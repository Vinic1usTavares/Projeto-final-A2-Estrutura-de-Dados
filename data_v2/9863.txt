hms vanguard was a british fast battleship built during second world war and commissioned after end of war she was biggest and fastest of royal navy s battleships mccart pp 1 10 last battleship to be launched in world and only ship of her class royal navy anticipated being outnumbered by combined german and japanese battleships in early 1940s and had therefore started building s however time consuming construction of triple 16 inch turrets for lion class would delay their completion until 1943 at earliest british had enough guns and turrets in storage to allow one ship of a modified lion class design with four twin 15 inch turrets to be completed faster than lion class vessels that had already been laid down work on vanguard was started and stopped several times during war and her design was revised several times during her construction to reflect war experience these stoppages and changes prevented her from being completed before end of war vanguards first task after completing her sea trial at end of 1946 was early next year to convey king george vi and his family on first royal tour of south africa by a reigning monarch mccart p 42 while refitting after her return she was selected for another royal tour of australia and new zealand in 1948 this was cancelled due to king george s declining health and vanguard briefly became flagship of mediterranean fleet in early 1949 after her return home in mid 1949 she became flagship of home fleet training squadron throughout her career battleship usually served as flagship of any unit to which she was assigned during early 1950s vanguard was involved in a number of training exercises with nato forces in 1953 she participated in queen elizabeth ii s coronation review while she was refitting in 1955 admiralty announced that ship was going to be put into reserve upon completion of work vanguard was sold for scrap and was broken up beginning in 1960 design and description by early 1939 it was clear that first two s could not be delivered before 1943 at earliest and that further battleship construction would be necessary to match german and japanese battleships already under construction main constraint on construction of any new battleships was limited available capacity and time required to build large calibre guns and their gun turrets using four existing twin 15 inch mountings offered possibility of bypassing this bottleneck and allowed construction of a single fast battleship more quickly than building more lion class ships turrets were originally built for battlecruisers and during first world war and were removed during conversions of these ships to aircraft carriers in 1920s to save time lion design was modified to accommodate four turrets and preliminary design work began in july 1939 square or transom stern was retained as it was estimated to improve speed at full power by this made vanguard only british battleship built with a transom stern as lions were never finished garzke and dulin pp 274 281 83 298 and roberts p 321 design work was suspended on 11 september 1939 after start of second world war but resumed in february 1940 after first lord of admiralty winston churchill expressed an interest in ship design was modified to increase protection against shell splinters on unprotected sides of ship s hull armour of secondary armament was increased to resist semi armour piercing bombs and splinter belt s thickness fore and aft of main armour belt was reduced by in compensation a small conning tower was added aft and four unrotated projectile mounts were added to supplement six octuple barrel 2 pounder anti aircraft mounts already planned raven and roberts pp 321 22 more pressing commitments forced preliminary design work to be suspended again in june and when it resumed in october design was modified again in light of recent war experience greater fuel capacity was added and armour protection improved but these changes deepened design s draught so that it exceeded limit of suez canal thickness of main belt was reduced by to save weight but primary method chosen to reduce draught was to increase beam by this exceeded width of docks at rosyth and plymouth which severely limited number of docks that could handle ship but these changes were approved by board of admiralty on 17 april 1941 ship had already been ordered on 14 and roberts p 322 under 1940 emergency war programme parkes p 687 although drawings were not turned over to john brown company until ten days later thumb left overhead view of vanguard vanguards design was revised again while ship was under construction in 1942 to reflect lessons learned from loss of battleship and operations with other battleships space between inboard and outboard propeller shafts was increased from to prevent a torpedo from wrecking both shafts and watertight access trunks were added to all spaces below deep waterline to prevent progressive flooding through open watertight doors and hatches as happened to prince of wales this change and relocation of some of ammunition handling rooms from lower deck to middle deck seriously delayed ship s completion design requirement that guns of a turret be capable of firing straight ahead at 0deg of elevation was sacrificed to allow her freeboard forward to be increased and her bow was reshaped to make it less prone to shipping water and throwing sea spray in head seas ship s fuel supply was increased from to to prevent fuel shortage problems suffered by and during their pursuit of unrotated projectile mounts were deleted from design and light anti aircraft armament was increased to a total of 76 two pounders in one quadruple and nine octuple mounts and 24 oerlikon 20 mm cannon were also added in 12 twin mounts space for these was made available by removing two floatplanes catapult and their associated facilities garzke and dulin pp 285 291 92 a proposal was made in 1942 to convert vanguard to an aircraft carrier director of naval construction stated that doing so along lines of would present no major difficulties but would require six months to redesign ship proposal was formally rejected on 17 july general characteristics thumb left vanguard during nato operation mainbrace 1952 vanguard had an overall length of a beam of and a draught of at deep load she displaced at standard load and at deep load ship was significantly larger than her predecessors of class almost longer and displaced about more than older ships at deep load vanguard was overweight by some which magnified difference ship had a complete double bottom deep and she was divided into 27 main compartments by watertight bulkheads raven and roberts pp 284 297 335 338 39 king george v class ships had been built with almost no sheer to main deck forwards to allow a turret to fire straight forward at zero elevation resulting in those ships being wet forward vanguard was redesigned as a result of this experience significant sheer and flare being added to bow ship was well regarded as seaworthy able to keep an even keel in rough seas at full load vanguard had a metacentric height of garzke and dulin pp 296 299 as a fleet flagship her complement was 115 officers and 1 860 men in 1947 air conditioning was provided for many of ship s control spaces and asbestos insulation was provided on exposed areas of ship s sides decks and bulkheads steam heating was provided for her armament instruments look out positions and other equipment to make vanguard suitable for operations in arctic an action information centre was fitted below main armour deck with facilities to track aircraft and ships around vanguard raven and roberts pp 328 339 propulsion to save design time four shaft unit machinery from lion class battleship was duplicated with alternating boiler and engine rooms vanguard had four sets of single reduction geared parsons steam turbines housed in separate engine rooms each set consisted of one high pressure and one low pressure turbine driving a propeller that was in diameter turbines were powered by eight admiralty 3 drum boilers in four boiler rooms at a working pressure of and temperature of garzke and dulin pp 297 305 engines were designed to produce a total of and a speed of but achieved more than during ship s sea trials in july 1946 when she reached a speed of raven and roberts p 334 after trials three bladed propellers on inboard shafts were replaced by five bladed propellers in a failed attempt to reduce vibrations of inboard propeller shafts garzke and dulin p 299 vanguard was designed to carry 4 850 long tons of fuel oil and of diesel fuel with a clean bottom she could steam at a speed of for ship had four turbogenerators and four diesel generators that supplied common ring main at 220 volts their total output of was largest of any british battleship garzke and dulin p 298 armament ship s main armament consisted of eight 42 calibre bl 15 inch mk i guns in four twin hydraulically powered gun turrets a b x and y from bow to stern when turrets were modernised to mk i n design their maximum elevation was increased from 20deg to 30deg raven and roberts p 325 although guns were loaded at 5deg they fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of this provided a maximum range of campbell pp 25 27 these guns were also capable of firing same projectiles while using which gave a maximum range of their rate of fire was two rounds per minute vanguard carried 100 shells per gun raven and roberts p 339 thumb 15 inch turrets had been designed when customary practice was to place magazine above shell room and it was not cost effective to modify ammunition hoists to accommodate opposite arrangement which was adopted after battle of jutland demonstrated dangers of exposing magazines to long range gunfire ship was provided with a powder handling room above shell room to mimic arrangement that turret s hoists were designed to handle and another set of hoists moved propellant charges from magazines to powder handling room charges were stowed in cases to reduce their exposure to fire garzke and dulin p 290 secondary armament consisted of sixteen 50 calibre qf 5 25 inch mk i dual purpose guns in eight twin gun mounts they had a maximum depression of 5deg and a maximum elevation of 70deg they fired an high explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of improved spec 5 25 turrets on vanguard were claimed to be fully automatic with a power rammed breech and automatic tracking and elevation under radar control enabling a rate of fire of about 18 rounds per minute garzke and dulin p 291 at maximum elevation guns had a maximum range of campbell pp 44 46 391 rounds were provided for each gun short range air defence was provided by 73 bofors 40 mm aa guns in a variety of mountings vanguard had ten sextuple barrel power operated mounts concentrated in superstructure and stern a twin barrel mount on b turret and 11 power operated single mounts on upper deck and rear superstructure all mounts could depress to 10deg and elevate to a maximum of 90deg gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of guns rate of fire was approximately 120 rounds per minute campbell pp 67 71 space was not available to stow standard allowance of 1 564 rounds per gun and vanguard carried only 1 269 rounds per gun raven and roberts p 327 two of single guns on quarterdeck were removed in 1949 and five others during a major refit in 1954 all of her multiple bofors mounts were removed at this same time garzke and dulin p 292 fire control vanguard was unique among british battleships in having remote power control rpc for her main secondary and tertiary guns along with admiralty fire control table mk x for surface fire control of main armament there were two director control towers dct for 15 inch guns each carrying a double cheese type 274 fire control radar for range finding and spotting fall of shot each dct could control all four turrets while b turret could control a and x turrets x turret could only control y turret there were four american mark 37 for 5 25 inch guns each carrying twin domes of type 275 gunnery radar each mark vi sextuple 40 mm bofors mounting was provided with a separate crbf close range blind fire director fitted with a type 262 radar although ship never mounted her complete outfit of those directors mk ii 40 mm bofors mounting carried its own type 262 on mounting itself other radar sets carried were type 960 air and surface search type 293 target indication and type 277 height finding raven and roberts pp 325 327 28 336 37 when 15 inch gun turrets were modernised their rangefinders were replaced by ones in all turrets except for a and they were fitted for rpc in azimuth only turrets were also provided with de equipment and insulation to improve their habitability protection thumb rear quarter view of vanguard showing her transom stern ship s armour scheme was based on that of king george v class with a thinner waterline belt and additional splinter protection raven and roberts p 328 originally belt armour was equal to that of older ships but it had to be reduced to offset weight increases when design was modified to reflect wartime experience waterline garzke and dulin pp 283 84 292 main belt was composed of krupp cemented armour kca thick but increased to abreast magazines it was high and tapered to a thickness of at bottom edge of belt fore and aft of transverse bulkheads that closed off central citadel belt continued almost to ends of ship forward it tapered to a thickness of and a height of and aft to same thickness but a height of at aft end of steering gear compartment was a transverse bulkhead after battle of denmark strait in 1941 non cemented armour bulkheads were added on sides of magazines to protect them from splinters from any hits from plunging shells that might have penetrated ship s side beneath her belt garzke and dulin p 293 when gun turrets from first world war era battlecruisers were modernised their kca faceplates were replaced by new ones 13 inches thick and their roofs were replaced by non cemented armour plates their sides remained in thickness barbettes for 15 inch guns were 13 inches thick on sides but tapered to closer to centreline of ship side and roof armour of 5 25 inch turrets was thick their ammunition hoists were protected by armour thick raven and roberts pp 322 and dulin p 294 intended to resist impact of a armour piercing bomb dropped from a height of vanguards deck protection was identical to that of king george v class it consisted of six inch non cemented armour over magazines that reduced to over machinery spaces armour continued forward and aft of citadel at lower deck level forward it tapered in steps from five inches down to 2 5 inches near bow aft it protected steering gear and propeller shafts with 4 5 inches of armour before tapering to a thickness of 2 5 inches near stern unlike germans french and americans british no longer believed that heavy armour for conning tower served any real purpose given that chance of hitting it was very small vanguards conning tower was therefore protected with of armour on face and 2 5 inches on sides and rear secondary conning tower aft had of armour on its sides vanguards underwater protection was enhanced when she was redesigned in 1942 to reflect lessons learned when prince of wales was sunk by japanese torpedo bombers it still consisted of a three layer system of voids and liquid filled compartments meant to absorb energy of an underwater explosion it was bounded on inside by torpedo bulkhead her enlarged oil tanks reduced empty spaces that could flood and cause ship to list and greater provision was made to pump these spaces out longitudinal bulkheads of side protection system were raised one deck higher to further subdivide spaces behind waterline armour belt side protection system had a maximum depth of but this decreased significantly as ship narrowed at its ends over length of citadel this system was found to be proof against of tnt during full scale trials raven and roberts pp 328 and dulin pp 294 95 construction and career vanguard was laid down on 2 october 1941 by john brown and company of clydebank scotland with yard number of 567 mccart pp 1 2 after japanese invasion of malaya in december ship was given an a1 priority in hope of finishing her by end of 1944 and construction of light cruiser hms bellerophon as well as some merchant shipping was halted to expedite ship s completion this was unsuccessful however due to a shortage of skilled labour raven and roberts pp 322 325 as a result it was not until 30 november 1944 that ship was launched princess elizabeth presided over this ceremony first ship she ever launched and was presented with a diamond rose brooch to commemorate event two yard workers were killed and six others injured when a blinding explosion

captain william gladstone agnew assumed command on 15 october 1945 end of hostilities following japan s surrender reduced need for new warships and consequently ship was not commissioned until 12 may 1946 mccart pp 9 13 by this time a total of ps11 530 503 including ps3 186 868 for modernisation of main armament had been spent on producing vanguard thumb a westland ws 51 dragonfly coming in to land on ship s foc sle after commissioning ship spent several months conducting sea trials and training until august when she began necessary modifications to serve as a royal yacht for forthcoming royal tour of south africa mccart pp 13 14 16 20 21 26 29 32 p 74 admiral s suite was reworked into accommodations for royal family and their staff while anti aircraft mount on top of b turret was replaced by a saluting platform agnew was promoted to rear admiral with effect from 8 january 1947 alterations were complete by december and vanguard made a shakedown cruise into central atlantic and made a port visit to gibraltar on return voyage initially escorted by destroyers and ship rendezvoused with home fleet on 1 february 1947 to receive a 21 gun salute led by battleships and and aircraft carrier later that morning a sikorsky r 4 helicopter landed aboard to pick up mail and photographic film vanguard arrived in cape town on 17 february escorted by south african frigates and on last leg of her voyage while royal family toured country on first visit by a reigning monarch to south africa ship exercised with ships of south african and royal navies stationed there and made port visits to a number of south african cities she sailed for home on 22 april and made brief visits to saint helena and ascension island en route vanguard arrived in portsmouth on 11 may and captain f r parham relieved newly promoted agnew on 29 may in july ship began an overhaul in devonport which lasted until august 1948 while she was refitting vanguard was tasked to carry royal family on a tour of australia and new zealand mccart pp 42 45 46 48 49 53 54 56 planned for january 1949 on 31 august she began a shakedown cruise to mediterranean and returned to devonport on 12 november pigott p 78 around this time vanguard was considered along with a number of other large warships for conversion to carry anti aircraft missiles but nothing further was done along these lines brown and moore p 32 george vi was now too ill for travel and royal tour was indefinitely postponed later that month vanguard became flagship of admiral sir arthur power commander in chief of mediterranean fleet on 1 march 1949 and ship made port visits to algeria france italy cyprus libya lebanon greece and egypt before she arrived back at devonport on 21 july newly promoted rear admiral parham was relieved by captain g v gladstone a week later ship then became flagship of home fleet training squadron under rear admiral edward evans on 12 november while returning from a brief training sortie to gibraltar vanguard went to aid of a small french merchantman whose cargo had shifted in a severe storm on 13 february 1950 merchantman was taken under tow and cargo was redistributed once storm had abated was able to resume her voyage under her own power vanguard reached weymouth bay following day later in march she fired salute to vincent president of france during his state visit to great britain mccart pp 54 56 60 62 63 65 thumb left vanguard at anchor on 13 september 1950 admiral sir philip vian hoisted his flag as commander in chief home fleet on vanguard and ship joined rest of home fleet on exercises with royal canadian navy and mediterranean fleet on 19 december vian transferred his flag to nearly two months later on 10 february 1951 aircraft carrier collided with vanguard as carrier docked at gibraltar hole in battleship s stern was not serious and vian re hoisted his flag in vanguard shortly afterwards after manoeuvres with indomitable during which her aircraft sank battleship ship made port visits in genoa and villefranche sur mer before returning for a brief refit in devonport on 14 march after completing her refit in may she became flagship of home fleet training squadron under rear admiral r m dick at isle of portland four months later admiral transferred his flag to carrier as vanguard began another refit in preparation to again become flagship of home fleet mccart pp 67 68 thumb vanguard in rotterdam june 1952 buckingham palace announced in november that king george vi was planning to take a short cruise for his health aboard vanguard which meant that her admiral s suite again had to be modified to accommodate him and his staff captain john litchfield assumed command on 21 december while ship was still refitting but king died on 6 february 1952 before he could make his cruise a detachment from ship participated in his funeral procession before she departed for her post refit shakedown cruise on 22 february after exercising with implacable indomitable and fast minelayer vanguard returned home on 29 march she became flagship of home fleet again on 13 may when admiral sir george creasy hoisted his flag due to manning and weight problems vanguard operated with many of her turrets unmanned and with ammunition carried for only two of 15 inch turrets and only starshell ammunition for 5 25 inch guns grove p 222 she participated in exercises with dutch and american navies before returning to portsmouth for holidays litchfield was relieved by captain r a ewing on 19 january 1953 ship departed next day for a brief refit at gibraltar after its completion on 2 march ship trained with several of royal navy s carriers before arriving back at portsmouth on 25 march vanguard participated in queen elizabeth s coronation fleet

participated in exercise a with dutch and french ships in march during rest of year she participated in anti submarine and anti aircraft exercises as well as making port visits to oslo and kristiansand in norway and helsingborg in sweden she was inspected on 11 july by king gustaf vi adolf of sweden before returning home later that month denny struck his flag on 15 september and vanguard sailed to devonport for a ps220 000 refit 10 days later february 1955 defence estimates had intended her as home fleet flagship with a role as a killer but after appointment of earl mountbatten in april pp 225 26 and with antony eden replacing churchill as prime minister government decided instead to maintain two extra cruisers in fleet and vanguard was placed in reserve when it completed its 1955 refit she subsequently became flagship of reserve fleet when vice admiral richard onslow hoisted his flag on 28 november while moored in fareham creek during her time in reserve

admiralty announced that vanguard would be scrapped as she was considered obsolete and too expensive to maintain she was decommissioned on 7 june 1960 and sold to iron and steel corporation of great britain for 000 on 4 august 1960 when ship was scheduled to be towed from portsmouth to breaker s yard at faslane scotland whole of southsea sea front was packed with people who came to see her off as vanguard was being towed towards harbour entrance she slewed across harbour and ran aground near still west pub she was pulled off by five tugboats an hour later and made her final exit from portsmouth five days later she arrived at faslane and by mid 1962 demolition process was complete she was last british battleship to be scrapped mccart pp 90 92 93 as a part of scrapping process
