adoptive sons of augustus and were his heirs until their deaths in ad 2 and 4 respectively following their deaths her cousin germanicus was made adoptive son of tiberius as part of augustus succession

traveled with him throughout his career taking her children everywhere they went in ad 14 germanicus was deployed in gaul as governor and general while there late augustus sent her son gaius to her

ashes to rome where they were interred at mausoleum of augustus agrippina was vocal in claiming her husband was murdered to promote tiberius son drusus julius caesar drusus younger as heir following model of her grandmother livia she spent time following germanicus death supporting cause of her sons nero and drusus caesar this put her and her sons at odds with powerful praetorian prefect lucius aelius sejanus who would begin eliminating their supporters with accusations of treason and sexual misconduct in ad 26 her family s rivalry with sejanus would culminate with her and nero s exile in ad 29 nero was exiled to pontia and she was exiled to island of pandateria where she would remain until her death by starvation in ad 33 name following roman custom of parents and children sharing same nomen and cognomen women in same family would often share same name accordingly marcus vipsanius agrippa had many relatives who shared name vipsania agrippina to distinguish marcus agrippa s daughter from his granddaughter historians refer to his daughter as latin agrippina maior literally agrippina elder likewise agrippina s daughter is referred to as agrippina minor literally agrippina younger like her father agrippina elder avoided her cognomen and was never called vipsania background thumb left a denarius depicting agrippa wearing a combination of corona muralis and corona marcus vipsanius agrippa was an early supporter of augustus then octavius during final war of roman republic that ensued as a result of assassination of julius caesar in 44 bc he was a key general in augustus armies commanding troops in pivotal battles against mark antony and sextus pompeius from early in emperor s reign agrippa was trusted to handle affairs in eastern provinces and was even given signet ring of augustus who appeared to be on his deathbed in a sign that he would become princeps were augustus to die it is probable that he was to rule until emperor s nephew marcus claudius marcellus came of age however marcellus died that year of an illness that became an epidemic in rome now with marcellus dead augustus arranged for marriage of agrippa to his daughter julia elder who was previously wife of marcellus agrippa was given tribunicia potestas tribunician power in 18 bc a power that only emperor and his immediate heir could hope to attain tribunician power allowed him to control senate and it was first given to julius caesar agrippa acted as tribune in senate to pass important legislation and though he lacked some of emperor s power and authority he was approaching position of co regent after birth of agrippa s second son lucius in 17 bc lucius and his brother gaius were adopted together by augustus around time of their adoption in summer augustus held fifth

their adoption agrippa was dispatched to govern eastern provinces bringing his family with him early life and family thumb left portrait of agrippina found in pergamon istanbul archaeology museums agrippina was born in 14 bc to marcus vipsanius agrippa and julia elder before their return to rome in 13 bc she had five siblings a half sister vipsania agrippina three brothers gaius lucius and postumus agrippa all were adopted by augustus gaius and lucius were adopted together following lucius birth in 17 bc postumus in ad 4 and a sister who shared same mother julia younger she was a prominent member of julio claudian dynasty on her mother s side she was younger granddaughter of augustus she was stepdaughter of tiberius by her mother s marriage to him and sister in law of claudius brother of her husband germanicus her son gaius better known as caligula would be fourth emperor and her grandson nero would be last emperor of dynasty in 13 bc her father returned to rome and was promptly sent to pannonia to suppress a rebellion agrippa arrived there that winter in 12 bc but pannonians gave up that same year agrippa returned to campania in italy where he fell ill and died soon after after her father s death she spent rest of her childhood in augustus household where access to her was strictly controlled some of currency issued in 13 12 bc and denarii make it clear that her brothers gaius and lucius were augustus intended heirs their father was no longer available to assume reins of power if emperor were to die and augustus had to make it clear who his intended heirs were in case anything should happen lucius and gaius military and political careers would steadily advance until their deaths in ad 2 and 4 respectively death of her brothers meant that augustus had to find other heirs although he initially considered agrippina s second cousin germanicus a potential heir for a time livia convinced augustus to adopt tiberius livia s son from her first marriage with tiberius claudius nero although augustus adopted tiberius it was on condition that tiberius first adopt germanicus so that germanicus would become second in line of succession it was a corollary to adoption probably in next year that agrippina was married to germanicus by her husband germanicus she had nine children nero julius caesar drusus julius caesar tiberius julius caesar a child of

following cursus honorum until in ad 12 he was made consul following year he was given command over gaul and forces on rhine totaling eight legions on 18 may ad 14 her one year old son gaius was sent by augustus from rome to join her in gaul she was pregnant at time and while germanicus was collecting taxes across gaul she remained at an unspecified separate location presumably for her safety augustus sent her a letter with her son s party which read later that year on 19 august augustus died while away in campania as a result tiberius was made princeps while germanicus was administering oath of fealty to tiberius a mutiny began among forces on rhine during mutiny agrippina brought out their sixth child gaius and made preparations to take him away to a safer town nearby he was in a full army outfit including legionary boots these military earned gaius nickname caligula lit little boots and garnered sympathy for agrippina and child among soldiery tacitus attributes her actions as having quelled mutiny tacitus annals 1 40 4 once mutiny was put to an end germanicus allowed soldiers to deal with ringleaders which they did with brutal severity he then led them against germanic tribes perhaps in an effort to prevent future mutiny germanicus would remain in gaul fighting against germanic tribes until ad 16 at which time he was recalled to rome by tiberius his campaigns won him much renown among roman people and he was awarded a triumph on 26 may ad 17 widowhood thumb left 250px benjamin west agrippina landing at brundisium with ashes of germanicus 1766 oil on canvas

agrippina was pregnant on their journey east and on way to syria she gave birth to her youngest daughter julia livilla on island of lesbos inscriptions celebrating her fertility have been found on island tiberius sent gnaeus calpurnius piso to assist her husband naming him governor of syria during their time there germanicus was active in his administration of eastern regions piso did not get along well with germanicus and their relationship only got worse in ad 19 germanicus ordered piso to leave province which piso began to do on his way back to rome piso stopped at island of kos off coast of syria around that time germanicus fell ill and he died on 10 october ad 19 at antioch rumours spread of piso poisoning her husband on emperor s orders after germanicus cremation in forum of antioch agrippina personally carried ashes of her husband to rome transportation of ashes witnessed national mourning she landed at port of brundisium in southern italy where she was met with huge crowds of sympathizers a praetorian escort was provided by emperor in light of her rank as wife of a governor general as she passed each town people and local magistrates came out to show their respect drusus younger son of tiberius claudius and consuls journeyed to join procession as well once she made it to rome her husband s ashes were interred at mausoleum of augustus tiberius and livia did not make an appearance life after germanicus thumb right great cameo of france detail depicting livia left drusus center and agrippina elder right her marriage to germanicus had served to unite imperial family agrippina may have suspected tiberius involvement in death of her husband and with germanicus dead she no longer had any familial ties to emperor historian richard alston says it is likely that either tiberius or livia were behind exile of agrippina s half sister and death of postumus he notes death of agrippina s mother who starved herself to death amidst her exile in ad 14 linking her death to tiberius disdain for her agrippina was vocal about her feelings claiming that germanicus was murdered to promote drusus younger as tiberius heir and worried that birth of younger drusus twin sons would displace her own sons in line of succession her fears proved to be unfounded with her son nero receiving toga virilis toga of manhood from tiberius and younger drusus on 7 june ad 20 further nero was promised office of quaestor five years before ordinary age and was wed to tiberius granddaughter julia agrippina s second oldest son drusus was given similar honors and was also promised office of quaestor in advance when he reached his fourteenth year in ad 23 at about this time tiberius praetorian prefect sejanus was becoming powerful in rome and began feuding with drusus younger while exact causes of feud are unknown it ended when younger drusus died of seemingly natural causes on 14 september ad 23 after death of tiberius son agrippina wanted to advance careers of her sons who were all potential heirs for tiberius to achieve this agrippina presented great cameo of france to tiberius it was a personalized gift that positioned family of germanicus around emperor work was designed to convince tiberius to choose her children as his heirs it is likely she was one who commissioned great cameo of france ultimately death of tiberius son elevated her own children to position of heirs her sons were logical choice because they were sons of germanicus and tiberius grandsons were too young nero was becoming popular in senate due in part tacitus says to his resemblance with his father rise of her children was threatening to sejanus position resultantly sejanus began spreading rumors about agrippina in imperial court coming years were marked with increasing hostility between sejanus and agrippina and her sons this effectively caused factions to rise in aristocracy between her family and sejanus political rivalry thumb left bronze sestertius with agrippina on obverse on new year s day ad 24 sejanus had priests and magistrates add prayers for health of nero and drusus in addition to those normally offered to emperor on that day tiberius was not happy with this and he voiced his displeasure in senate in addition he questioned priests of palatine some of priests who offered prayers were relatives of agrippina and germanicus this made tiberius suspicious of her and marked a change in his attitude toward her and her older sons but not caligula in ad 25 sejanus requested livilla s hand in marriage livilla was a niece of emperor which would have made him a member of imperial family while this did make his ambitions clear his request was denied loss may have been huge for sejanus had dissensions in imperial household not been deteriorating relations were so bad that agrippina refused to eat at tiberius dinner parties for fear of being poisoned she also asked tiberius if she could be allowed to remarry which he also refused if either of them were allowed to remarry it would have threatened line of succession that tiberius was comfortable with by refusing sejanus request tiberius made it clear he was content with children of germanicus and his own grandchildren being his successors had sejanus married livilla their children would have provided another line of possible successors implication of agrippina s request was that she needed a man from outside imperial family to serve as protector and step father of possible imperial heirs a powerful position it was also an implied reprimand tiberius was meant to be guardian of imperial family tiberius was in a tough position he was faced with a conflict between his family and his friend his solution was surprising in ad 26 left rome altogether and retired to island of capri in bay of naples he cut himself off from factions altogether and abandoned politics he left rome in care of sejanus this allowed sejanus to freely attack his rivals downfall with tiberius away from rome city would see a rise of politically motivated trials on part of sejanus and his supporters against agrippina and her associates many of her friends and associates were subsequently accused of maiestas treason by growing number of accusers it was also common to see charges of sexual misconduct and corruption in ad 27 agrippina found herself placed under house arrest in her suburban villa outside herculaneum in ad 28 senate voted that altars to clementia mercy and amicitia friendship be raised at that time clementia was considered a virtue of ruling class for only powerful could give clemency altar of amicitia was flanked by statues of sejanus and tiberius by this time his association with tiberius was such that there were those in roman society who erected statues in his honor and gave prayers and sacrifices in his honor sejanus birthday was honored as if he were a member of imperial family according to richard alston sejanus association with tiberius must have at least indicated to people that he would be further elevated sejanus did not begin his final attack on agrippina until after death of livia in ad 29 tacitus reports a letter being sent to senate from tiberius denouncing agrippina for her arrogance and prideful attitude and nero for engaging in shameful sexual activities senate would not begin highly unpopular prosecutions against her or her son until it received clear instructions from tiberius to do so despite public outcry agrippina and nero were declared public enemies hostes following a repeat of accusations by emperor they were both exiled nero to pontia where he was killed or encouraged to commit suicide in ad 31 and agrippina to island of pandateria same place her mother was exiled to suetonius says that while on island of pandateria she lost an eye when she was beaten by a centurion she would remain on island until her death in ad 33 accounts of her death vary she is said to have died from starvation but it is not certain whether or not it was self imposed tacitus says food was withheld from her in an effort to make her death seem like a suicide post mortem thumb 250px eustache le sueur caligula depositing ashes of his mother and brother in tomb of his ancestors 1647 oil on canvas royal collection windsor castle her son drusus was later also exiled on charges of sexual misdemeanors sejanus remained powerful until his sudden downfall and summary execution in october ad 31 just after death of nero exact cause for which remains unclear alston suggests that sejanus may have been acting in tiberius favor to remove germanicus family from power noting that agrippina and nero s brother drusus were left in exile even after sejanus death deaths of agrippina s older sons elevated her youngest son caligula to position of successor and he became princeps when tiberius died in ad 37 drusus younger s son tiberius gemellus was summoned to capri by his grandfather tiberius where he and caligula were made joint heirs when caligula assumed power he made gemellus his adopted son but caligula soon had gemellus killed for plotting against him after he became emperor caligula took on role of a dutiful son and brother in a public show of pietas piety he went out to islands of pontia and pandateria in order to recover remains of agrippina and nero it was not easy to recover nero s bones as they were scattered and buried moreover he had a stormy passage however difficulty in his task made his devotion seem even greater ashes were brought to ostia from where they were carried up tiber and brought to campus martius from where equestrians placed them on briers to join ashes of germanicus in mausoleum of augustus move was reminiscent of when agrippina carried ashes of her husband just over 17 years earlier agrippina s funerary urn still survives personality agrippina was fiercely independent a trait she shared with her mother dio described her as having ambitions to match her pedigree however anthony barrett notes that agrippina was fully aware that a woman in ancient rome could not hold power in her own right instead agrippina followed model of livia in promoting careers of her children she and her daughter agrippina younger are both described as being equally ambitious for their sons whereas elder agrippina s son failed to become emperor younger agrippina s son also named nero succeeds in a contrast tacitus has agrippina elder merely standing on a bridge waving soldiers passing by whereas her daughter eclipses her by presiding over a military tribunal and accepting gifts from foreign ambassadors tacitus also records serious tension between agrippina and livia he describes livia as having visited provocations on agrippina he says of agrippina were it not that through her moral integrity and love for her husband she converted an otherwise ungovernable temper to good tacitus annals 1 33 despite being sympathetic to her as a victim of imperial oppression he uses expressions like excitable arrogant proud fierce obstinate and ambitious to describe agrippina his comments are echoed by other sources historiography historian lindsay powell says agrippina enjoyed a normal marriage and continued to show her devotion to germanicus after his death he says she was regarded by roman people as quoting tacitus glory of country sole surviving offspring of augustus solitary example of good old times alston cautions against accepting stories of agrippina s feud with sejanus at face value as these accounts reflect a tradition hostile to tiberius and they may have been circulated by agrippina s supporters or they may have emerged after sejanus fall in ad 31 he adds these stories are plausible though not certain to be true suetonius augustus was proud of agrippina suetonius claims that augustus wrote her a letter praising her intellect and directing her education suetonius also records that augustus who held strict views on self restraint and respectable speech cautioned agrippina not to speak offensively when she next appears she is being chastised by tiberius in greek for making irritating remarks and tone of greek verse quoted by tiberius suggests that she should have heeded advice of her grandfather not to speak offensively tacitus annals of tacitus is a history of julio claudian dynasty beginning with death of augustus in it he portrays women as having a profound influence on politics women of imperial family in particular are depicted by tacitus as having a notable prominence in public sphere as well as possessing a ferocity and ambition with which they pursue it tacitus presents them as living longer than imperial men and thus being more wise as they advance in age among most broad of his portrayals is that of agrippina he emphasizes their role in connecting genetically back to augustus a significant factor in marriages of emperors and princes of dynasty annals repeatedly has agrippina competing for influence with tacitus simply because she is related to augustus biologically tacitus presents agrippina as being kindred to aristocratic males and has her reversing gender roles which showcases her assumption of male auctoritas authority with metaphors of her dressing and undressing in an example of agrippina assuming auctoritas he says using above epithet femina ingens a woman great for her courage he assigns a haughty attitude to agrippina that compels her to explore affairs of men he records her as having reversed natural order of things when she quelled mutiny of rhine in ad 14 in so doing he describes her as having usurped her husband s power a power rightfully belonging only to a general portraiture thumb right gemma claudia ad 50 depicting claudius front left agrippina younger back left germanicus front right and agrippina elder back right it has also been proposed that two on right are tiberius and livia however historian kleiner notes that claudius and agrippina younger would probably be paired with another married couple i e pairing them with a mother and son would be an unusual juxtaposition in addition if man on right were tiberius it is unlikely he would be depicted as being so young portraits of roman women from julio claudian dynasty display a freer hair treatment then those of traditional roman men and are more keen on sensitivity of recording on different textures these changes in style served to make reproducing them more popular in mid first century ad reproductions of her image would continue to be made into that period in portrait she is given a youthful face despite fact that she lived to middle age agrippina s hair is a mass of curls that covers both sides of her head and is long going down to her shoulders her portraiture can be contrasted with that of livia who had a more austere augustan hairstyle there are three different periods during first century ad when portraits were created for agrippina at time of her marriage to germanicus which made her mother of a potential emperor when her son caligula came into power in ad 37 and collected her ashes from island of pandateria for relocation to mausoleum of augustus and at time of claudius marriage to antonia minor who wanted to connect himself to lineage of augustus by evoking agrippina s image coins and inscriptions cannot act as a method of discerning her age because her hairstyle remains unchanged in all representations easiest phase of portraits to identify are those dating to time of caligula when a fair abundance of coins were minted with an image of his mother on them it is a posthumous portrait of her with idealized features in phase following claudius marriage her features are made to more closely resemble those of her daughter goal was to strengthen agrippina younger s connection with her mother finally portraits of her dating to time of tiberius are still idealized but not as much as those from period of caligula s reign images of agrippina from this period are most lifelike legacy agrippina has been depicted in many works of art most notable of which include agrippina landing at brundisium with ashes of germanicus 1766 a
