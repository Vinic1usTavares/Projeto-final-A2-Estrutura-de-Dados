married in december 1994 same month that eric turned 24 in when god writes your love story ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others but to wait for life partner that god has planned for them ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity and gresh 2007 p 279 authors do not discuss physical processes of sexual activity like many other christian books about premarital romantic relationships ludys book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing christian romantic relationships book is intended to be a tool in creation of reader s unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like irby 2013 p 186 before book s release it was endorsed by leslie and les parrott authors of saving your marriage before it starts beverly lahaye of concerned women for america and joe white president of kanakuk kamps first edition was packaged with a cd single by ludys faithfully a song they had written specifically to accompany book with lyrics discussing beauty of having a life partner ludy and ludy 2006 a perfect wedding p 20 content book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters each chapter is written from perspective of one of two authors nine are by eric while leslie writes seven as well as introduction first section desiring a love story addresses sexual desire and lovesickness suggesting that temporary relationships cannot fulfill those longings section two preparing for a love story advances ways in which one might before initiating a romantic relationship develop characteristics of a good spouse next section waiting for a love story discusses practice of fidelity to one s future spouse before meeting them by way of sexual abstinence and argues that waiting indefinitely is worth it even if one s soulmate never arrives in fourth section sweetening a love story ludys provide advice on how to proceed once possibility of a romantic relationship has presented itself final section discovering a god written love story argues that it is never too late to give god control of one s love life and that this sacrifice should be made not in expectation of personal benefit but rather to benefit one s future spouse and to honor god early in book eric retells a portion of homer s odyssey describing episode in which ulysses sails near land of sirens creatures whose song so attracts seafarers that they sail towards them and crash on rocks in this story ulysses orders all his men to fill their ears with beeswax and then tie him to mast ship therefore sails through area unharmed still ulysses hearing sirens song entire time is tortured by its beauty and his inability to get to song s source eric follows this story with a retelling of story of orpheus s encounter with sirens in this story orpheus s solution is to play a sweeter song than that of sirens ludy and ludy 2009 p 17 his ship also passes unharmed his men so entranced by his song that they do not notice sirens eric then argues from analogy that normally those who force themselves to resist premarital sexual and romantic temptations are likely to find process torturous like ulysses while those who listen to plans god has for them find waiting for marriage much easier as it was for orpheus s crew eric expands on concept of sweeter song throughout book and often refers to it another frequently mentioned concept in book is beautiful side of love ludy and ludy 2009 p 19 ludys use this phrase to refer to a lasting satisfying romance and contrast this state with such other experiences as breakups unrequited love and sexual frustration ludys argue that one s love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one s relationship with god they suggest that if god s plan and purpose for you is marriage then person you will one day marry is alive and wandering earth and that this knowledge should encourage people to act in such a way that their future spouses would be pleased ludy and ludy 2009 p 73 ludys contest definition of true love as an emotion instead they define true love as choice to commit to another person no matter what happens eric writes that there are two ways each of us can approach life spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others needs mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs we are never satisfied but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others our deepest needs are met as well ludy and ludy 2009 p 205 leslie argues that non permanent relationships involving physical or emotional intimacy or both result in long term psychological pain and that one should therefore only become physically or emotionally intimate with one s spouse eric retells greek myth of suitors of penelope in which penelope whose husband ulysses is erroneously believed to be dead resists a large number of marriage proposals until ulysses returns and kills suitors eric uses story to suggest that one should be faithful to one s future spouse even if it appears that they will never arrive eric argues that selfless service is an important part of marriage he therefore suggests that a good way for a man to make himself ready for his future spouse is to serve his mother and sisters and that single women should practice serving their fathers and brothers leslie writes that she is commonly asked question how will i know when a relationship is from god and her response is that people are likelier to recognize that a relationship is from god when they have a team made up of godly people who can keep us accountable to our commitments pray with us and provide a refreshing outside perspective ludy and ludy 1999 p 187 she indicates that this team should include one s parents or if one does not have living christian parents other christians of an older generation she writes that god offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals critical response discussions of context thumb left alt a photograph of a bald man facing right and looking right while covering his mouth with his left hand and wearing a dress shirt all on a black background when god writes your love story is often compared to books by joshua harris pictured such as i kissed dating goodbye and boy meets girl when god writes your love story is a popular christian book that provides alternatives to dating for this reason leah andrews of lewiston morning tribune compared book to joshua harris s i kissed dating goodbye and boy meets girl when god writes your love story also contains evangelical sexual abstinence teachings christine gardner a communications professor at wheaton college investigates such teachings in making chastity sexy rhetoric of evangelical abstinence campaigns and discusses ludys book as part of this investigation gardner writes that she interviewed a twenty two year old woman who had read when god writes your love story and desperately wanted god to write her love story but she thought that she would help him out by filling in blanks gardner argues that result was a fractured fairy tale one without a happy ending gardner 2011 p 114 in journal critical research on religion courtney ann irby of loyola university chicago writes that ludys disparage secular american culture as overtly sexual and thus an obstacle to christians according to irby secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in when god writes your love story and hookup culture is consistently discussed although irby indicates that since publication of ludys book some scholars have disputed prevalence of casual sex in united states irby suggests that ludys have no discernible qualifications to speak on issues they discuss but rather justify their message by emphasising their own personal experience as reason for their authority she writes that ludys recognize their lack of expertise and therefore emphasize trusting god as being more important than learning from specific stories in book irby 2013 p 183 irby suggests that ludys book is in these respects similar to many other evangelical books about premarital romantic relationships such as gresh s and bride wore white elisabeth elliot s passion and purity and quest for love don raunikar s choosing god s best ben young s and sam adams ten commandments of dating henry cloud s and john townsend s boundaries in dating alex s 5 paths to love of your life and joshua harris s i kissed dating goodbye and boy meets girl irby 2013 p 180 christian responses to book s

bonnie e field two single women in their thirties colon and field 2009 p 10 expressed their frustrations with ludys book in singled out why celibacy must be reinvented in today s church colon an english professor at wheaton college and field a former english professor at wayland baptist university criticize leslie ludy s account of her own wait for god to bring her a romantic partner they argue that language ludy uses to describe her time of waiting and trusting implies a difficult and long struggle that is finally rewarded by god and suggests that a long wait results in an even greater reward a concept that colon and field despite acknowledging as commonplace disagree with and trace back to william shakespeare s cymbeline which states more delay d delighted singled out suggests that because leslie was only 16 when she met eric her story is unlikely to inspire hope in older singles colon and field compare when god writes your love story to derek prince s god is a matchmaker and argue that prince s book better expresses concept that god allows some people to receive their soulmates quickly while requiring others to undergo a long wait while ludys book suggests that it is worth waiting for a soulmate because wait indicates a better prize colon and field favour prince s reasons for advocating waiting for one s soulmate which are that doing so tests one s faith and that god has required many of his choicest servants to wait long periods for fulfillment of his promise or purpose colon and field 2009 p 125 margaret and dwight peterson an american married couple who are christian studies professors at eastern university teach a course together called christian marriage peterson and peterson 2009 p 83 and were very critical of when god writes your love story they responded to ludys book by writing an essay called god does not want to write your love story they write therein that while they read when god writes your love story it began to dawn on us with particular clarity how different these stories of romance are from any traditionally christian understanding of marriage in response to leslie ludy s recommendation that a single woman should seek to be god s princess until becoming princess of a human prince petersons argue that this analogy makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of disney princesses and that this fantasy often results in disappointment peterson and peterson 2009 p 94 while referencing when god writes your love story specifically on several occasions petersons acknowledge that ludys book is one of many books with this premise and write that it is entire genre that is problematic peterson and peterson 2009 p 84 thumb left alt a photograph of a smiling woman wearing red lipstick a white

romantic relationships evert 2003 p 45 also in if you really loved me evert praises a passage from when god writes your love story in which leslie ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men

emotionally promiscuous according to evert these men are right he uses passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive evert 2003 pp 59 60 commentators have also noted

hear about wonderful way in which god brought another perfect couple together because it wasn t happening for me kiesler 2012 p 7 she wrote that her friends kept recommending book to her even after she had tried starting it she eventually decided that reason she didn t like book was her own selfishness in seeking to fulfill her own desires rather than leaving her desires for god to work out kiesler 2012 p 10 she then read book again and wrote that god used her reading of it to make her thankful for her time as a single person she also wrote that she found book to be mostly about letting
