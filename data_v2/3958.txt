eastern brown snake pseudonaja textilis often referred to as common brown snake is a highly venomous snake of family elapidae native to eastern and central australia and southern new guinea it was first described by andre marie constant dumeril in 1854 adult eastern brown snake is up to 2 m 7 ft long with a slender build its variable upper parts can be several shades of brown ranging from pale brown to almost black while its underside is pale cream yellow often with orange or grey splotches eastern brown snake is found in most habitats except dense forests it has become more common in farmland and on outskirts of urban areas benefiting from agriculture due to increased numbers of its main prey introduced house mouse species is oviparous snake is considered to be a least concern species according to international union for conservation of nature iucn though its status in new guinea is not well known considered world s second most venomous land snake after inland taipan oxyuranus microlepidotus based on its value subcutaneous in mice it is responsible for about 60 of snake bite deaths in australia its venom s main effects are on circulatory system coagulopathy haemorrhage bleeding cardiovascular collapse and cardiac arrest one of main components of venom is prothrombinase complex pseutarin c which breaks down prothrombin taxonomy john white surgeon general of first fleet to new south wales wrote a journal of a voyage to new south wales in 1790 which described many australian animal species for first time in it he reported a snake that fit description of eastern brown snake but did not name it french zoologist andre marie constant dumeril was first to describe species in 1854 he gave it binomial name furina textilis in french knitted from a specimen collected in october 1846 by jules verreaux remarking that fine meshed pattern on snake s body reminded him of fine stockings which was inspiration for name due to differences in appearance different specimens of eastern brown snake were categorized as different species in early 19th century german herpetologist johann gustav fischer described it as pseudoelaps superciliosus in 1856 from a specimen collected from sydney german british zoologist albert gunther described species as demansia annulata in 1858 italian naturalist giorgio jan named pseudoelaps and pseudoelaps kubingii in 1859 gerard curator of australian museum reclassified dumeril s species in genus pseudonaja in 1862 after collecting multiple specimens and establishing that markings of young snakes faded as they grew into adult brown snakes he concluded original description was based on an immature specimen and sent an adult to gunther who catalogued it under new name same year when cataloguing new species of snakes in british museum s collection after examining all specimens gunther concluded that furina textilis and annulata were named for young specimens and pseudoelaps superciliosus p sordelli and p kubingii were named for adults and all represented same species which he called diemenia superciliosa belgian british naturalist george albert boulenger gave it name diemenia textilis in 1896 acknowledging dumeril s name as having priority in subsequent literature it was known as demansia textilis as diemenia was regarded as an alternate spelling of demansia brown snakes were moved from diemenia demansia to pseudonaja by australian naturalist eric worrell in 1961 on basis of skull morphology and upheld by american herpetologist samuel booker mcdowell in 1967 on basis of muscles of venom glands this classification has been followed by subsequent authors in 2002 australian herpetologist richard w wells split genus pseudonaja placing eastern brown snake in new genus though this has not been recognized by other authors and wells has been strongly criticized for a lack of rigour in his research within genus pseudonaja eastern brown snake has largest number of diploid chromosomes at 38 those of other species range from 30 to 36 a 2008 study of mitochondrial dna across its range showed three broad lineages a southeastern clade from south australia victoria and southeastern and coastal new south wales a northeastern clade from northern and western new south wales and queensland and a central and presumably northern australian clade from northern territory central australian clade had colonised region around merauke in southern west papua and northeastern clade had colonised milne bay oro and central provinces in eastern papua new guinea in pleistocene via between australia and new guinea p textilis is monotypic raymond described all new guinea populations as pseudonaja textilis based on a differing maxillary tooth count from australian populations this difference was inconsistent and as no single new guinea population is genetically distinct taxon is not recognised wells and c ross wellington described pseudonaja in 1985 from a large specimen from mount gillen near alice springs distinguishing it on basis of scale numbers but it is not regarded as distinct species is commonly called eastern brown snake or common brown snake it was known as to eora and darug inhabitants of sydney basin to dharawal of illawarra it is dharawal and held ceremonies for eastern brown snake is reconstructed name in wiradjuri language of southern new south wales description thumb left juvenile showing bands and black nape eastern brown snake is of slender to average build with no demarcation between its head and neck its snout appears rounded when viewed from above most specimens have a total length including tail up to with some large individuals reaching maximum recorded size for species is evidence indicates that snakes from northern populations tend to be larger than those from southern populations adult eastern brown snake is variable in colour its upper parts range from pale to dark brown or sometimes shades of orange or russet with pigment more richly coloured in posterior part of dorsal scales eastern brown snakes from merauke have tan to olive upper parts while those from eastern papua new guinea are very dark grey brown to blackish eastern brown snake s fangs are small compared to those of other australian venomous snakes averaging 2 8 mm in length or up to 4 mm in larger specimens they are 1 1 cm apart tongue is dark and irises are blackish with a paler yellow brown or orange ring around pupil snake s chin and under parts are cream or pale yellow sometimes fading to brown or grey brown towards tail often orange brown or dark grey blotches occur on under parts more prominent anteriorly ventral scales are often edged with dark brown on their posterior edges juveniles can vary in markings but generally have a black head with a lighter brown snout and band behind and a black nuchal band their bodies can be uniform brown or have many black bands or a reticulated pattern with all darker markings fading with age snake clutches in colder areas tend have a higher proportion of young snakes with banded markings on their bodies its yellowish under parts serve to distinguish it from pseudonaja affinis and peninsula brown snake p which are entirely brown or brown with grey under parts eastern brown snake has flesh pink skin inside its mouth whereas northern brown snake and western brown snake have black skin large eastern brown snakes are often confused with mulga snakes pseudechis australis whose habitat they share in many areas but may be distinguished by their smaller heads juvenile eastern brown snakes have head markings similar to red naped snakes furina grey snakes dwyer s snakes suta and curl snake suta suta scalation number and arrangement of scales on a snake s body are a key element of identification to species level eastern brown snake has 17 rows of dorsal scales at midbody 192 to 231 ventral scales 45 to 75 divided subcaudal scales occasionally some of anterior ones are undivided and a divided anal scale its mouth is lined with six scales above and seven rarely eight scales below its nasal scale is almost always undivided and rarely partly divided its eyes have two or rarely three postocular scales distribution and habitat eastern brown snake is found along east coast of australia from in far north queensland along coasts and inland ranges of queensland new south wales victoria and to yorke peninsula in south australia disjunct populations occur on barkly tableland and macdonnell ranges in northern territory and far east of kimberley in western australia and discontinuously in parts of new guinea specifically northern milne bay province and central province in papua new guinea and merauke region of papua province in indonesian part of new guinea it is common in southeastern queensland between ipswich and eastern brown snake occupies a varied range of habitats from dry sclerophyll forests eucalypt forests and heaths of coastal ranges through to savannah woodlands inner grasslands and arid scrublands and farmland as well as drier areas that are intermittently flooded it is more common in open habitat and also farmland and outskirts of urban areas it is not found in rainforests or other wet areas because of their mainly rodent diet they can often be found near houses and farms such areas also provide shelter in form of rubbish and other cover snakes use sheets of corrugated iron or buildings as hiding spots as well as large rocks burrows and cracks in ground behaviour thumb right closeup of head eastern brown snake is generally solitary with females and younger males avoiding adult males it is active during day though it may retire in heat of hot days to come out again in late afternoon it is most active in spring males venturing out earlier in season than females and is sometimes active on warm winter days individuals have been recorded basking on days with temperatures as low as occasional nocturnal activity has been reported at night it retires to a crack in soil or burrow that has been used by a house mouse or less commonly skink rat or rabbit snakes may use refuge for a few days before moving on and may remain above ground during hot summer nights during winter they hibernate emerging on warm days to sunbathe fieldwork in murrumbidgee irrigation area found that snakes spent on average 140 days in a burrow over winter and that most males had entered hibernation by beginning of may autumn while females did not begin till mid may males mostly became active in first week in september spring while females not until end of month concrete slabs of houses have been used by eastern brown snakes hibernating in winter with 13 recorded coiled up together under a 5m by 3m slab of a demolished house between mount druitt and rooty hill in western sydney and another 17 in groups of one to four under smaller slabs within 20 m in late autumn 1972 groups of up to six hibernating eastern brown snakes have been recorded from under other slabs in area in july 1991 in melton six eastern brown snakes were uncovered in a nest in long grass eastern brown snakes are very fast moving snakes australian naturalist david fleay reported it could outpace a person running at full speed many people mistake defensive displays for aggression when confronted eastern brown snake reacts with one of two neck displays during a partial display snake raises front part of its body horizontally just off ground flattening its neck and sometimes opening its mouth in a full display snake rises up vertically high off ground coiling its neck into an s shape and opening its mouth snake is able to strike more accurately from a full display and more likely to deliver an envenomed bite due to snake s height off ground in full display resulting bites are often on victim s upper thigh a field study in farmland around that monitored 455 encounters between eastern brown snakes and people found that snake withdrew around half time and tried to hide for almost all remaining encounters in only twelve encounters did snake advance they noted that snakes were more likely to notice dark clothing and move away early reducing chance of a close encounter close encounters were more likely if a person were walking slowly but a snake was less likely to be aggressive in this situation encountering male snakes on windy days with cloud cover heightened risk as snake was less likely to see persons until they were close hence more likely to be startled similarly walking in undisturbed areas on cool days in september and october risked running into courting male snakes that would not notice people until close as they were preoccupied with mating reproduction eastern brown snakes generally mate from early october onwards during southern hemisphere spring they are oviparous males engage in ritual combat with other males for access to females appearance of two males wrestling has been likened to a pleated rope most dominant male will mate with females in area females produce a clutch of 10 to 35 eggs with eggs typically weighing each eggs are laid in a sheltered spot such as a burrow or hollow inside a tree stump or rotting log multiple females may even use same location such as a rabbit warren ambient temperature influences rate at which eggs develop eggs incubated at hatch after 95 days while those at hatch after 36 days eastern brown snakes can reach sexual maturity by 31 months of age and have been reported to live up to 15 years in captivity feeding thumb left holding its head up like a periscope looking for prey eastern brown snake appears to hunt by sight more than other snakes and a foraging snake raises its head like a periscope every so often to survey landscape for prey it generally finds its food sources in their refuges rather than chasing fleeing prey adult is generally diurnal while juveniles sometimes hunt at night eastern brown snake rarely eats during winter and females rarely eat while pregnant with eggs eastern brown snake has been observed coiling around and constricting prey to immobilise and subdue it adopting a strategy of poisoning and grappling their prey herpetologists richard shine and terry schwaner proposed that it might be resorting to constriction when attacking skinks as it might facilitate piercing skink s thick scales with its small fangs thumb right constricting its prey a blue tongue lizard eastern brown snake s diet is made up almost wholly of vertebrates with mammals predominating particularly introduced house mouse mammals as large as feral rabbits have been eaten small birds eggs and even other snakes are also consumed snakes in areas of natural vegetation or paddocks for stock eat a higher proportion of reptiles while those in crop fields eat more mice small lizards such as skinks are more commonly eaten than frogs as eastern brown snakes generally forage in areas over 100 m 350 ft distant from water snakes larger than from snout to vent eat predominantly warm blooded prey while smaller snakes mainly eat ectothermic animals other snakes such as common death adder acanthophis antarcticus and carpet python morelia have also been eaten cannibalism has also been recorded in young snakes bearded dragon is possibly resistant to effects of venom although eastern brown snake is susceptible to cane toad toxins young individuals avoid eating them which suggests they have learnt to avoid them some evidence indicates they are immune to their own venom and that of mulga snake pseudechis australis a potential predator venom eastern brown snake is considered second most venomous terrestrial snake in world behind only inland taipan oxyuranus microlepidotus of central east australia australian venom research unit 11 january 2014 facts and figures world s most venomous snakes archived university of melbourne retrieved 14 july 2014 responsible for more deaths from snakebite in australia than any other species it is most commonly encountered dangerous snake in adelaide and is also found in melbourne canberra sydney and brisbane as a genus brown snakes were responsible for 41 of identified snakebite victims in australia between 2005 and 2015 and for 15 of 19 deaths during this period within genus eastern brown snake is species most commonly implicated it is classified as a snake of medical importance by world health organization thumb right dangerous snake poster published by museum victoria in 1877 clinically venom of eastern brown snake causes venom induced consumption coagulopathy a third of cases develop serious systemic envenoming including hypotension and collapse thrombotic severe haemorrhage and cardiac arrest other common systemic symptoms include nausea and vomiting sweating and abdominal pain acute kidney injury and seizures can also occur onset of symptoms can be rapid with a headache developing in 15 minutes and clotting abnormalities within 30 minutes collapse has been recorded as occurring as little as two minutes after being bitten death is due to cardiovascular causes such as cardiac arrest or intracranial haemorrhage often little local reaction occurs at site of bite classical appearance is of two around 1 cm apart neurotoxicity is rare and generally mild and rhabdomyolysis has not been reported eastern brown snake yields an average of under 5 mg of venom per milking less than other dangerous australian snakes volume of venom produced is largely dependent on size of snake larger snakes producing more venom queensland eastern brown snakes produced over triple average amount of venom 11 mg vs 3 mg than those from south australia worrell reported a milking of 41 4 mg from a relatively large 2 1 m 6 9 ft specimen venom has a murine median lethal dose has been measured at 41 mg kg when using 0 1 bovine serum albumin in saline rather than saline alone to 53 mg kg when administered subcutaneously composition of venom of captive snakes did not differ from that of wild snakes eastern brown snake s venom contains coagulation factors and which together form prothrombinase complex pseutarin c this cleaves prothrombin at two sites converting it to thrombin pseutarin c is a procoagulant in laboratory but ultimately an anticoagulant in snakebite victims as prothrombin is used up and coagulopathy and spontaneous bleeding set in another agent textilinin is a kunitz like serine protease inhibitor that selectively and reversibly inhibits plasmin a 2006 study comparing venom components of eastern brown snakes from queensland with those from south australia found that former had a stronger procoagulant effect and greater activity of textilinin venom also contains pre and postsynaptic neurotoxins is a presynaptic neurotoxin at one stage considered most potent recovered from any land snake making up 3 of crude venom by weight it is composed of six subunits existing in two forms venom weighs 83 770 22 daltons and about 87 000 daltons respectively textilitoxin is a type of phospholipase a2 a group of enzymes with diverse effects that are commonly found in snake venoms at least two further phospholipase a2 enzymes have been found in eastern brown snake venom two postsynaptic neurotoxins have been labelled pseudonajatoxin a and pseudonajatoxin b these are three finger toxins a superfamily of proteins found in venom of many elapid snakes and responsible for neurotoxic effects another three finger toxin was identified in eastern brown snake venom in 2015 professor bart currie coined term brown snake paradox in 2000 to query why neurotoxic effects were rare or mild despite presence of textilitoxin in eastern brown snake venom this is thought to be due to low concentration of toxin in venom which is injected in only small amounts compared with other snake species analysis of venom in 2016 found unlike most other snake species that venom of juvenile eastern brown snakes differed from that of adults found in adults were absent and venom did not affect clotting times snakes found with a similar profile generally preyed upon dormant animals such as skinks eastern brown snake is second most commonly reported species responsible for envenoming of dogs in new south wales dogs and cats are much more likely than people to have neurotoxic symptoms such as weakness or paralysis one dog bitten suffered a massive haemorrhage of respiratory tract requiring euthanasia venom is uniformly toxic to warm blooded vertebrates yet reptile species differ markedly in their susceptibility treatment standard first aid treatment for any suspected bite from a venomous snake is for a pressure bandage to bite site victims should move as little as possible and to be conveyed to a hospital or clinic where they should be monitored for at least 24 hours tetanus is given though mainstay of treatment is administration of appropriate antivenom brown snake antivenom has been available since 1956 before this tiger snake antivenom was used though it was of negligible benefit in brown snake envenoming antivenom had been difficult to research and manufacture as species was hard to catch and amount of venom it produced was generally insufficient for horse immunization though these challenges were eventually overcome dogs and cats can be treated with a caprylic acid whole igg equine antivenom captivity eastern brown snakes are readily available in australia via breeding in captivity they are regarded as challenging to keep and due to snakes speed and toxicity suitable for only experienced snake keepers notes
