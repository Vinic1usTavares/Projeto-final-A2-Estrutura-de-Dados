battle of amiens also known as third battle of picardy was opening phase of allied offensive which began on 8 august 1918 later known as hundred days offensive that ultimately led to end of first world war allied forces advanced over on first day one of greatest advances of war with gen henry rawlinson s british fourth army with 9 of its 19 divisions supplied by fast moving australian corps of lt gen john monash and canadian corps of lt gen arthur currie playing decisive role battle is also notable for its effects on both sides morale and large number of surrendering german forces this led erich ludendorff to describe first day of battle as black day of german army amiens was one of first major battles involving armoured warfare prelude on 21 march 1918 german army had launched operation michael first in a series of attacks planned to drive allies back along length of western front after signing of treaty of brest litovsk with revolutionary controlled russia germans were able to transfer hundreds of thousands of men to western front giving them a significant if temporary advantage in manpower and material these offensives were intended to translate this advantage into victory operation michael was intended to defeat right wing of british expeditionary force bef but a lack of success around arras ensured ultimate failure of offensive a final effort was aimed at town of amiens a vital railway junction but advance had been halted at villers bretonneux by british and australian troops on 4 april subsequent german offensives operation georgette 9 11 april operation blucher yorck 27 may operation gneisenau 9 june and operation marne rheims 15 17 july all made advances elsewhere on western front but failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough by end of marne rheims offensive german manpower advantage had been spent and their supplies and troops were exhausted allied general general ferdinand foch ordered a counteroffensive which led to victory at second battle of marne following which he was promoted to marshal of france germans recognising their untenable position withdrew from marne to north foch now tried to move allies back onto offensive plan foch disclosed his plan on 23 july 1918 kearsey pp 11 12 following allied victory at battle of soissons plan called for reducing saint mihiel salient which would later see combat in battle of saint mihiel and freeing railway lines that ran through amiens from german shellfire commander of british expeditionary force field marshal sir douglas haig already had plans in place for an attack near amiens when british retreat had ended in april headquarters of british fourth army under general sir henry rawlinson had taken over front astride somme its left hand corps was british iii corps under lieutenant general richard butler while australian corps under lieutenant general john monash held right flank and linked up with french armies to south on 30 may all australian infantry divisions were united under corps hq for first time on western front australians had mounted a number of local counter attacks which both revealed suitability of open and firm terrain south of somme for a larger offensive and established and refined methods which were to be used blaxland pp 154 156 rawlinson had submitted monash s proposals to haig in july and haig had forwarded them to foch at a meeting on 24 july foch agreed to plan but insisted that french first army which held front to south of british fourth army should participate rawlinson opposed this as his and monash s plans depended on large scale use of tanks now finally available in large numbers to achieve surprise by avoiding a preliminary bombardment french first army lacked tanks and would be forced to bombard german positions before infantry advance began thus removing element of surprise eventually it was agreed that french would participate but not launch their attack until 45 minutes after fourth army it was also agreed to advance proposed date of attack from 10 august to 8 august to strike germans before they had completed their withdrawal from marne salient rawlinson had already finalised his plans in discussion with his corps commanders butler monash sir arthur currie of canadian corps and lieutenant general charles kavanagh of cavalry corps on 21 july for first time australians would attack side by side with canadian corps both had a reputation for aggressive and innovative tactics and a strong record of success over past two years tactical methods had been tested by australians in a local counter attack at battle of hamel on 4 july german defenders of hamel were deeply dug in and their position commanded a very wide field of fire similar positions had resisted capture for two months in battle of somme australians had used surprise rather than weight at hamel artillery had opened fire only at moment infantry and tanks advanced and germans were rapidly overrun blaxland pp 146 149 a key factor in final plan was secrecy there was to be no artillery bombardment a significant time before attack as was usual practice only fire immediately prior to advance of australian canadian and british forces final plan for fourth army involved 1 386 field guns and howitzers and 684 heavy guns making up 27 medium artillery brigades and thirteen heavy batteries in addition to infantry divisions artillery fire plan for fourth army s artillery was devised by monash s senior artillery officer major general c e d budworth british sound ranging advances in artillery techniques and aerial photographic reconnaissance made it possible to dispense with ranging shots to ensure accurate fire budworth had produced a timetable which allowed 504 out of 530 german guns to be hit at zero hour while a creeping barrage preceded infantry this method was similar to which germans themselves had used in their spring offensive but its effectiveness was increased by surprise achieved blaxland p 168 there were also to be 580 tanks canadian and australian corps were each allocated a brigade of four battalions with 108 mark v fighting tanks 36 mark v star and 24 unarmed tanks intended to carry supplies and ammunition forward a single battalion of mark v tanks was allocated to iii corps cavalry corps were allocated two battalions each of 48 medium mark a whippet tanks blaxland p 160 allies had successfully moved canadian corps of four infantry divisions to amiens without them being detected by germans this was a noteworthy achievement and reflected well on increasingly efficient staff work of british armies a detachment from corps of two infantry battalions a wireless unit and a casualty clearing station had been sent to front near ypres to bluff germans that entire corps was moving north to flanders blaxland p 161 canadian corps was not fully in position until 7 august to maintain secrecy allied commanders pasted notice keep your mouth shut into orders issued to men and referred to action as a raid rather than an offensive kearsey pp 13 14 preliminaries thumb 300px men of royal garrison artillery loading a 9 2 inch howitzer near just before battle although germans were still on offensive in late july 1918 allied armies were growing in strength as more american units arrived in france and british reinforcements were transferred from home army in britain and sinai and palestine campaign german commanders realised in early august that their forces might be forced onto defensive though amiens was not considered to be a likely front germans believed french would probably attack saint mihiel front east of rheims or in flanders near mount kemmel while they believed british would attack along either lys or near albert allies had indeed mounted a number of local counter offensives in these sectors both to gain local objectives to improve their defensive positions and to distract attention from amiens sector german forces began to withdraw from lys and other fronts in response to these theories allies maintained equal artillery and air fire along their various fronts moving troops only at night and feigning movements during day to mask their actual intent german front east of amiens was held by their second army under general georg von der with six divisions in line and two facing french 1st army there were only two divisions in immediate reserve there was some concern among allies on 6 august when german 27th division actually attacked north of somme on part of front on which allies planned to attack two days later german division a specially selected and trained stosstruppen formation penetrated roughly into one and a half mile front blaxland p 164 this attack was made in retaliation for a trench raid by 5th australian division north of somme on night of 31 july which had taken many prisoners before australian corps was concentrated south of river blaxland p 162 german division moved back towards its original position on morning of 7 august but movement still required changes to allied plan to increase level of surprise still further rumble of approaching tanks was to be masked by bombers flying up and down german lines bombers were twin engine handley page o 400 s whose engines were similar to tanks however 2 raf squadrons detailed to take part decided it was too hazardous to order planes into air in unseasonably dense fog and asked for volunteers two volunteered from 207 squadron captains gordon and william peace and both were awarded dfc brave young wings p168 ronald dodds 1980 published by canada s wings inc ontario battle thumb 300px map depicting advance of allied line first phase battle began in dense fog at 4 20 am on 8 august 1918 under rawlinson s fourth army british iii corps attacked north of somme australian corps to south of river in centre of fourth army s front and canadian corps to south of australians french 1st army under general opened its preliminary bombardment at same time and began its advance 45 minutes later supported by a battalion of 72 whippet tanks although german forces were on alert this was largely in anticipation of possible retaliation for their incursion on pp 17 18 and not because they had learned of preplanned allied attack although two forces were within of one another gas bombardment was very low as bulk of allied presence was unknown to germans attack was so unexpected that german forces only began to return fire after five minutes and even then at positions where allied forces had assembled at start of battle and had long since left kearsey pp 15 16 in first phase seven divisions attacked british 18th eastern and 58th 2 1st london australian 2nd and 3rd and canadian 1st 2nd and 3rd divisions parts of american 33rd division supported british attackers north of somme attackers captured first german position advancing about by about 7 30 am in centre supporting units following leading divisions attacked second objective a further distant australian units reached their first objectives by 7 10 am and by 8 20 am australian 4th and 5th divisions and canadian 4th division passed through initial breach in german lines third phase of attack was assigned to infantry carrying mark v tanks however infantry was able to carry out this final step unaided allies penetrated well to rear of german defences and cavalry now continued advance one brigade in australian sector and two cavalry divisions in canadian sector aircraft fire by new raf and armoured car fire kept retreating germans from rallying canadian and australian forces in centre advanced quickly pushing line forward from its starting point by 11 00 am speed of their advance was such that a party of german officers and some divisional staff were captured while eating breakfast a gap long was punched in german line south of somme by end of day there was less success north of river where british iii corps had only a single tank battalion in support terrain was rougher and german incursion of 6 august had disrupted some of preparations although attackers gained their first objectives they were held up short of chipilly spur a steep wooded ridge british fourth army took 13 000 prisoners and french captured a further 3 000 total german losses were estimated to be 30 000 on 8 august chronicles of world war one volume ii 1917 1921 randal gray facts on file new york 1991 british australian and canadian infantry of fourth army sustained about 8 000 casualties with further losses by tank and air personnel and french forces german army chief of staff paul von hindenburg noted allies use of surprise and that allied destruction of german lines of communication had hampered potential german counter attacks by isolating command positions hindenburg on amiens by paul von hindenburg from source records of great war vol vi ed charles f horne national alumni 1923 german general erich ludendorff described first day of amiens as schwarzer tag des deutschen heeres black day of german army not because of ground lost to advancing allies but because morale of german troops had sunk to point where large numbers of troops began to capitulate he recounted instances of retreating troops shouting you re prolonging war at officers who tried to rally them and blackleg at reserves moving up blaxland p 181 five german divisions had effectively been engulfed allied forces had pushed on average into enemy territory by end of day canadians gained australians french and british second phase advance continued on 9 august though without spectacular results of first day battle was widened on north and south of initial attack with southern part of battle involving french forces called battle of montdidier infantry had outrun supporting artillery and initial force of more than 500 tanks that played a large role in allied success was reduced to six battle ready tanks within four days tanks from national archives of united kingdom retrieved 15 july 2006 germans on chipilly spur commanded a wide field of fire to south of somme and their flanking fire held up left units of australian corps until late on 9 august when a small australian party slipped across river and captured village of chipilly itself together with a renewed attack by iii corps on canadian front congested roads and communication problems prevented british 32nd division being pushed forward rapidly enough to maintain momentum of advance blaxland pp 186 187 on 10 august there were signs that germans were pulling out of salient from operation michael according to official reports allies had captured nearly 50 000 prisoners and 500 guns by 27 august battle of amiens 27 august 1918 by philip gibbs from source records of great war vol vi ed charles f horne national alumni 1923 even with lessened armour british drove into german positions by 13 august field marshal haig refused request of marshal foch to continue offensive preferring instead to launch a fresh offensive by byng s third army between ancre and scarpe hart 2008 p 364 aftermath thumb 280px a german 7 7 cm fk 96 n a field gun captured during course of battle by 33rd australian battalion battle of amiens was a major turning point in tempo of war germans had started war with schlieffen plan before race to sea slowed movement on western front and war devolved into trench warfare german spring offensive earlier in 1918 had once again given germany offensive edge on western front armoured support helped allies tear a hole through trench lines weakening once impregnable trench positions british third army with no armoured support had almost no effect on line while fourth with fewer than a thousand tanks broke deep into german territory british war correspondent philip gibbs noted amiens effect on war s tempo saying on 27 august that enemy is on defensive and initiative of attack is so completely in our hands that we are able to strike him at many different places gibbs also credits amiens with a shift in troop morale saying change has been greater in minds of men than in taking of territory on our side army seems to be buoyed up with enormous hope of getting on with this business quickly and that there is a change also in enemy s mind they no longer have even a dim hope of victory on this western front all they hope for now is to defend themselves long enough to gain peace by negotiation references notes books further reading external links badsey stephen amiens battle of in 1914 1918 online international encyclopedia of first
