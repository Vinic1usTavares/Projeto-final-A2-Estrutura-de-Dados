before because he said in real life very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew and i felt that that would be wrong i felt in a sense it would be like cheating reader if it s somebody you didn t know and had never seen then what was point of following all clues i think that frustrates reader however lee prefaced this statement by admitting that due to his self professed poor memory he may have been confusing green goblin with a different character and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether norman osborn being green goblin was his idea or ditko s ditko has maintained that it was his idea even claiming that he had decided on it before first green goblin story was finished though osborn would not be introduced by name until amazing

one of his centipedes into norman osborn s head in order to save him from himself back in present norman osborn s carnage form feels a scratching in his head as he tells kindred to let him be one to kill spider man he then turns his target towards dylan brock and normie osborn spider man gets to his feet and defeats norman as more of flashback is shown kindred states to norman that he will leave now and will return when norman is himself again so that they can confront truth together as kindred starts to leave norman s cletus kasady persona states to kindred that he has a message for him from norman who states that he is so proud of him kindred takes his leave as norman s cletus kasady breaks out in maniacal laughter amazing spider man vol 5 31 marvel comics at some point norman s mind recovered and he joined power elite free comic book day vol 2018 avengers marvel comics powers and abilities norman osborn was turned into green goblin by a chemical solution he had devised based upon a formula originally conceived by professor mendel stromm process granted osborn superhuman strength speed reflexes and stamina as well as a low level rapid healing factor in addition to these physical advantages serum also greatly enhanced norman s already above average intellect making him a bona fide genius capable of making breakthroughs in advanced areas of genetics robotics engineering physics and applied chemistry goblin formula is also said to have driven osborn insane defects in his personality were strongly augmented by serum resulting in dangerous mood swings and hallucinations following his confrontation with returned spider man after his campaign against doctor octopus in spider man s body norman osborn has been rid of goblin formula from his system and thus has lost his superhuman abilities forcing him to rely on his intellect and other natural abilities doctor octopus s anti serum also prevents osborn s attempts of restoring his powers ultimately he seeks to rid himself of it in hopes of having them again despite risking his health and sanity after bonding to carnage symbiote norman uses it to expel anti serum from his body which restores his former powers in process but once more at cost of his mind in addition symbiote eliminates his physical scars including his features he has since claimed to have perfected formula so that it will grant subjects powers while also reverting those he chooses to a more basic mentality where they will accept his orders weapons of green goblin green goblin is armed with a variety of bizarre devices he wears a green costume underneath bulletproof chainmail with an overlapping purple tunic his mask has a built in gas filter to keep him safe from his own gasses green goblin s trademark weapons are his pumpkin bombs and razor bats as their name suggests bombs were designed with appearance of jack o lanterns these varied in function from smoke bombs to traditional explosives while razor edged bat shaped boomerangs could cut through very durable surfaces and materials gloves of goblin uniform were fashioned with minuscule conductors that allowed for release of electricity at nearly 10 000 amps of an undetermined voltage originally osborn used a mechanical broomstick to fly through air during his first few exploits as green goblin flying broomstick did not last long however and was improved upon creating goblin glider goblin glider was a more efficient flight system than norman s flying broomstick glider allowed goblin to carry a wide array of armaments including heat seeking and smart missiles machine guns extending blades a flamethrower and a pumpkin bomb dispenser launcher with him as he flew and had much greater speed and mobility than broomstick weapons as iron patriot during events of dark reign storyline osborn created identity of iron patriot an amalgam of iron man and captain america to cement his standing as a hero as iron patriot he utilized an outdated version of iron man s armor painted in captain america s colors armor featured superhuman strength enhanced durability flight magnetic impact blasts heat seeking missiles miniaturized lasers flamethrowers and a communications system housed in his helmet which allowed him to interface with any u s controlled satellite or computer network while original iron man armor utilized repulsor technology osborn s design does not stark destroyed all but one repulsor and stated that oz is too stupid to make his own repulsor based weapons system star shaped uni beam projector on his chest because of its shape also has a less powerful output than that of original iron man model powers as super adaptoid following his time in prison a i m scientists converted osborn into a super adaptoid capable of absorbing abilities of any mutant mutate alien android or other such superpowered being by touching them in this form he possessed considerably increased strength and durability where he was once approximately as strong as spider man he now possessed sufficient strength to overpower and throw luke cage a significant distance away from him he could also levitate and he was able to defeat vision in an aerial conflict between two he is known to have absorbed abilities of luke cage vision red hulk and protector and it is suggested that he also absorbed abilities of his current dark avengers in his final form his body grew to hulk s size and like hulk he was capable of creating by hitting ground or smashing his hands together his durability was sufficient to withstand combined attacks of all avengers and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities recovering in seconds after daisy johnson used her powers to make his heart explode he could also turn intangible by manipulating his density as vision does however osborn had no control over his super adaptoid abilities he would automatically absorb powers of any superhuman he touched even if he did not consciously want to he was also limited in how many powers his body could hold as a i m scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems in end he inadvertently absorbed abilities of all avengers and new avengers when they all touched him at once and unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry resulting in him going into a coma after he regained consciousness these powers were apparently burnt out returning him to his goblin level strength instead powers as red goblin after gaining control of carnage symbiote s desire for mindless slaughter osborn has used it to form a new attire in form of red goblin which essentially resembles a red version of his green goblin outfit without purple and green clothing as well as a long tail and flaming breath amazing spider man v4 796 with symbiote he can create his own goblin glider and what he terms carnage bombs which are essentially pumpkin bombs that can actually talk to and bite their targets before exploding as well as carnage symbiote s traditional enhancements amazing spider man v4 798 due to combination of symbiote with new goblin formula injected into his system osborn is immune to symbiote s traditional weaknesses of fire and sound although touch of anti venom is still dangerous to him he also revived its ability to spread its constituent matter to others amazing spider man v4 799 characterization norman osborn has consistently been depicted with several unusual weaknesses related to his psychosis and to his personality he suffers from manic depression has a pronounced narcissistic personality disorder co morbid with severe anti social psychopathic traits and in some depictions a multiple personality disorder for some of his early appearances he and goblin were separate personalities his goblin side his human weaknesses while his norman osborn persona was primarily motivated by his concern for harry although stress caused by his son s failing health as norman helped to provoke his transformation back into goblin this supposedly separate and more compassionate side of him never reappeared after he was believed dead norman is also highly sadistic showing a complete lack of empathy for lives of innocent people who stand between him and his objectives these weaknesses have often been referenced in stories featuring him and exploited by his enemies norman osborn is shown to be severely manic depressive this has been referenced several times in a myriad of spider man stories when he is not under direction of a psychiatrist and taking medication he has dangerous mood swings at apex of his mania he is paranoid delusional and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations including hearing voice of his green goblin persona and seeing its face in mirror rather than his own previously osborn s arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill in later conversations with sentry osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness after having rid of his powers after confrontation with superior spider man doctor octopus osborn s sanity apparently restored but remains a villain superhuman psychologist leonard samson says of osborn in clinical terms words psychotic and psychopathic are far from synonymous but in norman osborn s case both apply i d characterise him as a bipolar psychotic with concurrent aspects of psychopathic megalomania and malignant narcissism in layman s terms a lethal cocktail of intersecting personality disorders that makes him one of most dangerous human beings on planet there are many examples of osborn s pronounced superiority complex to point that he will rarely if ever admit that he has made mistakes he often transfers blame for his shortcomings to others or claims that he was better than he was even before his accident he spent more time providing harry with gifts or outings rather than actually being there for his son or trying to listen to his problems and nevertheless claims that he was still a good father likely due to abusive nature of his own father having become goblin he generally views other people as dim witted pests lacking in creative vision unworthy to be graced by his presence he goes out of his way to remind others of their personal failures and shortcomings and to remind those in close relationships with him such as his son that they are incapable of measuring up to his achievements when he first learned spider man s identity he claimed that when spider man had defeated him in their previous battles none of those victories counted because spider man had only beaten his lackeys or been rescued by intervention of other super powered beings such as human torch despite fact that he always departed battles after spider man s victories rather than trying to defeat his foe himself he also missed opportunity to lead original sinister six because he felt that joining group would mean admitting he needed help of others to rid himself of spider man although he later formed sinister twelve when spider man sent him to prison he expressed anger at mac gargan for acquiring venom symbiote rather than using new scorpion suit provided for him simply because gargan was not doing what he wanted despite venom being more powerful than scorpion when he participated in mystical ritual known as gathering of five he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive gift of power from ritual which would bestow upon participants power immortality knowledge madness and death respectively only to receive gift of madness instead subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity during his time in charge of h a m m e r he was provoked into attacking asgard by his goblin side because his ego couldn t allow himself to consider possibility that wouldn t threaten his power later events revealed that loki at least slightly influenced osborn s decision to further loki s own goals during his attempted takeover of earth s superhuman security defenses he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians who require strong like him to control them dismissing avengers as no better than him despite obvious distinction between osborn s demands for power and straightforward respect that general public have for avengers it has been shown that since having suppressed rampaging green goblin personality and becoming more dominant personality osborn has proven to be just as if not more evil and cruel osborn has demonstrated a high degree of sadism while in prison a guard once asked him for his advice in helping his critically ill wife osborn s advice led her to a quicker and more agonizing death as director of h a m m e r he directed his officers to shoot down an airplane full of innocent people just to see whether his enemy pepper potts was powerful enough to rescue passengers with her rescue armor his goblin persona vied for control of his body as depicted in january 2010 issue of dark avengers where he is shown writhing on floor and imploring apparently to himself why won t this face come off and finally took over when osborn s iron patriot armor was defeated by captain america and iron man at end of siege arc since being cured of goblin formula osborn claims that his sanity has also been restored however he has expressed satisfaction at plastic surgery that restored him to a twisted version of his original features and intended to use a modified version of formula to essentially infect entire country of symkaria to become goblin level soldiers without intellectual capacity to defy him other versions a number of alternate universes in marvel comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on osborn in which character s origins behavior and morality differ from mainstream setting marvel 2099 depicts goblin as a radical trickster who wants to prove that spider man miguel o hara is in pay of a he has bat like glider wings and a bag of tricks similar to 20th century version he
