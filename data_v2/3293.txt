from past seasons and commented on how season finale was written last episode of fourth season of greatest show of our time felt in many ways like it might have been written to end series what with many this is your life moments such as return of georgina sparks and blair s old minions izzy and kati wry references to episodes past wrapping up of story lines including revelation that dan has been secretly novelizing his observations of upper east side for entire time we ve thought we ve known him and meaningful departure of its most marketable star to none other than hollywood critical praise went to storyline twist behind charlie s identity citing her as big shocker of gossip girl finale and cameo appearance of gossip girl author cecily von ziegesar television without pity included episode in its gallery of season finales 2011 best and worst declaring finale as one of best and stating that it had a lot of storylines pay off and was our own little version of a fairy tale television without pity and steve marsi of tv fanatic praised return of georgina stating michelle had some of show s funniest dialogue in a long time she and jack bass have really made last two weeks for me it was great to have her back when reviewing final scene marsi commended appearance of positive pregnancy test to audience calling it quite cliffhanger to leave us with after a finale that was already pretty darn entertaining show went out on a high note and next season could be even better new york magazine commented on pregnancy test insisting that we re pretending that positive pregnancy test didn t exist los angeles times judy berman praised finale stating this year went out with a bang i had my doubts and reservations largely concerning blair and chuck but i am surprised and pleased to report that i found end of gossip girl season 4 both exciting and satisfying return of georgina sparks was well received as with serena s development with berman citing serena s confession with charlie before she could plunge to her death this debacle along with events of this season in general seems to have given s some perspective friends she apologizes to nate and dan for leading them on and confesses to charlie that her decision making skills leave something to be desired even if lazy writing results in serena falling into old habits next season it s a pretty gratifying moment berman also questioned vanessa s motive behind publishing dan s novel it s impossible to know whether she s trying to do her old friend one last favor or profit from stirring up more drama in his life considering that jessica szohr won t be returning to show in fall we may never find out berman also complimented casting of director david o russell calling it one of show s most delightfully random cameos ever new york magazine labeled chuck and blair s relationship as longest delayed breakup of season adding that big news was that blair and prince louis are somehow still together and engaged with wedding scheduled for november sweeps we feel comfortable assuming that by then chuck will have regrouped enough to break things up more definitively references external links category 2011
