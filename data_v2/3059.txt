myocardial infarction mi also known as a heart attack occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to a part of heart causing damage to heart muscle most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into shoulder arm back neck or jaw often it occurs in center or left side of chest and lasts for more than a few minutes discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn other symptoms may include shortness of breath nausea feeling faint a cold sweat or feeling tired about 30 of people have atypical symptoms women more often present without chest pain and instead have neck pain arm pain or feel tired among those over 75 years old about 5 have had an mi with little or no history of symptoms an mi may cause heart failure an irregular heartbeat cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest most mis occur due to coronary artery disease risk factors include high blood pressure smoking diabetes lack of exercise obesity high blood cholesterol poor diet and excessive alcohol intake among others complete blockage of a coronary artery caused by a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque is usually underlying mechanism of an mi mis are less commonly caused by coronary artery spasms which may be due to cocaine significant emotional stress and extreme cold among others a number of tests are useful to help with diagnosis including electrocardiograms ecgs blood tests and coronary angiography an ecg which is a recording of heart s electrical activity may confirm an st elevation mi stemi if st elevation is present commonly used blood tests include troponin and less often creatine kinase mb treatment of an mi is time critical aspirin is an appropriate immediate treatment for a suspected mi nitroglycerin or opioids may be used to help with chest pain however they do not improve overall outcomes supplemental oxygen is recommended in those with low oxygen levels or shortness of breath in a stemi treatments attempt to restore blood flow to heart and include percutaneous coronary intervention pci where arteries are pushed open and may be or thrombolysis where blockage is removed using medications people who have a non st elevation myocardial infarction nstemi are often managed with blood thinner heparin with additional use of pci in those at high risk in people with blockages of multiple coronary arteries and diabetes coronary artery bypass surgery cabg may be recommended rather than angioplasty after an mi lifestyle modifications along with long term treatment with aspirin beta blockers and statins are typically recommended worldwide about 15 9 million myocardial infarctions occurred in 2015 more than 3 million people had an st elevation mi and more than 4 million had an nstemi stemis occur about twice as often in men as women about one million people have an mi each year in united states in developed world risk of death in those who have had an stemi is about 10 rates of mi for a given age have decreased globally between 1990 and 2010 in 2011 a mi was one of top five most expensive conditions during inpatient hospitalizations in us with a cost of about 11 5 billion for 612 000 hospital stays terminology myocardial infarction mi refers to tissue death infarction of heart muscle myocardium it is a type of acute coronary syndrome which describes a sudden or short term change in symptoms related to blood flow to heart acute coronary syndrome american heart association retrieved november 25 2006 unlike other causes of acute coronary syndromes such as unstable angina a myocardial infarction occurs when there is cell death as measured by a blood test for biomarkers cardiac protein troponin or cardiac enzyme ck mb when there is evidence of an mi it may be classified as an st elevation myocardial infarction stemi or non st elevation myocardial infarction nstemi based on results of an ecg phrase heart attack is often used non specifically to refer to a myocardial infarction and to sudden cardiac death an mi is different from but can cause cardiac arrest where heart is not contracting at all or so poorly that all vital organs cease to function thus causing death it is also distinct from heart failure in which pumping action of heart is impaired however an mi may lead to heart failure signs and symptoms pain chest pain is most common symptom of acute myocardial infarction and is often described as a sensation of tightness pressure or squeezing pain radiates most often to left arm but may also radiate to lower jaw neck right arm back and upper abdomen pain most suggestive of an acute mi with highest likelihood ratio is pain radiating to right arm and shoulder similarly chest pain similar to a previous heart attack is also suggestive pain associated with mi is usually diffuse does not change with position and lasts for more than 20 minutes levine s sign in which a person chest pain by clenching one or both fists over their sternum has classically been thought to be predictive of cardiac chest pain although a prospective observational study showed it had a poor positive predictive value pain that responds to nitroglycerin does not indicate presence or absence of a myocardial infarction other symptoms chest pain may be accompanied by sweating nausea or vomiting and fainting and these symptoms may also occur without any pain at all in women most common symptoms of myocardial infarction include shortness of breath weakness and fatigue shortness of breath is a common and sometimes only symptom occurring when damage to heart limits output of left ventricle with breathlessness arising either from low oxygen in blood or pulmonary edema other less common symptoms include weakness light headedness palpitations and abnormalities in heart rate or blood pressure these symptoms are likely induced by a massive surge of catecholamines from sympathetic nervous system which occurs in response to pain and where present low blood pressure loss of consciousness due to inadequate blood flow to brain and cardiogenic shock and sudden death frequently due to development of ventricular fibrillation can occur in myocardial infarctions cardiac arrest and atypical symptoms such as palpitations occur more frequently in women elderly those with diabetes in people who have just had surgery and in critically ill patients silent myocardial infarctions can happen without any symptoms at all these cases can be discovered later on electrocardiograms using blood enzyme tests or at autopsy after a person has died such silent myocardial infarctions represent between 22 and 64 of all infarctions and are more common in elderly in those with diabetes mellitus and after heart transplantation in people with diabetes differences in pain threshold autonomic neuropathy and psychological factors have been cited as possible explanations for lack of symptoms in heart transplantation donor heart is not fully innervated by nervous system of recipient women thumb range of myocardial infarction symptoms in women in women myocardial infarctions can present with different symptoms classic presentation of chest pain occurs in about 50 of women women can also commonly experience back or neck pain indigestion heartburn lightheadedness shortness of breath fatigue nausea or pain in back of jaw these symptoms are often overlooked or mistaken for another condition causes most prominent risk factors for myocardial infarction are older age actively smoking high blood pressure diabetes mellitus and total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein levels many risk factors of myocardial infarction are shared with coronary artery disease primary cause of myocardial infarction with other risk factors including male sex low levels of physical activity a past family history obesity and alcohol use risk factors for myocardial disease are often included in risk factor stratification scores such as framingham risk score at any given age men are more at risk than women for development of cardiovascular disease high levels of blood cholesterol is a known risk factor particularly high low density lipoprotein low high density lipoprotein and high triglycerides many risk factors for myocardial infarction are potentially modifiable with most important being tobacco smoking including secondhand smoke smoking appears to be cause of about 36 and obesity cause of 20 of coronary artery disease lack of physical activity has been linked to 7 12 of cases less common causes include stress related causes such as job stress which accounts for about 3 of cases and chronic high stress levels diet there is varying evidence about importance of saturated fat in development of myocardial infarctions eating polyunsaturated fat instead of saturated fats has been shown in studies to be associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction while other studies find little evidence that reducing dietary saturated fat or increasing polyunsaturated fat intake affects heart attack risk dietary cholesterol does not appear to have a significant effect on blood cholesterol and thus recommendations about its consumption may not be needed trans fats do appear to increase risk acute and prolonged intake of high quantities of alcoholic drinks 3 4 or more daily increases risk of a heart attack genetics family history of ischemic heart disease or mi particularly if one has a male first degree relative father brother who had a myocardial infarction before age 55 years or a female first degree relative mother sister less than age 65 increases a person s risk of mi genome wide association studies have found 27 genetic variants that are associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction strongest association of mi has been found with chromosome 9 on short arm p at locus 21 which contains genes cdkn2a and 2b although single nucleotide polymorphisms that are implicated are within a non coding region majority of these variants are in regions that have not been previously implicated in coronary artery disease following genes have an association with mi lpa cdkn2a 2b abo other risk of having a myocardial infarction increases with older age low physical activity and low socioeconomic status heart attacks appear to occur more commonly in morning hours especially between 6am and noon evidence suggests that heart attacks are at least three times more likely to occur in morning than in late evening shift work is also associated with a higher risk of mi and one analysis has found an increase in heart attacks immediately following start of daylight saving time women who use combined oral contraceptive pills have a modestly increased risk of myocardial infarction especially in presence of other risk factors use of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids even for as short as a week increases risk endometriosis in women under age of 40 is an identified risk factor air pollution is also an important modifiable risk short term exposure to air pollution such as carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide but not ozone have been associated with mi and other acute cardiovascular events for sudden cardiac deaths every increment of 30 units in pollutant standards index correlated with an 8 increased risk of out of hospital cardiac arrest on day of exposure extremes of temperature are also associated a number of acute and chronic infections including pneumoniae influenza helicobacter pylori and among others have been linked to atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction as of 2013 there is no evidence of benefit from antibiotics or vaccination however calling association into question myocardial infarction can also occur as a late consequence of kawasaki disease calcium deposits in coronary arteries can be detected with ct scans calcium seen in coronary arteries can provide predictive information beyond that of classical risk factors high blood levels of amino acid homocysteine is associated with premature atherosclerosis whether elevated homocysteine in normal range is causal is controversial in people without evident coronary artery disease possible causes for myocardial infarction are coronary spasm or coronary artery dissection mechanism atherosclerosis thumb animation shows plaque buildup or a coronary artery spasm can lead to a heart attack and how blocked blood flow in a coronary artery can lead to a heart attack thumb a myocardial infarction occurs when an atherosclerotic plaque slowly builds up in inner lining of a coronary artery and then suddenly ruptures causing catastrophic thrombus formation totally occluding artery and preventing blood flow downstream most common cause of a myocardial infarction is rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque on an artery supplying heart muscle plaques can become unstable rupture and additionally promote formation of a blood clot that blocks artery this can occur in minutes blockage of an artery can lead to tissue death in tissue being supplied by that artery atherosclerotic plaques are often present for decades before they result in symptoms gradual buildup of cholesterol and fibrous tissue in plaques in wall of coronary arteries or other arteries typically over decades is termed atherosclerosis atherosclerosis is characterized by progressive inflammation of walls of arteries inflammatory cells particularly macrophages move into affected arterial walls over time they become laden with cholesterol products particularly ldl and become foam cells a cholesterol core forms as foam cells die in response to growth factors secreted by macrophages smooth muscle and other cells move into plaque and act to stabilize it a stable plaque may have a thick fibrous cap with calcification if there is ongoing inflammation cap may be thin or exposed to pressure associated with blood flow plaques especially those with a thin lining may rupture and trigger formation of a blood clot thrombus cholesterol crystals have been associated with plaque rupture through mechanical injury and inflammation other causes atherosclerotic disease is not only cause of myocardial infarction and it may exacerbate or contribute to other causes a myocardial infarction may result from a heart with a limited blood supply subject to increased oxygen demands such as in fever a fast heart rate hyperthyroidism too few red blood cells in bloodstream or low blood pressure damage or failure of procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafts may cause a myocardial infarction spasm of coronary arteries such as s angina may cause blockage tissue death thumb drawing of heart showing anterior left ventricle wall infarction if impaired blood flow to heart lasts long enough it triggers a process called ischemic cascade heart cells in territory of blocked coronary artery die infarction chiefly through necrosis and do not grow back a collagen scar forms in their place when an artery is blocked cells lack oxygen needed to produce atp in mitochondria atp is required for maintenance of electrolyte balance particularly through na k atpase this leads to an ischemic cascade of intracellular changes necrosis and apoptosis of affected cells cells in area with worst blood supply just below inner surface of heart are most susceptible to damage ischemia first affects this region region and tissue begins to die within 15 30 minutes of loss of blood supply dead tissue is surrounded by a zone of potentially reversible ischemia that progresses to become a full thickness infarct initial wave of infarction can take place over 3 4 hours these changes are seen on gross pathology and cannot be predicted by presence or absence of q waves on an ecg position size and extent of an infarct depends on affected artery totality of blockage duration of blockage presence of collateral blood vessels oxygen demand and success of procedures tissue death and myocardial scarring alter normal conduction pathways of heart and weaken affected areas size and location puts a person at risk of abnormal heart rhythms arrhythmias or heart block aneurysm of heart ventricles inflammation of heart wall following infarction and rupture of heart wall that can have catastrophic consequences diagnosis criteria an acute myocardial infarction according to current consensus is defined by elevated cardiac biomarkers with a rising or falling trend and at least one of following symptoms relating to ischemia changes on an electrocardiogram ecg such as st segment changes new left bundle branch block or q waves changes in motion of heart wall on imaging demonstration of a thrombus on angiogram or at autopsy types myocardial infarctions are generally clinically classified into st elevation mi stemi and non st elevation mi nstemi these are based on changes to an ecg stemis make up about 25 40 of myocardial infarctions a more explicit classification system based on international consensus in 2012 also exists this classifies myocardial infarctions into five types spontaneous mi related to plaque erosion and or rupture or dissection mi related to ischemia such as from increased oxygen demand or decreased supply e g coronary artery spasm coronary embolism anemia arrhythmias high blood pressure or low blood pressure sudden unexpected cardiac death including cardiac arrest where symptoms may suggest mi an ecg may be taken with suggestive changes or a blood clot is found in a coronary artery by angiography and or at autopsy but where blood samples could not be obtained or at a time before appearance of cardiac biomarkers in blood associated with coronary angioplasty or stents associated with percutaneous coronary intervention pci associated with stent thrombosis as documented by angiography or at autopsy associated with cabg associated with spontaneous coronary artery dissection in young fit women cardiac biomarkers there are a number of different biomarkers used to determine presence of cardiac muscle damage troponins measured through a blood test are considered to be best and are preferred because they have greater sensitivity and specificity for measuring injury to heart muscle than other tests a rise in troponin occurs within 2 3 hours of injury to heart muscle and peaks within 1 2 days level of troponin as well as a change over time are useful in measuring and diagnosing or excluding myocardial infarctions and diagnostic accuracy of troponin testing is improving over time one high sensitivity cardiac troponin is able to rule out a heart attack as long as ecg is normal other tests such as ck mb or myoglobin are discouraged ck mb is not as specific as troponins for acute myocardial injury and may be elevated with past cardiac surgery inflammation or electrical it rises within 4 8 hours and returns to normal within 2 3 days may be useful to rule out mi rapidly when used along with troponin electrocardiogram thumb upright 1 6 a 12 lead ecg showing a stemi elevation of st segment can be seen in some leads electrocardiograms ecgs are a series of leads placed on a person s chest that measure electrical activity associated with contraction of heart muscle taking of an ecg is an important part in workup of an ami and ecgs are often not just taken once but may be repeated over minutes to hours or in response to changes in signs or symptoms ecg readouts product a waveform with different labelled features in addition to a rise in biomarkers a rise in st segment changes in shape or flipping of t waves new q waves or a new left bundle branch block can be used to diagnose an ami in addition st elevation can be used to diagnose an st segment myocardial infarction stemi a rise must be new in v2 and v3 2 mm 0 2 mv for males or 1 5 mm 0 15 mv for females or 1 mm 0 1 mv in two other adjacent chest or limb leads st elevation is associated with infarction and may be preceded by changes indicating ischemia such as st depression or inversion of t waves abnormalities can help differentiate location of an infarct based on leads that are affected by changes early stemis may be preceded by peaked t waves other ecg abnormalities relating to complications of acute myocardial infarctions may also be evident such as atrial or ventricular fibrillation imaging noninvasive imaging plays an important role in diagnosis and characterisation of myocardial infarction tests such as chest x rays can be used to explore and exclude alternate causes of a person s symptoms tests such as stress echocardiography and myocardial perfusion imaging can confirm a diagnosis when a person s history physical examination including cardiac examination ecg and cardiac biomarkers suggest likelihood of a problem echocardiography an ultrasound scan of heart is able to visualize heart its size shape and any abnormal motion of heart walls as they beat that may indicate a myocardial infarction flow of blood can be imaged and contrast dyes may be given to improve image other scans using radioactive contrast include spect ct scans using thallium scans or or a pet scan using or rubidium 82 these nuclear medicine scans can visualize perfusion of heart muscle spect may also be used to determine viability of tissue and whether areas of ischemia are inducible medical societies and professional guidelines recommend that physician confirm a person is at high risk for myocardial infarction before conducting imaging tests to make a diagnosis as such tests are unlikely to change management and result in increased costs patients who have a normal ecg and who are able to exercise for example do not merit routine imaging differential diagnosis there are many causes of chest pain which can originate from heart lungs gastrointestinal tract aorta and other muscles bones and nerves surrounding chest in addition to myocardial infarction other causes include angina insufficient blood supply ischemia to heart muscles without evidence of cell death gastroesophageal reflux disease pulmonary embolism tumors of lungs pneumonia rib fracture heart failure and other musculoskeletal injuries rarer severe differential diagnoses include aortic dissection esophageal rupture tension pneumothorax and effusion causing cardiac chest pain in an mi may mimic heartburn causes of sudden onset breathlessness generally involve lungs or heart including pulmonary edema pneumonia allergic reactions and asthma and pulmonary embolus acute respiratory distress syndrome and metabolic acidosis there are many different causes of fatigue and myocardial infarction is not a common cause management a myocardial infarction requires immediate medical attention treatment aims to preserve as much heart muscle as possible and to prevent further complications treatment depends on whether myocardial infarction is a stemi or nstemi treatment in general aims to unblock blood vessels reduce blot clot enlargement reduce ischemia and modify risk factors with aim of preventing future mis in addition main treatment for myocardial infarctions with ecg evidence of st elevation stemi include thrombolysis or percutaneous coronary intervention although pci is also ideally conducted within 1 3 days for nstemi in addition to clinical judgement risk stratification may be used to guide treatment such as with timi and grace scoring systems pain pain associated with myocardial infarction may be treated with nitroglycerin or morphine nitroglycerin given under tongue or intravenously may improve blood supply to heart and decrease work heart must do it is an important part of therapy for its pain relief despite there being no benefit to overall mortality morphine may also be used and is effective for pain associated with stemi evidence for benefit from morphine on overall outcomes however is poor and there is some evidence of potential harm anticoagulation aspirin an antiplatelet anticoagulant is given as a loading dose with goal of reducing clot size and reduce further clotting in affected artery it is known to decrease mortality associated with acute myocardial infarction by at least 50 p2y12 inhibitors such as clopidogrel prasugrel and ticagrelor are given concurrently also as a loading dose with dose depending on whether further surgical management or fibrinolysis is planned prasugrel and ticagrelor are recommended in european and american guidelines as they are active more quickly and consistently than clopidogrel p2y12 inhibitors are recommended in both nstemi and stemi including in pci with evidence also to suggest improved mortality heparins particularly in unfractionated form act at several points in clotting cascade help to prevent enlargement of a clot and are also given in myocardial infarction owing to evidence suggesting improved mortality rates in very high risk scenarios inhibitors of platelet glycoprotein receptor such as or may be used there is varying evidence on mortality benefits in nstemi a 2014 review of p2y12 inhibitors such as clopidogrel found they do not change risk of death when given to people with a suspected nstemi prior to pci nor do heparins change risk of death they do decrease risk of having a further myocardial infarction angiogram primary percutaneous coronary intervention pci is treatment of choice for stemi if it can be performed in a timely manner ideally within 90 120 minutes of contact with a medical provider some recommend it is also done in nstemi within 1 3 days particularly when considered high risk a 2017 review however did not find a difference between early versus later pci in nstemi pci involves small probes inserted through peripheral blood vessels such as femoral artery or radial artery into blood vessels of heart probes are then used to identify and clear blockages using small balloons which are dragged through blocked segment dragging away clot or insertion of stents coronary artery bypass grafting is only considered when affected area of heart muscle large and pci is unsuitable for example with difficult cardiac anatomy after pci people are generally placed on aspirin indefinitely and on dual antiplatelet therapy generally aspirin and clopidogrel for at least a year fibrinolysis if pci cannot be performed within 90 to 120 minutes in stemi then fibrinolysis preferably within 30 minutes of arrival to hospital is recommended if a person has had symptoms for 12 to 24 hours evidence for effectiveness of thrombolysis is less and if they have had symptoms for more than 24 hours it is not recommended thrombolysis involves administration of medication that activates enzymes that normally dissolve blood clots these medications include tissue plasminogen activator and thrombolysis is not recommended in a number of situations particularly when associated with a high risk of bleeding or potential for problematic bleeding such as active bleeding past strokes or bleeds into brain or severe hypertension situations in which thrombolysis may be considered but with caution include recent surgery use of anticoagulants pregnancy and proclivity to bleeding major risks of thrombolysis are major bleeding and intracranial bleeding pre hospital thrombolysis reduces time to treatment based on studies conducted in higher income countries however it is unclear whether this has an impact on mortality rates other in past high flow oxygen was recommended for everyone with a possible myocardial infarction more recently no evidence was found for routine use in those with normal oxygen levels and there is potential harm from intervention therefore oxygen is currently only recommended if oxygen levels are found to be low or if someone is in respiratory distress if despite thrombolysis there is significant cardiogenic shock continued severe chest pain or less than a 50 improvement in st elevation on ecg recording after 90 minutes then rescue pci is indicated those who have had cardiac arrest may benefit from targeted temperature management with evaluation for implementation of hypothermia protocols furthermore those with cardiac arrest and st elevation at any time should usually have angiography aldosterone antagonists appear to be useful in people who have had an stemi and do not have heart failure rehabilitation cardiac rehabilitation benefits many who have experienced myocardial infarction even if there has been substantial heart damage and resultant left ventricular failure it should start soon after discharge from hospital program may include lifestyle advice exercise social support as well as recommendations about driving flying sport participation stress management and sexual intercourse prevention there is a large crossover between lifestyle and activity recommendations to prevent a myocardial infarction and those that may be adopted as secondary prevention after an initial myocardial infarction because of shared risk factors and an aim to reduce atherosclerosis affecting heart vessels primary prevention lifestyle physical activity can reduce risk of cardiovascular disease and people at risk are advised to engage in 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic exercise a week keeping a healthy weight drinking alcohol within recommended limits and quitting smoking reduce risk of cardiovascular disease substituting polyunsaturated fats such as olive oil and rapeseed oil instead of saturated fats may reduce risk of myocardial infarction although there is not universal agreement dietary modifications are recommended by some national authorities with recommendations including increasing intake of starch reducing sugar intake particularly of refined sugar consuming five portions of fruit and vegetables daily consuming two or more portions of fish per week and consuming 4 5 portions of unsalted nuts seeds or legumes per week dietary pattern with greatest support is mediterranean diet vitamins and mineral supplements are of no proven benefit and neither are plant or sterols public health measures may also act at a population level to reduce risk of myocardial infarction for example by reduce unhealthy diets excessive salt saturated fat and trans fat including food labeling and marketing requirements as well as requirements for catering and restaurants and stimulating physical activity this may be part of regional cardiovascular disease prevention programs or through health impact assessment of regional and local plans and policies most guidelines recommend combining different preventive strategies a 2015 cochrane review found some evidence that such an approach might help with blood pressure body mass index and waist circumference however there was insufficient evidence to show an effect on mortality or actual cardio vascular events medication statins drugs that act to lower blood cholesterol decrease incidence and mortality rates of myocardial infarctions they are often recommended in those at an elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases aspirin has been studied extensively in people considered at increased risk of myocardial infarction based on numerous studies in different groups e g people with or without diabetes there does not appear to be a benefit strong enough to outweigh risk of excessive bleeding nevertheless many clinical practice guidelines continue to recommend aspirin for primary prevention and some researchers feel that those with very high cardiovascular risk but low risk of bleeding should continue to receive aspirin secondary prevention there is a large crossover between lifestyle and activity recommendations to prevent a myocardial infarction and those that may be adopted as secondary prevention after an initial myocardial infarct recommendations include stopping smoking a gradual return to exercise eating a healthy diet low in saturated fat and low in cholesterol and drinking alcohol within recommended limits exercising and trying to achieve a healthy weight exercise is both safe and effective even if people have had stents or heart failure and is recommended to start gradually after 1 2 weeks counselling should be provided relating to medications used and for warning signs of depression previous studies suggested a benefit from omega 3 fatty acid supplementation but this has not been confirmed medications following a heart attack nitrates when taken for two days and ace inhibitors decrease risk of death other medications include aspirin is continued indefinitely as well as another antiplatelet agent such as clopidogrel or ticagrelor dual antiplatelet therapy or for up to twelve months if someone has another medical condition that requires anticoagulation e g with warfarin this may need to be adjusted based on risk of further cardiac events as well as bleeding risk in those who have had a stent more than 12 months of clopidogrel plus aspirin does not affect risk of death beta blocker therapy such as or is recommended to be started within 24 hours provided there is no acute heart failure or heart block dose should be increased to highest tolerated contrary to what was long believed use of beta blockers does not appear to affect risk of death possibly because other treatments for mi have improved when beta blocker medication is given within first 24 72 hours of a stemi no lives are saved however 1 in 200 people were prevented from a repeat heart attack and another 1 in 200 from having an abnormal heart rhythm additionally for 1 in 91 medication causes a temporary decrease in heart s ability to pump blood ace inhibitor therapy should be started within 24 hours and continued indefinitely at highest tolerated dose this is provided there is no evidence of worsening kidney failure high potassium low blood pressure or known narrowing of renal arteries those who cannot tolerate ace inhibitors may be treated with an angiotensin ii receptor antagonist statin therapy has been shown to reduce mortality and subsequent cardiac events and should be commenced with aim of lowering ldl cholesterol other medications such as may also be added with this goal in mind aldosterone antagonists spironolactone or may be used if there is evidence of left ventricular dysfunction after an mi ideally after beginning treatment with an ace inhibitor other a defibrillator an electric device connected to heart and surgically inserted under skin may be recommended this is particularly if there are any ongoing signs of heart failure with a low left ventricular ejection fraction and a new york heart association grade ii or iii after 40 days of infarction defibrillators detect potentially fatal arrhythmia and deliver an electrical shock to person to a critical mass of heart muscle prognosis prognosis after myocardial infarction varies greatly depending on extent and location of affected heart muscle and development and management of complications prognosis is worse with older age and social isolation anterior infarcts persistent ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation development of heart blocks and left ventricular impairment are all associated with poorer prognosis without treatment about a quarter of those affected by mi die within minutes and about forty percent within first month morbidity and mortality from myocardial infarction has however improved over years due to earlier and better treatment in those who have an stemi in united states between 5 and 6 percent die before leaving hospital and 7 to 18 percent die within a year it is unusual for babies to experience a myocardial infarction but when they do about half die in short term neonatal survivors seem to have a normal quality of life complications complications may occur immediately following myocardial infarction or may take time to develop disturbances of heart rhythms including atrial fibrillation ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation and heart block can arise as a result of ischemia cardiac scarring and infarct location stroke is also a risk either as a result of clots transmitted from heart during pci as a result of bleeding following anticoagulation or as a result of disturbances in heart s ability to pump effectively as a result of infarction regurgitation of blood through mitral valve is possible particularly if infarction causes dysfunction of papillary muscle cardiogenic shock as a result of heart being unable to adequately pump blood may develop dependent on infarct size and is most likely to occur within days following an acute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock is largest cause of in hospital mortality rupture of ventricular dividing wall or left ventricular wall may occur within initial weeks dressler s syndrome a reaction following larger infarcts and a cause of is also possible heart failure may develop as a long term consequence with an impaired ability of heart muscle to pump scarring and increase in size of existing muscle aneurysm of left ventricle myocardium develops in about 10 of mi and is itself a risk factor for heart failure ventricular arrhythmia and development of clots risk factors for complications and death include age hemodynamic parameters such as heart failure cardiac arrest on admission systolic blood pressure or class of two or greater st segment deviation diabetes serum creatinine peripheral vascular disease and elevation of cardiac markers epidemiology myocardial infarction is a common presentation of coronary artery disease world health organization estimated in 2004 that 12 2 of worldwide deaths were from ischemic heart disease with it being leading cause of death in high or middle income countries and second only to lower respiratory infections in lower income countries worldwide more than 3 million people have stemis and 4 million have a year stemis occur about twice as often in men as women rates of death from ischemic heart disease ihd have slowed or declined in most high income countries although cardiovascular disease still accounted for one in three of all deaths in us in 2008 for example rates of death from cardiovascular disease have decreased almost a third between 2001 and 2011 in united states in contrast ihd is becoming a more common cause of death in developing world for example in india ihd had become leading cause of death by 2004 accounting for 1 46 million deaths 14 of total deaths and deaths due to ihd were expected to double during 1985 2015 globally disability adjusted life years dalys lost to ischemic heart disease are predicted to account for 5 5 of total dalys in 2030 making it second most important cause of disability after depressive disorder as well as leading cause of death by this date society and culture depictions of heart attacks in popular media often include collapsing or loss of consciousness which are not common symptoms these depictions contribute to widespread misunderstanding about symptoms of myocardial infarctions which in turn contributes to people not getting care when they should legal implications at common law in general a myocardial infarction is a disease but may sometimes be an injury this can create coverage issues in administration of no fault insurance schemes such as workers compensation in general a heart attack is not covered workers compensation faq prairie view a m university retrieved november 22 2006 however it may be a work related injury if it results for example from unusual emotional stress or unusual exertion significant decisions subject index board of industrial insurance appeals retrieved november 22 2006 in addition in some jurisdictions heart attacks suffered by persons in particular occupations such as police officers may be classified as line of duty injuries by statute or policy in some countries or states a person having suffered from an mi may be prevented from participating in activity that puts other
