magazine vol 3 pp 48 49 in 1954 hamling started a companion magazine imaginative tales in addition his company greenleaf publishing was publisher of rogue a men s magazine modelled after playboy in 1957 liquidation of american news company a major distributor meant that many magazines had to scramble to find new distributors independent distributors often required that magazines be monthly and that they be in a larger format than digest size common in science fiction magazines larger format required higher revenue to be profitable but in many cases it proved impossible to attract additional advertising income that would have kept magazines afloat by end of 1958 many titles had disappeared as a result with imagination one of victims hamling closed down both imagination and its sister magazine to invest money in rogue instead last issue of imagination was october 1958 63rd issue while imaginative tales retitled space travel ceased with november 1958 issue michael ashley

intellectualism in november 1951 issue he commented that science fiction was never meant to be an educational tour de force so called adult story is nothing more than an attempt to show reader how

lists palmer as editor tuck and nicholls both list palmer rather than mahaffey with third issue greenleaf publishing company became publisher and william hamling took over as editor a position he
