vincent ward hargest was beaten in by ward jr who had a majority of 571 votes 5 82 and hargest had thus been beaten by both father and son ward jr retired at end of term and this allowed hargest to enter new zealand parliament in 1931 general election on his third attempt becoming mp for invercargill electorate in parliament hargest was an advocate for interests of southland but was also interested in defence and educational matters he held this electorate until 1935 before successfully switching to awarua electorate for 1935 election initially an independent reform mp he was a supporter of coalition between united party and reform party when coalition combined to become national party hargest formally joined new party and was possibly reform mp most committed from first to formation of national party in its early period of national party there was a lengthy discussion about its leadership as previous leaders of constituent parties were not acceptable to other at time

hargest wrote to coates rebuking him for his stance and pleading for unity as new party was still fragile in event hamilton won election by one vote and became national s first leader for much of period that he was in charge of national party hamilton was regarded a conscientious but lack lustre leader although national s performance had improved in election by winning an additional six electorates labour was still in government and there were discussions about replacing hamilton hargest who had retained his awarua seat for national in election was one of two contenders for party leadership other was keith holyoake but he had lost his electorate with outbreak of second world war hargest immediately volunteered for active service national party leadership eventually went to sidney holland in november 1940 there was a view that this was a temporary situation that could be reassessed once holyoake or hargest returned to parliament hargest remained a member of parliament during his time on active service and in he was sole candidate in awarua electorate whilst an internee in switzerland he was thus returned unopposed in 1935 hargest was awarded king george v silver jubilee medal second world war on volunteering for service in war hargest sought to serve abroad in command of one of infantry brigades of second new zealand expeditionary force 2nzef however newly appointed commander of 2nzef major general bernard freyberg was concerned about age and command experience of some potential senior officers of 2nzef such as hargest a subsequent medical assessment deemed hargest fit only for service on home front as he was still prone to bouts of shell shock from his service during first world war disappointed with this decision he approached peter fraser acting prime minister of new zealand with a request for a brigade command in 2nzef fraser disregarded official advice and arranged for hargest to be appointed commander of 5th infantry brigade at time chief of general staff of new zealand military forces major general john duigan wrote to freyberg disassociating himself from decision hargest with rank of brigadier left new zealand with second echelon in which his brigade which comprised 21st 22nd and 23rd battalions was largest formation in may 1940 originally intended to join first echelon of 2nzef then in egypt it was diverted en route to england following threat of a german invasion brigade carried out training and guard duties in area around dover before being shipped to egypt in early 1941 greece and crete within a matter of weeks brigade as part of 2nd new zealand division was in greece and manning defences on aliakmon line in preparation for anticipated invasion of country by germans following invasion hargest s brigade mounted a spirited defence of its positions at olympus pass from 14 to 16 april before it had to withdraw to provide cover neighbouring new zealand brigades conducting their own retreat brigade was eventually evacuated on night of 24 april to crete hargest and his brigade took part in subsequent battle of crete in may 2nd new zealand division was under command of brigadier edward puttick due to freyberg taking command of creforce which consisted of all allied troops on crete puttick gave hargest s brigade task of defending airfield at maleme and its easterly approaches 22nd battalion commanded by lieutenant colonel leslie andrew guarded airfield itself and a neighbouring hill point 107 with other two battalions of brigade positioned further east while hargest situated his headquarters at some distance from airfield within days of arriving on crete allied positions began to be subject of strafing and bombing attacks by german planes as a precursor to an airborne invasion mounted by german paratroopers of 1st parachute division bombing triggered in hargest an occurrence of his shell shock rendering him lethargic and confused when gliders containing paratroopers began landing around and to west of airfield on 20 may andrew became cut off from several of his platoons and companies with some being overrun by german forces unable to gauge how situation was unfolding his communications with hargest back at brigade headquarters also became disjointed andrew stressed seriousness of situation to hargest and requested reinforcements from other battalions which were more than holding their own hargest incorrectly advised that there were no available troops this left andrew with his own small platoon size reserve which was used in a failed counter attack eventually andrew sought permission to withdraw from point 107 hargest replied well if you must you must although well aware of importance of maleme airfield to defence of crete hargest made no effort to dissuade andrew or see situation for himself despite belated arrival of a reinforcing company of infantry sent by hargest that evening andrew decided his position was not defensible in daylight and withdrew his units to join other battalions of brigade germans took both airfield and point 107 early on morning of 21 may capture of airfield allowed german reinforcements to be landed directly on crete and establish a strong foothold on their otherwise tenuous positions a counterattack to take back airfield and point 107 was organised for following day at hargest s headquarters he was exhausted and had to take a quick nap before a conference to work out detailed plans for counter attack much to disgust of some of other participants afterwards he became pessimistic of chances of success and unsuccessfully sought to have attack called off attack did fail but hargest still well behind frontlines mistakenly believed it to be going well until he found that his brigade had returned to their starting positions his pessimism began to affect puttick who asked freyberg to allow 5th infantry brigade to withdraw which it duly did this began an eventual retreat and evacuation from crete on 31 may with hargest flying out for egypt by seaplane his brigade following by sea thumb right hargest centre front with lieutenant colonel leslie andrew left and major general bernard freyberg egypt july 1941 once he was back in egypt hargest was critical of freyberg s conduct of fighting on crete in a meeting with general archibald wavell commander of allied forces in middle east he expressed similar views in a meeting with new zealand prime minister peter fraser who was in egypt at time on a visit to new zealand forces he also voiced concern over what he considered to be a lack of consultation by freyberg with his senior commanders he was able to resolve his differences with freyberg and in later correspondence with fraser expressed his satisfaction with way freyberg dealt with his subordinates hargest s own performance on crete escaped official scrutiny and he was awarded a bar to his dso he was also awarded greek war cross for his services in military campaigns in greece and crete north africa after loss of crete 2nd new zealand division underwent a period of refit and training before it was assigned to british eighth army which was then engaged in north african campaign it took part in operation crusader in november 1941 where eighth army attempted to break through to tobruk hargest s brigade was used to cover movements of other two brigades of division which were attempting to advance through to tobruk in meantime generalleutnant lieutenant general erwin rommel s afrika korps had outflanked allies and were approaching hargest s position which was clustered with transport that made defending an attack difficult he and 700 men of his brigade were captured on 27 november 1941 when his headquarters situated on edge of an airfield near sidi aziz was overrun by german tanks he had resisted moving his headquarters to a nearby escarpment and incorrectly insisted his orders did not allow him this latitude after his capture he was taken to rommel who despite being irritated at hargest s refusal to salute him was complimentary of fighting performance of new zealanders prisoner of war hargest was transported to italy where he was initially held in a villa near sulmona but was transferred along with a fellow new zealander brigadier reginald miles who had been captured in december 1941 to castle known as campo 12 near florence campo 12 was a prison camp for officers of general and brigadier rank and prisoners were held under more comfortable conditions than soldiers of lesser rank in late march 1943 a group of officers including hargest and miles managed to escape using a tunnel dug from a disused chapel within castle walls of six escapees hargest and miles were only two to reach safety in neutral switzerland where they split up to independently try to make their way to england as hargest later related i was over in lucerne when miles rang up to say he was off and to suggest i should follow him later miles made it to figueras close to spanish frontier but overcome with depression killed himself on 20 october with help of french resistance hargest travelled through france to spain where he reached british consulate in barcelona he flew to england in december 1943 hargest was one of only three men miles was one of others known to british military intelligence to have escaped from an italian prisoner of war camp and make their way to another country prior to armistice with italy for his escape to switzerland hargest was awarded a second bar to his dso he was later appointed a commander of order of british empire he also wrote an account of his escape which was published as book farewell campo 12 death and legacy by early 1944 2nd new zealand division was fighting in

to british 50th infantry division an infantry unit of 21st army group with which he landed in normandy on 6 june he was wounded later that month after d day a new role was found for hargest now that allies were on mainland europe thought was turning to issue of dealing with expected arrival of newly released new zealanders from liberated prisoner of war camps 2nzef reception group was set up to help repatriate them hargest was appointed commander of group but on 12 august 1944 was killed by shell fire during battle of normandy when he was making a farewell visit to british 50th division
