alberta provincial highway no 3 commonly referred to as highway 3 and officially named crowsnest highway is a highway that traverses southern alberta canada running from crowsnest pass through lethbridge to trans canada highway in medicine hat together with british columbia highway 3 which begins in hope it forms an interprovincial route that serves as an alternate to trans canada from lower mainland to canadian prairies highway 3 begins as a two lane continuation of bc highway 3 in canadian rockies at crowsnest pass winding through foothills to a junction with highway 2 west of fort macleod briefly concurrent with highway 2 it becomes a divided highway and part of alberta s export highway a segment of canamex corridor that stretches from alaska to mexico in lethbridge it is an expressway named crowsnest trail that crosses oldman river and meets northern termini of highways 4 and 5 former is a major route that assumes designation of export highway connecting to interstate 15 in montana while latter branches southwest to magrath and cardston leaving lethbridge highway 3 passes through coaldale and taber before reverting to a two lane highway that ends at highway 1 in medicine hat for its entire length highway 3 follows alignment of canadian pacific railway it was first a rough dirt road known as red trail plotted in early 1900s later numbered as highway no 3 it was designated as a southern branch of former trans canada highway by 1920s and improved to gravel then eventually paved widened with shoulders and upgraded to an expressway in sections trans canada was officially routed through calgary in 1960s but highway 3 remained an important alternate route to west coast and was incorporated into national highway system in 1988 twinning of first segment between lethbridge and coaldale had been completed by mid 1960s and it was officially named crowsnest highway in late 1970s a major expressway realignment along crowsnest trail in central lethbridge was completed in 1980s and twinning of fort macleod lethbridge segment was completed in mid 1990s alberta transportation has long term plans to upgrade entire route to a freeway work will include twinning west of fort macleod and east of taber and an eventual elimination of at grade intersections plans have been drafted for a free flowing bypass of lethbridge that will realign highways 3 and 4 to north and east of city respectively and a future fort macleod bypass will realign highway 3 to south of town connecting to a newly extended highway 2 funding has not yet been allocated for any of future upgrades nor any potential timeline for projects route description highway 3 was designated as one of original core routes of national highway system in 1988 an interprovincial route connecting large population centres most of road is an undivided two lane highway with a speed limit of outside of rural areas from fort macleod to west lethbridge and from coaldale to taber it is a divided highway with a speed limit of highway 3 is a divided expressway between fort macleod and lethbridge that forms a portion of alberta s export highway a segment of canamex corridor that facilitates movement of goods between alaska and mexico fort macleod lethbridge segment also comprises westernmost portion of red coat trail a historic route advertised as that which was travelled by north west mounted police in late 19th century in their quest to bring order and peace to region crowsnest pass and foothills thumb crowsnest highway near cowley british columbia highway 3 is a two lane undivided highway that becomes alberta highway 3 at border in mountainous terrain paralleling a branch of canadian pacific railway it first crosses over to south side of railway and passes through centre of island lake on a causeway part of which is natural terrain it curves through communities of municipality of crowsnest pass on south side of crowsnest lake crossing crowsnest river and reaching highway 40 at coleman it continues alongside railway through blairmore again crossing crowsnest river and bisecting community of frank and rubble of frank slide a major landslide that killed more than 70 people in 1903 highway crowsnest river and railway meander east into municipal district of pincher creek no 9 and from which highway 507 splits south to beaver mines and forms an alternate route from west into pincher creek highway 3 curves northeast to hamlet of lundbreck which it bypasses and from which highway 22 begins and runs north first of four former alignments of highway 3 all of which are now designated as highway 3a passes through lundbreck splitting from highway 3 prior to hamlet and rejoining it later left thumb looking east on highway 3 near lundbreck east of lundbreck and cowley highway crosses castle river to highways 6 and 785 north of pincher creek it briefly parallels creek for which town was named before crossing it and reaching brocket and highway 786 which meets highway 507 southeast of pincher creek highway 3 follows oldman river to fort macleod approximately east of brocket just prior to fort macleod highway enters municipal district of willow creek no 26 and highway 810 splits south to communities of and glenwood after which highway 3 widens to a divided highway it meets highway 2 at a trumpet interchange and diverges into a one way road pair through fort macleod at a reduced speed limit of concurrent with highway 2 highway 811 turns north from highway 3 in central fort macleod to cross oldman river on a historic alignment of highway 2 at fort macleod health centre highways 2 and 3 curve southeast to leave town as one way roads rejoin into a divided highway concurrency ends as highway 2 splits south as a two lane highway to cardston and united states border at carway highway 3 bends back to northeast now designated as red coat trail and carrying canamex traffic destined for primary border crossing on highway 4 at coutts divided highway continues northeast from fort macleod with a speed limit of paralleling oldman river it curves east to bypass monarch to south and crosses river entering lethbridge county highway 3 formerly passed through monarch until 1990s construction of bypass that route is now designated as highway 3a and meets highway 23 east of town which then joins highway 3 north of confluence of oldman and belly rivers after curving southeast highway 509 splits southwest to stand off highway 3 intersects 51 avenue main access for town of coalhurst westview drive splits into west lethbridge at a partial interchange and for less than one kilometre it forms third route designated as highway 3a highway 3 continues east entering city of lethbridge as a freeway and meeting highway 25

highway 879 to town of bow island before seven persons highway enters cypress county and intersects highway 887 as it veers northeast to enter city of medicine hat from southwest it becomes a divided expressway called gershaw drive sw that passes north of medicine hat airport before ending at trans canada highway highway 1 gershaw drive continues into downtown medicine hat as highway 41a history early years thumb lethbridge seen here in 1911 was hub of southern alberta and crossroads of red yellow and sunshine trails that became highways 3 4 and 5 respectively many major highways in alberta are predated by historic railway lines for significant portions of their length including highways 1 2 4 and 12 through 16 inception of trail that would become highway 3 was similar with 1898 completion of a main line of canadian pacific railway spurring development in crowsnest pass region railway connected kootenay landing near creston british columbia to lethbridge and was primary method of transport until a rapid increase of private automobile use in early 20th century in 1926 major highways in alberta began receiving numbers previously all routes had been identified by coloured bands tied to telephone poles red trail officially became highway 3 in 1932 inception highway 3 has existed in alberta on generally same alignment since 1910s with only relatively minor changes made to a rough road called red trail that had been carved from medicine hat to crowsnest pass difficult terrain on south shore of crowsnest lake was a major obstacle in connecting road to british columbia border on april 29 1903 a major rockslide buried town of frank and killed dozens blocking existing red trail work immediately began to clear railway of debris but a new trail north of slide was created connecting frank and bellevue by 1906 a road had been carved through rock to south of railway replacing temporary trail a formal opening of highway was held on october 8 1917 in blairmore officials had aimed for ceremony to be held in september but final work on road had been delayed by canadian pacific railway who were unhappy with location at which highway crossed railroad causing originally surveyed route to be altered minister of public works charles stewart had travelled from edmonton for event and stated that highway was only natural route for a trans canada highway and would be in better condition if not for difficult economic times canada was embroiled in world war i which ended in 1918 and gravelling of highway began in following years thumb left an arch bridge built in 1953 carried highway 3 across crowsnest river near lundbreck falls until a new bridge was constructed further downstream in 1967 gravelling and upgrades traffic in alberta had always driven on right but british columbia bc had driven on left until 1921 switch eliminated confusion that had been occurring on road in vicinity of provincial border when traffic had to switch from one side of road to other desire for a trans canada route that incorporated red trail continued into 1920s with formation of trans canada red trail association its president dr o f advocated for road to be signed as trans canada red trail in addition to existing red markings and for route be improved to an all weather highway by late 1920s red trail remained a dirt road between medicine hat and taber but work began on gravelling lethbridge to macleod section in late 1928 and was completed in january 1929 crews then moved west and began gravelling between pincher station and macleod mountain pass into bc was not open during winter nor was dirt section between taber and medicine hat that had not yet been gravelled by 1928 highway was envisioned to be part of a trans canada trail that stretched from vancouver to halifax a 1929 map of major highways published by alberta development board listed highway 3 as part of a southern branch of trans canada highway that ran from medicine hat to vancouver via princeton and spences bridge in bc this route included portions of present day highways 5a and 8 as construction of a road connecting princeton and hope did not begin until 1930 northern branch connected medicine hat to banff via calgary thumb 3 avenue south in lethbridge was part of highway 3 until construction of crowsnest trail expressway several blocks north in 1980s work was also on going to upgrade road east of lethbridge in 1927 red trail between coaldale and chin was gravelled and upgrading continued further east to taber in 1928 in 1929 delegates from various communities along route met in taber to advocate to provincial government for gravelling of red trail from taber to medicine hat taber to bow island section was completed between 1929 and 1931 and a similar meeting was held in lethbridge in 1931 lobbying for remainder group included local officials farmers and residents who argued that red trail connected key population centres and irrigation districts in southern alberta and was a component of an interprovincial route from vancouver to winnipeg route was better known by tourists they claimed and was only highway to west that could economically be kept open year round at this time british columbia had done work to their portion of highway allowing it to remain open year round so it was desirable for alberta to follow suit general sentiment among southern alberta officials was that red trail was a shorter and preferable route compared to northern branch of trans canada through calgary minister of public works oran mcpherson in 1934 announced that section between bow island and medicine hat would be gravelled permitting all weather travel for entire length of highway 3 along with similar work in southern saskatchewan and aforementioned british columbia work project created an all weather connection across southern prairies through rubble of frank slide a new route for highway was carved north of railway in 1932 and paving of highway 3 began in august 1939 first stretch to be completed ran west from top of oldman river valley hill in west lethbridge near university drive to monarch local road now designated as township road 7 0 is historic alignment of highway 3 across castle river west of pincher creek and immediately north of pincher creek airport from east highway paralleled railway until pincher station at junction with highway 6 but then continued due west to cross river approximately south of present day crossing highway 3 turned northwest then west to pass through south side of lundbreck on a local road now named township road 7 4 west of lundbreck highway briefly paralleled crowsnest river before crossing it near lundbreck falls east of lethbridge highway 3 was composed of sections of road that followed a grid system for long stretches using only roads that ran due east or due north exiting lethbridge it followed a road now designated as highway 512 to coaldale then turned north into coaldale where it turned east south of tempest it turned back north then east near hamlet of chin after following vast majority of present day alignment alongside railway to seven persons it diverged from railway and curved northeast into medicine hat later years 1950 1970 thumb upright 1 2 current highway 3 bridge over oldman river in lethbridge was built in mid 1940s replacing a bridge to north that had been constructed circa 1905 in 1957 lethbridge council met to discuss expansion of highway 3 between lethbridge and coaldale to a divided highway highway minister gordon taylor in 1958 confirmed that alberta would complete project in near future but did not have a definite timeline coaldale voiced opposition to an upgraded highway bypassing town fearing economic losses as traffic would be diverted away from town citing safety and efficiency for motorists taylor stated that province would prefer for major highways to not travel through towns but extra mileage would not be created to accomplish this twinning work had been completed by mid 1960s and divided highway bisected coaldale work began in 1963 to upgrade highway between coaldale and barnwell so it could carry loads up to e c lonsdale chairman of lethbridge chamber of commerce stated that region was at an economic disadvantage until upgrade was completed final alignment for upgraded highway through barnwell had been confirmed by march 1966 with construction beginning shortly thereafter in 1965 chamber pressed taylor for further upgrades to highway including safety improvements to intersections and construction of adequate shoulders taylor stated that province was doing its best to improve road but funds were being spread among other important highway projects in province meanwhile you must not forget you have a completely black topped road here one that is equal to best roads in some of other provinces and united states taylor said nevertheless chamber was still concerned about condition of road particularly in crowsnest pass region where mountainous terrain and steep grades were making upgrades difficult there was also concern about diversion of traffic from highway 3 to trans canada highway which would have a negative effect on economies of southern alberta municipalities highway 3 underwent major realignment in lethbridge area beginning in 1966 existing route along westside drive and bridge drive was to be replaced by a new four lane expressway to north requiring new bridges over cpr tracks and an interchange at highway 25 most of interchange was built in 1966 but construction of bridge carrying highway 25 over new highway 3 lagged behind and opened following year twin bridges carrying new highway 3 over cpr tracks west of lethbridge also opened in 1967 as did a trumpet interchange further east at bridge drive on west bank of oldman river existing two lane bridge over oldman river that had been constructed in 1946 was widened to four lanes and a partial interchange at 5 avenue n built by 1968 completed realignment highway 3 was now twinned from monarch to coaldale thumb left a canadian pacific railway train next to highway 3 between lethbridge and coaldale first section of highway 3 to be twinned in medicine hat plans were presented to city council for an expressway upgrade to trans canada highway in september 1968 upgrade would include construction of a diamond interchange at existing intersection with gershaw drive highway 3 and widening of gershaw to a four lane road interchange had been constructed by summer 1976 delayed several weeks by unstable terrain necessitating steel beams to supplement concrete piles for bridge planning began in 1970 to establish a 4 lane corridor for highway 3 near crowsnest pass a route north of coleman was first selected later changed to south in 1973 to avoid developed residential areas on north side of coleman by end of decade both province and local municipality had endorsed route in mid 1980s municipality asked province to reconsider a route further to north of coleman but it was deemed to be at an unacceptable grade alignment to south of coleman and sentinel planned in 1970s remains preferred option for future upgrading crowsnest highway reconstruction of highway 3 to a modern standard with shoulders continued in 1970s a segment from medicine hat to west of severn persons was completed in 1973 with grading for another 21 7 km west of seven persons done in 1974 several local social credit party members of legislative assembly mla expressed dissatisfaction with rate at which work was progressing and reasoning given by highways minister clarence he cited a labour shortage and fact that provincial funds were being spread across multiple projects and also fact that drivers should not be subjected to overly lengthy construction zones mlas disagreed saying that alberta s oil and gas revenue should be enough to expedite highway 3 work and that their constituents preferred for work to be done sooner even if it meant longer stretches of road would be under construction at a given time thumb crowsnest highway ends at trans canada highway northeast of medicine hat airport a group of southern albertans called crowsnest highway 3 association met annually in 1970s with intent of promoting highway and advocating to provincial government for improvements group included local officials and residents who advertised highway 3 as a rival to trans canada highway and a more scenic route between prairies and west coast their efforts proved worthwhile to attract travellers who might better identify with a route that has only one name alberta officially renamed highway 3 as crowsnest highway 3 in 1977 with british columbia following suit for their portion through to hope members of association collaborated with government on new highway shields a sign that denotes designated number of highway they began to appear in both provinces by end of decade british columbia had its own shield and in alberta two versions of shield were initially erected a white number 3 on a crow background within shield and a more standard alberta highway shield with usual black number on a white background but with a crow perched on top peering down at number first variant prevailed and remains unchanged through 2010s long term planning for a highway 3 expressway was on going near end of decade with minor changes to two lane route near bc border in late 1970s at their 1979 meeting in lethbridge association pushed for wider recognition and advertisement of crowsnest route in tourism offices across canada and also hoped for crowsnest moniker to be expanded to include trans canada highway from medicine hat to saskatchewan border they would later create a 16 page brochure that highlighted points of interest along crowsnest highway en route to expo 86 a world s fair held in vancouver in october 1986 again presenting it as a better alternative to trans canada highway in 1979 a group similarly lobbied for a named highway across southern prairies including alberta highway 501 and saskatchewan highway 13 crowsnest efforts were used as an example of traffic that could be brought to a route when it has a cohesive name thumb left looking west along future crowsnest trail corridor in lethbridge in 1964 lethbridge realignment prior to construction of crowsnest trail expressway in lethbridge highway crossed oldman river then curved south underneath high level bridge following portions of 1 avenue and 3 avenue downtown after several years of planning a 50 million realignment of highway 3 through centre of city was presented to city council by calgary engineers in september 1981 receiving favourable comments new corridor was designated as one of several major continuous corridors in province it involved construction of a new four lane expressway from 43 street to existing highway 3 on east bank of oldman river between north and west lethbridge and new interchanges at 5 avenue n and scenic drive relocation of a canadian pacific railway yard from downtown lethbridge was required it was moved to kipp west of coalhurst construction was estimated to be completed by 1985 with province paying for 90 of project and city covering remaining 10 land acquisition was to cost between 2 and 12 million work began in 1983 and was completed in 1986 interchanges were constructed on crowsnest trail at stafford drive 13 street and mayor magrath drive at a cost of more than 50 million monarch interchange before four lane bypass south of monarch across oldman river was constructed highway 3 passed through monarch and crossed river southwest of town on a bridge built in 1957 this stretch is now designated as highway 3a interchange at highway 3a then highway 3 and highway 23 near monarch was completed in 1984 highway 23 had been shifted slightly west to eliminate two 90deg bends in route near new interchange was initially criticized for being confusing causing many drivers to make wrong turns counter intuitively traffic continuing westbound through interchange on highway 3 exited to right passing underneath highway 23 southbound traffic on highway 23 turning west onto highway 3 had to turn left across westbound lanes to access aforementioned single lane ramp macleod mla leroy promised improved signage and lighting for interchange in early 1984 fort macleod mayor wes olmstead was concerned that interchange along with upgrades of highways 519 and 520 encouraged northbound traffic to use highway 23 instead of continuing west to his community and using highway 2 towns of pincher creek and nanton had similar concerns about diversion of traffic caused by new interchange transport minister henry kroeger disagreed and thought concerns were unwarranted of fort macleod he stated town won t disappear as a result of interchange alberta had long term plans for highway 23 to be twinned and for monarch interchange to be expanded to a partial cloverleaf possibility of a southern monarch bypass had already been identified by mid 1980s an announcement for construction of passing lanes on two lane highway 3 between monarch and fort macleod came in 1985 though fort macleod mayor olmstead stated project was simply delaying inevitable twinning that would be required for route he remained concerned about loss of traffic to his community caused by monarch interchange and was confident that twinning of highways 2 and 3 would offset loss twinning of both routes continued in late 1980s export highway and east twinning thumb highway 3 between fort macleod and lethbridge is a part of a north south trade corridor in alberta that connects alaska to mexico alberta continues work to upgrade entire corridor to a divided highway a bypass of blairmore was completed in october 1983 after more than a year of construction highway was formerly routed down main street of community 20 avenue at a reduced speed limit at east end of blairmore a new bridge over crowsnest river was constructed and highway curves north around community before rejoining existing alignment west of town 3 9 million project was estimated to save almost 15 minutes of driving time through blairmore alberta transportation estimated that work on a coleman bypass would likely proceed within five years but this did not come to fruition in 1989 alberta announced plans to twin entire length of export highway a name given to southern portion of alberta s north south trade corridor that includes highway 2 from calgary to fort macleod highway 3 between fort macleod and lethbridge and entire length of highway 4 from lethbridge to united states border plan was for highway 2 to be twinned first followed by highway 3 then 4 highway 3 required twinning only from fort macleod to monarch as remainder to lethbridge had already been completed work included construction of two new steel bridges over oldman river in 1996 which formed a bypass to south of monarch former alignment of highway through monarch was re designated as highway 3a relegating previously controversial interchange at highway 23 to service of local monarch traffic travellers continuing west on highway 3 toward fort macleod from lethbridge no longer had to exit highway and reduce their speed to navigate a single lane ramp and were not at risk of missing exit and accidentally proceeding north on highway 23 toward vulcan twinning on highway 3 west of monarch continued into 1997 and was completed at a cost of 31 million though alberta had prioritized export highway twinning work was also progressing east of coaldale in mid 1990s alberta transportation minister steve west announced in 1995 that barnwell would not be bypassed and twinned highway would instead continue on its existing alignment through centre of village at a reduced speed limit some members of community opposed decision citing increased vehicular safety of recommended bypass alignment south of village and a safer environment for pedestrians who would not have to cross highway traffic representatives from barnwell acknowledged that bypassing town might be detrimental to growth of community local mla ron stated that residents who lived north of old highway were in favour of bypass being constructed to south of town while residents on south side preferred alignment through centre of town amidst controversy decision was later reversed by west and twinned highway 3 was constructed south of barnwell with former alignment designated as highway 3a after a slight delay in 1995 twinning continued in 1996 and had been completed to cranford by end of 1997 and to taber by end of decade in 1999 infrastructure minister ed stelmach stated that twinning remainder of highway from taber to medicine hat was not a priority despite pleas from local officials future alberta transportation has long term plans to upgrade entire length of highway 3 to a freeway requiring major bypasses of fort macleod and lethbridge proposed route for lethbridge bypass would split from highway 3 west of coalhurst running north past town to a new interchange at highway 25 it would continue east across oldman river on new bridges bypassing lethbridge to reach a newly extended highway 4 temporarily designated as highway 4x northeast of lethbridge it would rejoin existing highway east of chin a freeway upgrade of crowsnest trail was considered but would require extensive reconstruction and demolition within corridor through lethbridge and twinning of existing bridge across oldman river city of lethbridge expressed their disapproval of this alignment eliminating it early in study process left upright 1 1 thumb proposed realignment of highways 3 and 4 in lethbridge highlighted in red a functional planning study was completed in 2008 to identify optimal alignment for fort macleod bypass preferred alignment has new highway 3 temporarily designated as highway 3x splitting southeast from existing highway 3 west of intersection with highway 810 it would meet a newly extended highway 2 at an interchange southwest of fort macleod before continuing to a second interchange with existing two lane section of highway 2 between fort macleod and cardston stage 1 of project would include only highway 2 bypass with extension to highway 3 west of highway 810 completed in stage 2 a medicine hat bypass of trans canada highway highway 1 is also proposed which would involve construction of a large interchange with directional flyovers at highway 3 and newly realigned highway 1 southwest of medicine hat a 2004 study assessed reduction of accesses to highways 3 and 36 in taber as a stopgap measure until a bypass of town is constructed highway 3 currently has a speed limit of and seven at grade intersections in taber in april 2008 alberta transportation published a study analyzing twinning and potential changes to alignments of highways 3 and 6 in vicinity of pincher creek including construction of a diamond interchange at highway 6 residents who could be affected by changed routes were consulted as part of study in 2010 a study plotted routing of a bypass to north of seven persons with plans for a diamond interchange at highway 887 a 2013 study identified preferred alignment for a freeway bypass of burdett and bow island likely to be operated as a divided expressway until freeway is completed long term both towns would be bypassed to south with an interchange constructed at highway 879 major intersections see also crowsnest
