thumb 300px right alt photograph bradford colliery c 1947 bradford colliery was a coal mine in bradford manchester england although part of manchester coalfield seams of bradford coalfield correspond more closely to those of oldham coalfield bradford coalfield is crossed by a number of fault lines principally bradford fault which was reactivated by mining activity in mid 1960s coal had been mined at bradford since at least early 17th century when area around pits was largely rural it became increasingly built up and industrialised as nearby manchester expanded during 19th century coal was transported from colliery by canal and railway but most was consumed locally by adjacent bradford ironworks in mid 20th century a 469 yard 420 m tunnel was dug to supply coal directly to stuart street power station damage to buildings in area around colliery caused by subsidence led to it becoming uneconomic despite its sitting on large reserves of high quality coal and it was closed in 1968 site was cleared and is now occupied by city of manchester stadium geology bradford coalfield is isolated from rest of manchester coalfield its coal seams laid down in carboniferous period dip at an average of 1 in 3 towards south and correspond more closely with those of oldham coalfield upper coal measures above worsley four foot mine horizon were worked at bradford where worsley four foot is known as parker mine two foot doctor new yard bradford four foot three quarters and charlotte mines above parker mine are known as bradford group charlotte mine is closest to surface openshaw mine above charlotte was worked for fireclay below bradford group and parker mine are top middle and deep mines and below them roger mine top middle and deep mines correspond to major bland and ashton great mines in oldham coalfield crombouke mine in western coalfield corresponds to roger mine at bradford colliery in total workable seams contained 310 million long tons 347 million short tons of coal bradford coalfield is crossed by a number of fault lines principally bradford fault extraction of coal caused that fault to reactivate in 1960s resulting in a scarp that seriously damaged crompton hall a residential complex built in early 20th century building was subsequently demolished early history colliery was situated south of ashton canal built in 1797 and north of ashton new road a short arm of canal now filled in was built to colliery from between lock no 6 and lock no 7 beswick lock coal has been mined at bradford since at least early 17th century when endeavour could be very profitable albeit with significant financial risk thomas is recorded as having invested ps300 in his bradford colliery during reign of king james i 1603 1624 equivalent to more than ps500 000 as of 2009 at about that time seams at bradford were producing about 10 000 long tons 11 200 short tons of coal a year and probably an average of 20 000 30 000 long tons 22 400 33 600 short tons a year over course of 17th century early mines were shallow exploiting seams close to surface of what was a largely rural area until growth of nearby manchester colliery records date from 1740 when oswald mosley of ancoats hall granted a 200 year lease of mining rights first shaft for a deep colliery was sunk in 1840 by 1856 colliery was in ownership of thomas livesey and had two diameter shafts to parker mine at a depth of providing ventilation colliery became known as bradford colliery company and by 1896 employed 404 underground and 125 surface workers producing house coal and coal for manufacturing from parker mine high price of coal at end of 19th century persuaded newly created fine cotton spinners and association to mitigate effects on its members by purchasing colliery in 1900 thus ensuring a cheap supply of fuel for their steam powered mills expansion new owners embarked on a programme of expansion and installed one of earliest electrical plants at any colliery in 1900 a sirocco type ventilation fan made by hick hargreaves which could be powered by either electricity or steam was provided deepening downcast shaft to access deep mine at started in 1903 and coal was reached in 1906 a massive timber headgear was built over downcast shaft and a twin cylinder vertical winding engine built by robert daglish of st helens installed in engine house coal tubs holding 10 cwt of coal were wound six at a time in double deck cages shaft was used for winding men and had a smaller horizontal winding engine an earlier shaft at forge pit was deep and used for pumping water from workings a windlass was used for winding at this shaft by end of 19th century colliery site had become crowded and included a brickworks that used fireclay and shale spoil from pit it was surrounded by housing and factories in what was one of most industrial parts of manchester ready supply of coal encouraged development of manchester s chemical industry around colliery and in northeast of city generally a factory producing carbolic acid from coal tar was established in 1857 and sulphuric acid and naphthalene were produced from 1865 in nearby blackley later site of ici s dyestuff s division coal was transported by canal and a railway connection to lancashire and yorkshire railway s beswick branch built in early 1900s but most of it was used locally transported by road using horse and carts and motor lorries much of it destined for adjacent bradford ironworks company bought a 0 4 0 saddle tank locomotive bradford from avonside engine company of bristol in 1928 to shunt wagons to colliery siding later years in 1935 colliery was acquired by manchester collieries it had large reserves of high quality coal in roger mine below seams already exploited and although mines dipped steeply was a dry and relatively gas free pit manchester collieries initially improved coal screening but had plans to develop colliery and maximise output to 4000 long tons 4480 short tons per day involving complete replacement of surface works parker shaft was deepened to between 1944 and 1948 and winding installed to accommodate 12 long ton 13 44 short ton capacity skips transport of coal underground was improved by installation of three ton mine cars hauled by a battery powered locomotive and a system of conveyors a reinforced concrete winding tower was built to house a type friction wheel built by metropolitan vickers thumb longwall mining a new headgear and winding engine were built at deep pit shaft ventilation was by means of two axial type fans installed in an underground chamber after 1947 a tunnel below ground level was driven to stuart street power station to provide coal direct from colliery a conveyor within tunnel delivered 200 long tons 224 short tons of small coal an hour to power station s bunker most of developments begun by manchester collieries were completed after nationalisation in 1947 by national coal board ncb after modernisation and reconstruction coal was extracted by longwall mining using coal cutting machinery and conveyors this type of mining creates a void or goaf into which roof is allowed to collapse at bradford which had no spoil heap goaf was infilled with spoil or waste as there was insufficient spoil to fill void some was brought from other pits ncb incorporated takes or coal reserves of moston and ashton moss collieries into redeveloped bradford colliery moston was closed but shafts of ashton moss were retained for winding men and equipment closure by mid 1960s it was apparent that considerable subsidence was being caused by mining in built up area of manchester around bradford colliery many buildings were affected particularly in bradford and miles platting where in 1962 eleven council houses were so severely damaged they had to be demolished government approved an order restricting mining operations and ordered an enquiry to determine whether mining should continue unhindered and if not whether compensation for loss of production should be paid for first time ncb required planning permission to mine under city of manchester ncb gave evidence to enquiry in 1966 stating that for each ton of coal extracted from colliery 5s 2d had to be paid out in compensation for surface damage highest for any pit in region contrasted with a national average of 6d per ton ncb s plans for colliery included extending mines beneath cheetham and ancoats but risk of causing yet more subsidence proved to be unacceptable therefore despite sitting on vast reserves of premium coal bradford colliery was closed in 1968 as being uneconomic in its final year of operation 1500 workers employed produced 530 298 long tons 593 933 short tons of coal site renamed eastlands was cleared and its two deep shafts capped with reinforced concrete in a scheme costing ps8 million before redevelopment part of site is now occupied by city of manchester stadium incidents francis taylor is first recorded fatality at colliery killed by a roof fall at bradford coal pitt in 1622 although mines were relatively gas free there were nevertheless some gas related incidents one collier working by light of a candle in 1874 died from burns received in an explosion of firedamp in 1907 a miner died in a incident when gas exploded as a fuse was lit in 1924 a number of tubs transporting miners being hauled to surface derailed and dislodged a pit prop causing a roof collapse known locally as a crump three men were killed and nine injured heat from a fire in main winding engine house in 1953 caused winding cables to snap sending two coal carrying cages crashing to bottom of main shaft and trapping 350 men underground all managed to reach a smaller shaft away and were subsequently brought
