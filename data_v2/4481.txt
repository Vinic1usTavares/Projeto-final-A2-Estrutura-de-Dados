hastati singular hastatus were a class of infantry employed in armies of early roman republic who originally fought as spearmen and later as swordsmen these soldiers were staple unit after rome threw off etruscan rule they were originally some of poorest men in legion and could afford only modest equipment light chainmail and other miscellaneous equipment senate supplied their soldiers with only a short stabbing sword gladius and their distinctive squared shield scutum hastatus was typically equipped with these and one or two soft iron tipped throwing spears called pila this doubled their effectiveness not only as a strong leading edge to their maniple but also as a stand alone missile troop later hastati contained younger men rather than just poorer though most men of their age were relatively poor their usual position was first battle line they fought in a quincunx formation supported by lighter infantry enemy was allowed to penetrate first battle line consisting of hastati after which enemy would deal with more hardened seasoned soldiers principes they were eventually disbanded after marian reforms of 107 bc history and deployment thumb left formation and alignment of hastati hastati appear to have been remnants of old third class of army under etruscan kings when it was reformed by marcus furius camillus third class stood in last few ranks of a very large phalanx and were equipped in a similar manner to hastati although they were more often than not relegated to providing missile support to higher classes rather than fighting themselves penrose and southern postulate that it is probable that engagements with samnites and a crushing defeat at hands of gallic warlord brennus who both used lots of smaller military units rather than a few very large ones taught romans importance of flexibility and inadequacy of phalanx on rough hilly ground of central italy camillan system by 4th century bc military romans had inherited from etruscans was still being used though its efficiency was doubtful it proved effective against rome s largely local adversaries when gauls invaded etruria in 390 bc inhabitants requested help from rome small contingent rome sent to repel gallic invaders provoked a full scale attack on rome entire roman army was destroyed at battle of allia in a crushing defeat that prompted reforms by marcus furius camillus under new system men were sorted into classes based on wealth hastati were third poorest with rorarii being slightly poorer and principes slightly wealthier hastati were armed with short spears or hastae up to 1 8 metres 6 ft long from which soldiers acquired their name they fought in a quincunx formation usually carrying scuta large rectangular shields and wearing bronze helmets often with a number of feathers fixed onto top to increase stature they wore light armour most common form being small breastplates called heart protectors in this type of legion 900 hastati formed 15 maniples military units of 60 men each attached to each maniple were about 20 leves javelin armed light infantry hastati stood in first battle line in front of principes of second line and triarii of third in a pitched battle leves would form up at front of legion and harass enemy with their javelins to cover advance of hastati if hastati failed to break enemy during their engagement they would fall back and let heavier principes take over if principes could not break them they would retire behind triarii spearmen who would then engage enemy in turn equites cavalrymen were used as flankers and to pursue routed enemies rorarii and accensi in final battle line were some of least dependable troops and were used in a support role providing mass and reinforcing wavering areas of line polybian system by time of punic wars of 3rd century bc camillan organisational system had been found to be inefficient under a new polybian system infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth with hastati being youngest and least experienced their equipment and role was very similar to that which existed under previous system except they now carried swords or gladii instead of spears each hastatus also carried two pila heavy javelins that according to goldsworthy contrary to deeply entrenched myth did not bend on impact to make any struck shield useless or prevent weapon from being thrown back weight and barb alone sufficiently hampered any struck shield often penetrating shield to hit man behind it and iron was sufficiently hard that pila were often used as hand held spears against both infantry and cavalry by time volley of pila had reached enemy line usually only fifteen yards distant for best effect legionaries were charging and very quickly at work with their swords there was rarely any time for foe to find a pilum pull it out of whatever it had hit and throw it back hastati had been increased in number to 1 200 per legion and formed 10 maniples of 120 men each rorarii and accensi had been disbanded leves had been replaced with velites who had a similar role but were now also attached to principes and triarii pitched battles were conducted in a similar fashion velites would gather at front and fling javelins to cover advance of hastati if hastati failed to break enemy they would fall back on principes who had also been re armed with swords if principes could not break them they would retire behind triarii who would then engage enemy this order of battle was almost always followed battle of great plains and battle of zama being among few notable exceptions at great plains scipio roman general formed his men up in usual manner but once hastati had begun to engage enemy he used his principes and triarii as a flanking force routing opposing carthaginian troops at zama scipio arranged his men into columns side by side with large lanes in between opposing carthaginian elephants were drawn into these lanes where many were killed by velites without inflicting many casualties on romans once surviving elephants had been routed scipio formed his men into a long line with his triarii and principes in centre and hastati on flanks ready to engage carthaginian infantry marian reforms with formal military reforms of gaius marius in 107 bc intended to combat a shortage of manpower from wars against jugurtha king of numidia in north africa and germanic tribes to north different classes of units were disbanded entirely wealth and age requirements were scrapped instead it was decreed that soldiers would join legion as a career rather than as service to city and would all be equipped as heavy infantry with same state purchased equipment auxiliaries local irregular troops would fulfill other roles
