thylacine or also thylacine dictionary com unabridged v 1 1 random house inc 30 may 2009 from ancient greek thulakos thulakos pouch sack latin inus ine thylacinus cynocephalus now extinct is one of largest known carnivorous marsupials evolving about 4 million years ago last known live animal was captured in 1933 in tasmania it is commonly known as tasmanian tiger because of its striped lower back or tasmanian wolf because of its canid like characteristics as well as common alternative names thylacine was referred to by a range of other names which often makes clear identification of species in historical records difficult other names by which it is occasionally identified include marsupial wolf marsupial hyena zebra wolf kangaroo wolf zebra opossum marsupial tiger tiger cat tasmanian pouched wolf and hyena opossum it was native to tasmania new guinea and australian mainland thylacine was relatively shy and nocturnal with general appearance of a medium to large size dog except for its stiff tail and abdominal pouch similar to a kangaroo and dark transverse stripes that radiated from top of its back reminiscent of a tiger thylacine was a formidable apex predator paddle 2000 though exactly how large its prey animals were is disputed because of convergent evolution it displayed a form and adaptations similar to tiger and wolf of northern hemisphere even though not related its closest living relative is either tasmanian devil or thylacine was one of only two marsupials to have a pouch in both sexes other is water opossum pouch of male thylacine served as a protective sheath covering external reproductive organs thylacine had become extinct on australian mainland before british settlement of continent but it survived on island of tasmania along with several other endemic species including tasmanian devil intensive hunting encouraged by bounties is generally blamed for its extinction but other contributing factors may have been disease introduction of dogs and human encroachment into its habitat taxonomy thumb tasmanian devil and thylacine both labelled as members of didelphis from harris 1808 description this is earliest known non indigenous illustration of a thylacine numerous examples of thylacine engravings and rock art have been found dating back to at least 1000 bc petroglyph images of thylacine can be found at dampier rock art precinct on peninsula in western australia by time first european explorers arrived animal was already extinct in mainland australia and rare in tasmania europeans may have encountered it in tasmania as far back as 1642 when abel tasman first arrived in tasmania his shore party reported seeing footprints of wild beasts having claws like a tyger d 1682 a short relation out of journal of captain abel jansen tasman upon discovery of south terra incognita not long since published in low dutch philosophical collections of royal society of london 6 179 186 quoted in paddle 2000 p 3 marc

positive identification of thylacine as animal encountered cannot be made from this report since tiger quoll dasyurus maculatus is similarly described first definitive encounter was by french explorers on 13 may 1792 as noted by naturalist jacques labillardiere in his journal from expedition led by d entrecasteaux in 1805 william paterson lieutenant governor of tasmania sent a detailed description for publication in sydney gazette paddle 2000 p 3 he also sent a description of thylacine in a letter to joseph banks dated 30 march 1805 description of a tasmanian tiger received by banks from william paterson 30 march 1805 n d sir joseph banks papers state library of new south wales safe banks papers series 27 33 first detailed scientific description was made by tasmania s deputy surveyor general george harris in 1808 five years after first european settlement of island harris originally placed thylacine in genus didelphis which had been created by linnaeus for american opossums describing it as didelphis dog headed opossum recognition that australian marsupials were fundamentally different from known mammal genera led to establishment of modern classification scheme and in 1796 geoffroy saint hilaire created genus dasyurus where he placed thylacine in 1810 to resolve mixture of greek and latin nomenclature species name was altered to cynocephalus in 1824 it was separated out into its own genus thylacinus by temminck paddle 2000 p 5 common name derives directly from genus name originally from greek thulakos meaning pouch or sack evolution upright thumb skulls of thylacine left and timber wolf canis lupus are quite similar although species are only distantly related studies show that skull shape of red fox vulpes vulpes is even closer to that of thylacine modern thylacine probably appeared about 2 million years ago during early pleistocene pliocene aged specimens from pliocene aged chinchilla fauna described as thylacinus by charles de vis in 1894 is now attributed to this species b s et al confirmation of thylacinus from pliocene chinchilla local fauna australian mammalogy 24 2 2002 237 242 species of family date back to beginning of miocene since early 1990s at least seven fossil species have been uncovered at part of lawn hill national park in northwest queensland dickson s thylacine is oldest of seven discovered fossil species dating back to 23 million years ago this was much smaller than its more recent relatives largest species powerful thylacine thylacinus which grew to size of a wolf was only species to survive into late miocene in late pleistocene and early holocene times modern thylacine was widespread although never numerous throughout australia and new guinea an example of convergent evolution thylacine showed many similarities to members of dog family canidae of northern hemisphere sharp teeth powerful jaws raised heels and same general body form since thylacine filled same ecological niche in australia as dog family did elsewhere it developed many of same features despite this as a marsupial it is unrelated to any of northern hemisphere placental mammal predators thylacine is a basal member of along with numbats and quolls cladogram follows description thumb stuffed specimen in madrid only recorded species of thylacinus a genus that resembles dogs and foxes of canidae family animal was a predatory marsupial that existed on mainland australia during holocene epoch and observed by europeans on island of tasmania species is known as tasmanian tiger for striped markings of pelage descriptions of thylacine come from preserved specimens fossil records skins and skeletal remains and black and white photographs and film of animal both in captivity and from field thylacine resembled a large short haired dog with a stiff tail which smoothly extended from body in a way similar to that of a kangaroo mature thylacine ranged from long plus a tail of around adults stood about at shoulder and weighed there was slight sexual dimorphism with males being larger than females on average thumb thumbtime 2 45 all known australian footage of live thylacines shot in hobart zoo tasmania in 1911 1928 and 1933 two other films are known shot in london zoo thylacines uniquely for marsupials have largely cartilaginous epipubic bones with a highly reduced osseous element ronald m nowak walker s marsupials of world jhu press 12 09 2005 this has been once considered a synapomorphy with marshall l evolution of extinct south american predaceous marsupials berkeley university of california press 1978 though its now thought that both groups reduced their independently its yellow brown coat featured 15 to 20 distinctive dark stripes across its back rump and base of its tail which earned animal nickname tiger stripes were more pronounced in younger specimens fading as animal got older one of stripes extended down outside of rear thigh its body hair was dense and soft up to in length colouration varied from light fawn to a dark brown belly was cream coloured its rounded erect ears were about long and covered with short fur early scientific studies suggested it possessed an acute sense of smell which enabled it to track prey but analysis of its brain structure revealed that its olfactory bulbs were not well developed it is likely to have relied on sight and sound when hunting instead thylacine was able to open its jaws to an unusual extent up to 80 degrees this capability can be seen in part in david fleay s short black and white film sequence of a captive thylacine from 1933 jaws were muscular and had 46 teeth but studies show thylacine jaw was too weak to kill sheep tasmanian tiger s jaw was too small to attack sheep study shows science daily 1 september 2011 tasmanian tiger was no sheep killer abc science 1 september 2011 tail vertebrae were fused to a degree with resulting restriction of full tail movement fusion may have occurred as animal reached full maturity tail tapered towards tip in juveniles tip of tail had a ridge female thylacine had a pouch with four teats but unlike many other marsupials pouch opened to rear of its body males had a scrotal pouch unique amongst australian marsupials scrotal pouch is almost unique within marsupials only other marsupial species to have this feature is water opossum minimus which is found in mexico central and south america into which they could withdraw their scrotal sac for protection thumb right thylacine s footprint is easy to distinguish from those of native and introduced species thylacine footprints could be distinguished from other native or introduced animals unlike foxes cats dogs wombats or tasmanian devils thylacines had a very large rear pad and four obvious front pads arranged in almost a straight line hindfeet were similar to forefeet but had four digits rather than five their claws were non retractable more detail can be seen in a cast taken from a freshly dead thylacine cast shows plantar pad in more detail and shows that plantar pad is tri in that it exhibits three distinctive lobes it is a single plantar pad divided by three deep grooves distinctive plantar pad shape along with asymmetrical nature of foot makes it quite different from animals such as dogs or foxes this cast dates back to early 1930s and is part of museum of victoria s thylacine collection some observers described it having a strong and distinctive smell others described a faint clean animal odour and some no odour at all it is possible that thylacine like its relative tasmanian devil gave off an odour when agitated paddle 2000 p 49 thylacine was noted as having a stiff and somewhat awkward gait making it unable to run at high speed it could also perform a bipedal hop in a fashion similar to a kangaroo demonstrated at various times by captive specimens guiler speculates that this was used as an accelerated form of motion when animal became alarmed animal was also able to balance on its hind legs and stand upright for brief periods observers of animal in wild and in captivity noted that it would growl and hiss when agitated often accompanied by a threat yawn during hunting it would emit a series of rapidly repeated guttural cough like barks described as yip yap cay yip or hop hop hop probably for communication between family pack members it also had a long whining cry probably for identification at distance and a low noise used for communication between family members paddle 2000 pp 65 66 distribution and habitat thumb thylacine rock art at thylacine probably preferred dry eucalyptus forests wetlands and grasslands of mainland australia indigenous australian rock paintings indicate that thylacine lived throughout mainland australia and new guinea proof of animal s existence in mainland australia came from a desiccated carcass that was discovered in a cave in nullarbor plain in western australia in 1990 carbon dating revealed it to be around 3 300 years old recently examined fossilised footprints also suggest historical distribution of species on kangaroo island t 2017 fossil footprints reveal kangaroo island s diverse ancient wildlife abc net news retrieved on july 24 2017 in tasmania it preferred woodlands of midlands and coastal heath which eventually became primary focus of british settlers seeking grazing land for their livestock striped pattern may have provided camouflage in woodland conditions but it may have also served for identification purposes paddle 2000 pp 42 43 animal had a typical home range of between it appears to have kept to its home range without being territorial groups too large to be a family unit were sometimes observed together paddle 2000 pp 38 39 ecology and behaviour thumb one

zoo in hobart 1910 little is known about behaviour of thylacine a few observations were made of animal in captivity but only limited anecdotal evidence exists of animal s behaviour in wild most observations were made during day whereas thylacine was naturally nocturnal those observations made in twentieth century may have been atypical as they were of a species already under stresses that would soon lead to its extinction some behavioural characteristics have been extrapolated from behaviour of its close relative tasmanian devil thylacine was a nocturnal and crepuscular hunter spending daylight hours in small caves or hollow tree trunks in a nest of twigs bark or fern fronds it tended to retreat to hills and forest for shelter during day and hunted in open heath at night early observers noted that animal was typically shy and secretive with awareness of presence of humans and generally avoiding contact though it occasionally showed inquisitive traits at time much stigma existed in regard to its fierce nature this is likely to be due to its perceived threat to agriculture tasmanian tigers brought to life australian geographic 24 february 2011 breeding there is evidence for at least some year round breeding cull records show discovered in pouch at all times of year although peak breeding season was in winter and spring they would produce up to four cubs per litter typically two or three carrying young in a pouch for up to three months and protecting them until they were at least half adult size early pouch young were hairless and blind but they had their eyes open and were fully furred by time they left pouch after leaving pouch and until they were developed enough to assist juveniles would remain in lair while their mother hunted paddle 2000 p 60 thylacines only once bred successfully in captivity in melbourne zoo in 1899 paddle 2000 pp 228 231 their life expectancy in wild is estimated to have been 5 to 7 years although captive specimens survived up to 9 years in 2018 newton et al collected and ct scanned all known preserved thylacine pouch young specimens to digitally reconstruct its development throughout its entire window of growth in mother s pouch this study revealed new information on biology of thylacine including growth of its limbs and when it developed its dog like appearance it was found that two of thylacine young in tasmanian museum and art gallery were misidentified and of another species reducing number of known pouch young specimens to 11 worldwide feeding and diet thumb analysis of skeleton suggests that when hunting thylacine relied on stamina rather than speed in chase thylacine was carnivorous prey is believed to have included kangaroos wallabies and wombats birds and small animals such as and possums one prey animal may have been once common tasmanian emu some writers go further to postulate that mature thylacine s jaw and bipedal hop were specialised for hunting emu and either breaking its neck or severing jugular vein emu was a large flightless bird which shared habitat of thylacine and was hunted to extinction by humans around 1850 possibly coinciding with decline in thylacine numbers paddle 2000 pp 81 both dingoes and foxes have been noted to hunt emu on mainland european settlers believed thylacine to prey upon farmers sheep and poultry based on lack of reliable first hand accounts robert paddle argues that predation on sheep and poultry may have been exaggerated suggesting thylacine was used as a convenient scapegoat for mismanagement of sheep farms and image of it as a poultry killer impressed on public consciousness by a striking photo taken by henry burrell in 1921 paddle 2000 pp 79 138 throughout 20th century thylacine was often characterised as primarily a blood drinker according to robert paddle story s popularity seems to have originated from a single second hand account heard by geoffrey smith 1881 1916 smith geoffrey watkins 1909 a naturalist in tasmania clarendon press oxford smith geoffrey watkins com in a shepherd s hut paddle 2000 pp 29 35 there is some controversy over preferred prey size of thylacine a 2011 study by university of new south wales using advanced computer modelling indicated that thylacine had surprisingly feeble jaws animals usually take prey close to their own body size but an adult thylacine of around was found to be incapable of handling prey much larger than thus some researchers believe thylacines only ate small animals such as bandicoots and possums putting them into direct competition with tasmanian devil and tiger quoll however an earlier study showed that thylacine had a bite force quotient of 166 similar to that of most quolls in modern mammalian predators such a high bite force is almost always associated with predators which routinely take prey as large or larger than themselves if thylacine was indeed specialised for small prey this specialisation likely made it susceptible to small disturbances to ecosystem analysis of skeletal frame and observations of thylacine in captivity suggest that it preferred to single out a target animal and pursue that animal until it was exhausted a pursuit predator however trappers reported it as an ambush predator animal may have hunted in small family groups with main group herding prey in general direction of an individual waiting in ambush although living grey wolf is widely seen as thylacine s counterpart thylacine may have been more of an ambush predator as opposed to a pursuit predator in fact predatory behaviour of thylacine was probably closer to ambushing felids than to large pursuit canids its stomach was muscular and could distend to allow animal to eat large amounts of food at one time probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods when hunting was unsuccessful and food scarce in captivity thylacines were fed a wide variety of foods including dead rabbits and wallabies as well as beef mutton horse and occasionally poultry paddle 2000 p 96 there is a report of a captive thylacine which refused to eat dead wallaby flesh or to kill and eat a live wallaby offered to it but ultimately it was persuaded to eat by having smell of blood from a freshly killed wallaby put before its nose paddle 2000 p 32 in 2017 berns and ashwell published comparative cortical maps of thylacine and tasmanian devil brains showing that thylacine had a larger more basal ganglion authors associated these differences with thylacine s predatory lifestyle same year white mitchell and austin published a large scale analysis of thylacine mitochondrial genomes showing that they had split into eastern and western populations on mainland prior to last glacial maximum and had low genetic diversity by time of european arrival relationship with humans captivity by beginning of 20th century increasing rarity of thylacines led to increased demand for captive specimens by zoos around world department of environment 2018 thylacinus cynocephalus in species profile and threats database department of environment canberra retrieved 7 april 2018 despite export of breeding pairs these were unsuccessful and last thylacine outside australia died at london zoo in 1931 hunt for london s thylacines shows a greater truth about australian extinction conversation 6 april 2018 retrieved 7 april 2018 extinction in australian mainland thumb bagged thylacine 1869 australia lost more than 90 of its larger terrestrial vertebrates by around 40 thousand years ago with notable exceptions of kangaroo and thylacine a 2010 paper examining this issue showed that humans were likely to be one of major factors in extinction of many species in australia with climate change and bushfire activity playing facilitating roles although authors of research warned that one factor explanations might be thylacine itself likely neared extinction throughout most of its range in mainland australia by about 2 000 years ago however reliable accounts of thylacine survival in south australia though confined to thinly settled districts and flinders ranges and new south wales blue mountains exist from as late as 1830s from both indigenous and european sources paddle 2000 pp 23 24 a study proposes that arrival of dingoes may have led to extinction of tasmanian devil thylacine and tasmanian nativehen in mainland australia because dingo might have competed with thylacine and devil in preying on native hen however study also proposes that an increase in human population that gathered pace around 4 000 years ago may have led to this however a counter argument is that two species were not in direct competition with one another because dingo primarily hunts during day whereas it is thought that thylacine hunted mostly at night nonetheless recent morphological examinations of dingo and thylacine skulls show that although dingo had a weaker bite its skull could resist greater stresses allowing it to pull down larger prey than thylacine thylacine was less versatile in its diet than omnivorous dingo their ranges appear to have overlapped because thylacine subfossil remains have been discovered near those of dingoes adoption of dingo as a hunting companion by indigenous peoples would have put thylacine under increased pressure thumb right this 1921 photo by henry burrell of a thylacine with a chicken was widely distributed and may have helped secure animal s reputation as a poultry thief in fact image is cropped to hide fenced run and housing and analysis by one researcher has concluded that this thylacine is a mounted specimen posed for camera extinction in tasmania although thylacine was extinct on mainland australia it survived into 1930s on island state of tasmania at time of first european settlement heaviest distributions were in northeast northwest and north midland regions of state they were rarely sighted during this time but slowly began to be credited with numerous attacks on sheep this led to establishment of bounty schemes in an attempt to control their numbers van diemen s land company introduced bounties on thylacine from as early as 1830 and between 1888 and 1909 tasmanian government paid ps1 per head equivalent of ps100 or more today for dead adult thylacines and ten shillings for pups in all they paid out 2 184 bounties but it is thought that many more thylacines were killed than were claimed for its extinction is popularly attributed to these relentless efforts by farmers and bounty hunters however it is likely that multiple factors led to its decline and eventual extinction including competition with wild dogs introduced by european settlers erosion of its habitat concurrent extinction of prey species and a distemper like disease that affected many captive specimens at time paddle 2000 pp 202 203 a study from 2012 also found that were it not for an epidemiological influence extinction of thylacine would have been at best prevented at worst postponed chance of saving species through changing public opinion and re establishment of captive breeding could have been possible but carnivore disease with its dramatic effect on individual thylacine longevity and juvenile mortality came far too soon and spread far too quickly whatever reason animal had become extremely rare in wild by late 1920s despite fact that thylacine was believed by many to be responsible for attacks on sheep in 1928 tasmanian advisory committee for native fauna recommended a reserve similar to savage river national park to protect any remaining thylacines with potential sites of suitable habitat including arthur pieman area of western tasmania thumb wilf batty with last thylacine that was killed in wild last known thylacine to be killed in wild was shot in 1930 by wilf batty a farmer from mawbanna in state s northwest animal believed to have been a male had been seen around batty s house for several weeks work in 2012 examined relationship of genetic diversity of thylacines before their extinction results indicated that last of thylacines in australia on top of threats from dingoes had limited genetic diversity due to their complete geographic isolation from mainland australia further investigations in 2017 showed evidence that this decline in genetic diversity started long before arrival of humans in australia possibly starting as early as 70 120 thousand years ago benjamin and searches last captive thylacine later referred to as benjamin was trapped in florentine valley by elias churchill in 1933 and sent to hobart zoo where it lived for three years thylacine died on 7 september 1936 it is believed to have died as result of neglect locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters it was exposed to a rare occurrence of extreme tasmanian weather extreme heat during day and freezing temperatures at night paddle 2000 p 195 this thylacine features in last known motion picture footage of a living specimen 62 seconds of black and white footage showing thylacine in its enclosure in a clip taken in 1933 by naturalist david fleay in film footage thylacine is seen seated walking around perimeter of its enclosure yawning exposing its impressive gape sniffing air scratching itself in same manner as a dog and lying down fleay was bitten on buttock whilst shooting film having ignored threat yawn and hissing vocalizations made by animal frank darby who claimed to have been a keeper at hobart zoo suggested benjamin as having been animal s pet name in a newspaper article of may 1968 no documentation exists to suggest that it ever had a pet name and alison reid de facto curator at zoo and michael publicist for zoo denied that frank darby had ever worked at zoo or that name benjamin was ever used for animal darby also appears to be source for claim that last thylacine was a male paddle 2000 pp 198 201 robert paddle was unable to uncover any records of any frank darby having been employed by beaumaris hobart zoo during time that reid or her father was in charge and noted several inconsistencies in story darby told during his interview in 1968 thumb right last known thylacine photographed at beaumaris zoo in 1933 a scrotal sac is not visible in this or any other of photos or film taken leading to supposition that benjamin was a female photographic analysis in 2011 suggested benjamin was indeed a male sex of last captive thylacine has been a point of debate since its death at beaumaris zoo in hobart tasmania in 2011 a detailed examination of a single frame from motion film footage confirmed that thylacine was male when frame iii is enlarged scrotum can be seen confirming thylacine to be male by enhancing frame outline of individual testes is after thylacine s death zoo expected that it would soon find a replacement and benjamin s death was not reported on in media at time although there had been a conservation movement pressing for thylacine s protection since 1901 driven in part by increasing difficulty in obtaining specimens for overseas collections political difficulties prevented any form of protection coming into force until 1936 official protection of species by tasmanian government was introduced on 10 july 1936 59 days before last known specimen died in captivity paddle 2000 p 184 a thylacine was reportedly shot and photographed at mawbanna in 1938 a 1957 sighting from a helicopter could not be confirmed on ground an animal killed in sandy cape at night in 1961 was tentatively identified as a thylacine results of subsequent searches indicated a strong possibility of survival of species in tasmania into 1960s searches by dr eric guiler and david fleay in northwest of tasmania found footprints and scats that may have belonged to animal heard vocalisations matching description of those of thylacine and collected anecdotal evidence from people reported to have sighted animal despite searches no conclusive evidence was found to point to its continued existence in wild between 1967 and 1973 zoologist jeremy griffith and dairy farmer james malley conducted what is regarded as most intensive search ever carried out including exhaustive surveys along tasmania s west coast installation of automatic camera stations prompt investigations of claimed sightings and in 1972 creation of thylacine expeditionary research team with dr bob brown which concluded without finding any evidence of thylacine s existence thylacine held status of endangered species until 1980s international standards at time stated that an animal could not be declared extinct until 50 years had passed without a confirmed record since no definitive proof of thylacine s existence in wild had been obtained for more than 50 years it met that official criterion

bulletin as part of its 125th anniversary celebrations offered a 1 25 million reward for safe capture of a live thylacine when offer closed at end of june 2005 no one had produced any evidence of animal s existence an offer of 1 75 million has subsequently been offered by a tasmanian tour operator stewart malcolm trapping is illegal under terms of thylacine s protection so any reward made for
