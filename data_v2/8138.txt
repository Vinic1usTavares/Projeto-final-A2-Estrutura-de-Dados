fantastic adventures was an american pulp fantasy and science fiction magazine published from 1939 to 1953 by ziff davis it was initially edited by raymond a palmer who was also editor of amazing stories ziff davis s other science fiction title first nine issues were in bedsheet format but in june 1940 magazine switched to a standard pulp size it was almost cancelled at end of 1940 but october 1940 issue enjoyed unexpectedly good sales helped by a strong cover by j allen st john for robert moore williams jongor of lost land by may 1941 magazine was on a regular monthly schedule historians of science fiction consider that palmer was unable to maintain a consistently high standard of fiction but fantastic adventures soon developed a reputation for light hearted and whimsical stories much of material was written by a small group of writers under both their own names and house names cover art like those of many other pulps of era focused on beautiful women in melodramatic action scenes one regular cover artist was h w mccauley whose glamorous macgirl covers were popular with readers though emphasis on depictions of attractive and often partly clothed women did draw some objections in 1949 palmer left ziff davis and was replaced by howard browne who was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about fantasy fiction browne briefly managed to improve quality of fiction in fantastic adventures and period around 1951 has been described as magazine s heyday browne lost interest when his plan to take amazing stories upmarket collapsed and magazine fell back into predictability in 1952 ziff davis launched another fantasy magazine titled fantastic in a digest format it was successful and within a few months decision was taken to end fantastic adventures in favor of fantastic march 1953 issue of fantastic adventures was last publication history although science fiction sf had been published before 1920s it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until appearance in 1926 of amazing stories a pulp magazine published by hugo gernsback by end of 1930s field was undergoing its first boom malcolm edwards peter nicholls sf magazines in clute nicholls encyclopedia of science fiction pp 1066 1068 gernsback lost control of amazing stories in 1929 it was sold to teck publications and then in 1938 it was acquired by ziff davis ashley time machines p 76 ashley time machines p 115 following year ziff davis launched fantastic adventures as a companion to amazing first issue was dated may 1939 and editor of amazing ray palmer took on responsibility for new magazine as well ashley time machines pp 142 146 fantastic adventures was initially published in bedsheet format same size as early sf magazines such as amazing fantastic adventures in tuck encyclopedia of science fiction and fantasy vol 3 pp 558 559 brian stableford fantastic adventures in clute nicholls encyclopedia of science fiction p 404 perhaps in order to attract fans who were nostalgic for larger format it started as a bimonthly but in january 1940 began a monthly schedule sales were weaker than for amazing however and with june issue schedule reverted to bimonthly size was also reduced to a standard pulp format since that was cheaper to produce sales did not improve and ziff davis planned to make october issue last one that issue carried robert moore williams jongor of lost land and had a cover by j allen st john combination proved to be so popular that october sales were twice august figures this convinced ziff davis that magazine was viable and it was restarted in january 1941 as a bimonthly at first but switching to monthly again in may of that year howard browne took over as editor of both amazing stories and fantastic adventures in 1950 browne preferred fantasy to science fiction and enjoyed editing fantastic adventures but when his plans for taking amazing upmarket were derailed by korean war he lost interest in both magazines for a while he let william hamling take responsibility for both titles and quality declined at end of 1950 ziff davis moved its offices from chicago to new york browne relocated to new york but hamling decided to stay in chicago so browne became more involved once again and sf historians such as brian stableford and mike ashley consider result to have been a definite improvement in quality ashley transformations p 7 browne s interest in fantasy led him to start a new digest sized magazine fantastic in summer of 1952 it was an immediate success and led ziff davis to convert amazing stories to digest format as well move from pulp format to digests was well under way in early 1950s and with fantastics success there was little reason to keep fantastic adventures going it was merged with fantastic last issue was dated march 1953 and may june issue of fantastic added a mention of fantastic adventures to masthead though this disappeared with following issue ashley transformations pp 48 50 contents and reception palmer left thumb harold w mccauley s cover for january 1941 issue these macgirl covers as they were known began to appear from late 1940 replacing more action oriented artwork palmer s goal for fantastic adventures was to create a magazine that published fantasy fiction but was literary equal of quality magazines slicks such as saturday evening post although mixing science fiction with fantasy was not popular with sf fans of era palmer consciously promoted magazine as containing best of both worlds slogan on cover read best in science fiction but palmer also wrote blurbs in amazing stories for fantastic adventures in which he extolled value to a reader of getting both genres in a single magazine fantastic adventures competition included unknown which had been launched just a couple of months earlier in march 1939 and weird tales which was first published in 1923 but instead of attempting to emulate either one fantastic adventures focused on adventure stories in style of edgar rice burroughs palmer probably acquired some fantasy oriented material that had been submitted to amazing stories which gave him an immediate stream of submissions to work with however according to ashley first issue was quite weak cover story was invisible by eando binder and other contributors included harl vincent ross rocklynne and a hyatt verrill see individual issues for convenience an online index is available at an index to british reprints is at features included a quiz an author profile and a comic strip titled ray holmes scientific detective reader was supposed to solve mystery based on clues given in strip it was a failure and disappeared after first issue mike ashley fantastic adventures in tymn ashley science fiction fantasy and weird fiction magazines pp 232 240 back cover man from mars by frank r paul was more successful and illustrated back covers became a regular feature of magazine next issue contained scientists revolt by edgar rice burroughs a name guaranteed to help sales ashley comments that story was unimpressive it had been written as a palace intrigue set in contemporary europe but burroughs had been unable to find a buyer palmer eventually acquired it and rewrote it setting it in future despite weakness of lead story second issue was a marked improvement over first with well received stories by nelson s bond and john russell fearn as thornton ayre burroughs returned to fantastic adventures in 1941 with a series of novelettes in his carson of venus series there were four in all between march 1941 and march 1942 each with cover art by j allen st john and result was a significant boost to fantastic adventures circulation right thumb robert gibson jones october 1950 cover for l ron hubbard s masters of majority of stories in fantastic adventures came from a small group of writers who often wrote under house names main members of group were william p mcgivern david wright o brien don wilcox chester s geier rog phillips leroy yerxa robert moore williams robert bloch and berkeley livingston de camp science fiction handbook p 120 most of this material was of little lasting value in ashley s opinion but palmer was often able to get good stories from outside this group august derleth sold several stories to palmer for example ray bradbury also sold a story to fantastic adventures tomorrow and tomorrow which appeared in 1947 was his only appearance in magazine but ashley regards it as among best stories fantastic adventures published in 1940s an early contributor was nelson s bond whose story judging of priestess appeared in april 1940 issue this was second in a highly regarded series of three stories about a priestess in future after civilization has collapsed first and third in series appeared in amazing stories and astounding stories respectively bond also wrote a humorous short story called amazing invention of wilberforce weems which appeared in september 1939 issue and described consequences of a potion that allowed instant absorption of knowledge from any book palmer encouraged his stable of writers to follow up with more whimsical ideas and resulting offbeat stories gave fantastic adventures a reputation for light hearted and entertaining fantasy these stories often had absurd names early examples include quandary of sidney robot both by mcgivern and weird doom of floyd by robert bloch one of his series of stories about lefty feep almost all of which appeared in fantastic adventures between 1942 and 1945 robert moore williams contributed two sequels to his successful jongor of lost land return of jongor appeared in 1944 and jongor fights back in 1951 palmer enjoyed hoaxes such as printing a photograph of a writer when in fact name in question was a pseudonym in february 1944 issue of fantastic adventures he printed a letter in which writer claimed to be a time traveling scientist born in 1970 whose time machine was inspired by a story in magazine palmer pretended to take letter seriously and printed an appeal to readers to find scientist ashley time machines p 178 palmer s most successful hoax was shaver mystery a series of stories in which author richard shaver explained all wrecks and accidents on earth as result of interference by ancient machinery hidden underground series was enormously popular all shaver mystery stories were published in fantastic adventures companion magazine amazing stories which led ashley to describe fantastic adventures as a haven from shaver stories but shaver did also publish some competent fantasies in fantastic adventures ashley time machines p 183 increased circulation enabled both amazing and fantastic adventures to return to monthly publication in late 1940s ashley history of science fiction magazine vol 3 p 24 browne left thumb alexander kohn s cover for march 1949 issue phallic spaceships were common on sf magazine covers but here a submarine plays that role when browne took over at start of 1950 william hamling was doing most of editorial work browne did not fully take control of magazine until end of year when hamling and palmer both left ziff davis quality of fiction promptly improved at that point and first year or two of browne s tenure are regarded as high point of fantastic adventures run theodore sturgeon s novel dreaming jewels appeared in february 1950 and lester del rey william tenn and walter m miller all published notable material in april 1950 mack reynolds first story isolationist appeared in fantastic adventures reynolds became more strongly associated with astounding science fiction than with ziff davis magazines but some of radical political themes of his later work are evident in isolationist story describes helpful alien visitors abandoning earth to atomic war because of hostility of first earthman they encounter ashley transformations p 6 john jakes also debuted in fantastic adventures that year with dreaming trees in november 1950 overall quality was low but according to sf historian brian stableford sf writers given carte blanche to write pure fantasy for fantastic adventures did often produce readable fiction with a distinctive whimsical and ironic flavour critic john clute s assessment was that it was inconsistent but there were some terrific tales in it not enough but some clute science fiction illustrated encyclopedia p 101 notable stories from post war era include theodore sturgeon s largo and raymond f jones children s room artwork was generally of higher quality than stories ashley describes fantastic adventures as one of best illustrated magazines around regular artists included virgil finlay henry sharp rod ruth and malcolm smith in palmer s words it has been our experience that covers sell magazines simply because they attract attention for first year cover art while dramatic was more likely to show an action scene with a male hero than a damsel in distress but in august 1940 h w mccauley s cover showed a glamorous woman in a sparkling dress similar covers followed with increasing frequency with readers and editors giving various heroines name of macgirl science fiction historian paul carter commenting on change from action scenes to alluring women on covers suggests that surely war had something to do with this carter creation of tomorrow p 183 science fiction art often included spaceships as phallic symbols author and critic brian aldiss remarked on a fantastic adventures cover from march 1949 that included a submarine as a phallic symbol instead aldiss wingrove trillion year spree pp 222 463 464 readers letters often objected to attractive women and implied sexual content but stories themselves were quite tame bibliographic details jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep
