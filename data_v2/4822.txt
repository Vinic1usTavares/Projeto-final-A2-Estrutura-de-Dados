noting that songs have a strong meaning to franchise he had wanted to make songs that were included in series albums but not in its video games to be accessible in that form he also wanted to create an idolmaster video game that while maintaining a producer s viewpoint has a lighter feel and would allow player to hum along to idols as he or she plays he pointed out that rhythm game genre fell in line with these two desires and this led to development of shiny festa team chose to develop for playstation portable psp as he felt it was simple to play on at same time team also wanted to create scenes where series thirteen idols would be able to appear together and chose to use pre rendered videos to make this possible sakagami also noted that development team deliberately chose to use a gameplay system in which note icons float toward screen s center to attract player to look at videos in background games anime scenes were directed by atsushi nishigori and produced by a 1 pictures who also created idolmaster anime adaptation in 2011 according to hironori toba aniplex s producer for anime television series he was told about plans of including anime material in shiny festa during
