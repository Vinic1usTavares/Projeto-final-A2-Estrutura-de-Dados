alien science fiction horror film series game is set 15 years after events of original 1979 film alien and follows engineer amanda ripley daughter of alien protagonist ellen ripley as she investigates disappearance of her mother unlike previous game adaptations of alien franchise alien isolation places an emphasis on stealth and survival horror gameplay requiring player to avoid and outsmart a single alien creature with tools such as a motion tracker and flamethrower it was designed to resemble original film rather than its more action oriented 1986 sequel aliens and features a similar lo fi 1970s vision of what future would look like game runs on an engine built from scratch to accommodate technical aspects such as atmospheric and lighting effects and alien s behaviour creative assembly intended to make alien isolation a third person game but used first person to create a more intense experience alien isolation received generally positive reviews and had sold over two million copies by may 2015 critics praised game s retro futuristic art direction sound design and alien s artificial intelligence but criticised its characters and long runtime game won several year end awards including best audio at 2015 game developers choice awards and audio achievement at 2015 british academy of film and television arts awards game was ported to linux and os x in 2015 and to nintendo switch in 2019 gameplay thumb left upright 1 2 player can use motion tracker to track alien s location while motion was detected in front of tracker a circle will appear on its screen indicating where motion is detected alien isolation is a single player action adventure game with emphasis on stealth and survival horror features player controls amanda ripley from a first person perspective and must explore a space station and complete objectives while avoiding outsmarting and defeating enemies objectives range from activating computers to collecting certain items or reaching a specific area in game player can run climb ladders sneak into vents crouch behind objects to break line of sight with enemies and peek over or lean around to gain view player also has ability to go under tables or inside lockers to hide from enemies amanda encounters several antagonists over course of game including hostile humans and androids these can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means main antagonist an alien creature pursues player throughout game alien creature cannot be defeated requiring player to use stealth tactics in order to survive instead of following a predetermined path alien has ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt player by sight or sound along way player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect alien s movements however using any of these increases chance of alien finding player for example if alien is moving and close enough tracker s sound will attract alien forcing player to use tracker wisely and remove it as soon as it detects motion motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine if alien creature is up in ducts or on ground level although amanda gains access to a revolver a shotgun a bolt gun and a flamethrower over course of game alien isolation emphasises evasion over direct combat by providing limited ammunition player can also craft items by collecting schematics and different materials items include emp noisemakers molotov cocktails and pipe bombs these can help player deal with enemies for example can be used to attract enemies in a particular direction alien is afraid of fire so using flame weapons forces it to retreat into station s ventilation system player has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies health is restored with which can be crafted with materials in amanda s inventory space station is divided into sections connected by trams and elevators some doors require certain actions before entry is allowed for example some require a keycard or entry codes while others need to be hacked or to be cut with welding torches computer terminals and rewiring stations can be used to access information trigger actions such as disabling security cameras or manipulating space station s air purification mechanism an automap helps player navigate different areas of game to save game progress player needs to locate a terminal in game and insert amanda s access card if amanda dies player will have to restart from last saved point in addition to campaign mode alien isolation features a special mode called survivor mode in which player must complete objectives within a time limit on different challenge maps while avoiding an alien creature plot in 2137 15 years after events of original alien film amanda ripley daughter of ellen ripley learns from christopher samuels an android working for weyland yutani corporation that flight recorder of her mother s ship nostromo was recently located by crew of a salvage vessel anesidora flight recorder is being held aboard sevastopol a remote space station owned by seegson corporation in orbit around kg 348 gas giant samuels offers ripley a place on weyland yutani team being sent to retrieve it so that she can have closure regarding fate of her missing mother ripley samuels and weyland yutani executive nina taylor travel to sevastopol on board torrens courier ship group arrives at sevastopol to find station damaged and its communications offline they attempt to spacewalk over to station to investigate but their eva line is severed by debris and ripley is separated from others and forced to enter station on her own while exploring sevastopol ripley finds flight recorder of nostromo with no data and learns that station is out of control due to a deadly alien creature lurking aboard after regrouping with samuels and taylor ripley meets station s marshal waits and his deputy ricardo waits explains that alien was brought onto station by anesidora captain henry marlow whose crew discovered flight recorder near lv 426 moon where they also found a derelict ship previously found by nostromo crew and a nest of alien eggs contained within while exploring derelict marlow s wife was attacked by a facehugger she was then brought aboard sevastopol for emergency medical treatment but died after a chestburster hatched from her waits convinces ripley to contain alien inside a remote module of station although ripley is successful waits ejects module from station with her still inside as module careens towards kg 348 ripley space jumps back to sevastopol using a space suit ripley makes her way back to confront waits but ricardo reveals that station s service androids abruptly started slaughtering remaining crew including waits samuels attempts to interface with station s controlling artificial intelligence apollo to cease rampage however systems s defensive countermeasures kill him shortly after he opens a path for ripley into apollo s control core there ripley discovers that seegson had been trying to sell off sevastopol to weyland yutani who instructed apollo to protect alien at all costs ripley tells apollo that creature is no longer aboard station and demands to cease all activity but system refuses stating that scheduled reactor scans are unverified at reactor ripley discovers an alien nest and initiates a reactor purge to destroy it ripley learns from ricardo that taylor was sent to retrieve alien and that she freed marlow in exchange for location of lv 426 however marlow double crossed her and took her hostage aboard anesidora aboard anesidora ripley discovers a message from her mother that was recorded after her initial report of events on nostromo thus finally giving ripley closure marlow attempts to overload fusion reactor of anesidora to destroy station and ensure that no remaining alien creatures survive taylor kills him in attempt to reverse process but she herself is killed by electric discharge forcing ripley to escape shortly before anesidora explodes explosion destroys sevastopol s orbital stabilisers causing station to slowly drift into kg 348 s atmosphere ripley and

creatures and ultimately thrown into ship by a blast aboard torrens ripley discovers that another alien has boarded ship when ripley is cornered in airlock she ejects herself and alien into space adrift in her space suit ripley is awakened by a searchlight development alien isolation was developed by creative assembly which is best known for their work on total war strategy video game series idea of developing a game based on alien film series from 20th century fox was conceived when company finished work on their 2008 title viking battle for asgard after publisher sega acquired rights to develop alien games in december 2006 a six person team developed first prototype to pitch idea wherein one player would control alien manually while another would conceal themselves in an environment and try to hide from creature game captured attention of sega and project was eventually approved because creative assembly had no experience with survival horror games company hired people from studios such as bizarre creations black rock crytek ubisoft and realtime worlds for project according to director alistair hope development team grew from a couple of guys crammed in with total war team to a group of 100 people by 2014 creative assembly decided to design game more in line with ridley scott s 1979 film alien as opposed to james cameron s more action oriented 1986 sequel aliens to help designers authentically recreate atmosphere of film fox provided them with three terabytes of original production material including costume photography concept art set design behind scenes photos videos and film s original sound effect recordings artist john mckellan recalled it was a proper gold mine we saw angles of things we d never seen before during first stage of development developers deconstructed film to find out what made its setting unique this would allow them to build new environments that were faithful to it similarly film s original soundtrack was deconstructed so that composers could identify main cues which would then be used as templates to extend soundtrack and fill in length of game developers also met alien and blade runner editor terry rawlings who would give them additional insight rather than go for a shiny high tech science fiction look designers opted to recreate setting and feel of original alien film using work of concept artists ron cobb and moebius as a result game features a lo fi 1970s vision of what future would look like for example game features clunky machinery like phone receivers monochrome displays and distorted crt monitors to create period authentic distortion on in game monitors developers recorded their in game animations onto vhs and betamax video recorders then filmed those sequences playing on an old curvy portable tv while adjusting tracking settings as digital hacking was not conceived in 1970s game s hacking device was built way it would have been built on set of movie and requires players to tune into a computer s signal while selecting icons on its screen artist jon mckellan noted we had this rule if a prop couldn t have been made in 79 with things that they had around then we wouldn t make it either creative assembly wanted alien isolation to have a story that was closely related to film as a result team decided to explore a story set 15 years after events of film which would involve ellen ripley s daughter and nostromos flight recorder writer will porter explained that process of creating a backstory for amanda was refreshing as he felt that she was an overlooked character of alien universe actress sigourney weaver agreed to reprise her role as ellen ripley to voice small sections throughout game because she felt that story was interesting and true to film along with weaver original alien cast which includes tom veronica cartwright harry dean stanton and yaphet kotto reprised their roles for game s separate downloadable content missions marking first time they were brought back together since release of film all characters were created with 3d face scans a major story rewrite happened around a year before game s release and leftovers from it were discovered in a console build of game alien isolation runs on a proprietary engine that was built from scratch by creative assembly previously used in battle for asgard engine was adapted to accommodate technical aspects like game s atmospheric and lighting effects as well as alien s behavioural design engine s deferred rendering allowed artists to place hundreds of dynamic lights in a scene and achieve great geometric detail a major toolchain update occurred six months into development although new tools eventually improved workflow they initially caused major disruptions because previous work had to be discarded or ported into new tools taking valuable development time away from team alien itself was designed to look similar to h r giger s original design for creature from film including skull underneath its head however designers did alter its humanoid legs with recurved ones to provide alien a walk cycle that would hold up to scrutiny during longer encounters with player between 70 and 80 different sets of animation for alien were created alien s artificial intelligence was programmed with a complex set of behavioural designs that slowly unlock as it encounters player creating illusion that alien learns from each interaction and appropriately adjusts its hunting strategy as gameplay designer gary napper explains we needed something that would be different every time you played it you re going to die a lot which means restarting a lot and if alien was scripted you d see same behaviour that makes alien become predictable and a lot less scary save system was inspired by a scene in film where captain dallas uses a key card to access nostromos computer mother developers originally planned to add a feature that would allow players to craft weapons but idea was ultimately discarded according to hope we thought about what people would want to do in order to survive we explored different ideas and one of them was fashioning weapons to defend yourself that was quite early on but then we realised that this game isn t really about pulling trigger another cancelled feature was alien s iconic acid blood as a game mechanic which could melt through metal like in film although feature was reportedly implemented at one point it was eventually removed from game because developers felt it would change course of game in a weird direction although game is played from a first person perspective it was developed for a considerable amount of time in third person view perspective was ultimately changed after team realised that first person changed gameplay experience significantly hope explained that in third person view alien isolation would have become a game about jockeying camera and looking after your avatar but in first person it s you that s being hunted if you re hiding behind an object and you want to get a better view of your surroundings you have to move development of game took four years after creative assembly first pitched idea to sega alien isolation was released to manufacturing on 9 september 2014 it is dedicated to simon franco a programmer of game who died during its development marketing and release alien isolation was first unveiled on 12 may 2011 when uk government minister ed vaizey visited creative assembly and revealed on his twitter account that studio was hiring for an alien game although no gameplay details were confirmed sega confirmed to cvg that game would be released for consoles but did not specify any format sega boss mike hayes also said that game was going to be very much a triple a project we want this to be a peer to likes of dead space 2 although game s name was anticipated following a trademark registration in october 2013 and some screenshots of game were leaked in december 2013 alien isolation was formally announced and confirmed for microsoft windows playstation 3 playstation 4 xbox 360 and xbox one platforms with release of a teaser trailer on 7 january 2014 fact that sega s previous alien game aliens colonial marines received a negative public reaction did not affect creative assembly according to napper vocal reaction from alien fanbase assured team that they were building a game with what fanbase wanted in june 2014 alien isolation was presented at electronic entertainment expo e3 where journalists had a chance to play a demonstration of game game was also

downloadable content packs was released for linux os x playstation 4 and xbox one in late 2015 reception critical reception for alien isolation was generally favourable josh harmon of electronic gaming monthly felt that alien isolation succeeds as a genuine effort to capture spirit of film franchise in playable form rather than a lazy attempt to use it as an easy backdrop for a cash in with an ill fitting genre writing for gamespot kevin vanord credited game for its tense and frightening gameplay stating that when all mechanics are working as intended alien evasion is dread distilled into its purest simplest form however he criticised game s trial and error progression and frustrating distances between save points jeff marchiafava of game informer stated similar pros but criticised story and poor acting from voice actors game s visuals and atmosphere were highlighted positively polygon editor arthur gies felt that alien isolation is a beautiful game full of deep shadows and mystery around every corner while dan whitehead of eurogamer praised lighting and unusually compelling environment design ign s ryan mccaffrey gave high marks to game s retro futuristic art direction and sound design commenting from wisps of smoke that billow out of air vents to clouds of white mist that obscure your vision when you rewire an area s life support systems in order to aid your stealthy objectives isolation certainly looks and sounds like a part of alien universe similarly pc gamer said that game s art design sets alien isolation apart from likes of system shock or dead space and creates a convincing science fiction world with machines and environments that are functional and utilitarian rather than overtly futuristic characters were generally criticised game informer stated that amanda exhibits little growth or personality other than concern for her fellow humans and a desire not to die gruesomely while blake peterson of game revolution noted that none of characters are fully developed according to him we never spend enough time with them to build emotional bond necessary for their inevitable deaths to mean anything gametrailers said that most of computer terminals found in game contain unoriginal logs to describe predictable events but also remarked that reading reports from different computer terminals grounds sevastopol in an appreciable way writing for gamesradar david houghton highlighted alien s advanced artificial intelligence stating that progress becomes a case of if and how not when movement is measured in inches and feet rather than metres and simply remaining alive becomes more exhilarating than any objective achieved peterson praised gameplay for being tense scary and effective commenting that alien isolation is a solid incredibly striking example of survival horror genre that uses its first person perspective to greater personalize horror pc gamer credited crafting system for giving game a lot of unexpected depth allowing players to outsmart enemies in multiple ways game s survivor mode was praised by chris carter of destructoid who felt it offered players different feelings and experiences each time they played it although gameplay was praised by several reviewers some found game to be unnecessarily long repetitive and unforgiving in a mixed review mccaffrey felt that game does not offer many options of survival requiring players to spend most of their time hiding in lockers staring at motion tracker polygon criticised overexposure to alien creature turning alien isolation into an irritating experience as gies explained every time i thought i heard monster every blip on my motion tracker was a cause for a tightness in my chest at first by 300th time i dived under a table or into a locker i wasn t scared anymore i was annoyed despite criticism alien isolation was considered a brave title due to its difficult and unforgiving gameplay a feature that is uncommon in games
