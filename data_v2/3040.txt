privately owned turnpikes that stretched throughout new york a stretch from catskill to cairo was also once part of susquehannah turnpike created in april 1800 susquehannah turnpike began in catskill and ended in unadilla susquehannah turnpike aided growth of greene county which until then had depended on steamboats on susquehanna river and catskill creek turnpike attracted business from new england states made shipping easier for county s farmers and improved shipping from new york city turnpike was no longer maintained by a private company after 1899 and highway remained intact for over 75 years in 1974 part of turnpike was added to national register of historic places ny 32 was also part of orange turnpike which stretched from new jersey line to newburgh turnpike created three days after susquehannah turnpike follows current routes of ny 17 and ny 32 north of newburgh road follows another old turnpike to ny 300 junction and old plattekill turnpike from ny 300 to ulster county designation segment of modern ny 32 between albany and mechanicville was designated as part of ny 6 in 1924 from mechanicville to hudson falls current routing of ny 32 became part of ny 30 by 1926 portion of what is now ny 32 from harriman to newburgh was designated ny 58 from newburgh to albany ny 32 remained unnumbered at time when u s routes were first assigned in new york in 1927 portion of ny 6 from albany to waterford was designated as northernmost portion of us 9w in waterford us 9w merged with us 9e and continued north as us 9 to mechanicville where us 9 turned west onto modern ny 67 this edition shows u s routes as they were first officially signed in 1927 in 1930 renumbering of state highways in new york us 9w was truncated to albany while us 9 was rerouted to follow a new stretch between albany and round lake former routing of both routes along hudson river between albany and mechanicville as well as entirety of ny 58 and portion of ny 30 from schuylerville to glens falls was integrated into new ny 32 which followed its current routing between harriman and stillwater community of bemis heights and from schuylerville to glens falls automobile legal association ala automobile green book 1930 31 and 1931 32 editions scarborough motor guide co boston 1930 and 1931 1930 31 edition shows new york state routes prior to 1930 renumbering between bemis heights and schuylerville ny 32 followed what is now us 4 along hudson river while former routing of ny 30 between two locations became ny 32a at same time us 4 which previously ended in glens falls was rerouted south of hudson falls to end in east from northumberland to waterford route used what is now ny 32 reroutings thumb right ny 32 at its intersection with us 9 in albany alt a driver s view of a four lane highway in a commercial district ny 32 has been realigned in several locations since its inception in 1930 when route was initially assigned it passed through palenville instead of bypassing it to east as it does today in early 1940s ny 32 was rerouted to follow a new highway east of hamlet ny 32 s former routing into palenville was redesignated as ny 32a original ny 32a in saratoga county which was redundant to us 4 was supplanted at this time by a rerouted ny 32 bemis heights schuylerville portion of overlap between us 4 and ny 32 was eliminated in 1950s when original routing of ny 32 between two locations was upgraded construction on highway began in mid 1950s and was completed by 1958 at which time us 4 was rerouted to follow riverside roadway in bethlehem a southern suburb of albany ny 32 was originally routed on feura bush road between hamlets of feura bush and glenmont north of glenmont ny 32 followed what is now ny 144 in 1956 albany county board of supervisors asked state of new york to develop a highway that would reduce amount of traffic on ny 43 now ny 443 in bethlehem original plans released by state in 1959 called for a four lane divided highway between ny 85 in new scotland and us 9w in bethlehem new road known as delmar bypass would run south of hamlets of slingerlands delmar and elsmere and loosely parallel feura bush road to north between elm avenue and us 9w by february 1961 however state favored a new alignment that brought bypass north from elm avenue to slingerlands where it would connect to proposed slingerlands bypass north of ny 85 as a result road would run through western part of delmar and eastern section of slingerlands change in plans was met with stiff opposition from area residents at a february 8 public hearing and bethlehem town board unanimously voted to oppose altered route at a meeting one week later both actions eventually led state to cancel portion of route west of elm avenue in january 1963 portion east of elm avenue was completed in december 1963 and became part of a realigned ny 32 in 1970s part of right of way for delmar bypass near slingerlands was eventually used for a realignment of ny 140 named cherry avenue extension ny 32 s former routing along feura bush road is still state maintained as ny an unsigned reference route ny 32 ended in downtown glens falls until january 1 1949 when highway was extended east to us 4 in hudson falls by way of warren street boulevard and feeder street on april 1 1980 ownership and maintenance of boulevard between highland avenue and washington county line was transferred from state of new york to warren county in exchange for control over highland and dix avenues between warren avenue and washington county line in hudson falls boulevard and segment of feeder street south of boulevard were given to washington county on april 1 of following year in return for ownership and maintenance over all of dix and burgoyne avenues north of ny 196 ny 32 was rerouted to follow highland dix and burgoyne avenues shortly afterward rondout creek bridge rehabilitation thumb bridge in rosendale village being renovated in 2009 alt a blue metal truss bridge crosses over a small creek bordered on each side by sloping retaining walls made of stone in june 2008 nysdot began a rehabilitation project of bridge over rondout creek in rosendale project involved rehabilitating bridge one half at a time project was slated to have 74 year old bridge up to standards by fall of 2009 it also included improvements to road leading up to bridge having only one lane open at a time congested traffic in area total cost of project was 5 5 million bridge had been refurbished before in 1970 future in several locations traffic congestion along ny 32 has led to suggestions to change or modify road problems are most severe at southern terminus but it is not only section of road with issues woodbury commons road s southern terminus at woodbury commons is most frequent topic of discussion especially since black friday in 2001 when heavy traffic from holiday shoppers along adjacent sections of not only 32 but routes 6 and 17 and thruway came to a complete standstill this should have been planned for and it wasn t complained one local official now you re trying to close door and horse is already out despite several efforts and presence of state police on later black fridays a similar traffic jam occurred on labor day weekend 2006 when a break in bad weather led to an increase in shoppers so marked that us 6 and thruway were backed up as far as newburgh and palisades interstate parkway respectively woodbury police chief cited blockage created by drivers making left turn from ny 32 to thruway as cause plans to build an exit ramp that would allow that traffic to go directly to tollbooth have been expedited thumb left ny 32 begins just ahead adjacent to woodbury commons alt a big green sign reads junction i 87 new york thruway ny 32 and orange county route 64 on weekend of august 17 18 2009 another serious traffic jam occurred in which it took some drivers two hours to get to thruway from mall officials cited several factors heavy traffic on ny 17 that weekend for both 40th anniversary of woodstock music festival in sullivan county and observances of anniversary of rabbi joel teitelbaum s death in joel a few miles to west a traffic light that had been malfunctioning after a recent lightning strike may also have contributed in 2007 new york state department of transportation nysdot officials announced their long term plan to prevent further traffic jams they will create a series of loops and overpasses allowing traffic to go directly from southbound ny 32 to thruway and remove some traffic lights in front of mall changes were expected to be complete by 2011 as part of improvements to convert ny 17 expressway into i 86 however in 2009 they were postponed due to funding constraints work was slated to begin in 2013 but just before it could start governor andrew cuomo redirected money to repair projects elsewhere in state project was put on indefinite hold in 2014 until it could be funded in 2016 nysdot announced a new five year capital spending plan that included exit 131 project construction is not expected to begin until 2018 at earliest before beginning agency says it must acquire permanent easements over another and temporary easements over revised plan dot says will allow it to shorten timetable and complete project in one phase instead of two originally planned it was expected to cost 115 million late in 2017 cuomo revealed details of nysdot s new plan at a news conference main element would include converting interchange into a diverging diamond where traffic would switch sides of road on overpass so both left and right turns onto ny 17 would not have to be made against opposing traffic in order to meet federal clearance requirements for interstate highway standards ny 17 gradually being converted into i 86 will be lowered by beneath new overpass road cr 64 which currently ends at ny 32 just north of interchange would also be extended to east and grade separated as well passing underneath ny 32 in a new overpass to connect to a roundabout where it would meet a new access road to mall and an offramp from northbound ny 32 cuomo said new plan would cost 150 million and be completed by november 2019 vails gate five corners intersection of ny 32 and ny 94 at vails gate was a four way junction until world war ii when army extended temple hill road later ny 300 southeast to junction so that troops and materiel could get between west point and airbase at what was then stewart field more quickly it did not become a traffic problem until 1990s when gas stations supermarkets strip malls and fast food restaurants had been built on every corner by end of 20th century intersection was handling 30 000 drivers a day from increasingly developed cornwall newburgh and new windsor nysdot expanded intersection with middle turn lanes and overhead signs on all approaches many drivers still felt it was a confusing intersection and that confusion slowed traffic down as much as many cars stopping to enter and exit nearby businesses in 2001 state officials said they had done everything possible to improve traffic flows through five corners continuing congestion was attributable to insufficient or nonexistent planning downtown new paltz thumb congestion in downtown new paltz alt a narrow four lane highway is jammed with cars as they wait at a signalized intersection another choke point has been main street in new paltz a section shared by ny 32 and ny 299 this is main route back to thruway and downstate from heavily used hiking and climbing areas at mohonk preserve and state park preserve in shawangunks it is also a well developed commercial area in a college town with ample street parking traffic through village has been so heavy on weekends during summer and peak leaf peeping weekends in early autumn that many residents have proposed making main street one way carrying traffic only to west while diverting eastbound traffic onto either of two parallel streets other villages that have made such changes found making streets one way decreased business at their retailers after four years of studying and reviewing issue town and village agreed to make change in 2007 however village s new mayor who had supported plan while a trustee changed his mind and said village s support was on hold while campaigning he said few village residents had expressed support for plan what he learned since taking over as mayor had only further convinced him that it was mostly town residents who wanted street changes he also believed that making main street one way would reduce total amount of routes available to vehicles passing through village and would adversely route traffic away from businesses along main suffixed routes originally ny 32 had two suffixed routes ny 32a and ny 32b that were absorbed by other routes ny 32a designation has since been revived for a short connector in hudson valley ny 32a designation has been used for two distinct highways first ny 32a was assigned as part of 1930 renumbering of state highways in new york to segment of modern ny 32 between bemis heights and schuylerville in saratoga county at time ny 32 was routed on what is now us 4 between two locations route was supplanted by a realigned ny 32 in early 1940s current ny 32a is a connector between ny 32 and ny 23a in ulster and greene counties it was assigned in early 1940s ny 32b was assigned as part of 1930 renumbering to an alternate route of ny 32 between northumberland and glens falls in saratoga washington and warren counties it was truncated northward to hudson falls in early 1940s and mostly replaced by ny 254 major intersections see also references external links 032 category transportation in orange county new york category
