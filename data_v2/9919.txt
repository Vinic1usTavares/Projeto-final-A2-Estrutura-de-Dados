operation biting also known as bruneval raid was a british combined operations raid on a german coastal radar installation at bruneval in northern france during second world war on night several of these installations were identified from royal air force raf aerial reconnaissance photographs during 1941 but their exact purpose and nature of equipment that they possessed was not known some british scientists believed that these stations were connected with heavy losses being experienced by raf bombers conducting bombing raids against targets in occupied europe scientists requested that one of these installations be raided and technology it possessed be studied and if possible extracted and brought back to britain for further examination due to extensive coastal defences erected by germans to protect installation from a seaborne raid it was believed that a commando raid from sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for enemy to destroy installation it was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by seaborne evacuation would be most practicable way to surprise garrison of installation seize technology intact and minimise casualties to raiding force on night of 27 february after a period of intense training and several delays due to poor weather a company of airborne troops under command of major john frost parachuted into france a few miles from installation main force then assaulted villa in which radar equipment was kept killing several members of german garrison and capturing installation after a brief firefight an raf technician with force dismantled a wurzburg radar array and removed several key pieces after which force withdrew to evacuation beach detachment assigned to clear beach had initially failed to do so but german force guarding it was soon eliminated with help of main force raiding troops were picked up by landing craft then transferred to several motor gun boats which returned them to britain raid was entirely successful airborne troops suffered relatively few casualties and pieces of radar they brought back along with a captured german radar technician allowed british scientists to understand enemy advances in radar and to create countermeasures to neutralise them background after end of battle of france and evacuation of british troops from dunkirk during operation dynamo much of britain s war production and effort was channelled into raf bomber command and strategic bombing offensive against germany however bomber losses on each raid began to increase during 1941 which british intelligence concluded was due to german use of advanced radar equipment millar pp 2 3 british and germans had been competing in radar technology for nearly a decade at this point with german technology often at same level as british or surpassing them due to heavy investment in fledgeling technology cornwell p 262 by beginning of second world war britain had devised effective radar systems primarily through work of robert watson watt although much of technology was still rudimentary in nature and watson watt and other scientists had failed to devise an effective night defence system in time for german night time bombing of britain during 1940 cornwell p 267 another british scientist working on radar systems and techniques was r v jones who had been appointed in 1939 as britain s first scientific intelligence officer and had spent first years of conflict researching how advanced german radar was in comparison to britain cornwell p 268 convincing doubters that germans actually had radar jones p 192 thumb left upright 1 a limber freya radar alt pencil drawing of equipment standing on four legs by examining leaked german documents crashed bombers enigma and through german prisoner of war interrogations jones discovered that high frequency radio signals were being transmitted across britain from somewhere on continent and he believed they came from a directional radar system cornwell pp 273 274 within a few months of this discovery jones had identified several such radar systems one of which was being used to detect british bombers this was known as freya freya array named after ancient norse goddess cornwell p 274 jones was finally able to see concrete proof of presence of freya system after being shown several mysterious objects visible in reconnaissance pictures taken by raf near cap d antifer in normandy two circular emplacements in each of which was a rotating mattress antenna approximately wide having found proof of these freya installations jones and other scientists under his command could begin devising countermeasures against system and raf could begin to locate and destroy installations themselves jones also found evidence of a second part of freya set up referred to in enigma decrypts as wurzburg but it was not until he was shown another set of raf reconnaissance photographs in november 1941 that he learned what wurzburg was wurzburg radar device consisted of a parabolic antenna about in diameter which worked in conjunction with freya to locate british bombers and then direct night fighters to attack them cornwell p 275 two systems complemented each other freya was a long range early warning radar system but lacked precision whereas wurzburg had a much shorter range but was far more precise wurzburg fuse 62 d also had advantage of being much smaller than freya system and easier to manufacture in quantities needed by to defend german territory millar p 3 prelude in order to effectively neutralise wurzburg system by developing countermeasures against it jones and his team needed to study one of systems or at least more vital pieces of technology of which system was composed one such site had recently been sighted by an raf reconnaissance spitfire from photographic reconnaissance unit during a flight over part of french english channel coast near le havre harclerode p 208 site was found on a clifftop immediately north of village of bruneval which was itself north of le havre and was most accessible german radar site that had been found so far by british several other installations were further inland in france and others were as far away as romania and bulgaria a request for a raid on bruneval site to capture a wurzburg system was passed on to admiral lord louis mountbatten commander of combined operations millar p 4 mountbatten in turn took proposal to chiefs of staff committee who approved raid after a brief debate having received permission to conduct raid mountbatten and his staff studied bruneval installation and its defences rapidly coming to conclusion that due to extensive coastal defences in area around installation it was too well guarded to permit a seaborne commando raid they considered that such a raid would result in high casualties among attacking troops and would not be fast enough to capture wurzburg radar before it was destroyed by germans otway p 65 believing that surprise and speed were to be essential requirements of any raid against installation to ensure radar was captured mountbatten saw an airborne assault as only viable method on 8 january 1942 he therefore contacted headquarters of 1st airborne division and 38 wing raf asking if they were able to conduct raid division s commander major general frederick browning was particularly enthusiastic as a successful operation would be an excellent morale boost to airborne troops under his command as well as a good demonstration of their value otway p 66 thumb upright 1 4 troops of covering force and paratroopers

and aircrews could be completed by end of february when there would be suitable meteorological conditions for such an operation to take place training for raid was begun immediately but encountered several problems 38 wing was a new unit still in process of formation so no 51 squadron raf under wing commander percy charles pickard was selected to provide aircraft and aircrew needed for operation although group captain nigel norman of 38 wing would remain in overall command another problem encountered was state of training of unit of airborne troops chosen to raid installation during this period 1st airborne division was composed of only two parachute battalions of which only one 1st parachute battalion was fully trained browning wishing to keep 1st parachute battalion intact for any larger operation division might be selected for ordered 2nd parachute battalion to provide a company for operation c company commanded by frost was selected but company had been so recently formed that frost and many of his men had not yet completed their parachute jumping course level of security imposed on planning for raid was so high that when major frost was first briefed by a liaison officer from headquarters of 1st airborne division he was informed that his company was to take part in an airborne warfare demonstration for war cabinet he was also informed that c company would be divided into four sections for exercise which was contrary to a plan frost had devised for exercise and confused him it was only after frost raised several objections with a more senior officer at headquarters that he was informed of intended raid after which major dropped his objections and turned his attention to training company harclerode pp 208 209 training company spent time on salisbury plain in wiltshire and then travelled to inveraray in scotland where they underwent specialised training on loch fyne practising night on landing craft to prepare company for evacuation by sea after raiding radar installation after this unit returned to wiltshire and began carrying out practice parachute drops with aircraft and aircrews of 51 squadron despite aircrews having no previous experience in dropping parachutists these exercises proved to be successful harclerode p 209 company s working up was aided by creation of a scale model of radar installation and surrounding buildings being built by photographic interpretation unit jones p 239 during this period major frost was introduced to commander f n cook of royal australian navy who would be commanding naval force intended to evacuate company at completion of raid as well as to detachment of thirty two officers and men from no 12 commando who would arrive in landing craft and cover company as it withdrew from beach chappell p 27 otway p 67 frost also met raf flight sergeant c w h cox who had volunteered to accompany c company for operation as an expert radio mechanic it would be his job to locate wurzburg radar set photograph it and dismantle part of it for transportation back to britain millar pp 18 19 derek garrard of jones team asked jones to obtain an army uniform and identification number for cox as he would be object of special attention from germans if he was captured in air force uniform but war office were obdurate jones p 238 accompanying strike force was a 10 man section of royal engineers of

left upright 1 3 wurzburg radar of type installed at bruneval folded for transport alt wheeled radar looks like a circle cut down middle forming two semi circles information about bruneval radar installation was also gathered during this period often with help of french resistance without whom detailed knowledge of disposition of german forces guarding installation would have been impossible this information was gathered by gilbert renault known to british by code name remy and several members of his resistance cell jones pp 236 237 installation was composed of two distinct areas a villa approximately from edge of a cliff which contained radar station itself and an enclosure containing a number of smaller buildings which contained a small garrison wurzburg antenna was erected between villa and cliff otway p 68 radar station was permanently manned by radar technicians and was surrounded by guard posts and approximately 30 guards buildings in small enclosure housed about 100 german troops including another detachment of technicians a platoon of german infantry was stationed to south in bruneval and was responsible for manning defences guarding evacuation beach these included a strongpoint near beach as well as pillboxes and machine gun nests on top of cliff overlooking beach beach was not land mined and had only sporadic barbed wire defences but it was patrolled regularly a mobile reserve of infantry was believed to be available at one hour s notice and stationed some distance inland based on this information frost decided to divide company into five groups of forty men for raid each named after a famous royal navy admiral nelson jellicoe hardy drake and rodney nelson would clear and secure german positions defending evacuation beach whilst jellicoe hardy and drake would capture radar site villa and enclosure rodney was reserve formation placed between radar site and main likely enemy approach to block any counterattack harclerode pp 209 210 it was considered that combination of a full moon for visibility and a rising tide to allow landing craft to manoeuvre in shallow water was vital for success of raid which narrowed possible dates to a four day period between 24 27 february on 23 february a final rehearsal exercise took place which proved to be a failure despite ideal weather conditions evacuation landing craft grounded offshore and could not be shifted despite efforts of crews and troops raid thumb upright 1 4 wurzburg radar array from another angle showing equipment in profile alt aerial view of radar site raid was postponed for several days after 23 february rehearsal due to weather conditions but on 27 february weather proved to be ideal with clear skies and good visibility for aircraft of 51 squadron and a full moon which would provide illumination for evacuation of raiding force naval force under commander cook departed from britain during afternoon and whitley transport aircraft carrying c company took off from raf in evening aircraft crossed english channel without incident but as they reached french coast they came under heavy anti aircraft fire however none of them were hit and they successfully delivered c company to designated drop zone near installation drop was an almost total success with majority of raiding force landing on edge of drop zone however half of nelson detachment landed two miles short of dz once other detachments had gathered their equipment and orientated themselves they moved off to undertake their arranged tasks jellicoe hardy and drake encountered no enemy opposition as they moved towards villa housing radar installation and after surrounding villa frost gave order to open fire with grenades and automatic fire one german guard was killed as he returned fire from an upstairs window and two more were taken prisoner by airborne troops upon interrogation prisoners revealed that majority of garrison were stationed further inland harclerode p 212 there still remained a substantial enemy force in buildings in small enclosure near villa and this now opened fire on raiding force after being alerted by initial firefight killing one of airborne troops volume of fire rapidly increased when enemy vehicles could be seen moving towards villa from nearby woods this in particular worried frost as radio sets force had been issued failed to work giving him no means of communication with his other detachments including nelson who were tasked with clearing evacuation beach flight sergeant cox and several sappers arrived at this time and proceeded to dismantle radar equipment placing pieces on specially designed trolleys otway pp 68 69 having secured radar equipment and under heavy enemy fire major frost gave order for three detachments to withdraw to evacuation beach it became apparent however that beach had not been secured by under strength nelson detachment when a german machine gun opened fire on airborne troops severely wounding company sergeant major frost ordered rodney and available men of nelson to clear defences whilst he led other three detachments back to villa which had been reoccupied by enemy troops villa was soon cleared of enemy troops once more and when frost returned to beach he found that machine gun nest had been destroyed by mis dropped troops of nelson avoiding other enemy positions they had reached beach and attacked machine gun post from flank harclerode pp 212 213 by this time it was 02 15 but there was no sign of naval force that was to evacuate airborne troops frost ordered nelson to guard inland approaches to beach and then fired off an emergency signal flare soon after that naval force was seen approaching original plan for operation had called for two landing craft at a time to land on beach but this had never been satisfactorily achieved during training instead all six landing craft landed at same time with covering troops in landing craft opening fire on german soldiers gathering at top of cliff otway p 69 this deviation from original evacuation plan and enemy fire caused considerable confusion on beach some of landing craft left beach over crowded whilst others left half empty however radar equipment german prisoners and all but six of raiding force were embarked and transferred to motor gunboats for transport back to britain on return journey frost learned that naval force had received no signals apart from signal flare and had spent much of time hiding from a german naval patrol that had nearly discovered them journey back to britain was uneventful with force being escorted by four destroyers and a flight of spitfires paratroopers lost two killed eight wounded and six men who did not return to boats they were later taken prisoner by germans kronborg p 171 german reports were found after war which made german loss as follows army two killed one seriously wounded two missing three killed one wounded three missing kronborg pp 178 184 a member of french resistance movement who had participated in previous reconnaissance in bruneval was subsequently captured and executed by germans a frenchman and his fiancee were deported to concentration camps in germany for providing help to surviving british paratroopers in their attempt to return to uk kronborg p 183 aftermath thumb upright 1 2 pickard examines a german helmet taken after raid success of raid against bruneval installation had two important effects first a successful raid against german occupied territory was a welcome morale boost for british public and featured prominently in british media for several weeks afterwards harclerode p 214 british prime minister winston churchill took a personal interest in operation and on 3 march assembled war cabinet to hear from major frost and several other officers who had participated in it several medals were awarded as a result on 15 may 1942 a special supplement to london gazette carried announcement of 19 decorations frost was awarded military cross mc cook distinguished service cross dsc and cox military medal mm there were two other dscs two distinguished service medals dsm one other mc two further mms and nine mentions in despatches mid wing commander pickard was also subsequently awarded a bar to his distinguished service order on 26 may otway p 70 success of raid also prompted war office to expand existing british airborne forces setting up airborne forces depot and battle school in derbyshire in april 1942 and creating parachute regiment as well as converting a number of infantry battalions to airborne battalions in august 1942 harclerode p 218 second and most important result of raid was technical knowledge that british scientists gained examination of components of radar array showed that it was of a modular design that aided maintenance and made fixing faults far simpler than on similar british radar models this was confirmed during interrogation of captured german technician who proved to be less well trained than his british counterparts p 142 jones p 244 examination of radar array also allowed british scientists to conclude that they would have to deploy a countermeasure that had recently been developed code named window examination of wurzburg array showed that it was impervious to being jammed by conventional means used by british during early years of conflict thus window would have to be deployed against german radars millar p 191 effectiveness of window against wurzburg radar arrays was confirmed by a raid conducted by raf bomber command on 24 july 1943 against hamburg operation gomorrah johnson p 116 when bombers utilised window all of radar arrays in hamburg were blinded and their operators confused unable to distinguish between radar signature of a real bomber and several pieces of window giving off a similar signature millar p 195 thumb left upright 1 2 biting memorial at bruneval an unexpected bonus of bruneval raid was germans efforts to improve defences at wurzburg stations and prevent similar attacks radars were surrounded by rings of barbed wire which increased their visibility from air making them easier to target prior to operation overlord millar p 190 one final consequence of raid was that telecommunications research establishment where much of bruneval equipment was analysed and british radar systems were designed and tested was moved further inland from swanage on southern coast of england to malvern to ensure that it was not target of a reprisal raid by german airborne forces jones p 247 original model of area around radar station used to brief
