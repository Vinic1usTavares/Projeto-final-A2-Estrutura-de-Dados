jean yarbrough film features tom neal and jan wiley as a married pair of friends creeper blames for his deformities jane adams also starred as a blind pianist for whom creeper tries to raise money for an operation to restore her vision film was produced by universal pictures near end of their horror film period according to legend as result of its pending merger with international pictures universal pictures adopted a policy against releasing any more b movies so sold brute man for 125 000 to poverty row s producers releasing corporation which distributed film without any mention of universal s involvement in publicity or credits in fact universal released at least one b western following merger and still had numerous other titles in active circulation from preceding few years at time of merger most experts tend to believe that universal simply found exploitation of deceased hatton and his deformity for third time in his last film in which evidence of his impending demise may be foreshadowed in his acting and of a poorly developed story to be detrimental to its corporate image but did not want to take a financial loss by simply shelving film permanently film was released

bemis joseph crehan as police commissioner salisbury uncredited john hamilton as professor cushman uncredited production writing screenplay for brute man was written by george bricker and m coates webster based on a story by dwight v babcock an author of pulp fiction stories and novels started writing for universal pictures in 1943 where he worked primarily on horror films brute man marked last of nine films babcock wrote for universal before he left for a job at columbia pictures bricker wrote several screenplays in a variety of genres from horror films and mysteries to comedies and worked primarily as a freelancer jumping from studio to studio babcock and brister previously worked together on several low budget horror films including devil bat 1940 house of dracula 1945 pillow of death 1945 she wolf of london 1946 and house of horrors 1946 bricker and webster both previously wrote screenplays for universal pictures films featuring brute man star rondo hatton bricker penned house of horrors and webster wrote jungle captive 1947 third in a series of films about an ape that transforms into a beautiful woman thumb 230 px right alt face shot of rondo hatton balding and with an abnormally sized jaw origin of creeper in brute man is in part inspired by real life story of actor rondo hatton who suffered from acromegaly brute man is a quasi prequel to house of horrors in which hatton played a deformed madman named creeper who kills people by breaking their backs in brute man hatton also plays creeper while story explains how he became deformed and why he has a murderous personality hatton also played a disfigured killer called huxton creeper in pearl of death a 1944 sherlock holmes film but neither house of horrors nor brute man have any connection to that film in establishing a backstory explaining creeper s motives brute man s script seeks to humanize character and elicit more sympathy for him than creeper s other films in which he is generally portrayed as a two dimensional murderer origin of creeper is based partially on autobiographical details from hatton s real life before becoming disfigured by an accident creeper was a handsome young college football hero hatton himself was also a football player at university of florida before suffering from effects of acromegaly a syndrome that causes abnormal bone growth due to excess growth hormone from pituitary gland in film character is disfigured by chemicals during a laboratory accident in school while hatton s real life abnormalities stemmed from acromegaly it was often incorrectly stated by universal pictures publicity materials that they were result of exposure to mustard gas attacks during hatton s service in world war i film s setting which appears to be a major city is never identified in brute man but it has been suggested that it is manhattan since that is where house of horrors took place commentators have noted similarities between brute man and other films including charlie chaplin silent comedy city lights 1931 and universal pictures horror film bride of frankenstein 1935 city lights like brute man included a protagonist chaplin s tramp character who falls in love with a blind girl and seeks money for an operation to restore her eyesight likewise scenes between creeper and helen paige share a similar premise and dialogue as scenes between frankenstein s monster and blind hermit in bride of frankenstein in both films protagonists are shunned by society based on their physical appearance but find companionship in a blind loner who knows nothing about their deformities in both instances protagonist is first drawn to their blind companions by music creeper heard helen playing piano while frankenstein s monster heard hermit playing violin commentators have noted other similarities between two films for example creeper smashes a mirror after looking at his misshapen face much like monster lashes out at his reflection in a waterfall pool casting brute man marked one of several films in which universal pictures cast hatton as a murderer taking advantage of his natural deformities for shock value as a result of his acromegaly hatton had abnormally enlarged and shaped bones on his head and hands and universal pictures publicity department often promoted fact that hatton did not need make up for his roles tom neal who had recently appeared in cult classic noir film detour 1945 was cast as clifford scott having appeared in dozens of low budget films throughout early 1940s neal began to become known as king of b pictures in brute man neal portrayed scott both in his older years and in flashback scenes where character appears as a college student to differentiate between two neal was fitted with make up and costumes to make him better resemble a middle aged man during his non flashback scenes jane adams was cast as blind pianist helen paige adams had appeared in several universal pictures films before including lon chaney jr film house of dracula 1945 jan wiley was cast as scott s wife virginia although wiley had appeared in several movies throughout 1930s and 1940s brute man marked one of her final film performances it was also recalled as one of her most memorable film appearances along with another universal pictures b horror film she wolf of london however her performance in brute man proved to be a less than memorable one for her so much so that in an interview shortly before wiley s death in 1993 she could barely remember even having appeared in film donald macbride and peter whitney portray police officers captain m j donelly and lieutenant gates respectively their roles serve as comic relief for film their characters portray incompetence of police force in their inability to find and arrest creeper and their focus on passing blame for their failures rather than diverting resources toward his arrest filming brute man was developed by universal pictures company inc in later years of their successful production of horror films including dracula 1931 frankenstein 1931 and mummy 1932 while those films were great critical and financial successes brute man was filmed during what was widely considered low point of studio s horror film period it was produced by ben and directed by jean yarbrough both of whom had worked on house of horrors and many other horror films for universal over years brute man was filmed in 13 days during november 1945 flashback scenes which depict how hal moffet became disfigured and ultimately became creeper were all shot on final day of filming jane adams said hatton s acromegaly was becoming progressively worse by time brute man was filmed and it made acting difficult for him hatton had trouble remembering his lines focusing on his performance and responding to other actors hatton occasionally appears confused even on screen like during one scene where he says yes while shaking his head no adams called him a friendly and thoughtful man but called him so pathetic to work with and almost autistic maury gertsman was director of photography on brute man since film focused on a disfigured serial killer gertsman sought to give movie a dark diseased look appropriate for film s subject matter and urban setting although primarily a horror thriller film gertsman uses several film noir elements in his photography including shadowed lighting unbalanced compositions and chiaroscuro contrasts between light and dark as a result brute man features a bleak at times dismal visual atmosphere hans j salter who composed scores for many of universal pictures films of 1940s and 1950s worked as composer for brute man as well salter s score for film strongly resembled music he composed for universal horror films black friday 1940 and invisible man s revenge 1944 philip cahn edited brute man raymond kessler and ralph worked as dialogue director and assistant director respectively while john b goodman and abraham grossman worked as art directors other crew included russell a gausman and edward r robinson as set decorators joe lapis as sound technician jack pierce as make up director carmen as hair stylist and vera west as gowns supervisor release distribution although produced by universal pictures brute man was distributed by producers releasing corporation one of smaller film studios from hollywood s poverty row in 1945 universal merged with company international pictures and new organization adopted a policy against developing any more b movies including westerns horror films serials and movies running 70 minutes or less this resulted in firing of numerous production personnel members and sale of several already developed films including brute man sale was also perpetuated in part by death of star rondo hatton he died as a result of his acromegaly on february 2 1946 about eight months before brute man was first screened making it his final film universal feared releasing film so soon after his death would lead to accusations that studio was exploiting illness that ultimately killed hatton now embarrassed by film studio was anxious to sell it universal sold film to prc for 125 000 which represented negative cost plus interest transaction occurred around august 1946 but was not made public until it was screened for trade press on october 1 marking its official release date sale occurred so quickly and hastily on copyright files stores at library of congress name universal pictures was crossed out and pathe industries prc s corporate body was written in its place in pencil some pressbook advertisements circulated for film still included universal pictures logo prc had previously produced a horror film about acromegaly called monster maker 1944 in which a mad scientist injects human subjects with disease as part of his experiments reception brute man received generally negative critical reviews following its release on october 1 1946 a 1946 review in harrison s reports trade journal found that film had some suspenseful moments and could be enjoyed by fans of genre but that overall effect was artificial and stagy review stated most audiences will find it tiresome in plot and in treatment in fact some of action and dialogue may provoke laughs instead of serious response new york post critic arthur winsten criticized story and acting of rondo hatton commenting that his facial disfigurements alone did not make up for his poor acting skills just as clothes don t make a gentleman so a face doesn t make both a villain and continuous thrills all this picture has is a face handicapped by encircling in a review published in 1947 wanda hale of new york daily news called it a crude production compiled of bits from various b thrillers in contrast mandel of motion picture herald said although film used standard thriller film devices brute man stands favorably in its genre and director jean yarbrough kept film moving at a brisk pace decades after film s release contemporary reviews of brute man were similarly negative with many commentators criticizing exploitation of hatton s real life acromegaly film reviewer leonard maltin gave film one and a half out of four stars john stanley host of ktvu television show creature features described it as a dull and shoddy thriller criticizing both performances and mood from direction and photography authors of universal horrors studio s classic films 1931 1946 were highly critical of film s dialogue and claimed much of script seemed to be time killing stuff to pad film s already short running time they wrote that hatton s acting was so bad it wouldn t be acceptable even at a pre production cast get together and table reading much less in movie itself donald c willis a writer who wrote about horror and science fiction films described horror scenes as completely lacking suspense and said film was so flimsy that its three co plots seem to be operating independently of one another keith brown of university of edinburgh in his paper notes on terror film argued that brute man is an example of what he calls terror film a genre distinguishable from horror film due to its emphasis on naturally occurring sources of fear rather than fantastical or otherworldly horror elements brown wrote that creeper character blurs boundary between human and animal on account of his grotesque deformed features but is natural and thus a figure of terror home video for decades after film s theatrical release copies of brute man were unavailable and it became regarded as a lost film however film was eventually discovered and mass produced by admit one a home video distribution company that focused specifically on lesser known b films brute man was first released on betamax and vhs in 1982 by
