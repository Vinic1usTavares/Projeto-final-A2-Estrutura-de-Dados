a leadership spill for liberal party of australia was held on 1 december 2009 incumbent leader malcolm turnbull was defeated by tony abbott on second ballot joe hockey also stood as a candidate abbott thus replaced turnbull as leader of opposition and would lead party to 2010 federal election spill was culmination of a dispute within liberal party over its response to rudd government s proposed emissions trading scheme ets turnbull supported introduction of an ets and sought to negotiate amendments to government s proposed legislation abbott came to represent many liberal mps who were climate change sceptics or otherwise opposed ets after turnbull survived a spill motion a motion to declare leadership vacant against his leadership in late november 2009 abbott declared his candidacy and a subsequent spill was moved on 1 december hockey a moderate who had been a supporter of turnbull s position on ets also stood while hockey had been expected to win he was knocked out in first round of voting abbott subsequently defeated turnbull in second round 42 41 julie bishop who voted for turnbull was re elected unopposed as party s deputy leader background malcolm turnbull was elected to house of representatives in 2004 federal election in january 2007 he was appointed minister for environment and water resources by prime minister john howard after australian labor party defeated howard government in 2007 election turnbull brendan nelson and tony abbott announced they would each contest liberal party leadership nelson defeated turnbull in a ballot after abbott withdrew his candidacy turnbull became shadow treasurer on nelson s frontbench nelson s leadership of liberal party was beset by poor opinion poll numbers there was speculation that turnbull would challenge nelson for leadership in late 2008 however nelson caught turnbull by surprise by calling a snap spill of party s leadership positions while turnbull was returning from an overseas holiday spill was moved on 16 september 2008 turnbull defeated nelson by four votes becoming leader of liberal party and of opposition coalition between liberals and national party nelson later resigned from house of representatives climate change policy dispute turnbull was regarded as a believer in global warming as environment minister he had overseen introduction of an emissions trading scheme ets as a policy of liberal party shortly before howard government s defeat however many of turnbull s fellow mps in coalition were climate change deniers tensions within coalition on climate change policy had contributed to downfall of nelson s leadership as leader of liberal party turnbull supported introduction of an ets in june 2009 he indicated in principle support for an ets proposed by rudd government despite opposition of his coalition partner national party turnbull subsequently outlined coalition s position that it would oppose ets introduced to parliament by government but would be open to negotiating an amended version turnbull s willingness to negotiate with government was met with opposition from some coalition mps by september 2009 australian was reporting that only 12 of 59 liberal backbenchers supported negotiations on 18 october 2009 turnbull fronted a meeting of coalition mps with a proposal to negotiate amendments to government s ets this meeting supported his proposal in what was seen as a test of turnbull s leadership however there was speculation that a number of coalition senators would defy turnbull and cross floor of senate to vote against any ets legislation ets opponents argued that it would be premature for parliament to pass ets legislation before copenhagen summit on climate change divisions within coalition were laid bare in an episode of four corners aired by australian broadcasting corporation on 9 november 2009 program featured coalition s leader in senate nick minchin suggesting that man made climate change was a conspiracy of political left and disputing turnbull s authority to strike a deal with government on ets later in month minchin spoke against ets in senate abbott who had publicly supported ets was now arguing that coalition should abandon policy turnbull attacked abbott s change of mind stating tony has expressed a number of views each of which is at odds with view he expressed before on 23 november 2009 coalition s climate change spokesman ian macfarlane agreed to a deal with government to amend ets legislation amendments provided industry with substantial compensation and exemptions from ets turnbull took deal to liberal mps for formal approval but a majority of backbenchers opposed it turnbull nonetheless claimed he had coalition s support by counting as supporters 20 members of coalition shadow cabinet who he argued should be presumed to support deal this claim was met with rancour by his opponents in coalition anger at turnbull s response to 23 november 2009 meeting triggered a spill motion against his leadership three days later motion was moved by kevin andrews a former minister in howard government but was defeated by a vote of 48 to 35 andrews was not seen as a genuine prospect for leadership so close vote on spill motion was considered a blow to turnbull while abbott supported turnbull at time of andrews spill he subsequently resigned from frontbench several others joined abbott in resigning including nick minchin eric sophie mirabella and tony smith abbott and hockey challenges abbott announced on 27 november one day after turnbull survived kevin andrews spill motion that he would challenge turnbull for leadership abbott committed to withdrawing his candidacy if joe hockey was to challenge abbott confirmed his opposition to ets legislation questioning why australia would legislate for a potentially detrimental economic measure before other countries had committed to do same a newspoll released on 30 november placed hockey at 33 turnbull at 30 and abbott at 19 when voters were asked who would be best person to lead liberal party speculation flourished that hockey would challenge turnbull and hockey consulted senior party dignitaries such as howard and costello about whether he should run hockey faced a dilemma a moderate in liberal party hockey had been a consistent supporter of ets running against turnbull would mean taking leadership with support of party s right wing and climate change sceptics turnbull seized on dilemma claiming hockey had given turnbull his complete support and was still a firm supporter of ets legislation hockey attempted to resolve his dilemma by declaring that as leader he would allow a conscience vote on ets legislation abbott rejected hockey s declaration and reneged on his earlier indication that he would withdraw his candidacy for hockey abbott stated it now seems pretty clear we could change leader to joe and these offensive bills could still go through parliament on hockey s candidacy turnbull claimed that hockey had pledged his opposition to spill motion however it was expected that if spill motion succeeded hockey would stand for leadership against turnbull and abbott hockey was generally expected to win ballot and become leader to end turnbull refused to stand aside as leader insisting he would defeat spill motion hockey later alleged that turnbull had promised he would not stand against hockey if spill motion was successful turnbull denied that he had given and therefore broken any such undertaking results on 1 december 2009 liberal mps convened to consider spill motion to vacate leadership motion passed 48 34 following which turnbull hockey and abbott contested a ballot hockey was seen as favourite to win ballot but was knocked out in first round of voting receiving 23 votes to turnbull s 26 and abbott s 35 a second round of voting ensued in which abbott defeated turnbull by one vote 42 41 fran bailey a supporter of turnbull was absent for vote and there was one vote of no which was recorded as informal julie bishop remained deputy leader of party without being challenged for position abbott thus became third consecutive leader after nelson and turnbull for whom bishop would serve as deputy after ballots bishop declared that she had voted for turnbull although turnbull doubted her loyalty and bishop resorted to proving it by retrieving her ballot papers ballots spill motion to vacate yes 48 no 34 leadership roundsecond round tony abbott 35 42 malcolm turnbull 26 41 joe hockey 23 eliminated aftermath abbott said he was humbled and daunted by his unexpected election while hockey expressed surprise at his defeat upon his election abbott acknowledged his propensity for making controversial public statements which with his catholicism and background as a trainee priest earnt him moniker of mad monk and apologised for all his errors of past a week after ballot abbott named his shadow cabinet hockey remained in key position of shadow treasurer three howard government veterans kevin andrews philip ruddock and bronwyn bishop were recalled from backbench and outspoken national party mp and climate change sceptic barnaby joyce was appointed to shadow finance portfolio turnbull voluntarily moved to backbench under abbott s leadership liberal party voted against ets legislation in senate on 3 december 2009 two liberal senators judith and sue boyce crossed floor to support legislation in february 2010 abbott outlined his alternative climate change policy which would directly fund or subsidise emission reduction measures rather than cap emissions from industry speaking in house of representatives in february 2010 turnbull attacked abbott s climate change policy and praised government s ets legislation he argued that abbott s subsidy based policy would be a recipe for fiscal recklessness turnbull later announced he would leave parliament at end of his term before changing his mind within weeks he claimed that his change of mind was result of his anger at government s decision to delay its ets legislation until 2013 he denied being interested in regaining leadership of liberal party saying i don t think there is any likelihood of that i assure you turnbull subsequently gave qualified support to abbott s climate change policy arguing that while it was inferior to an ets in principle it was preferable to government s approach of delaying action until 2013 while it was third leadership spill motion in three years liberal party did not attempt another spill motion for six years after until february 2015 leadership spill motion which was defeated 61 votes to 39 in september 2015 malcolm turnbull called for another spill directly challenging tony abbott in a rematch between two and winning vote 54 44 to return to position of leader of liberal party and as a result displaced abbott as prime minister of australia for hockey it is viewed that his failure to come up with a firm position on ets had blown what turned out to be his only chance to become liberal leader in 2009 when prime minister tony abbott s leadership came under question in 2014 and 2015 hockey
