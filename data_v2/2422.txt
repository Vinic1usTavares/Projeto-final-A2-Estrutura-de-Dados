parts of scheme have been finished but other sections are still being built and one major aspect of original plan was refused planning permission site a steeply sloping hillside between a main railway line and one of brighton s main roads had been home of a railway locomotive works and goods yard for more than a century high density housing was built at same time and surrounded railway buildings from 1960s area fell into decline works and goods yard were closed and demolished and most of housing was cleared this left large areas of derelict land which attracted small scale redevelopment and transient commercial enterprises proposals for redevelopment were made from 1980s onwards in 2001 a master plan was granted planning permission by brighton and hove city council site clearance work followed and construction began in 2004 new england quarter consists of separately planned areas called blocks in master plan connected by new or altered road infrastructure and pedestrian links land use includes private and council housing of various styles and configurations office and retail space a college a hotel public space and community facilities some of residential development aims to meet high environmental and sustainability standards and green space is being provided on former railway land scheme has attracted criticism from various sources and certain aspects and proposals have been particularly controversial a planned 42 storey hotel and residential building on one block which was not in original plan and for which planning permission was later denied was opposed by many local people and politicians and was eventually rejected by a government minister on appeal decision to allow a large supermarket branch to be built in middle of development was also unpopular a

anticipated that most guests will arrive by train as station is immediately adjacent controversy arose over a proposal raised after master plan was approved in principle to build a 42 storey tower incorporating a large number of residential units and other facilities in addition to already approved hotel skyscraper was proposed by beetham organization a british property investment company and would have been similar in scale and appearance to other recently built beetham towers in liverpool manchester and birmingham architects allies and morrison drew up design there was much criticism of design its height and proposed location both from local councillors of all parties and from people in local community see also criticism and controversy section planning permission was denied in april 2005 but beetham organization lodged an appeal and a public inquiry was held in november 2006 ruth kelly secretary of state for communities and local government was responsible for deciding whether to overrule council s decision and approve tower a final decision on site was initially expected in february 2007 but inquiry eventually continued until 17 may 2007 when decision to refuse planning permission was upheld as well as agreeing with council s original argument that tower would not fit into local area and would have a harmful effect on surrounding conservation areas such as north laine and st bartholomew s church kelly stated that proposal would give insufficient benefit in terms of regeneration of area and did not offer enough outdoor leisure and recreation space future of block j site is undecided as a result of this however within four days of decision beetham organization announced that it intended to submit plans for an alternative scheme which it would develop in consultation with city council block k was acquired by jurys doyle hotel group plc which operated hotels under jurys inn brand until it sold its portfolio in 2007 it houses a three star hotel built

600 spaces although form which this had to take was not specified and various proposals were considered including a taller multi storey structure with more floors and a much smaller ground area during construction works a temporary car park was provided on land nearby there is relatively little parking elsewhere on site other than 190 space facility at sainsbury s supermarket this is partly mitigated by retention of london road multi storey car park located between block c and a23 london road itself residential areas in particular have very few dedicated parking spaces block k will have

been created largest change has been downgrading of former through route of new england street in favour of a new north south road fleet street which diverges to west this has allowed a large part of new england street to be narrowed pedestrianised and provided with cycle lanes in contrast cheapside is expected to take a much higher volume of traffic as it becomes main east west route in new

disused railway track which has for some time been designated a site of special nature conservation importance snci this is defined as a locally important site of nature conservation adopted by local authorities for planning purposes this will be maintained and improved to create a green corridor called greenway which will run from embankment overlooking new england road at northernmost point of site beyond blocks l and m through to station northern section which is already partly wooded and home to a variety of wildlife will be maintained in this condition housing developed by crest

brighton urban design development budd is a campaign group which was set up in february 1997 in response to original planning application for a sainsbury s superstore and car park on what is now new england quarter site although initially created to oppose and protest against these original plans it has subsequently developed into an all encompassing point of contact for all issues relating to new england quarter and its stated aim is now to stimulate encourage and initiate sustainable urban design and development through an inclusive participatory process to combat social exclusion and to generate schemes that integrate social cultural and environmental benefits to brighton and hove in 1999 brighton hove council awarded group a grant which enabled it to register as an industrial and provident society noting that it was providing a significant community benefit by providing a process for disparate communities of interest to develop their views and become involved in planning and decision making process budd held a public meeting was on 24 july 1997 at which 99 of approximately 300 people who attended voted against original planning application which had been submitted in may following several months of preparation a 4 317 name petition to same effect was submitted to council three months later marches and rallies also took place after new master plan was submitted and approved further action was taken by protestors this was focused on harvest forestry building at corner of new england street and cheapside which was squatted for a time schnews schnews a weekly

category and a hotel with ancillary facilities including a restaurant cafes conference facilities and a health and fitness centre one six storey building with retail units a1 and a3 category and a

and st bartholomew s church reduction in quality of surrounding public spaces lack of provision of outdoor recreation space negative effect on surrounding microclimate and loss of sunlight to nearby buildings and failure to consider fully impact on transport reasons for rejection were supported by various people and groups within city such as regency society which is involved with planning and
