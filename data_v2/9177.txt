chris owens from a distance they meet an old man who angrily tells them that there are no monsters and sends them to see his son a geneticist named francis pollidori john o hurley dr pollidori shows them his experiments studying hox gene using fruit fly drosophila this presentation includes images of a mutated fly whose legs are growing out of its mouth he tells agents that same kind of

alt title page for original pressing of frankenstein going into fifth season of x files series creator chris carter noted we knew we were going to be hitting these very dramatic marks which were mythology episodes and we wanted to lighten or leaven season with quirky episodes carter wanted to write a frankenstein inspired episode but found it difficult to reconcile mary shelley s unbelievable tale with style of show to achieve his vision he wrote a script that blurred real world with x files reality and that had a distinct fantasy element carter combined elements of original story with fairy tales and elements of folk tales in order to make episode as moving as possible carter sought to echo elements of james whale s 1931 film version of frankenstein he later noted that by using modern science i took an old style which is black and white and an old approach which is a kind of james whale approach to science fiction and came up with a story about a love lorn monster genetic engineering aspect of story was developed with assistance from series science adviser anne simon carter visited a friend of simon a scientist at indiana university in bloomington who had been able to genetically manipulate flies so that they grew legs from their eyes after carter had created character of great mutato he discovered that cartoonist matt groening had already created a character with same name although with different pronunciation for a comic book entry of simpsons carter contacted groening who gave carter permission to use name like two thirds of episodes of series post modern prometheus is a monster of week episode a stand alone plot which is unconnected to overarching mythology of x files casting thumb upright left after viewing episode singer cher came to regret turning down a cameo appearance cher s music plays a large role in post modern prometheus chris carter having written episode after spending a summer listening to cher records and developing a fixation on singer carter knew that cher s half sister lapiere was a major x files fan and carter learned through lapiere that cher herself was intrigued by show and would be interested in making an x files guest appearance sitcom star roseanne barr also expressed an interest in guesting on x files and carter wrote part of shaineh berkowitz specifically for her barr however was unavailable at time of shooting her projected role was filled by pattie tierce while cher passed on proffered cameo appearance performing as herself a decision for which she later expressed regret i wanted them to ask me to come on and act then they just wanted me to come on and sing just to come on and be myself wasn t anything i d want to do until i saw finished episode had i foreseen quality of it i would have done it in a heartbeat cher did authorize use of three of her tracks on episode s soundtrack including walking in memphis heard at episode s conclusion while ostensibly performed onstage by celebrity impersonator tracey bell filmed in longshot or from back or overheard as cher although bell was credited for role cher s fans responded to episode s premiere with online speculation as to whether singer had pseudonymously appeared in episode tabloid talk show host jerry springer appeared as himself these casting choices went against a long standing tradition on x files of only casting actors who were not well known seinfeld regular john o hurley had auditioned for several roles on show but carter had not previously thought of him as an x files actor for part of dr pollidori however carter considered him absolute perfect casting choice stewart gale who portrayed izzy berkowitz was a non actor who carter saw literally on street one day sitting in a car carter convinced gale s father who was initially suspicious of director s credentials to let gale travel to vancouver to take part in episode izzy s friends were also played by inexperienced actors one worked as a snake handler on set of x files feature film shooting of which overlapped that of season five and other worked at a vancouver coffee shop that carter frequented chris owens played great mutato and to many he was unrecognizable in heavy makeup owens had played a younger version of smoking man in two episodes of season four and was later cast as recurring character of fbi special agent jeffrey spender during his audition owens noted chris said okay did you ever see elephant man what i m looking for is dignity he s got dignity but he s definitely mutated after owens heeded carter s instructions and attempted to bring dignity to audition carter requested that he try it again with less autism hurwitz and knowles 2008 p 119 filming thumb 200px right director chris carter shot episode using a wide angle lens alt image shows a cross section of a wide angle lens first five seasons of x files including post modern prometheus were filmed in vancouver it was third episode of program that carter directed he decided to film episode in black and white in homage to james whale which brought more challenges than he expected director of photography joel ransom had to spend longer than usual lighting set because of use of grayscale stormy skies in episode added to emulate atmosphere of old frankenstein movies were a visual effect carter also used a wide angle camera lens throughout episode which forced actors to act directly to camera rather than to each other according to carter it also enabled him to give scenes in episode a more surreal staging than was usual for show makeup for character of great mutato was designed and created by special effects supervisor tony lindala mutato mask went through several design iterations on paper including 10 15 drawings and a color rendition constructed from latex and containing an articulated second mouth it cost 40 000 and took between five and seven hours to apply in addition to mask chris owens wore contact lenses and dentures owens later recalled that makeup had taken seven hours and then i had sat around for three or four and now i was going to sit in dark and i could only see out of one eye they put a big contact lens in initial versions of costume were deemed too human looking and so a newer design was chosen lindala also created baby mutato costumes for twin infants featured in jerry springer show scene but production crew had difficulty keeping costumes on children lindala later said t he little babies kept tearing their hair off we kept gluing it back on lindala was happy that episode was filmed in black and white because it helped prosthetic because it is difficult to work in a foam piece that long and not recognize it as a painted opaque false translucency lindala later called filming technique saving grace of episode in addition he later submitted his makeup for episode to academy of television arts sciences in an attempt to be nominated for an emmy award music and cultural references episode was scored by series composer mark snow and was according to him his best episode score of fifth season he described main theme as a very dark macabre insidious sort of nasty waltz episode s main theme is also greatly inspired by elephant man s theme song by john morris three songs are heard in versions sung by cher during episode sun ain t gonna shine anymore gypsies tramps thieves and walking in memphis latter is played at end of episode when agents take great mutato to a cher concert in episode character watches cher s 1985 movie mask and derives comfort from loving relationship between cher s character and her son who has a disfiguring genetic bone disorder at end of episode mulder and scully take great mutato from his small town to a cher concert where she picks him out of crowd to dance episode contains several cultural references first episode s title is a reference to both subtitle for shelley s original novel modern prometheus and to postmodernist school of thought postmodernism has been described as a style and concept in arts architecture and criticism that is characterized by self conscious use of earlier styles and conventions a mixing of different artistic styles and media and a general distrust of theories furthermore frankenstein like doctor shares name albeit with a slightly different spelling of shelley s contemporary john william polidori who was present at conception of her novel several lines in episode come directly from james whale s 1931 movie frankenstein themes post modern prometheus is most obvious reference to frankenstein made by series although traces of story are seen elsewhere in first season episode young at heart and sixth season episode beginning in addition series overarching mythology revolves around shadowy syndicate leaders who salvage alien spacecraft for their own technological use and create human alien hybrids episode contains themes relating to motherhood and sexuality according to film studies writer linda this episode and season four s home foreshadow scully s impending motherhood and her realization in following episodes christmas carol and emily that she has been used to create a human alien hybrid emily diane negra in her book off white hollywood american culture and ethnic female stardom points out that while great mutato impregnates both shaineh berkowitz and elizabeth pollidori without their consent or knowledge it is an oversimplification to label monster as a rapist because both berkowitz and pollidori desire for children through unconventional means thus mutato s acts allow for two women to get what they desperately desire in a moment of magical resolution eric bumpus and tim moranville in their book cease fire war is over propose that episode and by extension series as a whole is a rejection of modernity s naturalism and an acceptance of post modernity s mystic supernaturalism two argue that while in stereotypical great science fiction monster created usually runs amok in post modern prometheus creature is a lovable success furthermore indiana townspeople represent religious nuts who in end turn out to be right bumpus and moranville consider them secondary heroes of episode right after great mutato himself despite her physical absence from entry cher s presence can be felt throughout narrative negra argues that cher s flamboyant and self authored body is used as a metaphor for possibility of self transformation in addition her voice heard via songs like walking in memphis is associated with idea of circumvent ing patriarchy negra notes that cher s music is used in scenes during great mutato s sexual encounters with women negra asserts that this juxtaposition of sound and image cues our perception that we have entered realm of carnival where normal order of things is inverted negra 2001 p 177 emily vanderwerff of a v club reasons that ending was not actual conclusion of episode but rather fanciful and elaborate happy ending that was concocted by izzy berkowitz writer of comic book after talking to mulder in this manner notes episode abandons logic and reality and for lack of a better word transcends meghan deans from tor com postulates that entire episode never happened f rom a canonical perspective due to entry s comic book setting various meta references and happy ending reception chris carter was nominated for both outstanding writing and outstanding directing at 50th primetime emmy awards 250px thumb right alt picture shows several people sitting at a table one in center has white hair and is looking up ratings post modern prometheus

gunmen rated episode two stars out of five and criticized various elements of episode s direction they wrote chris carter writer has come up with something playful and light and charming and chris
