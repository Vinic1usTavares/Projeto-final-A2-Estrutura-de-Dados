1994 s youthanasia and 1997 s cryptic writings followed a similar route with latter spawning four top 20 hits frontman dave mustaine speaking about band s commercial breakthrough said i think a lot of our success now has to do with fact that we re willing to study marketplace and educate ourselves most musicians don t get opportunity to go into market with educated strategy fortunately for us our management educated us on how to study what s current without losing our integrity and to keep on edge while staying at forefront of what s important right now according to guitarist marty friedman it took band a year to prepare record from note one to mixing a lot of material was written during tour and some of it afterwards as friedman said songs came together naturally because band wasn t rushed to get a record out album was produced by dann huff who had his producing debut with megadeth band chose to work with huff because they were not satisfied with max norman producer of their previous record mustaine explained why he decided to quit collaboration with norman max came up with this bullshit formula that every song had to be 120 beats per minute to get on radio when people make drastic decisions to do things like that and it backfires it usually ends up in one way or another costing them their jobs before start of recording sessions bassist david ellefson stated that band doesn t want their seventh studio album to sound like anything they have already recorded instrumentally band introduced a more melodic mix than previous albums filled with crunchy riffs and speedy guitar solos in addition mustaine re evaluated band s songwriting techniques recasting some lyrics to better reflect sales and radio airplay environment of then s rock arena according to him many of song s lyrics were altered in order to make music a little more inclusive of people who aren t into dying and evil ellefson commented that this album was a natural progression in megadeth s sound he
