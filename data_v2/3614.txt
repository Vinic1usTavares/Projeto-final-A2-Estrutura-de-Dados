barndoor skate dipturus laevis is a species of marine cartilaginous fish in skate family of order it is native to northwestern atlantic ocean and is found from grand banks of newfoundland and southern side of gulf of st lawrence south to north carolina fish is one of largest skates found in north atlantic ocean reaching lengths up to it is carnivorous feeding on invertebrates and other fish found near sea floor after peaking in 1950s population of barndoor skate dramatically declined in 1960s and early 1970s as a result of overfishing in 2003 it was listed as endangered by world conservation union barndoor skate populations have increased substantially since 1990 in most cases barndoor skate is not intentionally harvested by commercial fishing industry it is usually considered bycatch in trawling nets used to target other species of fish description thumb left skeleton barndoor skate is a flat bodied fish with a large disk like body with sharply angled corners and a pointed snout its pectoral fins have evolved into broad flat wing like appendages used to propel fish through water these fins have a concave front edge with rounded posterior corners like sharks it has a boneless skeleton made of cartilage a tough elastic substance composed of collagenous and or elastic fibers cells and a firm gel like substance called matrix it has slot like body openings called gill slits on underside of body beneath pectoral fins that lead from gills dorsal fins are close together and far removed from tail it has two eyes on its dorsal surface located about apart fish s upper surface is brown to reddish brown with many scattered darker spots lighter streaks and reticulations center of each pectoral fin is marked with an oval spot or lower surface is light white to grey blotched irregularly with gray spots barndoor skate is unique from other species of skate in its having a straight line that begins at snout and ends at anterior margin of outer corner of disk but stopping short of disk barndoor skate is one of largest skates found in north atlantic ocean it can reach lengths of up to and can weigh up to there have been unconfirmed reports of individuals reaching lengths of a barndoor skate typically weighs tail is moderately short and does not have large thorn like structures called dermal denticles that are normally found on skates this lack of denticles distinguishes it from all but two species of skates found in western atlantic larger individuals do have three rows of smaller denticles on tail and mature females also possess denticles on head and shoulders and along dorsal of disk and tail denticles are completely absent on small individuals habitat barndoor skate occurs in a range extending from banks of newfoundland southern gulf of st lawrence and along northeastern coast and offshore banks of nova scotia south to north carolina reports in 19th century said range of fish extended as far south as northeastern florida but more recent research suggests that florida discoveries may have actually been a misidentification of r floridana it is found on various types of ocean bottoms including soft muddy sandy and rocky bottoms it can be found from shoreline to depths to although it is most commonly found at depths less than it inhabits waters in a broad range of temperatures from just above freezing to it appears to move closer to shore in autumn and further out to sea in warmer months it tolerates brackish water where salinity is as low as 21 to 24 parts per thousand but it prefers salinity between 31 and 35 parts per thousand it is believed to not exhibit any north south migratory patterns diet fish is carnivorous with its prey consisting mainly of benthic invertebrates and fishes such food items include polychaetes gastropods bivalve mollusks rock crabs cancer crabs spider crabs lobsters shrimps squids and fishes including spiny dogfish alewife atlantic herring menhaden hakes sculpins tautog sand lance and various flounders juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes copepods amphipods isopods shrimp and individuals have been found with denticles on snout worn smooth indicating that snout is used to dig in mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks importance to humans barndoor skate is one of five skates in gulf of maine that has commercial value but of those species that are most frequently targeted are winter skate ocellata and thorny skate radiata barndoor skate is most commonly considered bycatch by commercial trawlers operating in northwestern atlantic that target other commercially valuable species of fish using bottom trawling when harvested flesh of barndoor skate is used as bait fish meal and pet food and meat from its wings is sold for human consumption since 1981 landings of skates have increased substantially partly in response to increased demand for lobster bait and more significantly to increased export market for skate wings currently commercial retention and sale of barndoor skates is prohibited in united states conservation thumb barndoor skate caught during an noaa research cruise abundances of barndoor skate dropped precipitously in 1960s and early 1970s coinciding with period of intense fishing by foreign factory trawlers abundance remained very low through around 1990 but increased nearly exponentially from 1990 2005 and have been approaching levels observed in 1960s in 1998 casey and myers published a controversial study claiming that barndoor skate was nearly extinct however they only presented data through 1993 so recovery that started in early 1990s was not clearly evident in 1999 two conservation groups based in cambridge massachusetts and center for marine conservation based in washington dc petitioned national marine fisheries service nmfs to have barndoor skate listed under endangered species act after a 12 month study nmfs announced in 2002 that listing species as endangered or threatened was not warranted it cited increases in abundance and biomass of barndoor skate observed during surveys since 1993 which had become quite rapid by that time in 1994 world conservation union had listed barndoor skate as vulnerable under 1994 categories and criteria but in 2003 it reassessed species as endangered on iucn red list each year national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa estimates current population levels for a variety of aquatic species of special interest and releases an annual report showing progress being made to reduce harvesting of overfished species when a species has been determined to be either overfished or subject to overfishing regional fishery management councils are required to develop a plan to correct problem in 2006 noaa published a press release stating that as a result of conservation efforts between 2004 and 2005 monitored stocks of barndoor skate had grown to a level that noaa no longer considers overfished taxonomy and naming fish was originally described as raja laevis by samuel latham in 1818 scientific name was later changed to currently valid name dipturus laevis it has also been misidentified as raia granulata by theodore gill an american ichthyologist in 1879 genus name dipturus is derived from greek words di meaning two and meaning wing raja original genus which was coined by carl linnaeus in 1758 is still recognized as a valid subgenus see also fisheries management references external links iucn red list entry barndoor skate category fauna of newfoundland and labrador category natural history of nova scotia
