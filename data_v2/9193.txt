hiroshi matsuyama stated cyberconnect2 staff wanted to fix issues in original storm game naruto shippuden ultimate ninja storm 2 had been in development by cyberconnect2 s fukuoka studio in japan since release of first naruto shippuden ultimate ninja storm title because of series worldwide popularity cyberconnect2 decided to release it for first time for xbox 360 consoles multiplayer feature was added based on player feedback from first game adding other new features was a matter of trial and error in addition to balancing all elements so each character has a fair chance of winning a fight for example in a fight between young naruto and jiraiya staff made adjustments so it was equally fun and empowering playing either character team wanted to recreate look and feel of comics during videos and cinematic sequences this required going through game adjusting elements to fit this objective while ensuring gameplay remained responsive all sequences were worked out beforehand using storyboards then gameplay elements were created before aesthetic and sound design parts were added team found this challenging as their goal was to make these sequences of same quality as anime in contrast to ultimate ninja games made for playstation 2 team was able to add more strategy for next generation of consoles for example storm 2 allowed players use two assistant characters masashi kishimoto supervised game s contents and approved many of original sections of game s story mode finding them well made cyberconnect2 worked to make storm 2 more appealing than its prequel by adding more special effects and scenes with different angles this is evident mainly in game s boss battles where environment changes as fights continue in one example sakura haruno and chiyo fight boss sasori as battle continues cave in which characters are fighting is destroyed which team said was difficult to do in other boss battles fighting system changes an example being when gaara has to use projectile techniques while flying around his village chasing staff visited fansites where first storm game was discussed and listened to issues fans raised and addressed them so that they and new gamers would notice improvements team made to sequel result was that even gamers who were not familiar with franchise found sequel interesting ceo hiroshi matsuyama said that one of most important battles he wanted to create was fight between sasuke uchiha and his brother itachi itachi was matsuyama s favorite character and he felt emotional while developing fight besides including cast of naruto in their older forms game features lars alexandersson from tekken fighting series his design attracted matsuyama who asked tekken staff if he could include lars members from both naruto and tekken games staff were surprised by how well he fitted in with cast although lars does not have a story in game matsuyama expected gamers to enjoy playing as him in regular battles and online gameplay artificial intelligence was improved to make characters fights more entertaining alongside new boss fights matsuyama refrained from including downloadable content in game release naruto

complimented story mode as well as presentation of graphics which might attract gamers or appeal to players who are not too familiar with naruto series ign s reviewer complimented game saying while he was not a fan of naruto he was impressed by game s narrative to point of caring about characters fates another reviewer felt that some parts might confuse some gamers reviewer for gametrailers found

good sequel based on new characters new modes as well as its online mode inclusion of tekken guest character lars alexandersson was also well received by writers other criticisms of game were that characters had similar moves and that sidequests do not involve fights while visuals were praised world map was criticized for not having many activities other than finding items some criticized characters interactions other criticism included noticeably long loading times that occur during story mode as well as similarities between characters moves which made sequel lack appeal of famous fighting games on other hand engadget applauded breadth of strategies in fights and fact that players have to focus on interrupting their enemy s charging while trying to recharge themselves use of items within fights as well as sub missions has prompted some to compare game with eastern role playing games gamezone said worst aspect of game was its multiple use of arenas reviewers had mixed opinions about audio soundtrack and use of both english and japanese voices was praised while one reviewer found cast unlikable and disliked plot and voiceovers sales namco bandai hoped ultimate ninja
