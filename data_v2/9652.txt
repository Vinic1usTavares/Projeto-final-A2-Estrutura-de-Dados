thumb 400px eniac main control panel at moore school of electrical engineering history of numerical weather prediction considers how current weather conditions as input into mathematical models of atmosphere and oceans to predict weather and future sea state process of numerical weather prediction has changed over years though first attempted manually in 1920s it was not until advent of computer and computer simulation that computation time was reduced to less than forecast period itself eniac was used to create first forecasts via computer in 1950 and over years more powerful computers have been used to increase size of initial datasets as well as include more complicated versions of equations of motion development of global forecasting models led to first climate models development of limited area regional models facilitated advances in forecasting tracks of tropical cyclone as well as air quality in 1970s and 1980s because output of forecast models based on atmospheric dynamics requires corrections near ground level model output statistics mos were developed in 1970s and 1980s for individual forecast points locations mos apply statistical techniques to post process output of dynamical models with most recent surface observations and forecast point s climatology this technique can correct for model resolution as well as model biases even with increasing power of supercomputers forecast skill of numerical weather models only extends to about two weeks into future since density and quality of observations together with chaotic nature of partial differential equations used to calculate forecast introduce errors which double every five days use of model ensemble forecasts since 1990s helps to define forecast uncertainty and extend weather forecasting farther into future than otherwise possible background until end of 19th century weather prediction was entirely subjective and based on empirical rules with only limited understanding of physical mechanisms behind weather processes in 1901 cleveland abbe founder of united states weather bureau proposed that atmosphere is governed by same principles of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics that were studied in previous century in 1904 vilhelm bjerknes derived a two step procedure for model based weather forecasting first a diagnostic step is used to process data to generate initial conditions which are then advanced in time by a prognostic step that solves initial value problem he also identified seven variables that defined state of atmosphere at a given point pressure temperature density humidity and three components of flow velocity vector bjerknes pointed out that equations based on mass continuity conservation of momentum first and second laws of thermodynamics and ideal gas law could be used to estimate state of atmosphere in future through numerical methods with exception of second law of thermodynamics these equations form basis of primitive equations used in present day weather models in 1922 lewis fry richardson published first attempt at forecasting weather numerically using a hydrostatic variation of bjerknes s primitive equations richardson produced by hand a 6 hour forecast for state of atmosphere over two points in central europe taking at least six weeks to do so his forecast calculated that change in surface pressure would be an unrealistic value incorrect by two orders of magnitude large error was caused by an imbalance in pressure and wind velocity fields used as initial conditions in his analysis first successful numerical prediction was performed using eniac digital computer in 1950 by a team composed of american meteorologists jule charney philip thompson larry gates and norwegian meteorologist ragnar applied mathematician john von neumann and computer programmer klara dan von neumann they used a simplified form of atmospheric dynamics based on solving barotropic vorticity equation over a single layer of atmosphere by computing geopotential height of atmosphere s pressure surface this simplification greatly reduced demands on computer time and memory so computations could be performed on relatively primitive computers of day when news of first weather forecast by eniac was received by richardson in 1950 he remarked that results were an enormous scientific advance first calculations for a 24 hour forecast took eniac nearly 24 hours to produce but charney s group noted that most of that time was spent in manual operations and expressed hope that forecasts of weather before it occurs would soon be realized 280px thumb an example of 500 mbar geopotential height prediction from a numerical weather prediction model it also shows an omega block in united kingdom meteorological office first numerical weather prediction was completed by f h bushby and mavis hinds in 1952 under guidance of john sawyer these experimental forecasts were generated using a 12 x 8 grid with a grid spacing of 260 km a one hour time step and required four hours of computing time for a 24 hour forecast on edsac computer at university of cambridge and leo computer developed by j lyons and co following these initial experiments work moved to ferranti mark 1 computer at manchester university department of electrical engineering and in 1959 a ferranti mercury computer known as meteor was installed at met office 30px this article contains quotations from this source which is available under open government licence v3 0 c crown copyright early years in september 1954 carl gustav rossby assembled an international group of meteorologists in stockholm and produced first operational forecast i e routine predictions for practical use based on barotropic equation operational numerical weather prediction in united states began in 1955 under joint numerical weather prediction unit jnwpu a joint project by u s air force navy and weather bureau jnwpu model was originally a three layer barotropic model also developed by charney it only modeled atmosphere in northern hemisphere in 1956 jnwpu switched to a two layer thermotropic model developed by thompson and gates main assumption made by thermotropic model is that while magnitude of thermal wind may change its direction does not change with respect to height and thus baroclinicity in atmosphere can be simulated using and geopotential height surfaces and average thermal wind between them however due to low skill showed by thermotropic model jnwpu reverted to single layer barotropic model in 1958 japanese meteorological agency became third organization to initiate operational numerical weather prediction in 1959 first real time forecasts made by australia s bureau of meteorology in 1969 for portions of southern hemisphere were also based on single layer barotropic model later models used more complete equations for atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics in 1959 karl heinz hinkelmann produced first reasonable primitive equation forecast 37 years after richardson s failed attempt hinkelmann did so by removing small oscillations from numerical model during initialization in 1966 west germany and united states began producing operational forecasts based on primitive equation models followed by united kingdom in 1972 and australia in 1977 later additions to primitive equation models allowed additional insight into different weather phenomena in united states solar radiation effects were added to primitive equation model in 1967 moisture effects and latent heat were added in 1968 and feedback effects from rain on convection were incorporated in 1971 three years later first global forecast model was introduced sea ice began to be initialized in forecast models in 1971 efforts to involve sea surface temperature in model initialization began in 1972 due to its role in modulating weather in higher latitudes of pacific global forecast models thumb 280 px right models use systems of differential equations based on laws of physics fluid motion and chemistry and use a coordinate system which divides planet into a 3d grid winds heat transfer radiation relative humidity and surface hydrology are calculated within each grid and evaluate interactions with neighboring points a global forecast model is a weather forecasting model which and forecasts weather throughout earth s troposphere it is a computer program that produces meteorological information for future times at given locations and altitudes within any modern model is a set of equations known as primitive equations used to predict future state of atmosphere these equations along with ideal gas law are used to evolve density pressure and potential temperature scalar fields and flow velocity vector field of atmosphere through time additional transport equations for pollutants and other aerosols are included in some primitive equation high resolution models as well equations used are nonlinear partial differential equations which are impossible to solve exactly through analytical methods with exception of a few idealized cases therefore numerical methods obtain approximate solutions different models use different solution methods some global models and almost all regional models use finite difference methods for all three spatial dimensions while other global models and a few regional models use spectral methods for horizontal dimensions and finite difference methods in vertical national meteorological center s global spectral model was introduced during august 1980 european centre for medium range weather forecasts model debuted on may 1 1985 united kingdom met office has been running their global model since late 1980s adding a 3d var data assimilation scheme in mid 1999 canadian meteorological centre has been running a global model since 1991 united states ran nested grid model ngm from 1987 to 2000 with some features lasting as late as 2009 between 2000 and 2002 environmental modeling center ran aviation avn model for shorter range forecasts and medium range forecast mrf model at longer time ranges during this time avn model was extended to end of forecast period eliminating need of mrf and thereby replacing it in late 2002 avn model was renamed global forecast system gfs german weather service has been running their global hydrostatic model gme using a hexagonal icosahedral grid since 2002 gfs is slated to eventually be supplanted by flow following finite volume icosahedral model fim which like gme is gridded on a truncated icosahedron in mid 2010s global climate models in 1956 norman a phillips developed a mathematical model which could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in troposphere which became first successful climate model following phillips s work several groups began working to create general circulation models first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in late 1960s at noaa geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory by early 1980s united states national center for atmospheric research had developed community atmosphere model this model has been continuously refined into 2000s in 1986 efforts began to initialize and model soil and vegetation types which led to more realistic forecasts for example center for ocean land atmosphere studies cola model showed a warm temperature bias of 2 4 degc 4 7 degf and a low precipitation bias due to incorrect parameterization of crop and vegetation type across central united states coupled ocean atmosphere climate models such as hadley centre for climate prediction and research s model are currently being used as inputs for climate change studies importance of gravity waves was neglected within these models until mid 1980s now gravity waves are required within global climate models in order to properly simulate regional and global scale circulations though their broad spectrum makes their incorporation complicated climate system model csm was developed at national center for atmospheric research in january 1994 limited area models horizontal domain of a model is either global covering entire earth or regional covering only part of earth regional models also known as limited area models or lams allow for use of finer or smaller grid spacing than global models available computational resources are focused on a specific area instead of being spread over globe this allows regional models to resolve explicitly smaller scale meteorological phenomena that cannot be represented on coarser grid of a global model regional models use a global model for initial conditions of edge of their domain in order to allow systems from outside regional model domain to move into its area uncertainty and errors within regional models are introduced by global model used for boundary conditions of edge of regional model as well as errors attributable to regional model itself in united states first operational regional model limited area fine mesh model was introduced in 1971 its development was halted or frozen in 1986 ngm debuted in 1987 and was also used to create model output statistics for united states explanation of current ngm mos national weather service meteorological development lab 1999 retrieved 2010 05 15 its development was frozen in 1991 eta

followed by canadian global environmental multiscale model gem mesoscale model on february 24 1997 german weather service developed high resolution regional model hrm in 1999 which is widely run within operational and research meteorological communities and run with hydrostatic assumptions antarctic mesoscale prediction system amps was developed for southernmost continent in 2000 by united states antarctic program german non hydrostatic lokal modell for europe has been run since 2002 and an increase in areal domain became operational on september 28 2005 japanese meteorological agency has run a high resolution non hydrostatic mesoscale model since september 2004 air quality models thumb right visualization of a buoyant gaussian air pollutant dispersion plume technical literature on air pollution dispersion is quite extensive and dates back to 1930s and earlier one of early air pollutant plume dispersion equations was derived by bosanquet and pearson bosanquet c h and pearson j l spread of smoke and gases from chimneys transactions of faraday society 32 1249 1936 their equation did not assume gaussian distribution nor did it include effect of ground reflection of pollutant plume sir graham sutton derived an air pollutant plume dispersion equation in 1947 which did include assumption of gaussian distribution for vertical and crosswind dispersion of plume and also included effect of ground reflection of plume sutton o g problem of diffusion in lower atmosphere quarterly journal of royal meteorological society 73 257 1947 and theoretical distribution of airborne pollution from factory chimneys quarterly journal of royal meteorological society 73 426 1947 under stimulus provided by advent of stringent environmental control regulations there was an immense growth in use of air pollutant plume dispersion calculations between late 1960s and today a great many computer programs for calculating dispersion of air pollutant emissions were developed during that period of time and they were called air dispersion models basis for most of those models was complete equation for gaussian dispersion modeling of continuous buoyant air pollution plumes gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation requires input of h which is pollutant plume s centerline height above ground level and h is sum of hs actual physical height of pollutant plume s emission source point plus dh plume rise due plume s buoyancy to determine dh many if not most of air dispersion models developed between late 1960s and early 2000s used what are known as briggs equations g a briggs first published his plume rise observations and comparisons in 1965 briggs g a a plume rise model compared with observations journal of air pollution control association 15 433 438 1965 in 1968 at a

discussion chimney plumes in neutral and stable surroundings atmospheric environment 6 507 510 1972 urban model a regional forecast model for effects of air pollution and acid rain was developed by a private company in us in 1970 development of this model was taken over by environmental protection agency and improved in mid to late 1970s using results from a regional air pollution study while developed in california this model was later used in other areas of north america europe and asia during 1980s community multiscale air quality model is an open source air quality model run within united states in conjunction with nam mesoscale model since 2004 first operational air quality model in canada canadian hemispheric and regional ozone and nox system chronos began to be run in 2001 it was replaced with global environmental multiscale model modelling air quality and chemistry gem mach model in november 2009 tropical cyclone models thumb 260px top wrf model simulation of hurricane rita tracks bottom spread of nhc multi model ensemble forecast during 1972 first model to forecast storm surge along continental shelf was developed known as special program to list amplitude of surges from hurricanes splash in 1978 first hurricane tracking model based on atmospheric dynamics movable fine mesh mfm model began operating within field of tropical cyclone track forecasting despite ever improving dynamical model guidance which occurred with increased computational power it was not until decade of 1980s when numerical weather prediction showed skill and until 1990s when it consistently outperformed statistical or simple dynamical models in early 1980s assimilation of satellite derived winds from water vapor infrared and visible satellite imagery was found to improve tropical cyclones track forecasting geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl hurricane model was used for research purposes between 1973 and mid 1980s once it was determined that it could show skill in hurricane prediction a multi year transition transformed research model into an operational model which could be used by national weather service in 1995 hurricane weather research and forecasting model is a specialized version of weather research and forecasting wrf model and is used to forecast track and intensity of tropical cyclones model was developed by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa u s naval research laboratory university of rhode island and florida state university it became operational in 2007 despite improvements in track forecasting predictions of intensity of a tropical cyclone based on numerical weather prediction continue to be a challenge since methods continue to show higher skill over dynamical guidance ocean models first ocean wave models were developed in 1960s and 1970s these models had tendency to overestimate role of wind in wave development and underplayed wave interactions a lack of knowledge concerning how waves interacted among each other assumptions regarding a maximum wave height and deficiencies in computer power limited performance of models after experiments were performed in 1968 1969 and 1973 wind input from earth s atmosphere was weighted more accurately in predictions a second generation of models was developed in 1980s but they could not realistically model swell nor depict wind driven waves also known as wind waves caused by rapidly changing wind fields such as those within tropical cyclones this caused development of a third generation of wave models from 1988 onward within this third generation of models spectral wave transport equation is used to describe change in wave spectrum over changing topography it simulates wave generation wave movement propagation within a fluid wave shoaling refraction energy transfer between waves and wave dissipation since surface winds are primary forcing mechanism in spectral wave transport equation ocean wave models use information produced by numerical weather prediction models as inputs to determine how much energy is transferred from atmosphere into layer at surface of ocean along with dissipation of energy through whitecaps and resonance between waves surface winds from numerical weather models allow for more accurate predictions of state of sea surface model output statistics because forecast models based upon equations for atmospheric dynamics do not perfectly determine weather conditions near ground statistical corrections were developed to attempt to resolve this problem statistical models were created based upon three dimensional fields produced by numerical weather models surface observations and climatological conditions for specific locations these statistical models are collectively referred to as model output statistics mos and were developed by national weather service for their suite of weather forecasting models by 1976 united states air force developed its own set of mos based upon their dynamical weather model by 1983 ensembles as proposed by edward lorenz in 1963 it is impossible for long range forecasts those made more than two weeks in advance to predict state of atmosphere with any degree of skill owing to chaotic nature of fluid dynamics equations involved extremely small errors in temperature winds or other initial inputs given to numerical models will amplify and double every five days furthermore existing observation networks have limited spatial and temporal resolution for example over large bodies of water such as pacific ocean which introduces uncertainty into true initial state of atmosphere while a set of equations known as liouville equations exists to determine initial uncertainty in model initialization equations are too complex to run in real time even with use of supercomputers these uncertainties limit forecast model accuracy to about six days into future klaus jeff whitaker andres roubicek and catherine smith 2001 12 01 use of ensemble forecasts to produce improved medium range 3 15 days weather forecasts climate diagnostics center retrieved 2007 02 16 edward epstein recognized in 1969 that atmosphere could not be completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty and proposed a stochastic dynamic model that produced means and variances for state of atmosphere while these monte carlo simulations showed skill in 1974 cecil leith revealed that they produced adequate forecasts only when ensemble probability distribution was a representative sample of probability distribution in atmosphere it was not until 1992 that ensemble forecasts began being prepared by european centre for medium range weather forecasts canadian meteorological centre and national centers for environmental prediction ecmwf
