background thumb stephen crane in 1894 print of a portrait by artist and friend corwin k linson stephen crane published his first novel maggie a girl of streets in march 1893 at age of 22 maggie was not a success either financially or critically most critics thought unsentimental bowery tale crude or vulgar and crane chose to publish work privately after it was repeatedly rejected for publication stallman 1968 p 70 crane found inspiration for his next novel while spending hours lounging in a friend s studio in early summer of 1893 there he became fascinated with issues of century magazine that were largely devoted to famous battles and military leaders from civil war frustrated with dryly written stories crane stated i wonder that some of those fellows don t tell how they felt in those scraps they spout enough of what they did but they re as emotionless as rocks returning to these magazines during subsequent visits to studio he decided to write a war novel he later stated that he had been unconsciously working detail of story out through most of his boyhood and had imagined war stories ever since he was out of knickerbockers at time crane was intermittently employed as a free lance writer contributing articles to various new york city newspapers he began writing what would become red badge of courage in june 1893 while living with his older brother edmund in lake view new jersey crane conceived story from point of view of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of glory of war only to become disillusioned by war s reality he took private s surname fleming from his sister in law s maiden name he would later relate that first paragraphs came to him with every word in place every comma every period fixed working mostly nights he wrote from around midnight until four or five in morning because he could not afford a typewriter he carefully wrote in ink on legal sized paper occasionally crossing through or overlying a word if he changed something he would rewrite whole page he later moved to new york city where he completed novel in april 1894 publication history title of crane s original 55 000 word manuscript was private fleming his various battles but in order to create sense of a less traditional civil war narrative he ultimately changed title to red badge of courage an episode of american civil war in early 1894 crane submitted manuscript to s s mcclure who held on to it for six months without publication johanningsmeier 2008 p 226 frustrated author asked for manuscript to be returned after which he gave it to irving in october an abbreviated version of crane s story was first serialized in philadelphia press in december 1894 this version of story which was culled to 18 000 words by an editor specifically for serialization was reprinted in newspapers across america establishing crane s fame crane biographer john berryman wrote that story was published in at least 200 small city dailies and approximately 550 weekly papers johanningsmeier 2008 p 229 in october 1895 a version which was 5 000 words shorter than original manuscript was printed in book form by d appleton company this version of novel differed greatly from crane s original manuscript deletions were thought by some scholars to be due to demands by an appleton employee who was afraid of public disapproval of novel s content parts of original manuscript removed from 1895 version include all of twelfth chapter as well as endings to chapters seven ten and fifteen crane s contract with appleton allowed him to receive a flat ten percent royalty of all copies sold however contract also stipulated that he was not to receive royalties from books sold in great britain where they were released by heinemann in early 1896 as part of its pioneer series in 1982 w w norton company published a version of novel based on crane s original 1894 manuscript of 55 000 words edited by henry binder this version is questioned by those who believe crane made original edits for 1895 appleton edition on his own accord since its initial publication novel has never gone out of print plot summary on a cold day fictional 304th new york

first battle confederate soldiers charge but are repelled enemy quickly regroups and attacks again this time forcing some of unprepared union soldiers to flee fearing battle is a lost cause henry deserts his regiment it is not until after he reaches rear of army that he overhears a general announcing union s victory ashamed henry escapes into a nearby forest where he discovers a decaying body in a peaceful clearing in his distress he hurriedly leaves clearing and stumbles upon a group of injured men returning from battle one member of group a tattered soldier asks henry where he is wounded but youth dodges question among group is jim conklin who has been shot in side and is suffering delirium from blood loss jim eventually dies of his injury defiantly resisting aid from his friend and

thumb 300px right alt a painting depicting an ongoing battle with smoke billowing and bodies of horses and uniformed man blanketing field with a canopy of trees overhead battle of chancellorsville published by kurz and allison although crane once wrote in a letter you can tell nothing unless you are in that condition yourself he wrote red badge of courage without any experience of war he would however later serve as a war correspondent during greco turkish and spanish american wars nevertheless realistic portrayal of battlefield in red badge of courage has often misled readers into thinking that crane despite being born six years after end of civil war was himself a veteran while trying to explain his ability to write about battle realistically crane stated of course i have never been in a battle but i believe that i got my sense of rage of conflict on football field or else fighting is a hereditary instinct and i wrote intuitively for cranes were a family of fighters in old days monteiro 2000 p 86 crane drew from a variety of sources in order to realistically depict battle century battles and leaders series served as direct inspiration for novel and one story in particular warren lee goss s recollections of a private contains many parallels to crane s work morris 2007 p 139 thomas beer wrote in his problematic 1923 writing stephen crane a study in american letters 1923 thomas beer is known to have fabricated letters as well as particular events in crane s life beer s biography continues to be used as a credible source although it is understood by most critics and historians to contain many fictional elements that crane was challenged by a friend to write red badge of courage after having announced that he could do better than emile zola s la debacle this anecdote however has not been substantiated wertheim 1994 pp 90 91 metaphor of red badge of courage itself may have been inspired by true events historian cecil d eby jr noted that union officer philip kearny s insisted his troops wear bright red unit insignia patches which became known as marks of valor and bravery eby 1960 p 205 while 304th new york volunteer infantry is fictional many strategies and occurrences in novel echo actual events during civil war details concerning specific campaigns during war especially regarding battle formations and actions during battle of chancellorsville have been noted by critics it is believed that crane listened to war stories in town square of port jervis new york where his family at times resided sorrentino 2006 p 59 told by members of 124th new york volunteer infantry regiment commonly known as orange blossoms orange blossoms first saw battle at chancellorsville which is believed by local historians to have been inspiration for battle depicted in red badge of courage morris 2007 p 142 furthermore there was a private james conklin who served in 124th new york volunteer infantry regiment and crane s short story veteran which was published in mcclure s magazine year after red badge of courage depicts an elderly henry fleming who specifically identifies his first combat experience as having occurred at chancellorsville sears 1996 p 510 style and genre red badge of courage has a distinctive style which is often described as naturalistic realistic impressionistic or a mixture of three told in a third person limited point of view novel reflects inner experience of henry fleming a young soldier who flees from combat rather than upon external world around him red badge of courage is notable in its vivid descriptions and well cadenced prose both of which help create suspense within story critics in particular have pointed to repeated use of color imagery throughout novel both literal and figurative as proof of novel s use of impressionism blue and gray uniforms are mentioned as are yellow and orange sunlight and green forests while men s faces grow red with rage or courage and gray with death crane also uses animalistic imagery to comment upon people nature and war itself for example novel begins by portraying army as a living entity that is stretched out on hills resting while novel takes place during a series of battles red badge of courage is not a traditional civil war narrative focusing on complex internal struggle of its main character rather than on war itself crane s novel often divides readers as to whether story is intended to be either for or against war by avoiding political military and geographic details of conflict between states story becomes divorced from its historical context notably lacking are dates in which action takes place and name of battle these omissions effectively shift attention away from historical patterns in order to concentrate on emotional violence of battle in general writer alluded to as much in a letter in which he stated he wished to depict war through a psychological portrayal of fear writing more than thirty years after novel s debut author joseph conrad agreed that novel s main struggle was internal rather than external and that fleming stands before unknown he would like to prove to himself by some reasoning process that he will not run from battle and in his regiment he can find no help he is alone with problem of courage crane s realistic portrayal of psychological struck a chord with reviewers as one contemporary critic wrote for new york press at times description is so vivid as to be almost suffocating reader is right down in midst of it where patriotism is dissolved into its elements and where only a dozen men can be seen firing blindly and grotesquely into smoke this is war from a new point of view with its heavy use of irony symbolism and metaphor novel also lends itself to less straightforward readings as with many of crane s fictional works novel s dialogue often uses distinctive local dialects contributing to its apparent historicity for example jim conklin muses at beginning of novel i s pose we must go round th jest t keep em from gittin too or t m or something habegger 1990 pp 231 232 ironic tone increases in severity as novel progresses especially in terms of ironic distance between narrator and protagonist title of work itself is ironic henry wishes that he too had a wound a red badge of courage echoing a wish to have been wounded in battle wound he does receive from rifle butt of a fleeing union soldier however is not a badge of courage but a badge of shame by substituting epithets for characters names youth tattered soldier crane injects an allegorical quality into his work making his characters point to a specific characteristic of man there have been numerous interpretations concerning hidden meanings within red badge of courage beginning with robert w stallman s 1968 crane biography several critics have explored novel in terms of christian allegory in particular death of henry fleming s christ like friend jim conklin is noted for evidence of this reading as well as concluding sentence of chapter nine which refers to sun as fierce wafer in sky john berryman was one of first critics to interpret novel as a modern wasteland through which protagonist plays role of an everyman still others read novel as having a naturalist structure comparing work to those by theodore dreiser frank norris and jack london themes as title of work suggests main theme of novel deals with henry fleming s attempt to prove himself a worthy soldier by earning his red badge of courage first twelve chapters until he receives his accidental wound expose his cowardice following chapters detail his growth and apparently resulting heroism before onset of battle novel s protagonist romanticized war what little he knew about battle he learned from books he had read of marches sieges conflicts and he had longed to see it all mayer 2009 p 258 therefore when confronted by harsh realities of war henry is shocked and his idealism falters finding solace in existential thoughts he internally fights to make sense of senseless world in which he finds himself when he seems to come to terms with his situation he is yet again forced into fears of battle which threaten to strip him of his enlightened identity gullason 1961 p 61 joseph hergesheimer wrote in his introduction to 1925 knopf edition of novel that at its heart red badge of courage was a story of birth in a boy of a knowledge of himself and of self command however text is ambiguous making it questionable that henry ever matures as critic donald gibson stated in red badge of courage redefining hero novel undercuts itself it says there is no answer to questions it raises yet it says opposite it says that henry fleming finally sees things as they are it says he is a deluded fool it says that henry does not see things as they are but no one else does either although crane critic and biographer stallman wrote of henry s spiritual change by end of story he also found this theme difficult to champion in light of novel s enigmatic ending although henry progresses upwards toward manhood and moral triumph as he begins to mature by taking leave of his previous romantic notions education of hero ends as it began in self deception critic william b dillingham also noted novel s heroism paradox especially in terms of introspective henry s lapse into self abandon in second half of book dillingham stated that in order to be courageous a man in time of physical strife must abandon highest of his human facilities reason and imagination and act instinctively even indifference of natural world is a reoccurring theme in crane s work horsford 1986 p 112 at beginning of novel as regiments advance toward battle sky is described as being an innocuous fairy blue in chapter seven henry notes inexplicable tranquility of nature a woman with a deep aversion to tragedy even as battle rages on similarly heaven itself is indifferent to slaughter he encounters on battlefield gullason 1961 p 62 dichotomy between nature s sweetness and war s destructiveness is further described in chapter eighteen a cloud of dark smoke as from smoldering ruins went up toward sun now bright and gay in blue enameled sky horsford 1986 pp 112 113 after his desertion however henry finds some comfort in laws of nature which seem to briefly affirm his previous cowardice this landscape gave him assurance a fair field holding life it was religion of peace it would die if its timid eyes were compelled to see blood he threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel and he ran with chattering fear high in a treetop he stopped and poking his head cautiously from behind a branch looked down with an air of trepidation youth felt triumphant at this exhibition there was law he said nature had given him a sign squirrel immediately upon recognizing danger had taken to his legs without ado he did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to missile and die with an upward glance at sympathetic heavens on contrary he had fled as fast as his legs could carry him reception red badge of courage received generally positive reviews from critics on its initial publication in particular it was said to be a remarkably modern and original work gibson 1988 p 9 appleton s 1895 publication went through ten editions in first year alone making crane an overnight success at age of twenty four h g wells a friend of author later wrote that novel was greeted by an orgy of praise in england and united states an anonymous reviewer for new york press wrote shortly after novel s initial publication that one should be forever slow in charging an author with genius but it must be confessed that red badge of courage is open to suspicion of having greater power and originality than can be by name of talent reviewer for new york times was impressed by crane s realistic portrayal of war writing that book strikes reader as a statement of facts by a veteran a sentiment that was echoed by reviewer for critic who called novel a true book true to life whether it be taken as a literal transcript of a soldier s experiences in his first battle or a great parable of inner battle which every man must fight monteiro 2009 p 37 novel however did have its initial detractors some critics found crane s young age and inexperience troubling rather than impressive for example one reviewer wrote as mr crane is too young a man to write from experience frightful details of his book must be outcome of a very feverish imagination monteiro 2000 p 82 crane and his work also received criticism from veterans of war one in particular alexander c mcclurg a brigadier general who served through chickamauga and chattanooga campaigns wrote a lengthy letter to dial which his publishing company owned in april 1896 lambasting novel as a vicious satire upon american soldiers and american armies author and veteran ambrose bierce popular for his civil war fiction also expressed contempt for novel and its writer when a reviewer for new york journal referred to red badge of courage as a poor imitation of bierce s work bierce responded by congratulating them for exposing crane freak some reviewers also found fault with crane s narrative style grammar mistakes and apparent lack of traditional plot kaplan 1986 p 92 while it eventually became a bestseller in united states red badge of courage was more popular and sold more rapidly in england when it was published in late 1895 crane was delighted with his novel s success overseas writing to a friend i have only one pride and that is that english edition of red badge of courage has been with great praise by english reviewers i am proud of this simply because remoter people would seem more just and harder to win critic veteran and member of parliament george wyndham called novel a masterpiece applauding crane s ability to stage drama of man so to speak within mind of one man and then admits you as to a theatre monteiro 2009 p 42 harold frederic wrote in his own review that if there were in existence any books of a similar character one could start confidently by saying that it was best of its kind but it has no fellows it is a book outside of all classification so unlike anything else is it that temptation rises to deny that it is a book at all frederic who would later befriend crane when latter relocated to england in 1897 juxtaposed novel s treatment of war to those by leo tolstoy emile zola and victor hugo all of whose works he believed to be positively cold and ineffectual when

standard against which rest of his works were compared appleton republished novel again in 1917 shortly after us entered world war i reissuing it three additional times that same year gibson 1988 p 13 since resurgence of crane s popularity in 1920s red badge of courage has been deemed a major american text and crane s most important work while modern critics have noted crane s anticipation of modern spectacle of war kaplan 1986 p 106 others such as crane scholar stanley wertheim believe work to be unquestionably most realistic novel about american civil war donald gibson called novel ahead of its time because it did not conform to very many contemporary notions about what literature should be and do gibson 1988 p 1 novel has been anthologized numerous times including in ernest hemingway
