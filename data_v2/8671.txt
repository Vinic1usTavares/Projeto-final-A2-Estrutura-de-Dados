area and conveys a large numbers of freight vehicles project was jointly funded by act and australian governments at a total cost of a 288 million major construction works commenced in february 2013

standard link between northern terminus of monaro highway in territory s east and federal highway at north close to new south wales border parkway largely replaced majura road which was formerly main route through valley and carried approximately 18 000 vehicles each day majura road is single carriageway and rural in design and quality need for replacement with a more efficient higher capacity roadway was highlighted in several studies majura road remains largely intact to serve local traffic to various facilities located in majura valley multiple rural properties and canberra airport s business precinct other benefits of majura parkway include more efficient freight transportation relieving traffic congestion supporting future growth of canberra airport and easier movement between canberra s northern and southern suburbs roadway starts as a continuation from northern end of monaro highway it then crosses molonglo river and morshead drive as part of a singular bridge structure just to west of current morshead drive pialligo avenue intersection next section of parkway entirely replaces northern arm of morshead drive with a raised section of roadway before crossing over fairbairn road at location of current morshead drive fairbairn road intersection from this point roadway enters farmland and grasslands parkway itself aligned just to west of woolshed creek towards northern end of valley parkway bisects majura pine plantation north of plantation parkway gains a service road along its western side allowing southbound access via an overpass to businesses in that area this service road continues a short distance to north until it meets access road to mount majura air navigation facility which is located atop nearby mount majura remainder of roadway from plantation to north follows existing majura road alignment with addition of a second carriageway constructed to east it curves towards west and joins onto existing interchange with federal highway roadway itself then continues on through interchange into gungahlin district as horse park drive parkway is dual carriageway for entirety of its length each traffic lane is wide with a wide outside shoulder and a wide median shoulder speed limit is by 2030 majura parkway is expected to carry approximately 40 000 vehicles each day with 6 000 of those being freight vehicles stated cost is a 288 million and is jointly funded by act government and australian government both committing 144 million to project history thumb molonglo river bridge under construction in october 2014 thumb majura parkway and mount majura solar farm in 2017 planning of majura parkway began with tomorrow s canberra 1970 national capital development commission ncdc report which identified majura valley corridor as a component of canberra s peripheral road system further ncdc and national capital authority nca studies including metropolitan canberra 1984 and canberra spatial plan 2004 identified need for a primary road link in area this was also backed up by gungahlin external travel study information report 1989 identifying four main access roads needed for residents of gungahlin district from smec concept evaluation report 2006 roads act identified two preferred alignments which were known as western and eastern alignments eastern alignment was later scrapped because of environmental heritage and social issues along that corridor leaving western alignment as only preferred alignment scrapped eastern alignment would have also included a link to a future urban area in district resumption of land for parkway mostly involved farmland although part of majura pine plantation was acquired for new road alignment royal military college duntroon has also lost some parts of its playing fields though historic oval no 1 is preserved some concerns were raised about parkway occupying land now used for offroad recreational cycling in majura pine plantation however by later stages of planning process two large culverts had been planned in this area which would ease access between both sides of plantation for recreational cyclists and other users concerns were also raised by geological society of australia in regards to construction works affecting a fossil site on woolshed creek in vicinity of fairbairn avenue southbound offramp geological society of australia later accepted assurances from act government that site would be protected preparatory roadworks on nearby roads began in 2008 with main project beginning in september 2012 when fulton hogan was awarded contract to build major construction then began in january 2013 parkway was completed by april 2016 construction of parkway created around 350 jobs at november 2016 new road was still yet to appear on iphone maps and some gps systems intersections and interchanges completed majura parkway has multiple intersections and interchanges along its length providing access to facilities in majura valley and several
