consistent accurate and honest but i regret to have to say i cannot say same about wife s evidence having watched and listened to her give evidence having studied documents and having given in her

and inaccurate but also less than candid overall she was a less than impressive witness regarding her career judge said i find that far from husband dictating to and restricting wife s career and
