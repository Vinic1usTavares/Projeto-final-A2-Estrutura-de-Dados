bombing of yawata on night of 15 16 june 1944 was first air raid on japanese home islands conducted by united states army air forces usaaf strategic bombers during world war ii raid was undertaken by 75 b 29 superfortress heavy bombers staging from bases in china only 47 of these aircraft bombed raid s primary target imperial iron and steel works at yawata in northern kyushu and little damage was caused five b 29s were lost in accidents during operation and two were destroyed by japanese aircraft while raid did not achieve its aims it had other effects it raised japanese civilians awareness that their country was being defeated and received unduly positive media coverage in united states intelligence gathered by b 29s also revealed weaknesses in japan s air defenses and raid was first of many on japan yawata was attacked again by b 29s operating from china on 20 august 1944 and much of city was destroyed in a firebombing raid conducted by b 29s based in mariana islands on 8 august 1945 background first united states army air forces usaaf raid on japan took place on 18 april 1942 when 16 b 25 mitchell medium bombers flying from an aircraft carrier attacked several cities during doolittle raid although this raid caused little damage it boosted morale in united states japanese government responded to attack by both increasing number of fighter units based in home islands and conducting an offensive in pacific ocean which ended in defeat during battle of midway usaaf was not able to mount further attacks on japanese home islands after this raid however as none of its combat aircraft had sufficient range to reach this area from bases in china or pacific until b 29 superfortress heavy bomber was ready for combat correll 2009 p 62 b 29 superfortress had a difficult introduction into service work began on designing bomber in early 1940 and first prototype flew on 21 september 1942 superfortress was largest combat aircraft of world war ii and boasted a heavy maximum bomb load long range and powerful defensive armament polmar 2004 pp 4 5 b 29 also incorporated a number of new features such as a pressurized cabin and remote controlled turrets while 1 664 b 29s had been ordered by usaaf before aircraft first flew its development was set back by several months after second prototype crashed on 18 february 1943 and problems with design were gradually solved cate 1953 pp 6 8 58th bombardment wing was formed in june 1943 to operate usaaf s first b 29s but it did not begin receiving these aircraft until october slow delivery of b 29s and mechanical problems with aircraft meant that wing lagged behind its training schedule and only became capable of deployment in march 1944 after so called battle of kansas program began to produce combat ready aircraft cate 1953 pp 52 57 in late 1943 united states joint chiefs of staff approved a proposal to begin strategic air campaign against japanese home islands and east asia by basing b 29s in india and establishing forward airfields in areas of china this strategy which was designated operation matterhorn required construction of large airstrips near chengdu in inland china which would be supplied by allied cargo aircraft and be used to refuel b 29s traveling from bases in bengal en route to bombing targets in japan correll 2009 pp 62 63 xx bomber command was assigned responsibility for this effort and its ground crew began to leave united states for india by sea in december 1943 cate 1953 pp 75 2010 p 41 twentieth air force was formed in april 1944 to oversee all b 29 operations in an unprecedented move commander of usaaf general henry h arnold took personal command of this unit and ran it from pentagon tillman 2010 p 45 58th bombardment wing was xx bomber command s main combat unit and its movement from kansas to india took place from april to mid may tillman 2010 pp 43 44 while wing had not completed training at time it left for india its combat groups were more experienced than most newly deployed usaaf bomber units cate 1953 p 57 preparations united states thumb 300px alt a black and white map of east asia most of cities depicted on map are marked with bomb symbols locations of b 29 bomber bases in china and main targets they attacked in east asia during operation matterhorn after establishing itself in india xx bomber command under command of brigadier general kenneth wolfe undertook various tasks to prepare for raids against japan frank 1999 p 50 foremost among these was stockpiling fuel at airfields in china until late 1944 usaaf air transport command aircraft did not transport fuel for xx bomber command and this task was instead undertaken by b 29s this arrangement proved inefficient however as 12 b 29 sorties between india and china were needed to transport enough fuel and other supplies to enable one of heavy bombers to fly a round trip between china and japan correll 2009 p 64 as a result it took longer than expected to build up sufficient stockpiles in china to allow b 29 operations to commence cate 1953 p 98 moreover continued technical problems with superfortress and particularly their wright r 3350 engines resulted in many of xx bomber command s aircraft being unserviceable and in need of modification at all times correll 2009 p 63 xx bomber command conducted its first combat operation on 5 june 1944 on this day 98 b 29s were dispatched from bases in india to attack targets in bangkok thailand as a dress rehearsal for more ambitious operations against japan and targets in south east asia although little damage was done and five b 29s were lost due to flying accidents and technical faults operation was rated a success by xx bomber command as it provided useful combat experience for bomber crews as well as data on how b 29 performed in action cate 1953 pp 94 98 on 6 june wolfe received a message from arnold informing him that joint chiefs of staff wanted a raid to be conducted against japan as soon as possible goals of this operation were to relieve pressure on chinese forces which were being attacked by japanese and to support invasion of saipan arnold s message also asked how many b 29s could be dispatched on 15 and 20 june at time first raid on japan was tentatively scheduled for 23 june when sufficient supplies were expected to be available in china to support 100 b 29 sorties wolfe replied stating that 50 b 29s could be used on 15 june and 55 if operation was conducted on 20th of month arnold regarded these numbers as too low and directed that a raid by at least 70 b 29s be conducted against japan on 15 june following this order xx bomber command s b 29s and transport aircraft embarked on an intensive effort to move fuel to china further fuel supplies were made available to heavy bombers by reducing activities of usaaf fighter units based in china during same period command s ground crews reconditioned as many b 29s as possible to improve their reliability cate 1953 pp 98 99 target selected for first raid on japan was imperial iron and steel works at yawata an industrial city about from chengdu jablonski 1979 p 133 this was single most important facility in japan s steel industry as it produced 24 percent of country s total output of rolled steel facility was dependent on three coke plants and largest of these was selected as designated aiming point for b 29s nearby laoyao harbor which was an important industrial port was designated as raid s secondary target cate 1953 p 99 selection of yawata s steelworks as first target to be attacked was in accordance with a decision made by twentieth air force on 1 april 1944 which assigned highest priority to attacking japan s steel and coke industry cate 1953 pp 93 94 it was decided to conduct raid at night with each b 29 bombing individually as aircraft lacked range needed to conduct a more fuel intensive formation flight between forward air bases and yawata japanese despite an elaborate deception plan which included planted news stories claiming that b 29s would be deployed as bombers in europe but only be used as armed transports in china burma india theater japanese military detected preparation of b 29 bases in india and china cate 1953 pp 77 79 moreover japanese agents in china reported on all b 29 movements giving hours of warning time before raids on home islands tillman 2010 pp 44 45 japanese intelligence services deduced that once logistical preparations were complete heavy bombers would attack factories in northern kyushu and that first raid would be made at night sakaida takaki 2001 p 6 on 26 april japanese fighters encountered a b 29 for first time when two nakajima ki 43 oscars attacked and damaged a lone b 29 flying near china india border japanese military began transferring fighter aircraft from china and pacific to home islands in early 1944 in anticipation of b 29 raids kerr 1991 p 61 in june 1944 yawata lay within western district of japan s four regional defense commands foreign histories division headquarters united states army japan 1980 pp 3 5 129 19th air brigade was formed in june 1944 to command fighter units in western district and comprised 4th and 59th air regiments 4th air regiment was stationed at airfield and was equipped with 35 kawasaki ki 45 toryu twin engined heavy fighters of which 25 were operational in mid june and had brigade s best

army japan 1980 pp 134 136 19th air brigade s primary mission was to defend industrial facilities in northern kyushu and particularly iron works at yawata brigade s plans for defense of western district called for its interceptor aircraft to be concentrated over yawata and not move far from area while this inflexible deployment was considered unsatisfactory by 19th air brigade it was deemed necessary as few aircraft were available only searchlight units needed to facilitate night operations were stationed near yawata and northern kyushu was regarded by army as being most important region in western district foreign histories division headquarters united states army japan 1980 pp 131 132 prior to raid on yawata 19th air brigade undertook joint planning with anti aircraft units and implemented a training program which included practice in responding to alerts and night flying foreign histories division headquarters united states army japan 1980 pp 132 142 143 raid 58th bombardment wing s b 29s began moving from india to forward bases in china on 13 june by 15 june 83 superfortresses had reached four forward airfields around chengdu though at least 12 turned back before reaching china and another crashed causing death of its entire crew each of aircraft had departed india carrying of 500 pound bombs they would use in raid a large number of staff officers including eight generals also traveled to chengdu to observe operation but were not allowed to participate in raid bomber crews were joined by eight journalists and three news photographers however cate 1953 pp 99 100 at time usaaf had few recent photos of japanese industrial areas and bomber crews were briefed on yawata using maps and photos from late 1920s and early 1930s cate 1953 p 164 superfortresses began to depart their bases at 16 16 local time on 15 june cate 1953 p 100 raiding force was led by 58th bombardment wing s commander brigadier general laverne g saunders of 75 aircraft dispatched one crashed immediately after taking off with no casualties and a further four turned back suffering mechanical problems remaining aircraft proceeded on a direct course to okino island where they turned for run in to yawata each of 58th bombardment wing s four groups sent two aircraft ahead to mark target and other aircraft flew in a long bomber stream both of these tactics had been adopted from those used by british royal air force s bomber command in europe tillman 2010 pp 50 51 raiders were detected by japanese army and army air force units in china these reports were passed onto 19th air brigade which estimated that bombers were bound for northern kyushu and would arrive there at about midnight local time a radar station and lookout posts on cheju do subsequently detected bombers from 23 31 to 00 30 local time an air raid alarm was issued at 00 24 and 24 aircraft of 4th air regiment began to take off three minutes later to patrol over northern kyushu foreign histories division headquarters united states army japan 1980 pp 144 146 59th air regiment was not scrambled as its pilots had not worked with those of 4th air regiment in night operations its aircraft were suffering from mechanical problems and it was feared that b 29s would sight and attack base at ashiya foreign histories division headquarters united states army japan 1980 p 147 b 29s began to arrive over yawata at 00 38 local time and attack on city lasted almost two hours only 15 of american aircraft were able to aim their bombs visually as city was blacked out and obscured by smoke or haze other 32 bombed by radar two further b 29s bombed laoyao harbor and another five struck targets of opportunity overall 107 tons of bombs were dropped during raid cate 1953 pp 100 2005 298 after first bombs were released regular updates on operation were transmitted to twentieth air force s headquarters in washington from where they were relayed to arnold who was in london at time raiders were met with heavy but inaccurate anti aircraft fire and searchlights stationed around yawata were not effective 4th air regiment achieved only kill of night when one of its fighters shot down a b 29 regiment s other aircraft struggled to make contact with bombers and achieved few interceptions tillman 2010 pp 51 52 b 29s return flight to china was largely uneventful one of superfortresses was strafed and destroyed by japanese aircraft after landing at with engine trouble and a further two aircraft crashed with loss of their entire crews and a correspondent from magazine newsweek cate 1953 p 1979 p 134 overall american losses in raid were seven b 29s destroyed and a further six damaged by anti aircraft guns 57 airmen and one journalist were killed aboard these aircraft tillman 2010 p 52 many of b 29s were stranded in china for several days after raid due to fuel shortages there and only returned to india after wolfe borrowed of fuel from fighter wing s supplies during this period bombers were highly vulnerable to japanese retaliatory raids but none came about aftermath little damage was caused by raid on yawata on 18 june a usaaf fourteenth air force aircraft overflew city and photographed target area these photos showed that only a single bomb had landed within imperial iron and steel works complex and it had hit a powerhouse from nearest coke oven light damage had also been inflicted on kokura arsenal and other industrial and civilian buildings in area despite a usaaf policy of encouraging factual reportage of b 29 operations raid s results were overstated in u s media cate 1953 pp 101 103 light combat losses suffered by raiders and electronic intelligence collected by b 29s revealed ineffectiveness of japanese radar and air defenses as a result usaaf dispatched a single photo reconnaissance b 29 to overfly much of japan and korea on 21 june this sortie was successful and greatly improved u s intelligence holdings on these areas brown 1999 pp 421 422 yawata raid revealed serious shortcomings in japan s air defenses while 19th air brigade initially claimed to have shot down eight b 29s and damaged a further four it was soon determined that only two of bombers had been destroyed this loss ratio was considered too low to defeat attacks on home islands raid demonstrated that japan had too few air bases and not enough aircraft were available for night operations it was also found that toryu fighter was not well suited to intercepting b 29s as it was slower than bombers too lightly armed and most aircraft lacked radar while air raid alert system had proved successful in this instance radars which detected american aircraft had been unable to determine their altitude and it was decided that there was a need to further expand radar coverage foreign histories division headquarters united states army japan 1980 pp 147 149 performance of 131st anti aircraft regiment during raid was judged to be so poor that its commander was transferred to manchuria zaloga 2010 p 51 news reports of yawata raid and successful u s landing at saipan on same day also indicated to japanese civilians that war was not going well cate 1953 p 102 in response to raid japanese government ministers urged families living country s four major cities to evacuate their children to rural areas daniels 1981 15 16 june 1944
