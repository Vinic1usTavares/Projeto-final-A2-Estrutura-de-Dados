as a watershed case in nation s fourth amendment jurisprudence united states supreme court case in which court clarified application of fourth amendment s protection against warrantless searches and fifth amendment right against self incrimination for searches that intrude into human body until schmerber supreme court had not yet clarified whether state police officers must procure a search warrant before taking blood samples from criminal suspects likewise court had not yet clarified whether blood evidence taken against wishes of a criminal suspect may be used against that suspect in course of a criminal prosecution in a 5 4 opinion court held that forced extraction and analysis of a blood sample is not compelled testimony therefore it does not violate fifth amendment right against self incrimination schmerber v california court also held that intrusions into human body ordinarily require a search warrant schmerber 384 u s at 770 however court ruled that involuntary warrantless blood sample taken in this case was justified under fourth amendment s exigent circumstances exception because evidence of blood alcohol would be destroyed by body s natural metabolic processes if officers were to wait for a warrant schmerber 384 u s at 770 in present case however officer might reasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency in which delay necessary to obtain a warrant under circumstances threatened destruction of evidence internal quotations omitted in 2013 supreme court clarified in missouri v mcneely that natural metabolism of

government agents in rochin v california police officers broke into home of an individual suspected of selling narcotics and observed him place several small objects into his mouth rochin v california officers were unable to force his mouth open so they transported him to a local hospital where his stomach was pumped against his will rochin 342 u s at 166 a unanimous supreme court held involuntary stomach pump was an unlawful violation of substantive due process because it shocked conscience and was so brutal and offensive that it did not comport with traditional ideas of fair play and decency rochin 342 u s at 172 73 in 1957 court held in breithaupt v abram that involuntary blood samples taken by a skilled technician neither shocked conscience nor violated substantive due process

sample from schmerber schmerber 384 u s at 758 blood sample indicated that schmerber was intoxicated and he was placed under arrest schmerber 384 u s at 759 blood sample was ultimately admitted into

n 3 arguments before court schmerber submitted an appeal to supreme court of united states which granted certiorari on january 17 1966 schmerber v california in his brief schmerber argued inter alia that warrantless blood test violated his fourth amendment right to be free from unlawful searches and seizures as well as his fifth amendment right against self incrimination los angeles city attorney s office represented state of california on appeal brief for respondent schmerber v california 384 u s 757 u s 1966 in their brief city attorney argued that blood test did not violate fourth amendment because seizure was conducted incident to a lawful arrest city attorney also argued that admitting sample into evidence did not violate schmerber s fifth amendment right against self incrimination because blood is not testimonial evidence under fifth amendment oral arguments were held on april 25 1966 and court issued its opinion on june 20 1966 opinion of court thumb upright right in his majority opinion justice william j brennan jr emphasized that t he overriding function of fourth amendment is to protect personal privacy and dignity against unwarranted intrusion by state schmerber 384 u s at 767 in his majority opinion justice william j brennan jr held that schmerber s constitutional rights were not violated when police took his blood without his consent relying upon court s holding in breithaupt v abram he concluded that police did not violate schmerber s fifth amendment right against self incrimination because extraction and chemical analysis of blood sample did not involve even a shadow of testimonial compulsion schmerber 384 u s at 765 likewise justice brennan held that officers did not violate schmerber s fourth amendment right against unreasonable seizures justice brennan wrote that absent exigent circumstances searches that involve intrusions into human body require a search warrant here search was not justified as a search incident to arrest because weapons and contraband are not ordinarily concealed beneath skin schmerber 384 u s at 769 70 however involuntary blood draw was justified under fourth amendment s exigent circumstances exception because if officers had waited to receive a search warrant evidence of intoxication would have been lost through body s natural metabolism of alcohol in bloodstream schmerber 384 u s at 771 72 he wrote that responding officer might reasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency where evidence would be destroyed if he waited to receive a warrant additionally justice brennan cautioned that court s ruling was limited only to facts of present record and that minor intrusions into an individual s body under stringently limited conditions in no way indicates that it permits more substantial intrusions or intrusions under other conditions schmerber 384 u s at 772 justice harlan s concurrence in his concurring opinion justice john marshall harlan ii agreed that involuntary blood sample did not implicate involuntary testimonial compulsion but wrote separately to emphasize his opinion that case before court in no way implicates fifth amendment schmerber 384 u s at 772 harlan j concurring additionally justice harlan cited to his dissent in miranda v arizona where he argued against a broad expansion of fifth amendment right against self incrimination justice harlan disagreed with court s ruling in miranda and even stated that case represents poor constitutional law and entails harmful consequences for country at large miranda v arizona dissenting opinions thumb upright right in his dissenting opinion justice william o douglas wrote that involuntary blood samples violate right to privacy enumerated in griswold v connecticut schmerber 384 u s at 779 douglas j dissenting all four dissenting justices wrote separate dissenting opinions in schmerber chief justice earl warren reiterated his dissenting opinion in breithaupt v abram where he argued that involuntary blood samples violate substantive due process schmerber 384 u s at 772 warren c j dissenting citing breithaupt 352 u s at 442 warren c j dissenting justice hugo black authored an impassioned dissent in which he argued that officers violated schmerber s right against self incrimination schmerber 384 u s at 778 black j dissenting he wrote b with framers that these constitutional safeguards broadly construed by independent tribunals of justice provide our best hope for keeping our people free from governmental oppression i deeply regret court s holding justice william o douglas also reiterated his dissent in breithaupt v abram but added that physical invasions into human body violate right to privacy enumerated in griswold v connecticut and that n o clearer invasion of this right of privacy can be imagined than forcible bloodletting of kind involved here finally justice abe fortas wrote that involuntary blood sample was an act of violence that violated substantive due process and that states may not resort to acts of violence when prosecuting crimes schmerber 384 u s at 779 fortas j dissenting subsequent developments in 1970s and 1980s supreme court revisited questions about constitutionality of involuntary bodily intrusions in several key cases in 1973 court ruled in cupp v murphy that police were permitted to extract a tissue sample from underneath a suspect s fingernails to recover evanescent physical evidence cupp v murphy suspect in cupp was suspected of strangling his wife and voluntarily went to a police station to answer questions cupp 412 u s at 292 officers noticed bloodstains under suspect s fingernails and detained him but did not place him under arrest against suspect s wishes police scraped out a tissue sample from under his fingernails to retrieve evidence biological material found under suspect s fingernails was later found to have come from victim citing schmerber court held that this warrantless search was justified under exigent circumstances exemption of fourth amendment because search was necessary to preserve highly evanescent evidence under defendant s fingernails cupp 412 u s at 296 twelve years later court again revisited topic of involuntary bodily intrusions in winston v lee where court held that state of virginia could not force an individual to undergo surgery to extract a bullet that may be evidence of a crime winston v lee court applied its previous holding in schmerber to conclude that surgery would constitute an unreasonable search under fourth amendment and that a crucial factor for evaluating any bodily intrusion is extent to which procedure may threaten safety or health of individual winston 470 u s at 761 762 63 writing for court s majority chief justice warren e burger concluded that forcing a patient to undergo major surgery intrudes too far upon individual privacy rights and that surgical intrusions can only be characterized as severe winston 470 u s at 766 in 1989 court ruled in skinner v railway labor executives association that warrantless blood tests of railroad employees were reasonable under fourth amendment skinner v railway labor executives ass n court reaffirmed that compelled n into body for blood to be analyzed for alcohol content is a search under fourth amendment skinner 489 u s at 616 internal quotations omitted but that warrantless blood tests of railroad employees were necessary to prevent accidents and casualties in railroad operations that result from impairment of employees by alcohol or drugs skinner 489 u s at 620 21 citing 49 cfr ss 219 1 a 1987 court also concluded that when individuals participate in an industry that is regulated pervasively to ensure safety these individuals have a reduced expectation of privacy skinner 489 u s at 627 because these employees had a diminished expectation of privacy warrantless blood tests were permissible skinner 489 u s at 628 justice thurgood marshall and justice brennan wrote a dissenting opinion in which they argued that this case was distinguishable from schmerber because no such exigency prevents railroad officials from securing a warrant before chemically testing samples they obtain skinner 489 u s at 642 marshall j dissenting south dakota v neville and self incrimination thumb upright in his dissenting opinion in south dakota v neville justice john paul stevens wrote that schmerber intended to adopt a broad and liberal interpretation of fifth amendment right against self incrimination south dakota v neville stevens j dissenting t his court s opinion in schmerber v california citations had assumed that fifth amendment should be construed as broadly as more liberal state language after court issued its decision in schmerber a split of authority emerged in lower courts with regard to whether fifth amendment s right against self incrimination prohibited use of a suspect s refusal to submit to a blood test as evidence of guilt neville 459 u s at 558 we granted certiorari to resolve conflict united states supreme court resolved this split in authority in south dakota v neville where court held that prosecutors could use a suspect s refusal to submit to a blood test as evidence of guilt and introduction of this evidence at trial does not violate suspect s fifth amendment right against self incrimination neville 459 u s at 561 62 writing for court s majority justice sandra day o connor concluded that state did not directly compel respondent to refuse test and that a simple blood alcohol test is so safe painless and commonplace a suspect would not feel coerced to refuse test neville 459 u s at 562 63 justice john paul stevens wrote a dissenting opinion joined by justice thurgood marshall in which he argued that court in schmerber intended to adopt a broad and liberal interpretation of fifth amendment right against self incrimination neville 459 u s at 570 stevens j dissenting missouri v mcneely and exigent circumstances exception over time a split of authority grew among lower courts with regard to whether fourth amendment s exigent circumstances exception allowed officers to always conduct warrantless blood tests on individuals suspected of driving under influence of alcohol because evidence of alcohol was being destroyed by body s natural metabolic processes mcneely 133 s ct at 1558 discussing split of authority states that recognized this per se exigency argued that o nce police arrest a suspect for drunk driving each passing minute eliminates probative evidence of crime mcneely 133 s ct

in a 5 4 opinion court rejected theory that natural dissipation of blood alcohol constituted a per se exigency mcneely 133 s ct at 1558 1568 instead court affirmed basic principle from schmerber that absent an emergency that s acting without a warrant police may not conduct warrantless blood testing on suspects mcneely 133 s ct at 1559 consequently exigency in drunk driving cases must be
