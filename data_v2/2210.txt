sir edward coke cook formerly 1 february 1552 3 september 1634 was an english barrister judge and politician who is considered to be greatest jurist of elizabethan and jacobean eras born into an upper class family coke was educated at trinity college cambridge before leaving to study at inner temple where he was called to bar on 20 april 1578 as a barrister he took part in several notable cases including slade s case before earning enough political favour to be elected to parliament where he served first as solicitor general and then as speaker of house of commons following a promotion to attorney general he led prosecution in several notable cases including those against robert devereux sir walter raleigh and gunpowder plot conspirators as a reward for his services he was first knighted and then made chief justice of common pleas as chief justice coke restricted use of ex officio star chamber oath and in case of proclamations and dr bonham s case declared king to be subject to law and laws of parliament to be void if in violation of common right and reason these actions eventually led to his transfer to chief justiceship of king s bench where it was felt he could do less damage coke then successively restricted definition of treason and declared a royal letter illegal leading to his dismissal from bench on 14 november 1616 with no chance of regaining his judicial posts he instead returned to parliament where he swiftly became a leading member of opposition during his time as a member of parliament he wrote and campaigned for statute of monopolies which substantially restricted ability of monarch to grant patents and authored and was instrumental in passage of petition of right a document considered one of three crucial constitutional documents of england along with magna carta and bill of rights 1689 coke is best known in modern times for his institutes described by john rutledge as almost foundations of our law and his reports which have been called perhaps single most influential series of named reports historically he was a highly influential judge within england and wales his statements and works were used to justify right to silence while statute of monopolies is considered to be one of first actions in conflict between parliament and monarch that led to english civil war in america coke s decision in dr bonham s case was used to justify voiding of both stamp act 1765 and writs of assistance which led to american war of independence after establishment of united states his decisions and writings profoundly influenced third and fourth amendments to united states constitution while necessitating sixteenth family background and early life surname coke or cocke can be traced back to a william coke in hundred of south now norfolk town of swaffham in around 1150 family was relatively prosperous and influential members from 14th century onwards included an under sheriff a knight a barrister and a merchant name coke was pronounced during elizabethan age although it is now pronounced origins of name are uncertain theories are that it was a word for river among early britons or was descended from word for leader another hypothesis is that it was an attempt to disguise word cook coke s father robert coke was a barrister and bencher of lincoln s inn who built up a strong practice representing clients from his home area of norfolk over time he bought several manors at west acre and happisburgh all in norfolk and was granted a coat of arms becoming a minor member of gentry coke s mother winifred knightley came from a family even more intimately linked with law than her husband her father and grandfather had practised law in norfolk area and her sister audrey was married to thomas gawdy a lawyer and justice of court of king s bench with links to earl of arundel this connection later served edward well winifred s father later married agnes sister of nicholas hare edward coke was born on 1 february 1552 in mileham one of eight children other seven were daughters winifred dorothy elizabeth ursula anna margaret and ethelreda although it is not known in which order children were born two years after robert coke died on 15 november 1561 his widow married robert bozoun a property trader noted for his piety and strong business acumen once forcing nicholas bacon to pay an exorbitant amount of money for a piece of property he had a tremendous influence on coke children from bozoun coke learnt to loathe prefer godly men and briskly do business with any willing client something that shaped his future conduct as a lawyer politician and judge education and call to bar thumb right trinity college cambridge where coke studied between 1567 and 1570 alt a photograph of front of chapel of trinity college chapel itself is a white building with arches and large glass windows at age of eight in 1560 coke began studying at norwich free grammar school education there was based on erudition eventual goal being that by age of 18 students would have learned to vary one sentence diversely to make a verse exactly to an epistle eloquently and to declaim of a theme simple and last of all to attain some competent knowledge of greek tongue students were taught rhetoric based on rhetorica ad and greek centred on works of homer and virgil coke was taught at norwich to value forcefulness of freedom of speech something he later applied as a judge some accounts relate that he was a diligent student who applied himself well after leaving norwich in 1567 he matriculated to trinity college cambridge where he studied for three years until end of 1570 when he left without gaining a degree little is known of his time at trinity though he certainly studied rhetoric and dialectics under a program instituted in 1559 his biographers felt he had all intelligence to be a good student though a record of his academic achievements has not been found coke was proud of cambridge and time he spent there later saying in dr bonham s case that cambridge and oxford were eyes and soul of realm from whence religion humanities and learning were richly diffused into all parts of realm after leaving trinity college he travelled to london where he became a member of clifford s inn in 1571 this was to learn basics of law inns of chancery including clifford s inn provided initial legal education before transfer to inns of court where one could be called to bar and practise as a barrister students were educated through arguments and debates they would be given precedents and writs each day discuss them at dinner table and then argue a moot court based on those precedents and their discussions coke also studied various writs till they turned honey sweet on his tongue and after completing this stage of his legal education transferred to inner temple on 24 april 1572 at inner temple he began second stage of his education reading legal texts such as glanville s treatises and taking part in moots he took little interest in theatrical performances or other cultural events at inns preferring to spend his time at law courts in westminster hall listening to serjeants argue after six years at inner temple he was called to bar on 20 april 1578 a remarkably fast rate of progress given process of legal education at time which normally required eight years of study polson a biographer of coke suggests that this was due to his knowledge of law which excited benchers practice as a barrister thumb left court of king s bench where coke brought his first case alt an image of

20 april 1578 coke immediately began practising as a barrister his first case was in court of king s bench in 1581 and was known as lord cromwell s case after claimant lord henry cromwell a landlord in coke s home county of norfolk case was a charge of slander against a mr denny vicar of and coke s client in a dispute with denny cromwell had hired two unlicensed preachers to harass him denounce book of common prayer and preach gospel in his area denny retorted by telling cromwell you like not of me since you like those that maintain sedition cromwell argued that denny was guilty of scandalum magnatum slander against a peer of realm because his statement implied that cromwell himself was seditious or had seditious tendencies case was actually two actions with first judgement being given in denny s favour after coke s research found a flaw in pleadings that invalidated cromwell s case his counsel had worked from an inaccurate english copy of latin statute of scandalum magnatum which had mistranslated several passages forcing them to start case anew after case was restarted coke argued that denny had commented on cromwell s support of people attacking book of common prayer and was not implying any deeper disloyalty judge ruled that denny s statement had indeed meant this and from this position of strength coke forced a settlement coke was very proud of his actions in this case and later described it in his reports as an excellent point of learning in actions of slander next year he was elected reader of lyon s inn for three years something surprising considering his young age and likely related to his conduct in lord cromwell s case as reader he was tasked with reading to students at inn a group that numbered about thirty at any one time and quality of his readings increased his reputation even further his lectures were on statute of uses and his reputation was such that when he retired to his house after an outbreak of plague nine benchers forty barristers and others of inn accompanied him a considerable distance on his journey in order to talk to him during 1580s coke became intimately linked with howard family dukes of norfolk and earls of arundel his uncle thomas gawdy had close links to earl arundel himself in norfolk arundel held a liberty he was essentially a local prince who appointed all officials maintained his own prison executed justice and bribed any royal clerks his power base was his household particularly network of lawyers and stewards who held his estates together coke s uncle thomas gawdy had served as steward to third duke of norfolk and during 1580s coke was employed by howards to counter lawyers employed by crown who argued that howards lands were forfeit owing to treason of 4th duke as well as defeating these direct attacks coke traveled to cardiff to answer a challenge by francis dacre son of william dacre 3rd baron dacre and uncle in law to 4th duke s three sons philip howard and his two half brothers thomas howard 1st earl of suffolk and lord william howard he proved that dacre s evidence was false and had case dismissed coke became involved in now classic shelley s case in 1581 which created a rule in real property that is still used in some common law jurisdictions today case also established coke s reputation as an attorney and case reporter his next famous case was chudleigh s case a dispute over interpretation of statute of uses followed by slade s case a dispute between common pleas and king s bench over assumpsit now regarded as a classic example of friction between two courts and forward movement of contract law coke s argument in slade s case formed first definition of consideration politics thanks to his work in their behalf coke had earned favour of dukes of norfolk when he secured lordship of aldeburgh for them in 1588 he also obtained aldeburgh parliamentary constituency which elected two members of parliament mps with their support coke was returned for aldeburgh as an mp in february 1589 elizabeth i solicitor general and speaker thumb right robert cecil coke s political ally who acted as a staunch defender of elizabeth i alt a portrait of robert cecil who is

coke became a member of parliament earl of leicester died in 1588 followed by sir walter mildmay chancellor of exchequer a year later and sir francis a year after that in 1592 lord chief justice died and according to custom attorney general john popham succeeded him with solicitor general thomas egerton succeeding popham this created a vacancy among law officers of crown and thanks to influence of cecil family coke became solicitor general on 16 june 1592 this was likely a narrow victory owing to coke s defence of unpopular clients he was summoned before elizabeth i who berated him until he cried before confirming him as solicitor general coke held position only briefly by time he returned from a tour of norfolk to discuss election strategy he had been confirmed as speaker of house of commons by privy council having been proposed by francis knollys and thomas heneage following his return to parliament as mp for norfolk coke held positions of speaker and solicitor general at same time although he did not take up his post as speaker until state opening of parliament on 19 february 1593 despite being confirmed on 28 january 1593 after disabling himself in house of lords a ceremony in which incoming speaker apologised for his failings parliament was suspended until 24 february coke returned two days later having suffered from a stomach problem parliament was intended to be a brief and simple one with black death resurgent throughout england and threat of spain on horizon only matter was to impose certain taxes to fund queen s campaign against spanish with no bills to be introduced taxes were paramount subsidies collected in 1589 had been spent and war continued idea of a calm swift parliament foundered on rocks of religious conflict on 27 february james morice a puritan member of parliament proposed two new bills one against bishops of church of england and other against court of high commission morice was placed under house arrest and seven members of parliament were later arrested but bills remained in parliament they were defended by francis knollys one of few remaining puritan members of parliament while other puritans spat and coughed to drown out speeches by opponents coke and cecil government s two strongest defenders in parliament made several efforts to put off or end debate over bills cecil first pointed out that queen had forbidden bills on religion parliament ignored him and bill went ahead coke as speaker of house of commons whose job was to schedule any bills conducted a delaying campaign first suggesting that bill was too long to be read in morning and then that it be delegated to a committee both suggestions were voted down by commons coke continued talking until end of parliamentary day in a filibuster action granting a day of delay for government immediately afterwards coke was summoned by queen who made it clear that any action on bills would be considered evidence of disloyalty warning was accepted by commons and no more action was taken on two puritan bills attorney general thumb left robert devereux cecil and coke s main political rival alt a portrait of robert devereux who is portrayed wearing a silver shirt he has shoulder length black hair and a brown beard which reaches down to his collar devereux is wearing a medal suspended from a green ribbon on 10 april 1594 coke was made attorney general for england and wales thanks to his partnership with cecil family francis bacon his rival was supported by robert devereux who waged a constant war against robert cecil for control of english government position of master of rolls had become vacant in april 1593 and coke was expected to be appointed according to convention bacon therefore would become attorney general coke reacted by becoming even more dogmatic in his actions on behalf of crown and when devereux approached queen on bacon s behalf she replied that even bacon s uncle lord burghley considered him second best candidate after coke attorney general was main prosecutor of crown expected to bring all charges on its behalf and serve as its legal advisor in any situation coke was appointed in a time of particular difficulty besides famine and conflict with spain war had recently broken out in ireland coke primarily dealt with matters of treason such as cases of sir john smythe and edward squire he also handled religious incidents such as disputes between jesuits and church of england personally interrogating john gerard after his capture as 1590s continued infighting between cecil and devereux persisted with devereux s raid on cadiz earning him national fame in march 1599 devereux was sent to defeat growing rebellion in ireland and was given command of 18 000 men but by november his army was reduced to 4 000 rest frittered away in exchange for conquering nothing on 5 june 1600 he faced a panel of privy councillors judges and members of nobility at york house where he was charged with appointing generals without queen s permission ignoring orders and negotiating very basely with leader of rebel forces while members of nobility wished to be gentle with devereux lawyers and judges felt differently recommending fines and confinement in tower of london in end a compromise was reached with devereux put under house arrest and dismissed from all his government offices devereux immediately began plotting rebellion orders were sent out for bedding and draperies codenames for weapons and rebellious gentlemen gathered at essex house to hear him talk of elizabeth s crooked mind and crooked carcass in response coke and cecil began a counter plot in 1599 sir john hayward had written and published first part of life and of king iv dedicating it to devereux elizabeth furious had banned book suggesting that it was a seditious prelude intended to show her as a corrupt and poor monarch against backdrop of devereux s plot coke and cecil started a new investigation into book hoping to prove some involvement of devereux in publishing coke interviewed hayward s licensing cleric samuel who complained that dedication had been foisted on him by devereux in reaction coke decided to bring charges of treason against devereux saying that he had plotted and practised with pope and king of spain for deposing and selling of himself as well as crown of england his permitting underhand that treasonable book of henry iv to be printed and published it being plainly deciphered not only by matter and by epistle itself for what end and for whose behalf it was made but also earl himself being present so often at playing thereof and with great applause giving countenance to it charges were never brought because of an incident that soon transpired on 8 february 1601 devereux ordered his followers to meet at essex house a day later a group of emissaries led by thomas egerton and john popham were sent to devereux and immediately taken hostage after a failed attempt to garner support from population of london devereux found himself surrounded in essex house after burning his personal papers he surrendered on 19 february he was tried for treason along with earl of southampton coke led case for government and devereux was found guilty and executed earl of southampton was reprieved james i thumb right sir walter raleigh whom coke prosecuted for treason alt a head

vi of scotland set out to claim english throne taking title james i and cokes immediately began ingratiating themselves with new monarch and his family elizabeth hatton coke s wife travelled to scotland to meet anne of denmark incoming queen and high tempered beauty somehow pleased that withdrawn strong willed woman for as long as anna lived lady hatton and her husband would retain queen s affection and trust coke attended divine service with new king on 22 may who following service took a sword from his bodyguard and knighted coke coke was reconfirmed as attorney general under james and immediately found himself dealing with a series of treasons whether real or imaginary first of these was trial of sir walter raleigh according to cuthbert william johnson one of coke s biographers there is perhaps no reported case in which proofs against prisoner were weaker than in this trial never was an accused person condemned on slighter grounds raleigh was brought to trial on 17 november 1603 on charges of conspiring to deprive king of his government to alter religion to bring in roman superstition and to procure foreign enemies to invade kingdom government alleged that on 11 june 1603 raleigh had met with lord cobham and they had agreed to bring lady arbella stuart a great great granddaughter of henry vii to english throne and to accept 600 000 marks from spanish government as such raleigh was charged with supporting stuart s claim to throne and claiming spanish money he pleaded not guilty with coke s only evidence being a confession from cobham who was described as a weak and unprincipled creature who said one thing at one time and another thing in another and could be relied upon in nothing this case was no case at all it supports general charges in indictment only by vaguest possible reference to these practices and plots and invasions of which no more is said coke s behaviour during trial has been repeatedly criticised on this weak evidence he called raleigh a notorious traitor vile viper and damnable atheist perverting law and using every slip of tongue as a way of further showing raleigh s guilt raleigh was found guilty and imprisoned in tower of london for more than a decade before finally being executed it is generally concluded that trial was biased strongly against raleigh although assessment of coke varies while magruder in scottish law review writes that coke s fair fame was tarnished and outraged by his part in trial boyer notes that coke was above all loyal he prosecuted raleigh in that fashion because he had been asked to show raleigh s guilt by king and as attorney general coke was bound to obey next significant government prosecution was trial of eight main gunpowder plot conspirators in westminster hall men were indicted on 27 january 1605 and tried by lords commissioners coke conducted prosecution for government an easy one since conspirators had no legal representation and through his speeches blacken ed them in eyes of world conspirators were all sentenced to death and died through various means due to his judicial appointment this was last important prosecution coke participated in in 1606 coke reported star chamber case de which ruled that truth was not a defence against an accusation of seditious libel and also held that ordinary common law courts could enforce this a doctrine which thus outlived star chamber after its abolition in 1642 leonard w levy emergence of a free press chicago ivan r dee 1985 p 7 judicial work coke s first judicial postings came under elizabeth in 1585 he was made recorder of coventry in 1587 norwich and in 1592 recorder of london a position he resigned upon his appointment as solicitor general common pleas on 20 june 1606 coke was made a serjeant at law a requirement for his elevation to chief justice of common pleas which occurred on 30 june his conduct was noted by johnson as from first excellent ever perfectly upright and fearlessly independent although convention of day was that judges held their positions only at pleasure of monarch a biographer of francis bacon noted that t he most offensive of attorney generals sic transformed into most admired and venerated of judges some assert that coke became chief justice due to his prosecutions of raleigh and gunpowder plot conspirators but there is no evidence to support this instead it was traditional at time that a retiring chief justice would be replaced with attorney general court of high commission thumb left richard bancroft who led court of high commission during coke s attacks on it alt a head and shoulders portrait of richard bancroft portrait portrays bancroft on a grey background wearing a white shirt with a black vest bancroft is wearing a black cap and has collar length brown hair over bancroft s left shoulder is a red and brown family crest coke s changed position from attorney general to chief justice allowed him to openly attack organisations he had previously supported his first target was court of high commission an ecclesiastical court established by monarch with near unlimited power it administered a mandatory ex officio oath that deliberately trapped people high commission was vastly unpopular among both common lawyers and members of parliament as idea of prerogative law challenged both authorities appointment of richard bancroft as archbishop of canterbury in 1604 caused issue to grow in importance according to p b waite a canadian historian bancroft s zeal and strictness could hardly fail to produce an atmosphere in which principles and issues would crystallize in which logic would supplant reasonableness judges particularly coke began to unite with parliament in challenging high commission in 1607 parliament openly asked for coke s opinion on high commission s practices he replied that no man ecclesiastical or temporal shall be examined upon secret thoughts of his heart or of his secret opinion during this period a notorious suit ran through courts known as fuller s case after defendant nicholas fuller a barrister fuller had several clients fined by high commission for non conformity and stated that high commission s procedure was popish under jurisdiction not of christ but of anti christ for this fuller was held in custody for contempt of court court of king s bench argued that this was a lay matter while high commission claimed it fell under their jurisdiction coke had no official role other than acting as a mediator between two but in end fuller was convicted by high commission this was a defeat for common law and in response coke spent summer issuing writs of prohibition to again challenge bancroft and high commission on 6 november 1608 common law judges and members of high commission were summoned before king and told that they would argue and allow him to decide finding themselves unable to even argue coherently instead standing sullen merely denying each others statements group was dismissed and reconvened a week later coke speaking for judges argued that jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts was limited to cases where no temporal matters were involved and rest left to common law at this point king s own position in relation to law and his authority to decide this matter was brought up in what became known as case of prohibitions james stated that in cases where there is not express authority in law king may himself decide in his royal person judges are but delegates of king coke challenged this saying king in his own person cannot adjudge any case either criminal as treason felony etc or betwixt party and party but this ought to be determined and adjudged in some court of justice according to law and custom of england coke further stated that common law protecteth king to which james replied king protecteth law and not law king king maketh judges and bishops if judges interpret laws themselves and suffer none else to interpret they may easily make of laws s hose coke rejected this stating that while monarch was not subject to any individual he was subject to law until he had gained sufficient knowledge of law he had no right to interpret it he pointed out that such knowledge demanded mastery of an artificial reason which requires long study and experience before that a man can attain to cognizance of it coke was only saved from imprisonment by cecil who pleaded with king to show leniency which he granted after conclusion of this dispute coke freely left and continued to issue writs of prohibition against high commission dr bonham s case thumb meaning of coke s ruling in thomas bonham v college of physicians has been disputed over years thomas bonham v college of physicians commonly known as dr bonham s case was a decision of court of common pleas under coke in which he ruled that coke s meaning has been disputed over years some interpret his judgment as referring to judicial review of statutes to correct misunderstandings which would render them unfair while others argue he meant that common law courts have power to completely strike down those statutes they deem to be repugnant whatever coke s meaning after an initial period of application bonham s case was thrown aside in favour of growing doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty initially written down by william blackstone this theory makes parliament sovereign law maker preventing common law courts from not only throwing aside but also reviewing statutes in fashion coke suggested parliamentary sovereignty is now universally accepted judicial doctrine in england and wales bonham s case met a mixed reaction at time with king and lord ellesmere both deeply unhappy with it nineteenth and twentieth century academics are scarcely more favourable calling it a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra judicially and an abortion in united states coke s decision met with a better reaction during legal and public campaigns against writs of assistance and stamp act 1765 bonham s case was given as a justification for nullifying legislation marbury v madison american case which forms basis for exercise of judicial review in united states under article iii of constitution uses words void and repugnant seen as a direct reference to coke some academics such as edward samuel corwin have argued that coke s work in bonham s case forms basis of judicial review and declaration of legislation as unconstitutional in united states gary l mcdowell calls this one of most enduring myths of american constitutional law and theory to say nothing of history pointing out that at no point during constitutional convention was bonham s case referenced king s bench thumb left edward coke transferred to court of king s bench on 25 october 1613 coke was transferred from common pleas where he was succeeded by hobart to court of king s bench on 25 october 1613 on advice of bacon presumably because bacon and king felt that if he was moved from a court dedicated to protecting rights of people to one dedicated to rights of king his capacity for harm would be diminished from bacon s point of view king s bench was a far more precarious position for someone loyal to common law rather than monarch coke s first case of note there was peacham s case in which he dictated that writing of a sermon by puritan clergyman edmund peacham which advocated death of king a sermon which was never preached or published could not constitute treason king was unwilling to accept this decision and instead had him tried by coke s opponents on bench who not surprisingly found him guilty although his life was spared refusing to admit his guilt peacham was tortured on rack but before torture between torture and after torture nothing could be drawn from him in 1616 two years after peacham s case case of arose in writ was a method of transferring ecclesiastical property which james used in this case to allow richard to hold his bishopric and associated revenues without actually performing duties on 25 april 1616 courts at coke s bidding held that this action was illegal writing to king that in case any letters come unto us contrary to law we do nothing by such letters but certify your majesty thereof and go forth to do law notwithstanding same james called judges before him and furious ripped up letter telling them that i well know true and ancient common law to be most favourable to kings of any law in world to which law i do advise you my judges to apply your studies while all other judges succumbed to royal pressure and throwing themselves on their knees prayed for pardon coke defended letter and stated that when case happens i shall do that which shall be fit for a judge to do this was last straw on advice from bacon who had long been jealous of coke james i suspended coke from privy council forbade him from going on circuit and on 14 november dismissed him from his post as chief justice of king s bench this was greeted by deep resentment in country which saw king s actions as tampering with justice coke himself reacted by sinking into a deep depression james i then ordered coke to spend his time expunging and retracting such novelties and errors and offensive conceits as are dispersed in his reports bacon now in royal favour became lord chancellor on 3 march 1617 and set up a commission to purge reports also using his authority to expand powers of high commission with james unable to declare coke incompetent some of what humphry william woolrych describes as colorable excuses were produced to justify coke s dismissal he was accused of concealing ps12 000 uttering high words of contempt as a judge and declaring himself chief justice of england return to politics thumb in june 1614 edward coke was unanimously elected high steward of university of cambridge portrait by gilbert jackson in guildhall art gallery london now out of favour and with no chance of returning to judiciary coke was re elected to parliament as an mp ironically by order of king who expected coke to support his efforts elected in 1620 coke sat for in 1621 parliament which was called by king to raise revenues other topics of discussion included a proposed marriage between prince of wales and maria anna of spain and possible military support for king s son in law frederick v elector palatine coke became a leading opposition mp along with robert phelips thomas wentworth and john pym campaigning against any military intervention and marriage of prince of wales and maria anna his position at head of opposition was unsurprising given his extensive experience in both local and central government as well as his ability to speak with authority on matters of economics parliamentary procedure and law he subsequently sat as mp for coventry 1624 norfolk 1625 and buckinghamshire 1628 in june 1614 university of cambridge by unanimous vote elected coke high steward an honorary office immediately below chancellor of university through cecil previously high steward and then chancellor of cambridge coke had procured for university right to send its own two representatives to parliament a matter of much practical benefit a fervent coke had a habit of naming cambridge first including in parliament when reminded that precedence belonged to oxford by vote of house coke persisted in giving cambridge primacy a privy councilor sir thomas edmondes interrupted with a rebuke it was reported that coke suggested edmondes not bother worrying about primacy of oxford or cambridge given that he had not attended either university monopolies coke used his role in parliament as a leading opposition mp to attack patents a system he had already criticised as a judge historically english patent law was based on custom and common law not on statute it began as crown granted patents as a form of economic protection to ensure high industrial production as gifts from crown there was no judicial review oversight or consideration and no actual law concerning patents to boost england s economy edward ii began encouraging foreign workmen and inventors to settle in england offering letters of protection that protected them from guild policy on condition that they train english apprentices and pass on their knowledge letters did not grant a full monopoly rather they acted as a passport allowing foreign workers to travel to england and practice their trade this process continued for three centuries with formal procedures set out in 1561 to issue letters patent to any new industry allowing monopolies granting of these patents was highly popular with monarch because of potential for raising revenue a patentee was expected to pay heavily for patent and unlike a tax raise another method of raising crown money any public unrest as a result of patent was normally directed at patentee not monarch over time this system became more and more problematic instead of temporary monopolies on specific imported industries long term monopolies came about over more common commodities including salt and starch these monopolies led to a showdown between crown and parliament in which it was agreed in 1601 to turn power to administer patents over to common law courts at same time elizabeth revoked a number of more restrictive and damaging monopolies even given a string of judicial decisions criticising and overruling such monopolies james i when he took throne continued using patents to create monopolies coke used his position in parliament to attack these patents which were according to him now grown like hydras heads they grow up as fast as they are cut off coke succeeded in establishing committee of grievances a body chaired by him that abolished a large number of monopolies this was followed by a wave of protest at patent system on 27 march 1621 james suggested house of commons draw up a list of three most objectionable patents and he would remove them but by this time a statute was already being prepared by coke after passing on 12 may it was thrown out by house of lords but a statute of monopolies was finally passed by parliament on 25 may 1624 in response to both this and coke s establishment of a sub committee to establish freedom of speech and discuss rights of commons james announced that you usurp upon our prerogative royal and meddle with things far above your reach he first adjourned parliament and then forbade commons from discussing matters of state at home or abroad ignoring this ban parliament issued a remonstrance to king on 11 december 1621 authored by coke in which they restated their liberties and right to discuss matters of state claiming that such rights were ancient and undoubted birthright and inheritance of subjects of england after a debate it was sent to james who rejected it commons instead resolved to enter it into journal of commons which required no royal authorisation in presence of parliament king reacted by tearing offending page from journal declaring that it should be razed out of all memories and utterly annihilated then dissolved parliament coke was then imprisoned in tower of london on 27 december being released nine months later liberty and resolutions thumb right john selden who along with coke presented resolutions to house of lords alt a portrait of john selden selden blends into brown background of portrait his face is visible he has brown eyes and shoulder length brown hair he has a serious look on his face james died on 27 march 1625 and was succeeded by his son who became charles i of england coke was made high sheriff of buckinghamshire by king in 1625 which prohibited him from sitting in parliament until his term expired a year later following his father s example charles raised loans without parliament s sanction and imprisoned without trial those who would not pay judges of court of common pleas and king s bench declared this to be illegal and chief justice sir ranulph crewe was dismissed at this remaining judges succumbed to king s pressure more and more people refused to pay leading to darnell s case in which courts confirmed that if no cause was given for detention prisoner could not be freed as offence was probably too dangerous for public discussion result of this was that wealthy landowners refused to pay loan and crown s income fell below charles s expectations forcing him to call a fresh parliament in march 1627 with popular anger at charles s policies many mps were opposed to him including pym coke and a young oliver cromwell martial law was then declared with continued imprisonment for a failure to pay forced loans and soldiers billeted in homes of private citizens to intimidate population something which led to coke s famous declaration that house of an englishman is to him as his castle commons responded to these measures by insisting that magna carta which expressly forbade imprisonment of freemen without trial was still valid coke then prepared resolutions which later led to habeas corpus act 1679 these declared that magna carta was still in force and that furthermore in addition no tax or loan could be levied without parliament s permission and no private citizen could be forced into accepting soldiers into his home coke john selden and rest of committee for grievances presented resolutions to house of lords with coke citing seven statutes and 31 cases to support his argument he told lords that imprisonment in law is a civil death and a prison without a prefixed time is a kind of hell lords supportive of king were not swayed and charles himself eventually rejected resolutions insisting that commons trust him petition of right thumb left coke at time of petition of right s passage alt a mono color circular portrait of edward coke portraying him dressed in a ruffled collar he has a black cap on his head and a goatee coke undertook central role in framing and writing petition of right ongoing struggles over martial law and civil liberties along with rejection of resolutions seriously concerned commons accordingly coke convinced lords to meet with commons in april 1628 in order to discuss a petition to king confirming rights and liberties of royal subjects commons immediately accepted this and after a struggle lords agreed to allow a committee chaired by coke to draft eventual document hearing of this king sent a message to parliament forbidding commons from discussing matters of state resulting debate led to some mps being unable to speak due to their fear that king was threatening them with destruction of parliament coke despite fear in parliament stood and spoke citing historical precedents supporting principle that members of commons could within parliament say whatever they wished something now codified as parliamentary privilege petition of right was affirmed by commons and sent to lords who approved it on 17 may 1628 document s publication was met with bonfires and ringing of church bells throughout england as well as laying out a long list of statutes which had been broken it proclaimed various rights and liberties of free englishmen including a freedom from taxation without parliamentary approval right of habeas corpus a prohibition on soldiers being billeted in houses without owner s will and a prohibition on imposing martial law on civilians it was later passed into formal law by long parliament in 1641 and became one of three constitutional documents of english civil liberties along with magna carta and bill of rights 1689 retirement thumb monument to edward coke in st mary s church tittleshall in norfolk when parliament was dissolved in 1629 charles decided to govern without one and coke retired to his estate at stoke buckinghamshire about 20 miles west of london spending his time making revisions to his written works he made no attempt to return to politics stating that petition of right would be left as his greatest inheritance his desire to complete his writings coupled with his advanced age may also have been factors despite his age coke was still in good health and exercised daily following an accident in which his horse fell on him he refused to consult doctors saying that he had a disease which all drugs of asia gold of africa nor all doctors of europe could cure old age and instead chose to remain confined to house without medical treatment as he was on his deathbed privy council ordered that his house and chambers be searched seizing 50 manuscripts which were later restored his will

found out that bacon was also pursuing her hand coke acted with all speed to complete ceremony it was held at a private house at wrong time rather than at a church between 8 and 12 in morning all involved parties were prosecuted for breaching ecclesiastical law and coke had to beg for a pardon it is said that coke first suggested marrying hatton to sir robert cecil hatton s uncle at funeral of lord burghley coke s patron he needed to ensure that he would continue his rise under burghley s son cecil and did this by marrying into family hatton was 26 years younger than coke hot tempered and articulate boyer wrote that if she and coke were not compatible at least they were well matched their marriage having broken down in 1604 hatton went on to become a formidable protagonist and thorn in

thirteen volumes of law reports and four volume institutes of lawes of england john marshall gest writing in yale law journal notes that there are few principles of common law that can be studied without an examination of coke s institutes and reports which summed up legal learning of his time although student is deterred by too common abuse of coke s character and general criticism of his writings as dry verbose and pedantic john campbell in lives of chief justices of england said that his reasoning is narrow minded he had utter contempt for method and style in his compositions and says that coke s reports were with quaintness and pedantry gest noting this criticism points out that reports thumb left frontispiece to first volume of coke s reports 1600 alt front cover of coke s reports in centre title of book les reports de edward coke with a large subtitle around outside is a collection of images centred on a pair of pillars his law reports known as coke s reports were an archive of judgments from cases he had attended in which he had participated or about which he had been informed they started with notes he made as a law student in winter of 1572 with full reporting of cases from october 1579 reports were initially written down in seven notebooks four of which are lost first notebook contains not only law reports but also a draft version of coke s first institutes of lawes of england coke began reporting cases in traditional manner by copying out and repeating cases found in earlier law reports such as those of edmund plowden after being called to bar in 1578 he began attending court cases at westminster hall and soon drew attention of court officials many early reports have notes that he was told by old plowden or by wray cj original reports were kept in a generally chronological order interspersed with personal memos obituaries and notes on court practices they are not entirely chronological during his career coke took note of earlier cases which had drawn his attention these were written down with plea roll reference and year in which coke recorded them but later editions failed to include plea roll reference and led to inaccuracies reports have gained significant academic acclaim writing in cornell law quarterly theodore plucknett describes them as works of incomparable richness with a profound influence upon literature and indeed substance of english law john baker has described them as perhaps single most influential series of named reports and even francis bacon coke s rival wrote in praise of them saying had it not been for sir edward coke s reports which though they may have errors and some peremptory and extrajudicial resolutions more than are warranted yet they contain infinite good decisions and rulings over of cases for law by this time had been almost like a ship without ballast for that cases of modern experience are fled from those that are adjudged and ruled in former time although loaned to friends and family and therefore in slight public circulation coke s reports were never formally used during his lifetime select cases were published in 1600 containing most famous of his decisions and pleadings while a second volume in 1602 was more chronological in nature third part published in same year was also chronological while fourth published in 1604 was arranged by subject fifth part published in 1605 is arranged similarly as is sixth published in 1607 five more volumes were published until 1615 but coke died before he could publish a single bound copy no trace has been found of draft manuscript some academics have questioned accuracy of reports coke s famous case of proclamations and his speech there was first brought into public consciousness through its inclusion in volume 12 of his reports and roland g usher writing in english historical review notes that certain manuscripts at hatfield house and elsewhere seem to throw some doubt upon this famous account of a famous interview one of reasons given for possible inaccuracies in later volumes of reports is that they were published posthumously in july 1634 officials acting on order of king had seized coke s papers but a 1641 motion in house of commons restored extant papers to coke s eldest son twelfth and thirteenth volumes of reports were based on fragments of notes several decades old not on coke s original manuscript institutes coke s other main work was institutes of lawes of england a four volume treatise described as his masterwork first volume commentary upon littleton known as coke on littleton was published in 1628 it is ostensibly a commentary on sir thomas littleton s treatise on tenures but actually covered many areas of law of his time other three volumes were all published after his death and covered 39 constitutional statutes of importance starting with magna carta law relating to criminal law and constitutional and administrative law respectively while reports were intended to give an explanation of law chronologically coke s purpose was to provide an english language tutorial for students studying law at inns of court this served as an alternative to roman law lectures at university which were based on latin according to bowen it was a double vision institutes as authority reports as illustration by actual practise part one commentary upon littleton was undoubtedly most famous copies were exported to united states early in colonial era work was first printed in an american edition in 1812 by which point english version was in its sixteenth edition and had been commented on itself by various later legal authorities as with reports coke s institutes became a standard textbook in united states and was recorded in law libraries of harvard college in 1723 and brown university in 1770 john jay john adams theophilus parsons and thomas jefferson were all influenced by it john rutledge later wrote that coke s institutes seems to be almost foundations of our law while jefferson stated that a sounder whig never wrote more profound learning in orthodox doctrine of british liberties third institutes has been described as first really adequate discussion of treason a work which went far towards offering remedy of a humanized common law to injustices of trial procedures work had its detractors with some writers criticising it for repulsive pedantry and overbearing assertions as well as incorrect citations to works that were later discredited there are also factual inaccuracies kenyon in ecclesiastical law journal notes that despite being considered supreme legal authority on subject of consecration which coke covered in third volume of institutes he offered no legal support for his opinion and ignored those pieces of case law which rejected his interpretation jurisprudence coke s jurisprudence centres on hierarchy of judges monarch and parliament in making law coke argued that judges of common law were those most suited to making law followed by parliament and that monarch was bound to follow any legal rules this principle was justified by idea that a judge through his professional training internalised what political historian and theorist alan cromartie referred to as an infinity of wisdom something that mere politicians or laypersons could not understand due to complexity of law coke s commentary on littleton has been interpreted as deliberately obtuse with his aim being to write what cromartie called a sort of anti textbook a work whose very form denied that legal knowledge could be organised original edition could not be used for reference purposes as coke had published it without an index it is a book to be read in and lived with rather than consulted a monument to uselessness of merely written knowledge unless it is internalised in a trained professional mind this theory that judges were natural arbiters of law is known as appeal to reason with reason referring not to rationality but method and logic used by judges in upholding and striking down laws coke s position meant that certainty of law and intellectual beauty was way to see if a law was just and correct and that system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable john selden similarly thought that common law was proper law of england he argued that this did not necessarily create judicial discretion to alter it and that proper did not necessarily equal perfect law was nothing more than a contract made by english people this is known as appeal to contract thomas hobbes and francis bacon argued against coke s theory they were proponents of natural law created by king s authority not by any individual judge hobbes felt that there was no skill unique to lawyers and that law could be understood not through coke s reason method used by lawyers but through understanding king s instructions while judges did make law this was only valid because it was tacitly confirmed because not disapproved by king legacy coke s challenge to ecclesiastical courts and their ex officio oath is seen as origin of right to silence with his decision that common law courts could issue writs of prohibition against such oaths and his arguments that such oaths were contrary to common law as found in his reports and institutes coke dealt crucial blow to oath ex officio and to high commission case of john lilburne later confirmed that not only was such an oath invalid but that there was a right to silence drawing from coke s decisions in reaching that conclusion in trial of sir roger casement for treason in 1916 coke s assertion that treason is defined as giving aide and comfort to king s enemies within realme or without was deciding factor in finding him guilty his work in slade s case led to rise of modern contract law and his actions in case of proclamations and other pleadings which led to his eventual dismissal went some way towards securing judicial independence statute of monopolies foundation for which was laid by coke and which was drafted by him is considered one of first steps towards eventual english civil war and also one of landmarks in transition of england s economy from feudal to capitalist legal precept that no one may enter a home unless by invitation was established as common law in coke s institutes for a man s house is his castle et domus sua cuique est refugium and each man s home is his safest refuge it is origin of famous dictum an englishman s home is his castle coke was particularly influential in united states both before and after american war of independence during legal and public campaigns against writs of assistance and stamp act 1765 bonham s case was given as a justification for nullifying legislation and in income tax case of 1895 joseph hodges choate used coke s argument that a tax upon income of property is a tax on property itself to have supreme court of united states declare wilson gorman tariff act unconstitutional this decision ultimately led to passage of sixteenth amendment castle doctrine originates from coke s statement in third institutes that a man s home is his castle for where shall he be safe if it not be in his house which also profoundly influenced fourth amendment to united states constitution third amendment on other hand was influenced by petition of right coke was also a strong influence on and mentor of roger williams an english theologian who founded rhode island colony in north america and was an early proponent of doctrine of separation of church and state character coke was noted as deriving great enjoyment from and working hard at law but enjoying little else he was versed in latin classics and maintained a sizeable estate but law was his primary concern francis bacon his main competitor was known as a philosopher and man of learning but coke had no interest in such subjects notably when given a copy of novum organum by bacon coke wrote puerile insults in it coke s style and attitude as a barrister are well documented he was regarded even during his life as greatest lawyer of his time in both reputation and monetary success he was eloquent effective forceful and occasionally overbearing his most famous arguments can be read in complete state trials volume i and ii most early lawyers were not noted for their eloquence with thomas writing that they lacked elocution and pronunciation two of principal parts of and roger ascham saying that they do best when they cry loudest describing a court case where an advocate was roaring like a bull in court coke was insulting to parties disrespectful to judges and rough overbearing a rival once wrote to him saying in your pleadings you were wont to insult over misery and to bitterly at persons which bred you many enemies coke was pedantic and technical something which saw him win many cases as a barrister but when he became attorney general he showed same qualities in a less pleasing form he was determined to get a conviction by every means in his power francis watt writing in juridical review portrays this as coke s strongest characteristic as a lawyer that he was a man who having once taken up a point or become engaged in a case believes in it with all his heart and soul whilst all time conscious of its weakness as well as ready to resort to every device to bolster it up writers have struggled to reconcile his achievements as a judge surrounding rejection of executive power and rights of man with his tenure as attorney general with gerald p noting that his early career as a state prosecutor was one of arrogance and brutality coke made a fortune from purchasing estates with clouded titles at a discount whereupon through his knowledge of intricacies of property law he would clear titles on acquired properties to his favour about year 1615 his amassed property acquisitions attracted attention of government james i claimed that coke had already as much land as it was proper a subject should possess story goes that coke requested king s permission to just add one acre more to his holdings and upon approval proceeded to purchase fine estate of
