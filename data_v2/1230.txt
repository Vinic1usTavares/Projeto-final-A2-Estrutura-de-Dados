ah god how much heartbreak is a church cantata by johann sebastian bach he composed dialogue cantata in leipzig for sunday after new year s day text has been attributed to christoph birkmann by christine blanken of bach archiv leipzig he combined topics of readings gospel of flight into egypt and teaching about suffering of christians from first epistle of peter in a structure of unusual symmetry with a duet as first and last of five movements both duets are dialogues of soul represented by a soprano and jesus sung by a bass as voice of christ both duets are set as a chorale fantasia combining a stanza from a hymn sung by soprano as cantus firmus with original poetry set in counterpoint both stanzas are sung to same melody but come from different hymns martin moller s and martin behm s while poet wrote duets to fit same music bach composed them in contrast even changing meter of tune to fit different mood lamenting heartbreak in beginning comfort in end bach scored work for a small baroque instrumental ensemble of originally just strings and continuo probably intended to ease workload of musicians for christmas season in a later version he added a trio of oboes to outer movements bach counted work as part of his cycle of chorale cantatas which he had begun in 1724 it was presumably first performed on 5 january 1727 history and text bach composed dialogue cantata sunday after new year s day probably of 1727 this occasion happens only in years with a sunday between new year s day and epiphany on 6 january prescribed readings for day are from first epistle of peter suffering of christians and from gospel of matthew flight into egypt in his first year as thomaskantor director of church music in leipzig bach had composed for this occasion text has been attributed in 2015 to christoph birkmann a theologian and student of bach by christine blanken of bach archiv leipzig he retells topic of gospel in first recitative and expands it to journey suffering and perils of contemporary christian with a focus on contrast between suffering on earth and joy in heaven two outer movements are unusually similar both duets of soul and jesus using a hymn stanza and free text first movements includes first stanza of ach gott wie manches herzeleid published by martin moller in 1587 last movement includes second stanza of martin behm s published in 1610 in second volume of collection melody is same for both hymns and first appeared in lochamer s lochamer around 1455 poet s own verse for two movements is also similar as if author expected composer to repeat music but bach set them differently even contrasting bach performed cantata presumably first on 5 january 1727 he performed it again on 4 january 1733 or 3 january 1734 only this later version survived for which bach had added oboes to orchestra and wrote a new third movement surviving continuo part of original aria suggests a significantly different character as only continuo part of first version of central aria movement survived it is unknown if text was also changed bach counted work as part of his cycle of chorale cantatas which he had begun in 1724 25 in that year s christmas season sunday fell between christmas and new year a different occasion with different prescribed readings is not similar to early works of that cycle which focus on one lutheran hymn such as a cantata on moller s hymn composed for second sunday after epiphany of 1725 according to bach scholar alfred durr cantata is to be numbered among successors of seventeenth century dialogue compositions as a dialogue of faithful soul with god scoring and structure bach structured cantata in five movements in a symmetrical arrangement of two framing duets surrounding recitatives and a central aria bach scored work for two vocal soloists soprano s and bass b and a baroque instrumental ensemble of originally two violins vl viola va and basso continuo john eliot gardiner who conducted bach cantata pilgrimage in 2000 notes that scoring for just two voices and strings was probably intended to ease workload of musicians who had a busy time during christmas season in later version bach added a trio of two oboes ob and taille ot duration is given as 17 minutes in following table of movements scoring follows neue bach ausgabe of later version keys and time signatures are taken from book on all cantatas by bach scholar alfred durr using symbols for common time 4 4 continuo playing throughout is not shown music structure of piece is unusually symmetric it opens and closes with a duet including a chorale text harmonically piece begins and ends in c major and central movement is in d minor second movement modulates from a minor to f major while fourth movement mirrors this motion 1 first movement ah god how much heartache is a chorale fantasia with soprano representing soul singing cantus firmus reinforced by taille while bass as voice of christ delivers original verse in counterpoint to melody melody is tonal but with a very chromatic subtext movement marked adagio begins with a ritornello of strings doubled by oboes a dotted rhythm figure characteristic of a french overture dominates music a figure of lament appears first in continuo then also in upper voices ritornello recurs midway through movement 2 secco bass recitative though angry world might persecute you is chromatic and in two sections first describes a history of persecution related to flight into egypt with striding angular phrases while second section emphasizes presence of god using a gentler and smoother melodic line 3 third movement i am cheerful in my sorrow is a soprano aria with an obbligato solo violin da capo movement describes spirit s confidence in god first section includes a motto theme transitioning into a hectic violin melody middle section is characterized by a muscular soprano line and oddly bizarre solo violin first section returns modified and unheralded 4 soprano recitative if world cannot cease begins by recounting persecution but quickly becomes an arioso with a walking continuo 5 final movement i have a difficult journey before me opens with a triad fanfare which bass voice sings on words nur be comforted it is similar to a motif in bach s violin concerto in e minor bwv 1042 soprano reprises chorale melody in duple rather than original triple time with a responding line in bass voice after two phrases ritornello plays alone for eight measures before both voices re enter in counterpoint to complete chorale recordings frank bach aria group bach aria
