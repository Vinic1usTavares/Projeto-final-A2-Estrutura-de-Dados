san pedro is a holocene composite volcano in northern chile and one of tallest active volcanoes in world part of chilean andes volcanic segment it is part of central volcanic zone of andes one of four tracts of andean volcanic belt this region of volcanism includes world s two highest volcanoes ojos del salado and llullaillaco san pedro like other andean volcanoes was formed by subduction of nazca plate beneath south america plate it has a neighbouring volcano san pablo and is itself formed by two separate edifices usually known as old cone and young cone these edifices are formed by rocks ranging from basaltic andesite over andesite to dacite and are emplaced on a basement formed by miocene volcanic rocks old cone was active over one hundred thousand years ago and was eventually truncated by a giant landslide that removed its northwestern side within landslide scar lava flows and pyroclastic flows constructed young cone as well as lateral centre la poruna this volcano was glaciated during pleistocene and a large plinian eruption occurred at beginning of holocene some eruptions reportedly occurred during historical time presently volcano is fumarolically active geography and geomorphology san pedro is located in northern chile in ollague commune el loa province tarapaca region border to bolivia is away whole region is remote and thinly populated towns in area include ascotan and and san pedro railway station lies southwest of volcano tracks left by sulfur miners lead up to san pedro s summit and roads run around volcano passes around northern northwestern and western flanks of volcano san pedro is part of long central volcanic zone one of two belts of volcanoes in chile which contains a total of about 44 active volcanoes plus silicic caldera and ignimbrite systems and monogenetic volcanoes many of these volcanoes are of pliocene pleistocene age and approach heights of about above sea level at llullaillaco and ojos del salado such sizes of volcanoes occur because edifices rise from a relatively high basement volcanism in this region is relatively poorly studied and there is not much present day activity with exception of lascar most present day manifestations are limited to fumarolic activity san pedro is one of highest volcanoes in world and is visible as far as away in its height has been variously given as or it is a composite volcano which forms a twin volcano with san pablo farther east between two lies so called central crater at an elevation of san pedro itself is formed from easterly old cone whose most prominent expression is eastern summit and westerly young cone which is only about lower young cone has two craters eastern of which is younger one lava flows emerge from a breach in this crater and have filled an older wide older crater hydrothermally altered rocks and sulfur deposits are found on san pedro s summit and were mined into 1930s a number of lava flows of volumes between make up part of edifice upper part of younger cone is covered with such lava flows which have steep fronts and are up to thick downslope lava flows are found mainly over northwestern flank where they radiate away from san pedro s crater scars at elevations of on edifice have been origin of mudflows largest is known as estacion flow and covers much of southern and western foot of san pedro to distances of debris apron reaches loa river and san pedro river these mudflows occurred between 110 000 36 000 years ago and they filled river bed of loa while impact on san pedro river was much more minor hot avalanche deposits or pyroclastic flows are also found on volcano largest of which covers large parts of edifice and has a total volume of approximately these deposits contain prismatic jointed blocks and poorly sorted pumice with their thickness ranging from a thick layer to scattered rocks their formation was probably due to steep incline of san pedro s slopes which tended to destabilize lava bodies high on edifice similar to regular landslides at least one plinian fall deposit is known from san pedro size of deposit indicates that it was as large as ad 79 eruption of vesuvius in italy this plinian eruption was accompanied by formation of an ignimbrite that covers much of southern southwestern and western slopes of san pedro and reaches thicknesses of it has a volume of and is called el encanto ignimbrite there is evidence of a large sector collapse on san pedro which removed northwestern flank of volcano and formed a large debris avalanche deposit this avalanche deposit covers a surface area of and its front is high in pampa de la debris flow formed by sector collapse does not have many of typical hummock like hills of volcanic sector collapse deposits and instead features grooves and radial ridges such flank collapse occurred notably on mount st helens during its eruption in 1980 a high scarp west of eastern summit was left by collapse of san pedro otherwise much of evidence was buried by later volcanic activity as with mudflows steep slopes of san pedro probably facilitated onset of sector collapse which descended over an elevation difference of about a parasitic vent named la poruna lies on western foot of san pedro its formation was probably influenced by a normal fault that runs in that area it is a wide and high scoria cone on top of a field of lava flows which extend as far as west of san pedro and from cone cone s western side slumped and lava flows issued from breach in addition a lava dome at an elevation of lies on southwestern flank of san pedro and also seems to be a parasitic vent andesite lava flows emanate from this area as well they are largest found on san pedro with volumes of and a surface area of they reach a distance of from vent san pedro has been glaciated in past evidence of such glaciation is found especially on southern side of old cone and it includes moraines at elevations of over as well as other glacially modified surfaces such as rock pavements and striated boulders chronology of glaciations in central andes is poorly known but stratigraphic relations indicate that san pedro was glaciated during late pleistocene some cirques on southern flank contain evidence of past rock glaciers but there are no glaciers presently on mountain san pedro river flows at foot of san pedro volcano and joins loa river southwest of volcano pleistocene lava flows from san pedro created a lava dam on san pedro river forming a lake which no longer exists as reported in 1926 slopes of san pedro were used to cultivate a plant that was grown as a fuel source geology beneath northern chile nazca plate subducts beneath south america plate this subduction process is responsible for volcanic activity in western cordillera as well as elsewhere in andes volcanoes of chile are part of pacific ring of fire which in chile contains about 2000 volcanoes over a length of in chile it is subdivided into two volcanic zones central volcanic zone which also spans peru bolivia and argentina and southern volcanic zone which spans chile and argentina in addition colombia and ecuador feature northern volcanic zone while subduction of antarctic plate beneath south america plate at southernmost tip of south america forms austral volcanic zone south of southern volcanic zone there were two cycles of volcanic activity in chile first during permian triassic and a second starting from tertiary in san pedro region this volcanic activity migrated east from its point of inception but recently has moved back westward west of san pedro lies pampa del tamarugal and coastal cordillera neither of which show evidence of recent volcanic activity regional volcanoes in this region of chile often form lineaments perpendicular to volcanic arc with northwest southeast and north south lineaments commons other volcanoes with such trends are cerro cerro ascotan and aucanquilcha complex youngest edifice is westernmost one basement of region is formed by various metamorphic and sedimentary rocks intruded by plutons ranging in their age from paleozoic to tertiary one of these is 65 million years old cerro colorado pluton however in area of san pedro this basement is entirely buried beneath volcanites of miocene age including ignimbrites remnants of composite volcanoes and volcanic debris at least three individual ignimbrites have been found one of ignimbrites san pedro ignimbrite may have originated from a vent now covered by san pedro volcano although neighbouring volcano is also a candidate source older composite volcano centres include cerro and cerro south southeast of san pedro and cerro del diablo due north this surface slopes down to loa river in west composition old cone lavas range from andesite to olivine containing basaltic andesite young cone lavas include both andesite and hornblende containing dacite volcanic rocks erupted during both stages of san pedro belong to potassium rich calc alkaline suite san pedro volcanic rocks are usually glassy with only tiny phenocrysts plagioclase and pyroxene are dominant minerals with amphibole and olivine being secondary components magma feeding volcano probably formed from mixing of magmas of distinct temperatures as indicated by various clues indicating significant thermal between various components eruption of la poruna appears to have been accompanied by a change in magma system of general volcano climate region has an arid climate with infrequent precipitation moisture ultimately originates on tropical atlantic ocean and much of it rains out as it crosses eastern cordillera and altiplano so that little reaches western cordillera with precipitation in san pedro area less than this dryness was interrupted during late ice age between 17 000 and 11 000 years before present by a wetter period during which glaciers expanded eruptive history san pedro formed in two stages which are known as old cone and young cone old cone was formed by lava and scoria and later largely buried by glacial mudflows and volcanic deposits of young cone it forms about 80 of volume of present day san pedro edifice one date has been obtained on old cone lavas by argon argon dating 160 000 years ago after activity of old cone ceased glacial and fluvial erosion dissected san pedro until large sector collapse occurred so called white airfall with a volume of as well as pyroclastic flows on western summit may have been erupted during collapse but this is uncertain activity of young cone began after collapse within scar left by failure of edifice this activity involved extrusion of four groups of lavas of both andesitic and dacitic composition as well as lava domes and one pumice flow apparently emission of each lava unit was preceded by explosive eruptions which formed pyroclastic flows argon argon dating on one of these units has yielded an age of 100 000 35 000 years ago surface exposure dating of la poruna parasitic vent has yielded an age of 103 000 1 200 years before present it was previously proposed that la poruna formed in late 19th century southwest dome is of comparable age to la poruna 107 000 12 years ago in general dates obtained by argon argon dating range from 168 000 to 68 000 years ago a large eruption covered parts of upper edifice with scoria about 15 000 years before present plinian eruption was even more recent occurring about 10 000 years ago 10 085 45 radiocarbon years ago after this event four small lava domes formed in summit region and partly underwent collapse forming hot avalanche deposits it is possible that 1901 eruption was one of these lava dome forming events historical activity eruptions at san pedro are reported from possibly 1885 when a newspaper from valparaiso reported strong shaking of earth emission of large quantities of white steam and damage to railway houses and water pipes other eruptions reported from san pedro were in 1901 when an eruption caused damage may august 1910 1911 february 1938 and a minor event in december 1960 additional eruptions are mentioned in records and dated to 1870 1916 1917 1923 all these eruptions are uncertain and apparently of phreatic nature and no geological evidence of them has been found timing of eruptions at san pedro sometimes is unclear one eruption reported from 1877 may instead have occurred in 1891 as there are two reports of an eruption before 1910 and they may either refer to one eruption with two candidate dates or two eruptions this volcanic activity makes san pedro one of highest active volcanoes presently fumaroles in eastern summit crater are only ongoing activity at san pedro a steam plume is barely visible fumarole has formed sulfur deposits based on measurements made in december 2013 output of san pedro is about fumaroles were also reported from ojos de san pedro area south of san pedro volcano and a report published in 1894 mentions a smell of sulfur at la poruna in addition seismic activity has been observed at volcano history of volcanic activity at san pedro indicates two principal hazards from future eruptions first is formation of long debris avalanches or pyroclastic flows that could reach which is just away from volcano second hazard is formed by a large explosive eruption resulting in ash fall and emplacement of ignimbrites whole region could be affected if eruption column is over high a few seismic stations monitor earthquake activity at san pedro chilean sernageomin publishes a volcano hazard level for volcano see also list of volcanoes in
