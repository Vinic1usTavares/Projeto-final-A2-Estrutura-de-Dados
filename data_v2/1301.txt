but is now spoken as an interdialect throughout most of czech republic moravian dialects spoken in eastern part of country are also classified as czech although some of their eastern variants are closer to slovak czech has a moderately sized phoneme inventory comprising ten monophthongs three diphthongs and 25 consonants divided into hard neutral and soft categories words may contain

widespread in early 15th century in context of bohemian reformation jan hus contributed significantly to standardization of czech orthography advocated for widespread literacy among czech commoners particularly in religion and made early efforts to model written czech after spoken language early modern czech there was no standardization distinguishing between czech and slovak prior to 15th century in 16th century division between czech and slovak becomes apparent marking confessional division between lutheran protestants in slovakia using czech orthography and catholics especially slovak jesuits beginning to use a separate slovak orthography based on language of trnava region publication of kralice bible between 1579 and 1593 first complete czech translation of bible from

bohemian revolt of predominantly protestant aristocracy which was defeated by habsburgs in 1620 protestant intellectuals had to leave country this emigration together with other consequences of thirty

changed little journals from that period have no substantial differences from modern standard czech and contemporary czechs can understand them with little difficulty sometime before 18th century czech language abandoned a distinction between phonemic l and y which survives in slovak with beginning of national revival of mid 18th century czech historians began to emphasize their people s accomplishments from 15th through 17th centuries rebelling against counter reformation habsburg re efforts which had denigrated czech and other non latin languages czech philologists studied sixteenth century texts advocating return of language to high culture this period is known as czech national revival or renaissance during national revival in 1809 linguist and historian josef dobrovsky released a german language grammar of old czech entitled der sprache comprehensive doctrine of bohemian language dobrovsky had intended his book to be descriptive and did not think czech had a realistic chance of returning as a major language however josef jungmann and other revivalists used dobrovsky s book to advocate for a czech linguistic revival changes during this time included spelling reform notably i in place of former j and j in place of g use of t rather than ti to end infinitive verbs and non capitalization of nouns which had been a late borrowing from german these changes differentiated czech from slovak modern scholars disagree about whether conservative revivalists were motivated by nationalism or considered contemporary spoken czech unsuitable for formal widespread use adherence to historical patterns was later relaxed and standard czech adopted a number of features from common czech a widespread informally used variety such as leaving some proper nouns this has resulted in a relatively high level of homogeneity among all varieties of language geographic distribution thumb upright alt map of vojvodina a province of serbia with czech in official

contains ten basic vowel phonemes and three diphthongs vowels are and their long counterparts diphthongs are last two are found only in loanwords such as car and euro in czech orthography vowels are spelled as follows short long diphthongs letter indicates that previous consonant is palatalised e g after a labial it represents e g but is pronounced mne cf each word usually has primary stress on its first syllable except for enclitics minor monosyllabic unstressed syllables in all words of more than two syllables every odd numbered syllable receives secondary stress stress is unrelated to vowel length both long and short vowels can be stressed or unstressed vowels are never reduced in tone e g to schwa sounds when unstressed when a noun is preceded by a monosyllabic preposition stress moves to preposition e g to prague voiced consonants with unvoiced counterparts are unvoiced at end of a word before a pause and in consonant clusters voicing assimilation occurs which matches voicing to following consonant unvoiced counterpart of h is x czech consonants are categorized as hard neutral or soft hard neutral soft in czech orthography consonants are spelled as follows hard neutral soft hard consonants may not be followed by i or i in writing or soft ones by y or y except in loanwords such as kilogram neutral consonants may take either character hard consonants are sometimes known as strong and soft ones as weak this distinction is also found declension patterns of nouns which vary according to whether final consonant of noun is hard or soft phoneme represented by letter

of other slavic languages is fusional its nouns verbs and adjectives are inflected by phonological processes to modify their meanings and grammatical functions and easily separable affixes characteristic of agglutinative languages are limited czech for case gender and number in nouns and tense aspect mood person and subject number and gender in verbs parts of speech include adjectives adverbs numbers interrogative words prepositions conjunctions and interjections adverbs are primarily formed from adjectives by taking final y or i of base form and replacing it with e e or o negative statements are formed by adding affix ne to main verb of a clause with one exception je he she or it is becomes sentence and clause structure thumb a czech language sign at entrance to a children s playground czech pronouns nominative ja formal vy 3 on masculine ona feminine ono neuter oni masculine feminine ona neuter because czech uses grammatical case to convey word function in a sentence instead of relying on word order as english does its word order is flexible as a pro drop language in czech an intransitive sentence can consist of only a verb information about its subject is encoded in verb enclitics primarily auxiliary verbs and pronouns appear in second syntactic slot of a sentence after first stressed unit first slot must contain a subject or object a main form of a verb an adverb or a conjunction except for light conjunctions a and i and even or ale but czech syntax has a subject verb object sentence structure in practice however word order is flexible and used for and focus although czech has a passive construction like english in colloquial style word order changes frequently replace passive voice for example to change peter killed paul to paul was killed by peter order of subject and object is inverted petr zabil pavla peter killed paul becomes paul peter killed pavla zabil petr pavla is in accusative case grammatical object of verb a word at end of a clause is typically emphasized unless an upward intonation indicates that sentence is a question pes ji bagetu dog eats baguette rather than eating something else bagetu ji pes dog eats baguette rather than someone else doing so pes bagetu ji dog eats baguette rather than doing something else to it ji pes bagetu does dog eat baguette emphasis ambiguous in parts of bohemia including prague questions such as ji pes bagetu without an interrogative word such as co what or who are intoned in a slow rise from low to high quickly dropping to low on last word or phrase in modern czech syntax adjectives precede nouns with few exceptions relative clauses are introduced by such as adjective analogous to english relative pronouns which that and who whom as with other adjectives it agrees with its associated noun in gender number and case relative clauses follow noun they modify following is a glossed example czech chc i it universit u na ou chod i jan gloss want 1 sg visit inf university sg acc on which sg f acc attend 3 sg john sg nom english i want to visit university that john attends declension in czech nouns and adjectives are declined into one of seven grammatical cases which indicate their function in a sentence two numbers singular and plural and three genders masculine feminine and neuter masculine gender is further divided into animate and inanimate classes case 200px thumb right a street named after nemcova with her name declined in genitive case a sign probably from time of protectorate a nominative accusative language czech marks subject nouns of transitive and intransitive verbs in nominative case which is form found in dictionaries and direct objects of transitive verbs are declined in accusative case vocative case is used to address people remaining cases genitive dative locative and instrumental indicate semantic relationships such as noun adjuncts genitive indirect objects dative or agents in passive constructions instrumental additionally prepositions and some verbs require their complements to be declined in a certain case locative case is only used after prepositions an adjective s case agrees with that of noun it modifies when czech

prepositions of motion time and pad dative indirect objects prepositions of pad accusative direct objects prepositions of motion and paty pad vocative addressing pad lokal locative prepositions of location time and pad instrumental instrumental passive agents instruments prepositions of location some czech grammatical texts order cases differently grouping nominative and accusative and dative and locative together because those declension patterns are often identical this order accommodates learners with experience in other inflected languages such as latin or russian this order is nominative accusative genitive dative locative instrumental and vocative some prepositions require nouns they modify to take a particular case cases assigned by each preposition are based on physical or metaphorical direction or location conveyed by it for example od from away from and z out of off assign genitive case other prepositions take one of several cases with their meaning dependent on case na means onto or for with accusative case but on with locative this is a glossed example of a sentence using several cases czech nes l js em i do dom u se sv ym em gloss carry sg m pst be 1 sg box sg acc into house sg gen with own sg ins friend sg ins english i carried box into house with my friend gender czech distinguishes three genders masculine feminine and neuter and masculine gender is subdivided into animate and inanimate with few exceptions feminine nouns in nominative case end in a e or a consonant neuter nouns in o e or i and masculine nouns in a consonant adjectives agree in gender and animacy with nouns they modify main effect of gender in czech morphology is difference in noun and adjective declension as well as in endings of verbal participles and past tense verbs which are also marked for gender e g delal he did or made she did or made and it did or made gender also plays a semantic role most nouns that describe people and animals including personal names have separate masculine and feminine forms which are normally formed by adding a suffix to stem for example cech czech man has feminine form ceska czech woman examples of declension patterns for noun

nouns and adjectives they modify to take any case but numbers over five require subject and direct object noun phrases to be declined in genitive plural instead of nominative or accusative and when used as subjects these phrases take singular verbs for example one czech crown was jedna koruna ceska two czech crowns were dve koruny ceske byly three czech crowns were tri koruny ceske byly four czech crowns were koruny ceske byly five czech crowns were pet bylo numbers decline for case and numbers one and two are also inflected for gender numbers one through five are shown below as examples number one has declension patterns identical to those of demonstrative pronoun ten masc jedna fem jedno neut dva masc dve fem neut masc jedne fem neut or or masc jedne fem neut masc an jeden masc in fem jedno neut dva masc dve fem neut masc jedne fem neut masc fem neut although czech s grammatical numbers are singular and plural several residuals of dual forms remain such as words dva two and oba both which decline same way some nouns for paired body parts use a historical dual form to express plural in some cases ruka hand nominative noha leg instrumental genitive locative oko eye and ear usi while two of these nouns are neuter in their singular forms all plural forms are considered feminine their gender is relevant to their associated adjectives and verbs these forms are plural semantically used for any non singular count as in mezi ocima face to face lit among four eyes plural number paradigms of these nouns are a mixture of historical dual and plural forms for example legs nominative accusative is a standard plural form of this type of noun verb conjugation czech verbs agree with their subjects in person first second or third number singular or plural and in constructions involving participles also in gender they are conjugated for tense past present or future and mood indicative imperative or conditional for example conjugated verb we speak is in present tense and first person plural it is distinguished from other conjugations of infinitive by its ending ime infinitive form of czech verbs ends in t archaically ti it is form found in dictionaries and form that follows auxiliary verbs for example muzu te i can hear you aspect typical of slavic languages czech marks its verbs for one of two grammatical aspects perfective and imperfective most verbs are part of inflected aspect pairs for example koupit perfective and kupovat imperfective although verbs meaning is similar in perfective verbs action is completed and in imperfective verbs it is ongoing or repeated this is distinct from past and present tense any verb of either aspect can be conjugated into either past or present tense but future tense is only used with imperfective verbs aspect describes state of action at time specified by tense verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways by prefix or by suffix in prefix pairs perfective verb has an added prefix for example imperfective to write to be writing compared with perfective to write down most common prefixes are na o po s u vy z and za in suffix pairs a different infinitive ending is added to perfective stem for example perfective verbs koupit to buy and to sell have imperfective forms kupovat and imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs iterative and frequentative forms denoting repeated or regular action verb jit to go has iterative form to go repeatedly and frequentative form to go occasionally many verbs have only one aspect and verbs describing continual states of being byt to be to want to be able to to lie down to be lying down have no perfective form conversely verbs describing immediate states of change for example to become pregnant and se to become enthusiastic have no imperfective aspect tense conjugation of byt in future budu bude present tense in czech is formed by adding an ending which agrees with person and number of subject at end of verb stem as czech is a null subject language subject pronoun can be omitted unless it is needed for clarity past tense is formed using a participle which ends in l and a further ending which agrees with gender and number of subject for first and second persons auxiliary verb byt conjugated in present tense is added in some contexts present tense of perfective verbs which differs from english present perfect implies future action in others it connotes habitual action perfective present is used to refer to completion of actions in future and is distinguished from imperfective future tense which refers to actions that will be ongoing in future future tense is regularly formed using future conjugation of byt as shown in table on left and infinitive of an imperfective verb for example budu i will eat or i will be eating where budu has a noun or adjective complement it means i will be for example budu stastny i will be happy some verbs of movement form their future tense by adding prefix po to present tense forms instead e g i go i will go mood conditional form of koupit to buy koupil a koupili y koupil a bys koupili y 3 koupil a o by koupili y a by czech verbs have three grammatical moods indicative imperative and conditional imperative mood is formed by adding specific endings for each of three person number categories o i ej for second person singular te ete for second person plural and me eme for first person plural imperatives are usually expressed using perfective verbs if positive and imperfective verbs if negative conditional mood is formed with a particle after participle ending in l which is used to form past tense this mood indicates hypothetical events and can also be used to express wishes verb classes most czech verbs fall into one of five classes which determine their conjugation patterns future tense of byt would be classified as a class i verb because of its endings examples of present tense of each class and some common irregular verbs follow in tables below class to do to p sg p sg p sg p pl p pl p pl irregular to beto p sg p sg p sg p pl p pl p pl orthography thumb right upright 1 35 handwritten czech

czech is not codified but some of its elements have become adopted in written standard since second half of 20th century common czech elements have also been spreading to regions previously unaffected as a consequence of media influence standard czech is still norm for politicians businesspeople and other czechs in formal situations but common czech is gaining ground in journalism and mass media

intelligible speakers of either language can communicate with greater ease than those of any other pair of west slavic languages since 1993 dissolution of czechoslovakia mutual intelligibility has

vowels and slovak by its less frequent use of long vowels than czech however slovak has long forms of consonants r and l when they function as vowels slovak phonotactics employs a rhythmic law which forbids two syllables with long vowels from following one another in a word unlike in czech grammatically although czech unlike slovak has a fully productive vocative case both languages share a
