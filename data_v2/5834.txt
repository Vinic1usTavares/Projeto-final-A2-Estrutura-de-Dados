sir joseph rotblat 4 november 1908 31 august 2005 was a polish physicist a self described pole with a british passport rotblat worked on tube alloys and manhattan project during world war ii but left los alamos laboratory after war with germany ended his work on nuclear fallout was a major contribution toward ratification of 1963 partial nuclear test ban treaty a signatory of 1955 russell einstein manifesto he was secretary general of pugwash conferences on science and world affairs from their founding until 1973 and shared with pugwash conferences 1995 nobel peace prize for efforts to diminish part played by nuclear arms in international affairs and in longer run to eliminate such arms early life and education jozef rotblat was born on 4 november 1908 to a polish jewish family in warsaw in what was then russian poland he was one of seven children two of whom died in infancy his father zygmunt rotblat built up and ran a nationwide horse drawn carriage business owned land and bred horses jozef s early years were spent in what was a prosperous household but circumstances changed at outbreak of world war i borders were closed and family s horses were requisitioned leading to failure of business and poverty for their family despite having a religious background by age of ten he doubted existence of god and later became an agnostic i have to admit however that there are really many things that i do not know i am not a particularly religious person and this is reason for my agnosticism to be an agnostic simply means that i do not know and will keep seeking answer for eternity this is my response to questions about religion rotblat s parents could not afford to send him to a gymnasium so rotblat received his secondary education in a heder taught by a local rabbi he then attended a technical school where he studied electrical engineering graduating with his diploma in 1923 after graduating rotblat worked as an electrician in warsaw but had an ambition to become a physicist he sat entrance examinations of free university of poland in january 1929 and passed physics one with ease but was less successful in writing a paper about commission of national education a subject about which he knew nothing he was then interviewed by dean of science faculty wertenstein had studied in paris under marie curie and at cavendish laboratory at university of cambridge under ernest rutherford wertenstein offered rotblat a place rotblat earned a master of arts at free university in 1932 after he entered university of warsaw and became a doctor of physics in 1938 he held position of research fellow in radiological laboratory of scientific society of warsaw of which wertenstein was director and became assistant director of atomic physics institute of free university of poland in 1938 during this period rotblat married a literature student tola gryn whom he had met at a student summer camp in 1930 before outbreak of world war ii he conducted experiments which showed that in fission process neutrons were emitted in early 1939 he envisaged that a large number of fissions could occur and if this happened within a sufficiently short time then considerable amounts of energy could be released he went on to calculate that this process could occur in less than a microsecond and as a consequence would result in an explosion in 1939 through wertenstein s connections rotblat was invited to study in paris and at university of liverpool under james chadwick winner of 1932 nobel prize for discovering neutron chadwick was building a particle accelerator called a cyclotron to study fundamental nuclear reactions and rotblat wanted to build a similar machine in warsaw so he decided to join chadwick in liverpool he travelled to england alone because he could not afford to support his wife there before long chadwick gave rotblat a fellowship oliver lodge fellowship doubling his income and in that summer of 1939 young pole returned home intending to bring tola back with him when time came to leave warsaw in late august however she was ill following an operation for appendicitis and remained behind expecting to follow within days however outbreak of war brought calamity tola was trapped and desperate efforts in ensuing months to bring her out through denmark with help of niels bohr belgium and finally italy came to nothing as each country in turn was closed off by war he never saw her again she died in holocaust at belzec concentration camp this affected him deeply for rest of his life and he never remarried manhattan project while still in poland rotblat had realised that nuclear fission might possibly be used to produce an atomic bomb he first thought that he should put whole thing out of my mind but he continued because he thought only way to prevent nazi germany from using a nuclear bomb was if britain had one to act as a deterrent he worked with chadwick on tube alloys british atomic bomb project in february 1944 rotblat joined los alamos laboratory as part of chadwick s british mission to manhattan project usual condition for people to work on manhattan project was that they had to become us citizens or british subjects rotblat declined and condition was waived at los alamos he was befriended by stan ulam a fellow polish jewish scientist with whom he was able to converse in polish rotblat worked in egon bretscher s group investigating whether high energy gamma rays produced by nuclear fission would interfere with nuclear chain reaction process and then with robert r wilson s cyclotron group rotblat continued to have strong reservations about use of science to develop such a devastating weapon in 1985 he related that at a private dinner at house at los alamos in march 1944 he was shocked to hear director of manhattan project major general leslie r groves jr say words to effect that real purpose in making bomb was to subdue soviets historians notably barton bernstein have cast doubt on this story by end of 1944 it was also apparent that germany had abandoned development of its own bomb and rotblat asked to leave project chadwick was then shown a security dossier in which rotblat was accused of being a soviet spy and that having learned to fly at los alamos he was suspected of wanting to join royal air force so that he could fly to poland and defect to soviet union in addition he was accused of visiting someone in santa fe and leaving them a blank cheque to finance formation of a communist cell rotblat was able to show that much of information within dossier had been fabricated in addition fbi records show that in 1950 rotblat s friend in santa fe was tracked down in california and she flatly denied story cheque had never been cashed and had been left to pay for items not available in uk during war in 1985 rotblat recounted how a box containing all my documents went missing on a train ride from washington d c to new york as he was leaving country but presence of large numbers of rotblat s personal papers from los alamos now archived at churchill archives centre is totally at odds with rotblat s account of events nuclear fallout rotblat returned to britain to become senior lecturer and acting director of research in nuclear physics at university of liverpool he naturalised as a british subject on 8 january 1946 most of his family had survived war with help of a polish man his brother in law mieczyslaw mietek pokorny had created false polish catholic identities for rotblat s sister ewa and niece halina ewa taking advantage of fact that she was an ash blonde who like rotblat spoke fluent polish as well as yiddish smuggled rest of family out of warsaw ghetto mietek rotblat s brother mordecai michael and michael s wife manya rotblat s mother and two russian soldiers lived in a concealed bunker underneath a house near otwock in which ewa and halina lived with a polish family displays of polish anti semitism that she witnessed during warsaw ghetto uprising embittered ewa towards poland and she petitioned rotblat to help family emigrate to england he therefore now accepted chadwick s offer of british citizenship so he could help them escape from poland they lived with him in london for some time before becoming established halina would go on to graduate from somerville college oxford and university college london and become an editor of dictionary of national biography rotblat felt betrayed by use of atomic weapons against japan and gave a series of public lectures in which he called for a three year moratorium on all atomic research rotblat was determined that his research should have only peaceful ends and so became interested in medical and biological uses of radiation in 1949 he became professor of physics at st bartholomew s hospital barts london a teaching hospital associated with university of london he remained there for rest of his career becoming a professor emeritus in 1976 he received his phd from liverpool in 1950 having written his thesis on determination of a number of neutrons emitted from a source he also worked on several official bodies connected with nuclear physics and arranged atom train a major travelling exhibition for schools on civil nuclear energy at st bartholomew s rotblat worked on effects of radiation on living organisms especially on ageing and fertility this led him to an interest in nuclear fallout especially strontium 90 and safe limits of ionising radiation in 1955 he demonstrated that contamination caused by fallout after castle bravo test at bikini atoll nuclear test by united states had been far greater than that stated officially until then official line had been that growth in strength of atomic bombs was not accompanied by an equivalent growth in radioactivity released japanese scientists who had collected data from a fishing vessel lucky dragon which had inadvertently been exposed to fallout disagreed with this rotblat was able to deduce that bomb had three stages and showed that fission phase at end of explosion increased amount of radioactivity by forty times his paper was taken up by media and contributed to public debate that resulted in ending of atmospheric tests by partial nuclear test ban treaty peace work rotblat believed that scientists should always be concerned with ethical consequences of their work he became one of most prominent critics of nuclear arms race was youngest signatory of russell einstein manifesto in 1955 and chaired press conference that launched it after positive coverage of manifesto cyrus eaton offered to fund influential pugwash conferences on science and world affairs an international organisation that brought together scholars and public figures to work toward reducing danger of armed conflict and to seek solutions to global security threats particularly those related to nuclear warfare with bertrand russell and others rotblat organised first of these in 1957 and continued to work within their framework until his death despite iron curtain and cold war he advocated establishing links between scientists from west and east for this reason pugwash conferences were viewed with suspicion initially british government thought them little more than communist front gatherings however he persuaded john cockcroft a member of united kingdom atomic energy authority to suggest who might be invited to 1958 conference he successfully resisted a subsequent attempt to take over conferences causing a foreign office official to write that difficulty is to get prof rotblat to pay any attention to what we think he is no doubt jealous of his independence and scientific integrity and that securing a new organizer for british delegation seems to be first need but i do not know if there is any hope of this by early 1960s ministry of defence thought that pugwash conferences were now a very respectable organization and foreign office stated that it had official blessing and that any breakthrough may well originate at such gatherings pugwash conferences are credited with laying ground work for partial test ban treaty of 1963 nonproliferation treaty of 1968 anti ballistic missile treaty of 1972 biological weapons convention of 1972 and chemical weapons convention of 1993 in parallel with pugwash conferences he joined with albert einstein robert oppenheimer bertrand russell and other concerned scientists to found world academy of art and science which was proposed by them in mid 1950s and formally constituted in 1960 later life rotblat retired from st bartholomew s in 1976 in 1975 and 1976 he was montague visiting professor of international relations at university of edinburgh he believed that scientists have an individual moral responsibility and just as hippocratic oath provides a code of conduct for physicians he thought that scientists should have their own code of moral conduct a hippocratic oath for scientists during his tenure as president of pugwash conferences rotblat nominated israeli nuclear technician mordechai vanunu for nobel peace prize every year from 1988 to 2004 vanunu had disclosed extent of israel s nuclear weapons programme and consequently spent 18 years in prison including more than 11 years in solitary confinement rotblat campaigned ceaselessly against nuclear weapons in an interview shortly before 2004 us presidential election he expressed his belief that russell einstein manifesto still had great relevance today after 50 years particularly in connection with election of a president in united states and above all with respect to potential pre emptive use of nuclear weapons central to his view of world were words of russell einstein manifesto with which he concluded his acceptance lecture for nobel prize in 1995 above all remember your humanity he also served as editor in chief of journal physics in medicine and biology from 1960 to 1972 he was president of several institutions and professional associations and also a co founder and member of governing board of stockholm international peace research institute as well as a member of advisory committee on medical research of world health organization rotblat was a programme advisor to bafta award winning nuclear docudrama threads produced in 1984 joseph rotblat on imdb com rotblat suffered a stroke in 2004 and his health declined he died of septicaemia at royal free hospital in camden london on 31 august 2005 awards and honours rotblat was appointed a commander of order of british empire in 1965 new year honours he won albert einstein peace prize in 1992 and was elected a fellow of royal society frs in 1995 he was appointed a knight commander of order of st michael and st george in 1998 birthday honours for services to international understanding his certificate of election to royal society read rotblat shared with pugwash conferences 1995 nobel peace prize for efforts toward nuclear disarmament his citation read for efforts to diminish part played by nuclear arms in international affairs and in longer run to eliminate such arms towards end of his life he was also elected honorary member of international
