loggerhead sea turtle caretta caretta also commonly called loggerhead is a species of oceanic turtle distributed throughout world it is a marine reptile belonging to family cheloniidae average loggerhead measures around in carapace length when fully grown adult loggerhead sea turtle weighs approximately with largest specimens weighing in at more than skin ranges from yellow to brown in color and shell is typically reddish brown no external differences in sex are seen until turtle becomes an adult most obvious difference being adult males have thicker tails and shorter plastrons lower shells than females loggerhead sea turtle is found in atlantic pacific and indian oceans as well as mediterranean sea it spends most of its life in saltwater and estuarine habitats with females briefly coming ashore to lay eggs loggerhead sea turtle has a low reproductive rate females lay an average of four egg clutches and then become quiescent producing no eggs for two to three years loggerhead reaches sexual maturity within 17 33 years and has a lifespan of 47 67 years loggerhead sea turtle is omnivorous feeding mainly on bottom dwelling invertebrates its large and powerful jaws serve as an effective tool for dismantling its prey young loggerheads are exploited by numerous predators eggs are especially vulnerable to terrestrial organisms once turtles reach adulthood their formidable size limits predation to large marine animals such as sharks loggerhead sea turtle is considered a vulnerable species by international union for conservation of nature in total 9 distinct population segments are under protection of endangered species act of 1973 with 4 population segments classified as threatened and 5 classified as endangered commercial trade of loggerheads or derived products is prohibited by cites appendix i untended fishing gear is responsible for many loggerhead deaths greatest threat is loss of nesting habitat due to coastal development predation of nests and human disturbances such as coastal lighting and housing developments that cause during emergence of hatchlings turtles may also suffocate if they are trapped in fishing trawls turtle excluder devices have been implemented in efforts to reduce mortality by providing an escape route for turtles loss of suitable nesting beaches and introduction of exotic predators have also taken a toll on loggerhead populations efforts to restore their numbers will require international cooperation since turtles roam vast areas of ocean and critical nesting beaches are scattered across several countries

features paired gular humeral pectoral abdominal femoral and anal scutes shell serves as external armor although loggerhead sea turtles cannot retract their heads or flippers into their shells sexual dimorphism of loggerhead sea turtle is only apparent in adults adult males have longer tails and claws than females males plastrons are shorter than females presumably to accommodate males larger tails carapaces of males are wider and less domed than females and males typically have wider heads than females sex of juveniles and subadults cannot be determined through external anatomy but can be observed through dissection an operation performed on abdomen histological examination cell anatomy and assays immune study dealing with lachrymal glands located behind each eye allow loggerhead to maintain osmotic balance by eliminating excess salt obtained from ingesting ocean water on land excretion of excess salt gives false impression that turtle is crying distribution thumb left 300px alt

over broadest geographical range of any sea turtle it inhabits atlantic indian and pacific oceans and mediterranean sea in atlantic ocean greatest concentration of loggerheads is along southeastern coast of north america and in gulf of mexico very few loggerheads are found along european and african coastlines florida is most popular nesting site with more than 67 000 nests built per year nesting extends as far north as virginia as far south as brazil and as far east as cape verde islands cape verde islands are only significant nesting site on eastern side of atlantic loggerheads found in atlantic ocean feed from canada to brazil in indian ocean loggerheads feed along coastlines of africa arabian peninsula and in arabian sea along african coastline loggerheads nest from mozambique s archipelago to south africa s st lucia estuary largest indian ocean nesting site is oman on arabian peninsula which hosts around 15 000 nests giving it second largest nesting population of loggerheads in world western australia is another notable nesting area with 1 000 2 000 nests per year pacific loggerheads live in temperate to tropical regions they forage in east china sea southwestern pacific and along baja california peninsula eastern australia and japan are major nesting areas with great barrier reef deemed an important nesting area c michael hogan 2011 coral sea encyclopedia of earth eds p saundry c j cleveland national council for science and environment washington dc pacific loggerheads occasionally nest in vanuatu and tokelau yakushima island is most important site with three nesting grounds visited by 40 of all nearby loggerheads after nesting females often find homes in east china sea while kuroshio current extension s bifurcation region provides important juvenile foraging areas eastern pacific populations are concentrated off coast of baja california where upwelling provides rich feeding grounds for juvenile turtles and subadults nesting sites along eastern pacific basin are rare mtdna sequence polymorphism analysis and tracking studies suggest 95 of population along coast of americas hatch on japanese islands in western pacific turtles are transported by prevailing currents across full length of northern pacific one of longest migration routes of any marine animal return journey to natal beaches in japan has been long suspected although trip would cross unproductive clear water with few feeding opportunities evidence of a return journey came from an adult female loggerhead named adelita which in 1996 equipped with a satellite tracking device made 14 500 km 9 000 mi trip from mexico across pacific adelita was first animal of any kind ever tracked across an ocean basin mediterranean sea is a nursery for juveniles as well as a common place for adults in spring and summer months almost 45 of mediterranean juvenile population has migrated from atlantic loggerheads feed in alboran sea and adriatic sea greece is most popular nesting site along mediterranean with more than 3 000 nests per year zakynthos hosts largest mediterranean nesting with second one being in kyparissia bay because of this greek authorities do not allow planes to take off or land at night in zakynthos due to nesting turtles in addition to greek coast coastlines of cyprus and turkey are also common nesting sites one record of this turtle was made in ireland

lives in open ocean and in shallow coastal waters they rarely come ashore besides females brief visits to construct nests and deposit eggs hatchling loggerhead turtles live in floating mats of sargassum algae adults and juveniles live along continental shelf as well as in shallow coastal estuaries in northwestern atlantic ocean age plays a factor in habitat preference juveniles are more frequently found in shallow estuarine habitats with limited ocean access compared to non nesting adults loggerheads occupy waters with surface temperatures ranging from during non nesting season temperatures from are most suitable for nesting females juvenile loggerheads share sargassum habitat with a variety of other organisms mats of sargassum contain as many as 100 different species of animals on which juveniles feed prey found in sargassum mats may include barnacles crab larvae fish eggs and colonies some prey such as ants flies aphids leafhoppers and beetles are carried by wind to mats marine mammals and commercial fishes including tuna and mahi mahi also inhabit sargassum mats ecology and behavior thumb left alt a loggerhead sea turtle resting under a rock with its eyes open a resting loggerhead sea turtle loggerhead sea turtles observed in captivity and in wild are most active during day in captivity loggerheads daily activities are divided between swimming and resting on bottom while resting they spread their forelimbs to about swimming position they remain motionless with eyes open or half shut and are easily alerted during this state at night captives sleep in same position with their eyes tightly shut and are slow to react loggerheads spend up to 85 of their day submerged with males being more active divers than females average duration of dives is 15 30 min but they can stay submerged for up to four hours juvenile loggerheads and adults differ in their swimming methods a juvenile keeps its forelimbs pressed to side of its carapace and propels itself by kicking with its hind limbs as juvenile matures its swimming method is progressively replaced with adult s alternating limb method they depend entirely on this method of swimming by one year old water temperature affects sea turtle s metabolic rate lethargy is induced at temperatures between 13 and 15 degc 55 and 59 degf loggerhead takes on a floating cold stunned posture when temperatures drop to around 10 degc however younger loggerheads are more resistant to cold and do not become stunned until temperatures drop below 9 degc loggerheads migration helps to prevent instances of cold stunning higher water temperatures cause an increase in metabolism and heart rate a loggerhead s body temperature increases in warmer waters more quickly than it decreases in colder water their critical thermal maximum is currently unknown in february 2015 a live loggerhead turtle was found floating in british columbian waters of 10 5 degc with extensive algal growth on its carapace female female aggression which is fairly rare in other marine vertebrates is common among loggerheads ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat this conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds escalation typically follows four steps first initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues second confrontation occurs beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head tail circling they begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces other third sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each other s jaws final stage separation is either mutual with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions or involves chasing one out of immediate vicinity escalation is determined by several factors including hormone levels energy expenditure expected outcome and importance of location at all stages an upright tail shows willingness to escalate while a curled tail shows willingness to submit because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating contact is much more likely to escalate when conflict is over access to good foraging grounds further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads turtles are seemingly territorial and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species feeding thumb left alt translucent moon jelly on black blackground

turtles including members of its own species algae and vascular plants during migration through open sea loggerheads eat jellyfish floating molluscs floating egg clusters squid and flying fish loggerheads crush prey with their large and powerful jaws projecting scale points on anterior margin of forelimbs allow manipulation of food these points can be used as pseudo claws to tear large pieces of food in loggerhead s mouth loggerhead will turn its neck sideways to consume torn food on scale points inward pointing mucus covered papillae found in fore region of loggerhead s esophagus filter out foreign bodies such as fish hooks next region of esophagus is not with numerous mucosal folds digestion rate in loggerheads is temperature dependent it increases as temperature increases predators thumb a horned ghost crab preying on a loggerhead hatchling in western australia ghost crabs are one of chief causes of egg and hatchling mortality in sea turtles thumb right alt a red fox walking along a fallen tree red fox is a predator of loggerhead nests in australia loggerheads have numerous predators especially early in their lives egg and nestling predators include ghost crabs oligochaete worms beetles fly larvae ants flesh flies snakes gulls corvids opossums bears rats armadillos mustelids skunks canids procyonids cats pigs and humans during their migration from their nests to sea hatchlings are preyed on by dipteran larvae crabs toads lizards snakes seabirds such as frigatebirds and other assorted birds and mammals in ocean predators of loggerhead juveniles include crabs and various fishes such as parrotfishes and moray eels adults are more rarely attacked due to their large size but may be preyed on by large sharks seals and killer whales nesting females are attacked by flesh flies feral dogs and humans salt marsh mosquitos can also pester nesting females in australia introduction of red fox vulpes vulpes by british settlers in 19th century led to significant reductions in loggerhead sea turtle populations in one coastal section in eastern australia during 1970s predation of turtle eggs destroyed up to 95 of all clutches laid aggressive efforts to destroy foxes in 1980s and 1990s has reduced this impact however it is estimated that it will be year 2020 before populations will experience complete recovery from such dramatic losses along southeastern coast of united states raccoon procyon lotor is most destructive predator of nesting sites mortality rates of nearly 100 of all clutches laid in a season have been recorded on some florida beaches this is attributed to an increase in raccoon populations which have flourished in urban environments aggressive efforts to protect nesting sites by covering them with wire mesh has significantly reduced impact of raccoon predation on loggerhead sea turtle eggs on bald head island in north carolina wire mesh screens are used on every confirmed nest to prevent excavation by resident red foxes a new concern with steel cage technique is interference with normal development of nestlings magnetic sense due to use of ferrous wire which may disrupt turtles ability to navigate properly efforts are underway to find a nonmagnetic material that will prevent predators gnawing through barrier up to 40 of nesting females around world have wounds believed to come from shark attacks disease and parasites infectious bacteria such as pseudomonas and salmonella attack loggerhead hatchlings and eggs fungi such as penicillium infect loggerhead sea turtle nests and cloacae disease caused by a form of herpes type virus threatens loggerheads with internal and external tumors these tumors disrupt essential behaviors and if on eyes cause permanent blindness trematodes of family inhabit tissues throughout body of loggerhead including vital organs such as heart and brain trematode infection can be highly debilitating for example inflammatory trematode lesions can cause endocarditis and neurological disease a nematode also infects loggerheads causing histologic lesions in respiratory tract more than 100 species of animals from 13 phyla as well as 37 kinds of algae live on loggerheads backs these parasitic organisms which increase drag offer no known benefit to turtle although effect of organisms on shell color may improve camouflage life history early life thumb hatchling running to sea hatchlings range in color from light brown to almost black lacking adult s distinct yellows and reds upon hatching they measure about and weigh about eggs are typically laid on beach in an area above high tide line eggs are laid near water so hatchlings can return to sea loggerhead s sex is dictated by temperature of underground nest incubation temperatures generally range from 26 32 degc 79 90 degf sea turtle eggs kept at a constant incubating temperature of 32 degc become females eggs incubating at 28 degc become males an incubation temperature of 30 degc results in an equal ratio of male to female hatchlings hatchlings from eggs in middle of clutch tend to be largest grow fastest and be most active during first few days of sea life after incubating for around 80 days hatchlings dig through sand to surface usually at night when darkness increases chance of escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced hatchlings enter ocean by navigating toward brighter horizon created by reflection of moon and starlight off water s surface hatchlings can lose up to 20 of their body mass due to evaporation of water as they journey from nest to ocean they initially use undertow to push them five to 10 m away from shore once in ocean they swim for about 20 hours taking them far offshore an iron compound magnetite in their brains allows turtles to perceive earth s magnetic field for navigation many hatchlings use sargassum in open ocean as protection until they reach hatchling loggerheads live in this pelagic environment until they reach juvenile age and then they migrate to nearshore waters maturation thumb left alt photo of a loggerhead swimming above a reef a mature loggerhead sea turtle when ocean waters cool loggerheads must migrate to warmer areas or hibernate to some degree in coldest months they submerge for up to seven hours at a time emerging for only seven minutes to breathe although outdone by freshwater turtles these are among longest recorded dives for any air breathing marine vertebrate during their seasonal migration juvenile loggerheads have ability to use both magnetic and visual cues when both aids are available they are used in conjunction if one aid is not available other suffices turtles swim at about during migration relationship between loggerhead turtle caretta

prepares for reproduction in its foraging area this takes place several years before loggerhead migrates to a mating area female loggerheads first reproduce at ages 28 33 in southeastern united states and australia and at ages 17 30 in south africa age at first reproduction in mediterranean oman japan and brazil are unknown nesting loggerheads have a straight carapace length of because of large

a female loggerhead sea turtle from back laying eggs into hole it has dug a loggerhead sea turtle laying eggs female loggerheads first reproduce between ages of 17 and 33 and their mating period may last more than six weeks they court their mates but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling biting and head and flipper movements studies suggest females produce cloacal pheromones to indicate reproductive ability before mating male approaches a female and attempts to mount her while she resists next male and female begin to circle each other if male has competitors female may let males struggle with each other winner then mounts female male s curved claws usually damage shoulders of female s shell during this process other courting males bite male while he is attempting to copulate damaging his flippers and tail possibly exposing bones such damage can cause male to dismount and may require weeks to heal while nesting females produce an average of 3 9 egg clutches and then become quiescent producing no eggs for two to three years unlike other sea turtles courtship and mating usually do not take place near nesting beach but rather along migration routes between feeding and breeding grounds recent evidence indicates ovulation in loggerheads is mating induced through act of mating female ovulates eggs which are fertilized by male this is unique as mating induced ovulation is rare outside of mammals in northern hemisphere loggerheads mate from late march to early june nesting season is short between may and august in northern hemisphere and between october and march in southern hemisphere loggerheads may display multiple paternity multiple paternity is possible due to sperm storage female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation a single clutch may have as many as seven fathers each contributing sperm to a portion of clutch multiple paternity and female size are positively correlated two hypotheses explain this correlation one posits that males favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity ability to reproduce other states because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds they have longer mating periods all sea turtles have similar basic nesting behaviors females return to lay eggs at intervals of 12 17 days during nesting season on or near beach where they hatched they exit water climb beach and scrape away surface sand to form a body pit with their hind limbs they excavate an egg chamber in which eggs are deposited females then cover egg chamber and body pit with sand and finally return to sea this process takes one to two hours and occurs in open sand areas or on top of sand dunes preferably near dune grasses that females can use to camouflage nest nesting area must be selected carefully because it affects characteristics such as fitness emergence ratio and vulnerability to nest predators loggerheads have an average clutch size of 112 4 eggs taxonomy carl linnaeus gave loggerhead its first binomial name testudo caretta in 1758 thirty five other names emerged over following two centuries with combination caretta caretta first introduced in 1873 by leonhard stejneger english common name loggerhead refers to animal s large head loggerhead sea turtle belongs to family cheloniidae which includes all extant sea turtles except leatherback sea turtle subspecific classification of loggerhead sea turtle is debated but most authors consider it a single polymorphic species molecular genetics has confirmed hybridization of loggerhead sea turtle with kemp s ridley sea turtle hawksbill sea turtle and green sea turtles extent of natural hybridization is not yet determined however second generation hybrids have been reported suggesting some hybrids are fertile evolutionary history although evidence is lacking modern sea turtles probably descended from a single common ancestor during cretaceous period like all other sea turtles except leatherback loggerheads are members of ancient family cheloniidae and appeared about 40 million years ago of six species of living cheloniidae loggerheads are more closely related to kemp s ridley sea turtle olive ridley sea turtle and hawksbill turtle than they are to turtle and green turtle around three million years ago during pliocene epoch central america emerged from sea effectively cutting off currents between atlantic and indo pacific oceans rerouting of ocean currents led to climatic changes as earth entered a glacial cycle cold water upwelling around cape of good hope and reduction in water temperature at cape horn formed coldwater barriers to migrating turtles result was a complete isolation of atlantic and pacific populations of loggerheads during most recent ice age beaches of southeastern north america were too cold for sea turtle eggs as earth began to warm loggerheads moved farther north colonizing northern beaches because of this turtles nesting between north carolina and northern florida represent a different genetic population from those in southern florida distinct populations of loggerheads have unique characteristics and genetic differences for example mediterranean loggerheads are smaller on average than atlantic ocean loggerheads north atlantic and mediterranean loggerhead sea turtles are descendants of colonizing loggerheads from south africa south african loggerhead genes are still present in these populations today conservation many human activities have negative effects on loggerhead sea turtle populations prolonged time required for loggerheads to reach sexual maturity and high mortality rates of eggs and young turtles from natural phenomena compound problems of population reduction as a consequence of human activities threats thumb left alt an orange diamond sign with words loggerhead turtle nesting area is blocking off a roped off area on beach where a

consumption has decreased however due to worldwide legislation despite this turtle meat and eggs are still consumed in countries where regulations are not strictly enforced in mexico turtle eggs are a common meal locals claim egg is an aphrodisiac eating turtle eggs or meat can cause serious illness due to harmful bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and marcescens and high levels of toxic metals that build up through bioaccumulation us west coast is a critical migratory corridor for pacific loggerheads in which these turtles swim across pacific to california s coast from breeding grounds in japan important foraging habitats for juveniles in central north pacific have been revealed through telemetry studies along with these foraging habitats high levels of bycatch from industrial scale fisheries have been found to overlap with drift gillnets in past and longline fisheries presently many juvenile loggerheads aggregate off coast of baja california sur mexico where small coastal fisheries increase these turtles mortality risk fishers have reported catching dozens of loggerheads with bottom set gear per day per boat most common commercial fishery that accidentally takes loggerheads are bottom trawls used for shrimp vessels in gulf of california in 2000 between 2 600 and 6 000 loggerheads were estimated to have been killed by pelagic in pacific fishing gear is biggest threat to loggerheads in open ocean they often become entangled in longlines or gillnets according to 2009 status review of loggerheads by fisheries service drowning from entanglement in longline and gillnet fishing gear is turtles primary threat in north pacific they also become stuck in traps pots trawls and dredges caught in this unattended equipment loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning turtle excluder devices for nets and other traps reduce number being accidentally caught nearly 24 000 metric tons of plastic are dumped into ocean each year turtles ingest a wide array of this floating debris including bags sheets pellets balloons and abandoned fishing line loggerheads may mistake floating plastic for jellyfish a common food item ingested plastic causes numerous health concerns including intestinal blockage reduced nutrient absorption and malnutrition suffocation ulcerations or starvation ingested plastics release toxic compounds including polychlorinated biphenyls which may accumulate in internal tissues such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells tissue damage or deviation from natural behaviors artificial lighting discourages nesting and interferes with hatchlings ability to navigate to water s edge females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting on developed beaches nests are often clustered around tall buildings perhaps because they block out man made light sources loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward brighter area over water which is consequence of reflection of moon and star light confused by brighter artificial light they navigate inland away from protective waters which exposes them to dehydration and predation as sun rises artificial lighting causes tens of thousands of hatchling deaths per year destruction and encroachment of habitat by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles optimum nesting beaches are open sand beaches above high tide line however beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas forcing them to nest closer to surf urbanization often leads to siltation of sandy beaches decreasing their viability construction of docks and marinas can destroy near shore habitats boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles at or near surface annual variations in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios since loggerheads have temperature dependent sex determination high sand temperatures may skew gender ratios in favor of females nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures over a three year period produced 87 99 females this raises concern over connection between rapid global temperature changes and possibility of population extinction a more localized effect on gender skewing comes from construction of tall buildings which reduce sun exposure lowering average sand temperature which results in a shift in gender ratios to favor emergence of male

organizations worldwide have worked with shrimp trawling industry to develop turtle exclusion devices teds to exclude even largest turtles teds are mandatory for all shrimp trawlers in many places during nesting season workers and volunteers search coastline for nests and researchers may also go out during evening to look for nesting females for tagging studies and gather barnacles and tissues samples volunteers may if necessary relocate nests for protection from threats such as high spring tides and predators and monitor nests daily for disturbances after eggs hatch volunteers uncover and tally hatched eggs undeveloped eggs and dead hatchlings any remaining live hatchlings are released or taken to research facilities typically those that lack vitality to hatch and climb to surface die
