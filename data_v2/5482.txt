noye s fludde is a one act opera by british composer benjamin britten intended primarily for amateur performers particularly children first performed on 18 june 1958 at that year s aldeburgh festival it is based on 15th century chester mystery or miracle play which recounts old testament story of noah s ark britten specified that opera should be staged in churches or large halls not in a theatre by mid 1950s britten had established himself as a major composer both of operas and of works for mixed professional and amateur forces his mini opera little sweep 1949 was written for young audiences and used child performers he had previously adapted text from chester play cycle in his 1952 canticle ii which retells story of abraham and isaac noye s fludde was composed as a project for television to chester text britten added three congregational hymns greek prayer kyrie eleison as a children s chant and an alleluia chorus a large children s chorus represents pairs of animals who march into and out of ark and proceedings are directed by spoken voice of god of solo sung roles only parts of noye noah and his wife were written to be sung by professionals remaining roles are for child and adolescent performers a small professional ensemble underpins mainly amateur orchestra which contains numerous unconventional instruments to provide particular musical effects bugle fanfares for animals handbell chimes for rainbow and various improvisations to replicate musically sounds of a storm at its premiere noye s fludde was acclaimed by critics and public alike both for inspiration of music and brilliance of design and production opera received its american premiere in new york in march 1959 and its first german performance at ettal in may of that year since then it has been staged worldwide performance in beijing in october 2012 was first in china of any britten opera occasion of britten s centenary in 2013 led to numerous productions at music festivals both in uk and abroad background chester mystery plays thumb upright a 14th 15th century performance of chester mystery plays on a pageant cart english mystery or miracle plays were dramatised bible stories by ancient tradition performed on church feast days in town squares and market places by members of town s craft guilds woolf p 22 they covered full range of narrative and metaphor in christian bible from fall of lucifer to last judgement woolf p 54 from many play cycles that originated in late middle ages chester cycle is one of four that has survived into 21st century texts by an unidentified writer were revised during late 15th century into a format similar to that of contemporary french passion plays and were published in 1890 in alfred w pollard s english miracle plays moralities and interludes story of noah and flood third play in chester cycle was originally performed by city s guild of drawers of dee otherwise known as water carriers ch 5 a feature of this play observed by historian rosemary woolf is depiction of noah s wife and by implication women generally as disobedient obdurate and finally abusive in contrast to grave and obedient noah and his patient sons woolf pp 140 41 by latter part of 16th century reformation church had grown less tolerant of mystery plays a performance in chester in 1575 is last recorded from city until 20th century when chester cycle was revived under supervision of christopher ede as part of city s festival of britain celebrations in june 1951 p 65 this production was received enthusiastically and was repeated following year thereafter it became a regular feature and tourist attraction thacker and lewis pp 275 76 inception by late 1940s benjamin britten had established himself as a leading composer of english opera with several major works to his credit in 1947 he suggested to his librettist eric crozier that they should create a children s opera based on a bible story britten 2004 p 287 crozier gave britten a copy of pollard s book as a possible source of material carpenter p 381 nothing came of this project immediately instead britten and crozier wrote cantata saint nicolas 1948 first of several works in which britten combined skilled performers with amateurs cantata involves at least two children s choirs and incorporates two congregational hymns sung by audience elliott 2006 pp 66 67 britten also used this fusion of professional with amateur forces in little sweep 1949 which forms second part of his entertainment for children let s make an opera that he devised with crozier white pp 168 73 again child singers also doubling as actors were used and audience sings choruses at appropriate points oliver p 136 and evans p 265 in 1952 although britten s collaboration with crozier had ended he used chester plays book as source text for his canticle ii based on story of abraham and isaac britten 2008 p 580 in april 1957 boris ford head of schools broadcasting at associated rediffusion a r wrote to britten proposing a series of half hour programmes these would show britten composing and rehearsing a work through to its performance and would provide children with an intimate piece of musical education by watching a piece of music take shape and in some degree growing with it britten 2008 pp 562 564 britten was initially cautious he found idea interesting but he warned ford he was at that time busy travelling and had little time for writing he was also anxious not to cover same ground as he had with let s make an opera letter dated 15 april 1957 quoted in britten 2008 p 564 however he agreed to meet ford to discuss project further on 11 july they met in london together with britten s musical assistant imogen holst britten told ford that he had for some months or a year vaguely been thinking of doing something with chester miracle plays and agreed to write an opera for a r s 1958 summer term of school programmes subject would be noah and flood based on chester text britten 2008 pp 564 65 later ford and his script editor martin worth travelled to aldeburgh and with britten looked at possible churches for performance church of st bartholomew orford was chosen as unlike most other churches in east suffolk its pews were not fixed thus offering a more flexible performing space britten 2008 p 565 roles rolevoice typepremiere cast 18 june 1958 conductor charles mackerras voice of

noye agrees and calls on people and his family to help his sons and their wives enter with tools and materials and begin work while mrs noye and her gossips close friends mock project when ark is

finally drag mrs noye on board while gossips are swept away by encroaching flood she rewards her husband with a slap rain begins to fall building to a great storm at height of which first verse of naval hymn eternal father strong to save is heard from ark congregation joins in second and third verses of hymn during which storm gradually subsides when it is calm noye sends out a raven saying if this foule come not againe it is a signe to that dry it is on hill or when raven fails to return noye knows that bird has discovered dry land he sends out a dove who eventually brings back an olive branch noah accepts this as a sign of deliverance and thanks god voice of god instructs everyone to leave ark as they do animals sing alleluias and people sing a chorus of praise lord we thee through

detailed planning for opera in august 1957 while sailing to canada for a tour with english opera group britten 2008 p 494 he told colin graham at that time s stage manager that he wanted him to direct new work graham p 44 after a further meeting at associated rediffusion s london headquarters on 18 october britten began a composition draft in aldeburgh on 27 october to pollard s edition of noah play s text he added three congregational anglican hymns lord jesus think on me eternal father strong to save and spacious firmament on high britten introduced repetitive greek chant kyrie eleison lord have mercy at entry of animals and alleluias at their triumphant exit white pp 217 19 he had completed about two thirds of opera when ford was dismissed from a r allegedly for administrative shortcomings and inexperience a r decided to withdraw from project which was then taken up by associated television atv whose chairman lew grade personally took responsibility for signing contract and urged that britten should complete opera britten 2008 pp 565 67 in november 1957 britten moved to red house aldeburgh but continued to work on opera throughout upheaval according to a letter he wrote to edith sitwell on 14 december final bars of opera were punctuated by hammer blows from workmen busy at red house britten 2008 p 582 before he finished composition draft britten wrote to baritone owen brannigan who had sung in several previous britten operas asking if he would take title role britten 2008 pp 579 80 britten completed full score of opera in march 1958 britten 2008 p 566 which he dedicated to my nephew and nieces sebastian sally and welford and my young friend ronald duncan one of britten s godsons britten 2008 p 10 performance requirements with wide variety of child performers required in opera and in light of how it was cast and performed at its premiere britten detailed some of its specific requirements for performance in vocal and study scores published by boosey hawkes opera is intended for a large hall or church not a theatre action should take place on raised rostra though not on a formal stage set apart from audience and orchestra should be placed in full sight with conductor in a position to conduct both orchestra and when performing hymns congregation noye and mrs noye are sung by accomplished singer actors and voice of god although not necessarily a professional actor should have a rich speaking voice with a simple and sincere delivery without being at all stagey young amateurs playing parts of noye s children should be between 11 and 15 years old with well trained voices and lively personalities jaffet eldest could have a broken voice mrs noye s gossips should be older girls with strong voices and considerable acting ability children playing animals should vary in size and range in age from seven to eighteen older age groups with perhaps some broken voices should represent larger animals lions leopards horses camels etc while younger play rats mice and birds britten noye s fludde pocket score boosey hawkes 1958 there is a dance or ballet involving two child performers playing roles of raven and dove for first time in any of his works involving amateurs britten envisaged a large complement of child performers among his orchestral forces roseberry p 2 led by what graham described as professional stiffening of a piano duet string quintet two violins viola cello and bass recorder and a timpanist young musicians play a variety of instruments including a full string ensemble with each section led by a member of professional string quintet violins are further divided into parts of different levels of difficulty from simplest mostly playing open strings to those able to play in third position recorders should be led by an accomplished soloist able to flutter tongue bugles played in original production by boys from a local school band are played as children representing animals march into ark and at climax of opera child percussionists led by a professional timpanist play various exotic and invented percussion instruments score itself specifies sandpaper two pieces of sandpaper attached to blocks of wood and rubbed together and slung mugs latter used to represent first drops of rain britten originally had idea of striking teacups with a spoon but having failed to make this work he sought imogen holst s advice she recalled that by great good fortune i had once had to teach women s institute percussion groups during a wartime social half hour so i was able to take him into my kitchen and show him how a row of china mugs hanging on a length of string could be hit with a large wooden spoon carpenter p 382 britten also added relatively late in process of scoring work an ensemble of handbell ringers according to imogen holst a member of aldeburgh youth club brought britten s attention to a local group of bellringers hearing them play britten was so enchanted by sound that he gave ensemble a major part to play as rainbow unfolds towards end of opera carpenter p 383 several commentators including michael kennedy christopher palmer and humphrey carpenter have noted affinity between sound of britten s use of handbells and gamelan ensembles he had heard first hand in bali in 1956 kennedy 1981 p 216 palmer p 76 and carpenter pp 383 84 scarcity of handbells tuned at several of pitches required by britten in opera was to become an issue when score was being prepared for publication britten 2010 pp 55 58 performance history and reception premiere first performance of noye s fludde was staged during 1958 aldeburgh festival at st bartholomew s church orford on 18 june conductor was charles mackerras britten 2008 p 562 who had participated in several productions at past aldeburgh festivals britten 2008 p 555 production was directed by colin graham who also designed its set with costume designs by ceri richards graham pp 44 46 thumb left detail from a statue of noah and dove in orford church where noye s fludde was first performed apart from brannigan as noye two other professional singers were engaged gladys parr in her last role before retirement sang part of mrs noye and spoken voice of god was provided by welsh bass trevor anthony other major roles were taken by child soloists who were selected from extensive auditions among these was future actor singer michael crawford then 16 years old and described by graham as a very recently broken voiced young tenor who played role of jaffet mrs noye s gossips were originally to be performed by girls from a suffolk school but when headmistress heard rumours about dissolute parts they were to play she withdrew her pupils professional element in orchestra was provided by english opera group players led by emanuel hurwitz with ralph downes at organ children players billed as an east suffolk children s orchestra included handbell ringers from county modern school a percussion group whose instruments included slung mugs from hall school recorder players from framlingham college and bugle players from royal hospital school holbrook graham p 44 graham recalling premiere some years later wrote large orchestra originally 150 players were massed around font of orford church while opera was played out on a stage erected at end of nave philip hope wallace writing for manchester guardian observed that charles mackerras conducted widespread forces actually moving round a pillar to be able to control all sections in turn philip hope wallace britten s noye s fludde in manchester guardian 19 june 1958 quoted in britten 2010 p 49 martin cooper of daily telegraph noted white walls of orford church furnished an ideal background to gay colours of ceri richards s costumes and fantastic head dresses of animals in fact future of work will lie in village churches such as this and with amateur musicians for whom britten has written something both wholly new and outstandingly original martin cooper flood story to music by britten in daily telegraph 19 june 1958 quoted in britten 2010 p 49 general critical reception was warmly enthusiastic felix aprahamian in sunday times called performance a curiously moving spiritual and musical experience carpenter p 386 eric roseberry writing in tempo magazine found music simple and memorably tuneful throughout writing for strings recorders and percussion is a miracle of inspiration andrew porter in opera magazine also found music touched by high inspiration evening was an unforgettable experience extraordinarily beautiful vivid and charming and often deeply moving design and production porter reported were brilliant while mackerras commanded his disparate forces masterfully several critics remarked favourably on sound of handbells roseberry p times quoted in britten 2010 p 48 timess critic noted effectiveness of britten s setting of mystery play it is britten s triumph that in this musically slender piece he has brought to new life mentality of another century by wholly modern means these means included a miscellaneous orchestra such as he alone could conceive and handle after premiere there were two further performances by same forces in orford church on 19 and 21 june noye s fludde became first of britten s operas to be shown on television when it was broadcast by atv on 22 june 1958 later performances noye s fludde had been largely created according to resources available from local suffolk community evans p 8 however once britten witnessed public and critical reception following premiere he insisted on taking it to london carpenter p 377 looking for a suitable london church britten settled on southwark cathedral somewhat reluctantly as he felt that it did not compare favourably with orford britten 2010 p 53 four performances featuring same principals as premiere were given on 14 and 15 november 1958 with britten conducting first britten 2010 p 87 all four performances sold out on first day of booking even as britten told a friend before any advertisement with 2000 circulars yet to be sent on 24 and 25 april 1959 finchley children s music group which was formed in 1958 specially to perform noye s fludde gave what was billed as first amateur london performance of work at all saint s church finchley cast included operatic bass norman lumsden as noah in united states after a radio broadcast in new york city on 31 july 1958 school of sacred music of union theological seminary staged us premiere on 16 march 1959 kennedy 2001 p 130 following year saw opera s canadian premiere conducted by john avison staged during 1960 vancouver international festival in christ church cathedral during preparations for first german performance of noye s fludde in ettal planned for may 1959 problem of scarcity of handbells became acute britten suggested that in absence of handbells a set of tubular bells in e flat in groups of twos and threes could be played by four or six children with two hammers each to enable them to strike chords britten was not present in ettal but he learned from ernst roth of boosey hawkes that ettal production had substituted glockenspiel and for handbells according to roth bells in carl orff s percussion ensembles were too weak for purpose britten 2010 p 57 britten later wrote to a friend i am rather relieved that i wasn t there no church no bugles no handbells no recorders but they seem to have done it with a great deal of care all same still i rather hanker after doing it in darmstadt as we want it even importing handbells for instance britten 2010 p 102 in uk christopher ede producer of landmark performances of chester mystery plays during festival of britain directed britten s opera in winchester cathedral 12 14 july 1960 writing to ede on 19 december 1959 britten urged him to keep staging of noye s fludde simple rather than elaborate britten 2010 p 137 in 1971 aldeburgh festival once again staged noye s fludde at orford a full television broadcast of production transferred to snape maltings was made by bbc conducted by steuart bedford under composer s supervision with brannigan resuming role of noah sheila rex as his wife and lumsden as voice

of work and first full performance of a britten opera in china it was performed again at shanghai music in summer air misa festival in july 2013 a performance is a minor plot point in 2012 movie moonrise kingdom britten s centenary year 2013 prompted numerous performances across uk including at tewkesbury abbey during cheltenham music festival and festival where 120 local children appeared as animals an aldeburgh festival production as a finale to centenary year was staged in november on eve of britten s 100th birthday anniversary in his home town of lowestoft andrew shore appeared as noye and felicity palmer as mrs noye this performance was broadcast in uk on bbc radio 3 on 24 november outside uk several professional companies mounted centenary year productions involving local children including santa fe opera and new orleans opera which mounted its first production of any britten opera music noye s fludde has been described by musicologist arnold whittall as a forerunner of britten s church parables of 1960s whittall p 216 and by composer s biographer paul kildea as a hybrid work as much a cantata as an opera kildea p 425 most of orchestral writing says music analyst eric roseberry lies well within range of intelligent young players of very restricted technique several episodes of opera such as grinding conflict of britten s passacaglia theme against dykes s familiar hymn tune in storm introduces listeners and youthful performers to what roseberry terms a contemporary idiom of dissonance in contrast to outworn style of most music written for young roseberry pp 2 3 with its innovatory arrangement of vocal and instrumental forces noye s fludde is summarised by whittall as a brilliant demonstration of how to combine relatively elementary instrumental and vocal skills of amateurs with professionals to produce a highly effective piece of music theatre opera begins with a short strenuous instrumental prelude roseberry p 3 which forms basis of musical accompaniment to opening congregational hymn its first phrase is founded on a descending bass e b f itself to become an important motif humphrey carpenter notes that throughout hymn bass line is out of step with singing an effect which he says suggests an adult world where purity is unattainable following hymn voice of god is accompanied as it is in all his pre flood warnings and declamations by e b f notes from opera s opening bass line sounded on timpani after noye s response in recitative next musical episode is entry of noye s children and their wives a passage which carpenter suggests replaces pessimism of adult word with blissful optimism of childhood syncopated tune of children s song is derived from final line of noye s recitative as god has bidden us doe roseberry p 4 mrs noye and her gossips enter to an f sharp minor distortion of children s tune which reflects their mocking attitude in noye s song calling for ark to be built a flood leitmotiv derived from first line of opening hymn recurs as a solemn refrain roseberry p 5 music which accompanies construction work heavily involves children s orchestra and includes recorder trills pizzicato open strings and tapping of oriental temple blocks after brief quarrel duet between noye and his wife in 6 8 time timpani led percussion heralds voice of god s order to fill ark bugle fanfares announce arrival of animals who march into ark to a innocent tune in which roseberry detects spirit of mahler fanfares punctuate entire march birds are last group to enter ark to accompaniment of a three part canon sung by noye s children and their wives in final scene before storm where noye and his family try to persuade mrs noye to join them in ark in g major music expresses mrs noye s obstinacy by having her reply accompanied by a d sharp pedal which prepares for gossips drinking scherzo in e minor slap which mrs noye administers when finally persuaded is accompanied by an e major fortissimo roseberry pp 7 8 storm scene which forms centre of opera is an extended passacaglia theme of which uses entire chromatic scale whittall p 166 in a long instrumental introduction full rein is given to various elements of children s orchestra slung mugs struck with a wooden spoon give sound of first raindrops trills in recorders represent wind strings impersonate waves while piano chords outline flood leitmotiv sound builds to a peak with thunder and lightning from percussion when eternal father is sung at climax of storm passacaglia theme provides bass line for hymn matthews p 123 after hymn minor key fury of passacaglia gradually subsides resolving into what roseberry describes as a dewy pastoral f major akin to that of finale of beethoven s pastoral symphony roseberry p 9 noye s reappearance is followed by brief waltzes for raven accompanied by solo cello and dove latter a flutter tongued recorder solo melody of which is reversed when dove returns roseberry p p 218 following god s instruction people and animals leave ark singing a thankful chorus of alleluias with more bugle fanfares in b flat appearance of rainbow is accompanied by handbell chimes a sound which dominates final stages of work in final canonical hymn main tune moves from f major to g major and is sung over reiterated bugle calls joined by handbells in third verse organ provides a brief discordant intervention one jarring note in noye s fludde according to musicologist peter evans evans p 281 graham elliott believes that this may be a musical joke in which britten pokes gentle fun at habits of some church organists elliott p 69 mingled chimes of slung mugs and bells continue during god s final valedictory blessing as noye leaves full orchestra provides a final fortissimo salute opera then concluding peacefully with b flat chimes of handbells alternating with extended g major string chords a hauntingly beautiful close says roseberry publication several of opera s novel features including use of a large amateur orchestra and specifically its use of handbells posed problems for britten s publishers boosey hawkes ernst roth made enquiries about availability of handbells to firm mears stainbank bell foundry based in whitechapel london and then wrote to britten urging him to prepare an alternative simplified version of noye s fludde for publication since rarity of handbells in scale of e flat made original score in his view impractical britten 2010 p 58 britten resisted such a proposal i think if you consider a performance of this work in a big church with about fifty or more children singing you will agree that orchestra would sound totally inadequate if it were only piano duet a few strings and a drum or two britten suggested rather that boosey hawkes should invest in a set of e flat handbells to hire for performances or that handbells music could be simply cued in piano duet part letter dated 16 july 1958 quoted in britten 2010 pp 55 56 after score had been published and in face of an imminent performance in ettal britten suggested that he could attempt to rewrite music for a handbell ensemble in d since sets in that key were more common than in e flat letter dated 28 february 1959 quoted in britten 2010 p 57 britten never prepared this alternative version for reduced instrumentation he did agree however to make published full score less bulky by presenting amateur forces of recorders ripieno strings and percussion in form of short score on understanding that full scores for those groups would be available to hire for rehearsal and performance purposes britten
