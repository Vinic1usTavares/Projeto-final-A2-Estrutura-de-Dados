californium is a radioactive chemical element with symbol cf and atomic number 98 element was first synthesized in 1950 at lawrence berkeley national laboratory then university of california radiation laboratory by bombarding curium with alpha particles helium 4 ions it is an actinide element sixth transuranium element to be synthesized and has second highest atomic mass of all elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with unaided eye after einsteinium element was named after university and state of california two crystalline forms exist for californium under normal pressure one above and one below a third form exists at high pressure californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature compounds of californium are dominated by 3 oxidation state most stable of californium s twenty known isotopes is californium 251 which has a half life of 898 years this short half life means element is not found in significant quantities in earth s crust californium 252 with a half life of about 2 645 years is most common isotope used and is produced at oak ridge national laboratory in united states and research institute of atomic reactors in russia californium is one of few transuranium elements that have practical applications most of these applications exploit property of certain isotopes of californium to emit neutrons for example californium can be used to help start up nuclear reactors and it is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials using neutron diffraction and neutron spectroscopy californium can also be used in nuclear synthesis of higher mass elements oganesson element 118 was synthesized by bombarding californium 249 atoms with calcium 48 ions users of californium must take into account radiological concerns and element s ability to disrupt formation of red blood cells by bioaccumulating in skeletal tissue characteristics physical properties californium is a silvery white actinide metal with a melting point of and an estimated boiling point of pure metal is malleable and is easily cut with a razor blade californium metal starts to vaporize above when exposed to a vacuum below californium metal is either ferromagnetic or it acts like a magnet between 48 and 66 k it is antiferromagnetic an intermediate state and above it is paramagnetic external magnetic fields can make it magnetic it forms alloys with lanthanide metals but little is known about them element has two crystalline forms under 1 standard atmosphere of pressure a double hexagonal close packed form dubbed alpha a and a face centered cubic form designated beta b a form exists below 600 800 degc with a density of 15 10 g cm3 and b form exists above 600 800 degc with a density of 8 74 g cm3 at 48 gpa of pressure b form changes into an orthorhombic crystal system due to delocalization of atom s 5f electrons which frees them to bond bulk modulus of a material is a measure of its resistance to uniform pressure californium s bulk modulus is which is similar to trivalent lanthanide metals but smaller than more familiar metals such as aluminium 70 gpa chemical properties and compounds representative californium compounds state

emerald green 3 californium iii bromide yellowish green 3 californium iii iodide lemon yellow iii oh 5 pale green 4 californium iv oxide black brown 4 californium iv fluoride green californium exhibits oxidation states of 4 3 or 2 it typically forms eight or nine bonds to surrounding atoms or ions its chemical properties are predicted to be similar to other primarily 3 valence actinide elements and element dysprosium which is lanthanide above californium in periodic table element slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature with rate increasing when moisture is added californium reacts when heated with hydrogen nitrogen or a chalcogen oxygen family element reactions with dry hydrogen and aqueous mineral acids are rapid californium is only water soluble as californium iii cation attempts to reduce or oxidize 3 ion in solution have failed element forms a water soluble chloride nitrate perchlorate and sulfate and is precipitated as a fluoride oxalate or hydroxide californium is heaviest actinide to exhibit covalent properties as is observed in californium borate isotopes twenty radioisotopes of californium have been characterized most stable being californium 251 with a half life of 898 years californium 249 with a half life of 351 years californium 250 with a half life of 13 08 years and californium 252 with a half life of 2 645 years all remaining isotopes have half lives shorter than a year and majority of these have half lives shorter than 20 minutes isotopes of californium range in mass number from 237 to 256 californium 249 is formed from beta decay of berkelium 249 and most other californium isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a nuclear reactor although californium 251 has longest half life its production yield is only 10 due to its tendency to collect neutrons high neutron capture and its tendency to interact with other particles high neutron cross section californium 252 is a very strong neutron emitter which makes it extremely radioactive and harmful californium 252 undergoes alpha decay 96 9 of time to form curium 248 while remaining 3 1 of decays are spontaneous fission one microgram ug of californium 252 emits 2 3 million neutrons per second an average of 3 7 neutrons per spontaneous fission most of other isotopes of californium decay to isotopes of curium atomic number 96 via alpha decay history thumb left cyclotron used to first synthesize californium alt large pieces of equipment with a man standing nearby californium was first synthesized at university of california radiation laboratory in berkeley by physics researchers stanley g thompson kenneth street jr albert ghiorso and glenn t seaborg on or about february 9 1950 it was sixth transuranium element to be discovered team announced its discovery on march 17 1950 to produce californium a microgram sized target of curium 242 was bombarded with 35 mev alpha particles in cyclotron at berkeley which produced californium 245 plus one free neutron only about 5 000 atoms of californium were produced in this experiment and these atoms had a half life of 44 minutes discoverers named new element after university and state this was a break from convention used for elements 95 to 97 which drew inspiration from how elements directly above them in periodic table were named however element directly above element 98 in periodic table dysprosium has a name that simply means hard to get at so researchers decided to set aside informal naming convention they added that best we can do is to point out that searchers a century ago found it difficult to get to california weighable quantities of californium were first produced by irradiation of plutonium targets at materials testing reactor at national reactor testing station in eastern idaho and these findings were reported in 1954 high spontaneous fission rate of californium 252 was observed in these samples first experiment with californium in concentrated form occurred in 1958 isotopes californium 249 to californium 252 were isolated that same year from a sample of plutonium 239 that had been irradiated with neutrons in a nuclear reactor for five years two years later in 1960 burris cunningham and james wallman of lawrence radiation laboratory of university of california created first californium compounds californium trichloride californium oxychloride and californium oxide by treating californium with steam and hydrochloric acid high flux isotope reactor hfir at oak ridge national laboratory ornl in oak ridge tennessee started producing small batches of californium in 1960s by 1995 hfir nominally produced of californium annually plutonium supplied by united kingdom to united states under 1958 us uk mutual defence agreement was used for californium production atomic energy commission sold californium 252 to industrial and academic customers in early 1970s for 10 per microgram and an average of of californium 252 were shipped each year from 1970 to 1990 californium metal was first prepared in 1974 by haire and who reduced californium iii oxide with lanthanum metal to obtain microgram amounts of sub micrometer thick films occurrence traces of californium can be found near facilities that use element in mineral prospecting and in medical treatments element is fairly insoluble in water but it adheres well to ordinary soil and concentrations of it in soil can be 500 times higher than in water surrounding soil particles fallout from atmospheric nuclear testing prior to 1980 contributed a small amount of californium to environment californium isotopes with mass numbers 249 252 253 and 254 have been observed in radioactive dust collected from air after a nuclear explosion californium is not a major radionuclide at united states department of energy legacy sites since it was not produced in large quantities californium was once believed to be produced in supernovas as their decay matches 60 day half life of however subsequent studies failed to demonstrate any californium spectra and supernova light curves are now thought to follow decay of nickel 56 transuranic elements from americium to fermium including californium occurred naturally in natural nuclear fission reactor at oklo but no longer do so production californium is produced in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators californium 250 is made by bombarding berkelium 249 with neutrons forming berkelium 250 via neutron capture n g which in turn quickly beta decays b to californium 250 in following reaction n g b bombardment of californium 250 with neutrons produces californium 251 and californium 252 prolonged irradiation of americium curium and plutonium with neutrons produces milligram amounts of californium 252 and microgram amounts of californium 249 as of 2006 curium isotopes 244 to 248 are irradiated by neutrons in special reactors to produce primarily californium 252 with lesser amounts of isotopes 249 to 255 microgram quantities of californium 252 are available for commercial use through u s nuclear regulatory commission only two sites produce californium 252 oak ridge national laboratory in united states and research institute of atomic reactors in dimitrovgrad russia as of 2003 two sites produce 0 25 grams and 0 025 grams of californium 252 per year respectively three californium isotopes with significant half lives are produced requiring a total of 15 neutron captures by uranium 238 without nuclear fission or alpha decay occurring during process californium 253 is at end of a production chain that starts with uranium 238 includes several isotopes of plutonium americium curium berkelium and californium isotopes 249 to 253 see diagram center upright 2 8 thumb scheme of production of californium 252 from uranium 238 by neutron irradiation alt a complex flow diagram showing various isotopes applications thumb fifty ton shipping cask built at oak ridge national laboratory which can transport up to 1 gram of 252cf large and heavily shielded transport containers are needed to prevent release of highly radioactive material in case of normal and hypothetical accidents alt large conical structure on a pulley with a man on top and two near base californium 252 has a number of specialized applications as a strong neutron emitter and each microgram of fresh californium produces 139 million neutrons per minute this property makes californium useful as a neutron startup source for some nuclear reactors and as a portable non reactor based neutron source for neutron activation analysis to detect trace amounts of elements in samples neutrons from californium are employed as a treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective it has been used in educational applications since 1969 when georgia institute of technology received a loan of 119 ug of californium 252 from savannah river plant it is also used with online elemental coal analyzers and bulk material analyzers in coal and cement industries neutron penetration into materials makes californium useful in detection instruments such as fuel rod scanners neutron radiography of aircraft and weapons components to detect corrosion bad welds cracks and trapped moisture and in portable metal detectors neutron moisture gauges use californium 252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells as a portable neutron source for gold and silver prospecting for on spot analysis and to detect ground water movement major uses of californium 252 in 1982 were in order of use reactor start up 48 3 fuel rod scanning 25 3 and activation analysis 19 4 by 1994 most californium 252 was used in neutron radiography 77 4 with fuel rod scanning 12 1 and reactor start up 6 9 as important but distant secondary uses californium 251 has a very small calculated critical mass of about high lethality and a relatively short period of toxic environmental irradiation low critical mass of californium led to some exaggerated claims about possible uses for element in october 2006 researchers announced that three atoms of oganesson element 118 had been identified at joint institute for nuclear research in dubna russia as product of bombardment of californium 249 with calcium 48 making it heaviest element ever synthesized target for this experiment contained about 10 mg of californium 249 deposited on a titanium foil of 32 cm2 area californium has also been used to produce other transuranium elements for example element 103 later named lawrencium was first synthesized in 1961 by bombarding californium with boron nuclei precautions californium that bioaccumulates in skeletal tissue releases radiation that disrupts body s ability to form red blood cells element plays no natural biological role in any organism due to its intense radioactivity and low concentration in environment californium can enter body from ingesting contaminated food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of element once in body only 0 05 of californium will reach bloodstream about 65 of that californium will be deposited in skeleton 25 in liver and rest in other organs or excreted mainly in urine half of californium deposited in skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years respectively californium in skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout bone element is most dangerous if taken into body in addition californium 249 and californium 251 can cause tissue damage externally through gamma ray emission ionizing radiation emitted by californium on bone and in liver can cause cancer notes references bibliography external links californium at periodic table of videos university of
