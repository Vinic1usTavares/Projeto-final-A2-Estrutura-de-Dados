leading wicket taker during season taking twice as many wickets as next most effective bowler charles winter fothergill s first match in 1883 was in a representative match playing for south against

eleven wickets in each match including seven for 62 in second innings against leicestershire but neither match had first class status in 1885 he enjoyed his best match for south taking four wickets in each innings as north were defeated by nine wickets majority of his cricket from 1884 until 1886 was made for mcc although he did appear four times in 1886 for somerset which had been stripped of its first class status foot 1986 pp 23 28 in contrast in 1887 and 1888 he played almost exclusively for county appearing just three times for mcc somerset who had relied on bowling of fothergill in early 1880s were spearheaded by e w bastard ted tyler and sammy woods in late 1880s and fothergill was rarely needed to bowl many overs despite this he was presented with a bat during 1888 a reward usually given to batsmen who had scored a century roebuck 1991 pp 43 45 test cricketer thumb right advertisement for two matches on tour including first test alt a black and white poster all text advertising two cricket matches during english winter of 1888 89 mcc sent a touring team to south africa organised by major gardner warton original itinerary only featured odds matches in which an 11 player mcc team faced opposition sides including 15 18 or 22 players depending on their perceived strength in his book a history of cricket harry altham describes that quality of touring party was about that of a weak county fothergill was selected as part of side despite not having played a first class match since may 1887 majority of wickets during tour were taken by lancashire s spinner johnny briggs who took almost 300 but fothergill was heavily used as a bowler and claimed 119 wickets at an average of 6 89 altham suggests that ease of touring side s victories justifies selection of a comparatively weak side as tour continued there were calls for an even strength contest with english side facing an 11 player south african side two such matches were arranged but were considered no different from other matches during tour being advertised as major warton s xi v south africa xi matches were later granted test match status although wisden cricketers almanack commented that it was never intended or considered necessary to take out a representative english team for a first trip to cape in first test fothergill opened bowling with briggs and bowled economically conceding 15 runs from his 24 four ball overs he only took one wicket in innings and was noted more for his batting later in day having bowled south africa out for 84 england rallied from 103 for nine due to a 45 run partnership for tenth wicket between fothergill and basil grieve batting at number eleven fothergill scored 32 runs second only to opening batsman bobby abel in south africa s second innings fothergill was used as first change bowler and took four wickets for 19 his best figures in two test matches south africa scored 129 runs before being bowled out and england scored 67 runs required for victory with a day of match remaining england dominated second test largely due to bowling of briggs batting first england scored 292 runs of which abel contributed 120 fothergill claimed first south african wicket albert rose innes at end of first day but only claimed two more in match as briggs took fifteen wickets on second day to help england to an innings and 202 run victory fothergill s two test appearances were only ones of his career and were also his final first class matches in all he took 119 first class wickets at an average of 18 18 his highest score was 74 runs he scored on his debut later life and career after returning from south africa fothergill played occasionally for mcc and three further times for somerset but with little merit he made his final appearance for somerset in 1889 against staffordshire he took 157 wickets for county in total of which 57 came in first class matches his last match for mcc was three years later against llandudno cricket club in his obituary
