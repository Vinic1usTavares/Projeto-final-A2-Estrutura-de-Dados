releases trio was compelled to take a break and subsequently participated in various side projects box car racer and transplants when they regrouped they felt inspired to approach song structure and arrangements differently on their next effort together recorded from january to october 2003 with producer jerry finn album has been described as darker and more mature than band s earlier work it also marked a musical departure from their previous efforts infusing experimental elements inspired by lifestyle changes band members all became fathers before album was released and side projects into their usual pop punk sound its songs are sonically expansive and downcast leading critics to view it as a more elaborate mature side of band songwriting is more personal in nature and explores darker territory touching upon realities of adulthood and unexpected hardships in addition its recording process was long and often unconventional fans were generally split regarding band s new direction but album proved successful selling 2 2 million copies in united states it received positive reviews with critics welcoming its change in tone lead singles feeling this and i miss you

aftermath of september 11 attacks shooman 2010 p 89 and they were called off a second time after delonge suffered a herniated disc in his back shooman 2010 p 90 with time off from touring delonge felt an itch to do something where he didn t feel locked in to what blink was shooman 2010 p 92 and channeled his chronic back pain and resulting frustration into box car racer 2002 a post hardcore disc that further explores his fugazi and refused inspiration refraining from paying for a studio drummer he invited blink drummer travis barker to record drums on project shooman 2010 p 94 box car racer intended as a one time experimental project became a full fledged band with barker behind kit and hazen street guitarist david kennedy on guitar blink bassist mark hoppus felt betrayed and jealous and it would create an unresolved tension within trio that followed band for several years at end of 2001 it felt like blink 182 had broken up it wasn t spoken about but it felt over said hoppus later

tabloid attention adding to awkwardness present in band post hardcore sound of box car racer inspired change in tone and experimental nature band approached blink 182 with hoppus described his desire for album to experiment with different arrangements in a 2002 interview before we got one guitar sound that we changed a little bit through record this time we want to try a whole different setup for each song hoppus recalled that barker entered production process by urging band to not think of album as next blink 182 record think of it as first blink 182 record members were also inspired after hearing houston we have a drinking problem by bad astronaut and its expansive sound once door was opened by tom and travis with box car racer mark started to be more on board with that concept he was also more flexible and next blink album was able to be a pretty big departure from previous two said assistant engineer sam boukas box car racer opened door in that sense and i think three of them wanted to be more creative and have more creative liberty on that next album shooman 2010 p 121 recording and production thumb right 250px bassist mark hoppus beside a grand piano while recording album at conway recording studios in september 2003 in january 2003 band rented a home in san diego luxury community of rancho santa fe planning to record entire album there in addition to home being converted into a studio pay per view pornography was on continuous play and it included a space to smoke hella weed in garage trio ditched their typical previous recording process writing and demoing several songs and recording them in a studio one instrument at a time and instead approached each song together band attacked each song and worked on three to four songs per day simply moving on to next one when feeling burned out on a track band also had fun at home studio delonge commented if i wasn t smoking half of colombia i probably ran up 3 million in adult film charges band recorded at home until april 2003 when owners of house kicked them out barker unwilling to leave moakler would drive from los angeles to san diego each day he subsequently left that spring to tour with transplants leaving band with a variety of drum tracks to listen to while he was gone band regrouped after being kicked out by owners of house they were recording in and began recording at rolling thunder studios until band left to perform a couple of summer shows in canada and japan where they premiered several songs live in studio antics and behind scenes moments were recorded and posted on

period lasting until october previous blink 182 sessions were recorded in three months band stated that being in a studio longer than three months gave them luxury of experimenting with different methods of writing playing and recording band built each song with a minute attention to detail hoppus described studio as a musical laboratory over 70 guitars 30 amps 30 or 40 different snare drums up to six drum kits various keyboards turntables and pianos were used in album s production a lot of which came from finn s personal collection https www youtube com watch v barker was responsible for turntables and a copy of pink floyd s wall group also enlisted help of james guthrie an engineer behind wall trio also sent cure frontman robert smith bed track of all of this in hopes he would contribute smith makes a guest appearance and recorded his parts in england three initially believed their legitimacy would be in question due to humor oriented nature of their earlier recordings to which smith responded nobody knows what kind of songs you are going to write in future and nobody knows full potential of any band i really like music you sent me band also collaborated with dj shadow and dan and barker desired to work with neptunes jerry finn who had produced previous two blink 182 albums and box car racer album returned to produce blink 182 which would be his final collaboration with band as record neared completion by august 2003 band performed for a short time for armed forces in middle east and premiered more new songs at their reading and leeds sets trio shot small home made videos for several songs on blink 182 as well as official music video for feeling this song they picked as first single band spent time to finalize cd booklet and album artwork in september mark hoppus stated that album was so personal to all three of us that we really wanted to be involved in every aspect of it release date kept getting missed and pushed back to point where jordan schur then president of geffen records made calls asking what is absolute last possible second that we can turn this thing in and still make our release date delonge described final days of mixing album as crazy stressful with literally hours to turn album to have it come it out on time album was in production so late that final mixes were still being judged by hoppus delonge and barker night before album was sent to pressing plant for barker he later considered it his favorite time in band s history commenting that was a good time in my life i was smoking just enough weed and taking just enough pills composition music and style thumb 170px left bassist and vocalist mark hoppus considered his lyricism on untitled his most personal to that point while still rooted in pop punk untitled finds band expanding their sonic template with darker restless songs compositions on record have been described as musically diverse and borderline experimental with sullen moodiness and off kilter hooks basis for many tracks record pulls from a variety of styles including post hardcore new wave electronic rock jangle pop and reflective alternative rock experimentation was constantly present band tried different mic techniques and toyed with harmonium organs polynesian gamelan bells and turntables band infused these experimentalist elements into their usual pop punk sound inspired by lifestyle changes band members all became fathers before album was released and side projects box car racer and transplants in a full article about album in november 20 2003 edition of milwaukee journal sentinel ben wener described music of album as expansive downcast and sometimes spectral new york times considered that album may have been influenced by growing popularity of emo pop while allmusic regarded it a delve into post punk much of punk has been dissolved buzzsaw guitars faded into corners allowing room for staggering dynamics cathartic guitar bursts and a weightier more experimental and ambitious sound wrote tom bryant of kerrang goal for untitled was continuity each song develops lyrically like chapters in a book and songs segue into one another to present a cohesive feel instead of a regular collection of tracks in addition to side projects music of album was inspired by september 11 attacks and onset of iraq war mood was unsettling for delonge whose brother is a navy officer it was so weird because we d all be glued to tv watching these bombs explode over another country so i d see all this and wonder where he was at and then we d have to go into next room and sing or finish writing lyrics i think it affected our moods throughout day in addition it was just inspired by socializing we would just hang out for hours talking it was really cool said delonge lyrics critics agreed that this album represents a more mature blink 182 hence absence of songs with toilet humour or jokes for which band had been known we wanted to be different remarked delonge some of our fans were probably like fuck maybe they should stop joking so people could hear why i like this band and i think this record is going to help those kids out blender issue unknown 2004 in an interview with mtv album launch hoppus said that desired effect of album was for people to listen to it and say wait a minute that s blink 182 themes for album include growing up and dealing with realities of adulthood including relationship woes daily pressures and unexpected hardships album is lyrically consumed with sorrow and uncertainty about world entertainment weekly described it as a concept album based on a dying relationship a self meditation on romantic decay i think at this point in our career we are better musicians and we ve evolved our way of thinking as far as songwriting delonge told billboard in reference to more mature lyricism hoppus in his interview with milwaukee journal sentinel described lyrics as most personal he had written to that point while past recordings tended to meditate on feelings from high school band felt it was akin to a safety net and desired to write about what s going on right now lyrics continued to be autobiographical but band took more time than usual on their writing delonge would routinely rewrite his sections upwards of four times songs record opens with feeling this which features flanged drums and an unconventional syncopated latin flavored backbeat and a harmony rich chorus following a series of half barked vocals feeling this was first song written for album and illustrates a scenario of lust ambivalence and regret with protagonist of song reflecting over his romance s dimming flame in chorus fate fell short this time your smile fades in summer hoppus and delonge wrote song in two different rooms and upon meeting to discuss song two realized they had both written about sex passionate lustful side reflected in verses and romantic side choruses it segues into obvious which explores wall of sound technique and features a brooding heavy intro combined with cascading guitar riffs i miss you is an all acoustic affair featuring a melancholy piano cello upright acoustic bass and a hip hop groove song features references to tim burton s 1993 animated film nightmare before christmas with we can live like jack and sally and we ll have halloween on christmas in interviews and liner notes for blink 182 barker reveals that line was directed towards his then girlfriend shanna moakler violence flicks between bizarre spoken jazzy verses and anthemic punk rock choruses with lyrics that equate broken hearts with global violence stockholm syndrome has been described as most obvious examples of blink 182 s experimentation was recorded using a microphone dating back to 1950s and reverb on vocals was achieved by playing recordings into a shower drum fills for song were recorded separately than rest of tracks with tape machines sped up and super compressed then played back at normal speed to sound really deep and gigantic according to hoppus in liner notes for blink 182 it features an interlude before it in which joanne whalley reads letters hoppus s grandfather wrote to his grandmother during world war ii delonge explained letters as real sincere genuine letters from worst war in history down continues theme of longing set to a rain drenched soundscape shooman 2010 p 122 124 original version of down ran over six minutes long and contained a drum and bass breakdown from barker fallen interlude which functions as an outro to down finds barker showcasing different percussive techniques over a funk tinged jazz sound it is a near instrumental recorded with sick jacken of hip hop band psycho realm go is record s only straight punk rock song it s a personal song said hoppus it s not specifically about my mother i feel weird talking about it asthenia uses real nasa transmissions from apollo 9 space flight it centers on a fictional astronaut stranded in space floating in an apollo capsule and contemplating whether or not to return to his home planet it is also only song in blink 182 s catalog to feature a 3 4 time signature during bridge song was inspired by delonge s self admitted paranoia regarding future and how war and famine could affect it always features an uptempo backbeat combined with a new romantic era keyboard and pulls from new wave influences band often jokingly called track 80s song it contains a riff reminiscent of only ones another girl another planet easy target and all of this were based on a story from producer jerry finn s middle school years finn was in love with a female classmate holly who invited him over only to have her and her friend drench him with a hose humiliated he rode home on his bicycle all of this is a gothic tinged pop song that uses strings and guitar effects to create a moody atmosphere track here s your letter according to hoppus in liner notes for blink 182 is about people s inability to communicate with one another and how words and explanations only confuse issues i m lost without you mixes an industrial loop with piano latter track took many months to create and took over 50 different tracks including two drum sets combined during last minute of song barker described idea for percussion combination as something we always wanted to do but never got around to and believed song sounded like pink floyd or failure uk edition of record features b side not now originally recorded during sessions not now features a church organ in its verses and guitar riffs reminiscent of descendents its subject matter continues theme of complicated miscommunication and fading love packaging and title thumb right 170px album artwork was led by drummer travis barker who was inspired by british act jam and pop art due to some contradicting sources title of album or lack thereof is debated travis barker in his memoir can i say writes that some people think it s a self titled album called blink 182 but mark hoppus has always insisted it was actually untitled a 2003 interview and article from mtv news discussing naming of pending album repeatedly refers to release as untitled album while a press release from that time period confirms same despite this several critics have used terms eponymous untitled and self titled in describing album in a 2009 mtv news article james montgomery refers to album as self titled joking or untitled it s never really been clear title for album was originally rumored to be use your erection i ii a parody of guns n roses albums use your illusion i and ii but was revealed to be a joke barker made to get a rise out of people delonge in reference to previous joke album titles such as enema of state stated we didn t want to label it with a joke title that people might expect as such a billboard article from week of album s release lists three rejected joke titles diarrhea de janeiro vasectomy a you and our pet sounds to support new album blink 182 created an entirely new logo a smiley face with xs for each eye and five arrows on left side of its face according to barker blink 182 logo originated at his clothing line famous stars and straps barker wanted to brand an icon for band it just had to be a cool kind of happy face but i wanted arrows you know like jam were my favorite band they always had arrows in their logos and stuff it was just kind of inspired by pop art hoppus seconded this sentiment he spearheaded all artwork for record there were smiley face stickers and posters all over los angeles and that was his idea barker invited his tattoo artist mister cartoon to create artwork for record and his good friend estevan oriol to handle photography his style incorporated into blink s didn t make us too gangster it just gave us a bit of an edge it was cool to feel like blink had a dangerous side barker later remembered musicomh described album booklet as meticulously put together and resembling a pastiche each song includes small notes detailing lyrical inspiration for each song what it means to each band member and recording techniques used band originally wanted each cd booklet to be made from canvas material geffen gave band a choice between custom artwork or keeping sale price down to us 12 and band chose latter as they felt it was more important that young listeners obtain record for less money promotion and
