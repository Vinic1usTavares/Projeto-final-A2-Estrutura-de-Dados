encounter a more evil force dark and after destroying him finally return peace to algol system development background thumb yuji naka lead programmer role playing games rpg were beginning to gain popularity with console players in japan in late 1980s many japanese game designers were inspired by western rpgs such as ultima and wizardry enix s dragon quest series was proving to be very popular on famicom translation archived inspiring other developers to design similar games falcom began development on ys i ancient ys vanished as square was doing same with final fantasy around release of dragon quest ii in january 1987 sega felt they needed an rpg for their master system to compete in this emerging market translation archived they believed they could not rely on third party support because sega s hardware market share was only one tenth that of nintendo s they looked internally and found designer kotaro hayashida and programmer yuji naka were interested in creating an rpg they had previously been recognized for their work within sega hayashida for alex kidd in miracle world 1986 and naka for his 8 bit home console conversions of arcade games like out run and space harrier with sega s approval hayashida and naka began forming a team to develop an rpg team consisted of around ten people hayashida was lead designer and naka was lead programmer other staff members from miracle world joined project including lead graphic designer rieko kodama and composer uwabo there were more women on development team than was typical at time among them were kodama who drew most of artwork designer miki morimoto who did much of playtesting and enemy statistics configuration and chieko aoki who wrote game s original story and script aoki had already been working on an original story with most of dialogue already completed and this became first draft for rpg project game would be character designer naoto ohshima s first project at sega although there was no team director hayashida believes he had largest role in shaping game as lead designer and scenario writer although ohshima recalls naka leading project name phantasy star was formed after naka took word fantasy from a song he enjoyed titled nagisa no fantasy by noriko sakai team shared same room so they could see each other s work they were given freedom to build game how they wanted without restrictions which hayashida believes led to them enjoying themselves more and producing a higher quality game in end production team wanted phantasy star to be different from other rpgs they took many new approaches to design of game and its art to provide a unique experience one approach was with setting team was strongly influenced by star wars and how it combined western culture with japanese touches such as how clothing resembled judo uniforms and lightsabers were used like samurai swords kodama took this approach and designed world of phantasy star using a science fiction motif mixed with medieval fantasy elements rather than use an airship to navigate over mountainous landscape something common in other games they added in a vehicle that could mow down impassable terrain team also added detailed event scenes and animated monsters to help set game apart their philosophy was to use extensive animation so ocean and walkways on world map are always moving because master system could not draw large sprites some parts of large characters were drawn to background and only animated portions were drawn as sprites thumb left navigating a 3d dungeon in phantasy star another unique addition to phantasy star was 3d dungeons they became a central concept in game s early planning stages in part because famicom was incapable of handling them team drew inspiration from western dungeon crawling rpgs like wizardry and wanted to add animated navigation to help player know their location and orientation more easily naka had experimented with creating dungeons inspired by these rpgs typically these scenes were rendered in small boxes so naka was motivated to engineer a full screen dungeon that could be used for an action game or an rpg originally artists were drawing full 2d backgrounds using a 3d perspective but number of frames necessary to achieve animated effect used too much space on cartridge naka solved this by programming true wireframe 3d dungeons artists then used a program by naka to superimpose their art on top of they also saved three quarters of memory they would normally need by making each quadrant of screen identical new dungeons scrolled faster than expected and needed to be slowed down female heroine alis was a sharp contrast compared with typical male protagonists of other rpgs kodama had designed female characters before but never one in a strong and prominent role this was an uncommon portrayal when games at time usually had a damsel in distress kodama went through about a dozen designs until she achieved a strong but feminine character one with whom female gamers could empathize noah was also designed by kodama as a mysterious and intelligent character in original draft noah was an androgynous character and would become male or female depending on how player progressed eventually it was decided character would be male ohshima designed odin because kodama did not enjoy drawing muscular men kodama envisioned visual contrast between noah and odin as comparable to that between raistlin majere and caramon majere in dragonlance book series ohshima was also responsible for a third of monster designs at most lead monster designer enjoyed classic fantasy monsters such as golems and medusa so these types of characters appeared in final game myau was designed by takako kawaguchi at four megabits game s data was large for time phantasy star was only second game for master system to use a chip this large it was one of four games where it would be used in spite of chip s capacity team made many compromises to save space original story featured four planets but this was reduced to three artists had to make compromises with backgrounds and battle animations background scenes were mirrored vertically to save space this created inconsistencies with shadowing there were plans for a password system to save progress but this was cut due to memory limitations batteries were used instead team wanted to have a password feature as a failsafe in case saving data corrupted it as was often case in playtests instead naka programmed a backup of save data that could be used to restore a corrupted save file composer uwabo noted that game was developed during japanese economic bubble which fueled his enthusiasm which he believes is reflected in music translation game was compatible with master system fm synthesis expansion unit which housed a yamaha chip that added nine more mono channels to console s programmable sound generator psg expansion gave soundtrack a wider range and heavier bass unit was not released outside japan release thumb right phantasy star was originally released on master system japanese mark iii model pictured phantasy star was first released in japan for master system on december 20 1987 two days after final fantasy was released for famicom game was released in west in november 1988 introducing players outside japan to emerging jrpg scene having been localized before dragon quest or final fantasy it was most expensive game for master system in every market its price being driven by large 4 megabit chip save battery and a concurrent chip shortage across industry in japan game was difficult to find in stores sega often got requests from fans for a mega drive port so they eventually shipped a limited release for mega drive as part of a contest in 1994 this version was identical to master system version but lacked fm sound enhancements tectoy translated master system version to portuguese and released it in brazil in 1991 since original western release retained text formatting of japanese version it used fewer characters than a proper english translation required in 2008 fans modified text engine to fit longer lines of dialogue and released a newly translated version with japanese fm soundtrack as well a series of phantasy star compilations were released for sega saturn game boy advance and playstation 2 saturn version was released in 1998 it includes both hiragana and katakana alphabets an improvement from original which had only katakana due to limited memory 2008 playstation 2 version is based on saturn version and has additional features game boy advance compilation was a straight emulation and was only compilation released outside japan phantasy star also appeared in emulated form on sonic s ultimate genesis collection for xbox 360 and playstation 3 and on wii via virtual console in 2009 in 2018 a port developed by m2 was released through sega ages label for nintendo switch this version includes enhancements such as options to make game easier and faster guides for items spells and monsters fm soundtrack hiragana support and a dungeon auto mapping feature naka s tricky programming efficiencies to save memory in

buried under a ton of nes titles and aggressive marketing electronic game player felt game was leading industry into a new era of console rpgs sega pro called it best rpg on master system and zzap called it a must have for rpg fans boys life wrote that along with legend of zelda series phantasy star may represent future of home video games by combining graphic quality of arcade games with complexity of computer games game was commended for its strategy puzzles and challenge videogames computer entertainment and s sega magazine praised game for being easy to play and not relying on quick action reflexes critics liked variety of monsters and combat system computer gaming world wrote that not since dungeon master had such a good and explicit graphic combat system been seen computer entertainer felt game s large scope and deep gameplay was more typically seen in computer games than on consoles this large scope made critics thankful for cart s battery back up an unusual hardware feature at time save battery and complex gameplay led some critics to compare phantasy star to legend of zelda 1986 critics praised game for its presentation building a grand sense of adventure and atmosphere videogames computer entertainment commended mix of science fiction and fantasy elements and felt it had a grander scale than other rpgs electronic game player wrote that atmosphere was simply breathtaking by current video game standards graphics were enjoyed by many reviewers especially for their vivid colors and animation monster animations in particular received

force and so technologically superior in graphics that nintendo titles pale by comparison zzap called it a technical achievement considering master system s hardware limitations it was awarded best graphics for 1988 by electronic gaming monthlys player s choice awards game was difficult to recommend for some because of its high price computer entertainer found purchase difficult to justify as it was highest price they had ever seen for a game on any cartridge based system or disk based computer computer and video games felt they could only recommend it for hardcore rpg fans for this reason videogames computer entertainment however called it such a remarkable video game that it may justify its existence as most expensive cartridge on shelf retrospective reviews phantasy star was reviewed again for its re releases most critics continued to hold graphics in high regard gamespot and g force wrote that graphics pushed master system to its limits and helped set game apart in its time rpgfan and nintendo life called 3d dungeons revolutionary nintendo life felt that graphics did show their age but noted that it looks much better than an 8 bit rpg has any right to and it easily surpasses any nes effort of era 1up com and ign agreed writing that it outclassed both original final fantasy and dragon quest some critics commented that game felt too standard compared to modern rpgs some also felt it was more difficult and dull than modern offerings due to heavier grinding game boy advance version was commended for being a good emulation but criticized for poor sound and missed opportunities for enhancements nintendo world report praised switch release for adding fm sound and enhancements to make for a more streamlined experience legacy phantasy star is considered a landmark rpg it has been called revolutionary pioneering and ahead of its time it is credited with helping to define genre and introduce west to console rpgs ign wrote phantasy star was game that defined an entire generation s early experiences with rpg genre as a whole a role playing adventure without equal at time of its initial debut a time when competition was virtually non existent in category it has been called one of best games on master system nintendo life called it a killer app which not only tested hardware but also boundaries and expectations of genre retro gamer called it a key release for genre s popularity in west and a key reason to own a master system game introduced many elements that later became staples of rpg genre its fusion of science fiction with medieval fantasy contrasted with traditional fantasy seen in all other rpgs of its era nintendo power explained that phantasy star was first rpg to break out of dragon quest dungeons dragons mold of generic arthurian fantasy by introducing sci fi elements inclusion of pre defined characters with unique personalities and abilities in game is also considered revolutionary when compared to customizable characters in other rpgs graphics are considered ahead of their time particularly 3d dungeons and monster animations it was also one of earliest video games to feature a female protagonist which nintendo life called perhaps its most revolutionary aspect phantasy star launched careers of its staff some worked on a series of sequels starting on mega drive known as some of best rpgs of their era
