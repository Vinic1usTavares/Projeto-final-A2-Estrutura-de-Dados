litre more acid to give balance to sugar more flavour and more complexity these elements combine to make wines which are amongst most long lived of all white wines beneficial use of noble rot in

acidic characteristic of wine that gives riesling its thirst quenching quality producers of sauvignon blanc and pinot often avoid malolactic fermentation for same reason riesling is often put through a process of cold stabilization where wine is stored just above its freezing point wine is kept at this temperature until much of tartaric acid has crystallized and precipitated out of wine this helps
