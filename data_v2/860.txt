chairman of cabinet of ministers he and his two first deputy prime ministers vladimir and vitaly were approved by supreme soviet of soviet union on 14 january while approval for majority of his ministers followed within a few weeks pavlov was considered a conservative upon his election as prime minister and soviet press described him as a bold and complex man who was against full marketisation but who believed that soviet union was even more oppressive towards workers than even most advanced capitalist societies one of his first actions as prime minister was to move headquarters of soviet government cabinet of ministers from moscow kremlin to former headquarters of state committee for construction to strengthen his position pavlov monetary reform thumb right a new 50 rouble banknote issued in 1991 during pavlov reform soviet monetary reform of 1991 commonly referred to as pavlov reform was last monetary reform prior to dissolution of soviet union initiated on 22 january 1991 it was intended to withdraw money from circulation for reallocation to production of consumer goods which were in short supply in a speech pavlov stated that reason for withdrawal was government s belief that money was being sent to soviet union from abroad fuelling inflation although ridiculed by soviet press at time three years later truth of pavlov s statement was verified mikhail gorbachev then signed a presidential decree ordering soviet financial system to stop accepting and exchanging banknotes issued in 1961 directive also included 50 rouble and 100 rouble banknotes issued in 1991 on 23 january 1991 government began restricting monthly bank deposit withdrawals to 500 rubles with official explanation that this was to freeze income of corrupt officials capitalists and criminals under orders of pavlov government freed forty percent of prices on 1 january 1991 and introduced sales tax of 5 prices of consumer goods in particular were now considered free in sense that negotiation became possible between producers and distributor according to philip hanson in his book rise and fall of soviet economy an economic history of ussr from 1945 pavlov s reform was undermined by union republics who failed to follow pavlov s orders along with widespread existence of local monopolies which tended to have their own definition of luxury goods and as a result imposed higher prices on such items soviet citizens had only three days from 23 25 january to exchange their old 50 rouble and 100 rouble banknotes for new currency exchange could be postponed but only through specialized government commissions due to this short exchange window long queues formed in front of soviet savings banks even though it was also possible to exchange money at workplaces and post offices this reform also dealt a crippling blow to soviet citizens who had saved their money and could not move fast enough to get it exchanged some lost as much as 15 000 30 000 rubles overnight in end reform proved unsuccessful government only managed to withdraw 14 billion rubles from circulation of country s money supply against an intended target of 81 5 billion rubles as a result pavlov reform did not put an end to inflation prices for items including food and transport rose by 100 300 percent while soviet standard of living decreased sharply and state budget deficit increased by an estimated 20 30 percent of gnp in aftermath of reform inflation exceeded 50 percent mark every month coup attempt in june 1991 pavlov discovered that gorbachev planned to replace him as prime minister in response he arrived at supreme soviet of soviet union visibly nervous and in his report to supreme soviet he was forced to tell delegates of faltering state of soviet economy however pavlov blamed this on ongoing war of laws between supreme soviet of soviet union and supreme soviet of russian soviet federative socialist republic rsfsr which he argued could be resolved by introducing a state of emergency across entire soviet union or at least in certain economic sectors according to pavlov union s problems remained insoluble as long as gorbachev retained so much power and had limited time to address important issues to break impasse pavlov called for a transfer of power from president of soviet union to prime minister and cabinet of ministers even creating a five point resolution to that end for legislature to consider pavlov received support for idea from soyuz parliamentary faction leader viktor alksnis who called for an immediate vote on issue however several members of soyuz also demanded a statement by kgb and ministry of defence to comment on proposal in retrospect alksnis notes that this resolution could have become a coup d etat had pavlov consulted with them earlier according to historian jerry f hough pavlov s program was not directed as much at gorbachev as at boris yeltsin by afternoon majority of soyuz members favoured an immediate vote chairman of supreme soviet of soviet union anatoly lukyanov had already departed for novo to take part in constitutional negotiations and he promised to tell gorbachev about vote in his place stood ivan laptev a pro gorbachev reformer who did not trust lukyanov and tried to stall vote by demanding a statement from kgb ministry of interior and ministry of defence according to laptev mood was such that if a vote had been taken pavlov would have won at time both soviet secret police and military establishment in general wanted to strengthen authority of soviet government and so they too supported pavlov s program soyuz through a vote was able to increase powers of cabinet of ministers and gave institution right of legislative initiative shortly afterwards jack matlock united states ambassador to soviet union told gorbachev of possibility of a coup attempt against him and soviet leader became worried when anatoly informed him of mysterious troop movements outside moscow on 21 june four days after pavlov s speech gorbachev addressed supreme soviet and told delegates that there were no differences in opinion between him and pavlov even when he had been able to secure his position gorbachev s power within system was already faltering although he succeeded in getting enhanced powers previously given to cabinet of ministers reversed power struggle between gorbachev and pavlov was not over with gorbachev promising yeltsin and nursultan nazarbayev that pavlov along with dmitry yazov minister of defence and vladimir kryuchkov chairman of kgb would be removed from their posts following signing and ratification of new union treaty august coup 1991 soviet coup d etat attempt commonly referred to as august coup was prompted by slow disintegration of soviet union that resulted from gorbachev s reform policy and yeltsin s drive towards an independent russia new union treaty being prepared called for further decentralisation of power to republics which weakened government s already tenuous hold on economy pavlov received a draft of new union treaty on 12 august at a security council meeting and managed to get it published in moscow news on 14 august opposing decentralisation stance taken in treaty pavlov was one of key players in establishment of state committee for state of emergency in august 1991 pavlov s inclusion in committee has been used to demonstrate its unwillingness to revert to pre gorbachev policies committee s main goal was to ensure that soviet union continued as a highly centralised union state emergency committee was led by gennady vice president of soviet union interior minister boris defence minister dmitry yazov and other hardliners who were determined to take action to oust gorbachev vladimir kryuchkov kgb chairman had told pavlov of coup on 18 august one day before it began he was asked by kryuchkov to meet his co plotters at moscow kremlin where on 19 august he and his co conspirators appeared on live television and told soviet people that gorbachev was indisposed as day wore on it soon became apparent that pavlov had been drinking since he issued several contradictory orders and repeated himself in retrospect he admitted that he had been drinking with his son day before on same day his fellow plotters decided to depose pavlov sending him to his dacha where his wife took care of him as with all others pavlov was arrested following collapse of coup shortly after pavlov was hospitalised with hypertension whilst remaining in custody he was released on bail in january 1993 and granted
