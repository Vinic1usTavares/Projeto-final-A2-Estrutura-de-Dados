been interested in contes de or contes de ma mere l oye and in 1693 published a versification of les souhaits ridicules and in 1694 a tale with a cinderella theme called peau d ane further a handwritten and illustrated manuscript of five of tales including le chat ou le chat botte existed two years before tale s 1697 paris publication pierre darmancour was sixteen or seventeen years old at time manuscript was prepared and as scholars iona and peter opie note quite unlikely to have been interested in recording fairy tales darmancour who became a soldier showed no literary inclinations and when he died in 1700 his obituary made no mention of any connection with tales however when perrault senior died in 1703 newspaper alluded to his being responsible for la belle au bois dormant

similarities to book character later appeared in adventures of puss in boots voiced by eric bauza cat food named puss n boots is owned by usa llc and is available in united states and canada commentaries jacques and henry pettit note in their introduction to authentic mother goose fairy tales and nursery rhymes that main motif of puss in boots is animal as helper and that tale carries atavistic memories of familiar totem animal as father protector of tribe found everywhere by missionaries and anthropologists they also note that title is original with perrault as are boots no tale prior to perrault s features a cat wearing boots thumb upright woodcut frontispiece copied from 1697 paris edition of perrault s tales and published in english speaking world folklorists iona and peter opie observe that tale is unusual in that hero little deserves his good fortune that is if his poverty his being a third child and his unquestioning acceptance of cat s sinful instructions are not nowadays looked upon as virtues cat should be acclaimed prince of con artists they declare as few swindlers have been so successful before or since success of histoires is attributed to seemingly contradictory and incompatible reasons while literary skill employed in telling of tales has been recognized universally it appears tales were set down in great part as author heard them told evidence for that assessment lies first in simplicity of tales then in use of words that were in perrault s era considered populaire and du bas peuple and finally in appearance of vestigial passages that now are superfluous to plot do not illuminate narrative and thus are passages opies believe a literary artist would have rejected in process of creating a work of art one such vestigial passage is puss s boots his insistence upon footwear is explained nowhere in tale it is not developed nor is it referred to after its first mention except in an aside according to opies perrault s great achievement was accepting fairy tales at their own level he recounted them with neither impatience nor mockery and without feeling that they needed any aggrandisement such as a frame story although he must have felt it useful to end with a rhyming perrault would be revered today as father of folklore if he had taken time to record where he obtained his tales when and under what circumstances bruno bettelheim remarks that more simple and straightforward a good character in a fairy tale easier it is for a child to identify with it and to reject bad other child identifies with a good hero because hero s condition makes a positive appeal to him if character is a very good person then child is likely to want to be good too amoral tales however show no polarization or juxtaposition of good and bad persons because amoral tales such as puss in boots build character not by offering choices between good and bad but by giving child hope that even can survive morality is of little concern in these tales but rather an assurance is provided that one can survive and succeed in life small children can do little on their own and may give up in disappointment and despair with their attempts fairy stories however give great dignity to smallest achievements such as befriending an animal or being befriended by an animal as in puss in boots and that such ordinary events may lead to great things fairy stories encourage children to believe and trust that their small real achievements are important although perhaps not recognized at moment thumb left upright an early nineteenth century engraving of perrault surrounded by vignettes from histoires ou contes du temps passe in fairy tales and art of subversion jack zipes notes that perrault sought to portray ideal types to reinforce standards of civilizing process set by upper class french society a composite portrait of perrault s heroines for example reveals author s idealized female of upper class society is graceful beautiful polite industrious well groomed reserved patient and even somewhat stupid because for perrault intelligence in womankind would be threatening therefore perrault s composite heroine passively waits for right man to come along recognize her virtues and make her his wife he acts she waits if his seventeenth century heroines demonstrate any characteristics it is submissiveness a composite of perrault s male heroes however indicates opposite of his heroines his male characters are not particularly handsome but they are active brave ambitious and deft and they use their wit intelligence and great civility to work their way up social ladder and to achieve their goals in this case of course it is cat who displays characteristics and man benefits from his trickery and skills unlike tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage male centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men virtues of perrault s heroes reflect upon bourgeoisie of court of louis xiv and upon nature of perrault who was a successful civil servant in france during seventeenth century according to fairy and folk tale researcher and commentator jack zipes puss is epitome of educated secretary who serves his master with complete devotion and diligence cat has enough wit and manners to impress king intelligence to defeat ogre and skill to arrange a royal marriage for his low born master puss s career is capped by his elevation to grand seigneur and tale is followed by a double moral one stresses importance of possessing industrie et savoir faire while other extols virtues of dress countenance and youth to win heart of a princess renowned illustrator of dickens novels and stories george cruikshank was shocked that parents would allow their children to read puss in boots and declared as it stood tale was a succession of successful falsehoods a clever lesson in lying a system of imposture rewarded with greatest worldly advantages another critic maria tatar notes that there is little to admire in puss he threatens flatters deceives and steals in order to promote his master she further observes that puss has been viewed as a linguistic virtuoso a creature who has mastered arts of persuasion and rhetoric to acquire power and wealth puss in boots has successfully supplanted its antecedents by straparola and basile and tale has altered shapes of many older oral trickster cat tales where they still are found morals perrault attached to tales are either at odds with narrative or beside point first moral tells reader that hard work and ingenuity are preferable to inherited wealth but moral is belied by poor miller s son who neither works nor uses his wit to gain worldly advantage but marries into it through trickery performed by cat second moral stresses womankind s vulnerability to external appearances fine clothes and a pleasant visage are enough to win their hearts in an aside tatar suggests that if tale has any redeeming meaning it has something to do with inspiring respect for those domestic creatures that hunt mice and look out for their masters briggs does assert that cats were a form of fairy in their own right having something akin to a fairy court and their own set of magical powers still it is rare in europe s fairy tales for a cat to be so closely involved with human affairs according to jacob grimm puss shares many of features that a household fairy or deity would have including a desire for boots which could represent seven league boots this may mean that story of puss and boots originally represented tale of a family deity aiding an impoverished family member stefan zweig in his 1939 novel des references puss in boots procession through a rich and varied countryside with his master and drives home his metaphor with a mention of seven league boots references notes footnotes works cited external links origin of story of puss in boots puss in boots english translation from blue fairy
