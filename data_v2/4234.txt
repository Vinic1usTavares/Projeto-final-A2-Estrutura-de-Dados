h to he who am only one is third album by british progressive rock band van der graaf generator it was released in 1970 on charisma records band recorded album in several stages throughout mid 1970 in trident studios with producer john anthony songs mentioned a killer shark in killer lost love in lost and science fiction material in pioneers over c bassist nic potter left group in august partway through recording with organist hugh banton covering on bass guitar in studio and playing bass pedals in concert king crimson s robert fripp made a guest appearance on guitar and cover was first of several by band to feature artwork of paul whitehead album did not chart in uk and contemporary reviews were mixed but it has since been regarded as a good example of progressive rock albums by critics killer has been singled out for praise as a fan favourite background group s previous album least we can do is wave to each other february 1970 had achieved a small amount of commercial success and critical acclaim in uk and europe next project group attempted was recording soundtrack to 1970 film eyewitness but it was rejected largely for being too sinister they started to develop a live following during 1970 counting film director anthony as one of their fans but things backfired after a show at royal festival hall in june that drew negative reviews from melody makers chris welch around this time band decided to write some new material for a follow up album first song to be attempted was killer which came out of a rehearsal that attempted to join fragments of songs together in a deliberate attempt to create something that would be commercially successful track was a composite of a basic song structure written by group leader peter hammill in 1968 an old song written by founding member judge smith called a cloud as big as a man s hand and a rock riff composed by organist hugh banton that he later said was influenced by move s brontosaurus lyrics referred to a shark in ocean who becomes lonely through killing everything killer quickly became a live favourite with fans and group s signature track hammill wrote emperor in his war room about a tyrant who tortures people indiscriminately but is ultimately haunted by those he has tormented music joined together two different sections a sombre opening and closing combined with a bass driven rock section in middle lost was uncharacteristically for band a straightforward song about lost love and group added several different instrumental sections into basic structure pioneers over c was co written by hammill and saxophonist david jackson song had a strong science fiction element and was about a group of astronauts who managed to travel faster than speed of light hence c in title as a result they go into a time warp experiencing a living death where time passes in a nonlinear fashion and are unable to return to earth whole band helped with arrangement coming up with musical themes to match lyrical theme of isolation and fear last track to be written for album was house with no door hammill wrote song on piano which was about someone who had difficulty forming friendships and was unable to have meaningful contact with other people song is one of several by hammill to use a house as a metaphor which would be revisited in subsequent solo work recording as with previous van der graaf generator albums band collaborated with producer john anthony at trident studios who had established a good working relationship with band however recording for h to he was sporadic and occurred intermittently between gigs throughout 1970 hammill wanted king crimson s guitarist and bandleader robert fripp to play on emperor in his war room fripp had never played as a session musician at that point but had enjoyed listening to least we can do and was persuaded to take part by anthony jackson recalled that fripp set up all of his stuff put his headphones on and started searing away fripp played guitar part twice having never heard track before and a composite of both takes appears on final recording fripp has subsequently introduced anthony as guy who gave me my first session at events fripp would collaborate again with van der graaf generator on their next album pawn hearts released following year group took a break from recording to play several festivals throughout summer of 1970 in july they played at munich and aachen festivals with deep purple pink floyd black sabbath and fairport convention in august group played a show as part of bbc radio 1 s in concert series which included killer and performed at 10th national jazz and blues festival at plumpton on 9 august immediately after show bassist nic potter quit band group quickly auditioned dave anderson roadie for brinsley schwarz who knew van der graaf generator socially but group struggled during rehearsals to form a cohesive sound as an alternative banton who had a background in classical and church organ music suggested he could simply play all bass parts on bass pedals instead purchasing a hammond organ to augment his existing farfisa anderson was retained as a roadie to further expand sound jackson started working with electric saxophones playing them through effects boxes including a wah wah banton decided to play bass guitar as well as organ for remaining studio sessions being familiar with instrument pioneers over c was recorded in sections in studio then edited together making it impossible to perform live in concert banton used an oscillator as a musical device to complement that track s lyrical theme by contrast house with no door was mostly put down live group found sessions enjoyable despite some of downbeat themes present on album and all found fun in some of esoteric sounds they were creating to promote album band went on charisma s six bob tour with genesis and lindisfarne as van der graaf generator had been signed to charisma longest they were headline act artwork cover was drawn by paul whitehead and was inspired by pioneers over c front cover was a painting he had already completed called birthday which showed a beam of light focusing on london illustrating whitehead s birth inner gatefold picture was called checkmate h to he in title refers to fusion of hydrogen nuclei to form helium nuclei a basic exothermic reaction between sun and stars first u s issue of album was on dunhill records division of abc records it featured a revised cover with a white background instead of purple mid priced charisma classics re issue from early 1980s had a blue cover a re mastered version of this album added bonus tracks and was released in 2005 one of additions is a studio version of squid octopus a song that had been a staple of early van der graaf generator concerts whitehead would go on to draw several other covers for band and for other charisma artists including genesis he became something of a house artist for label in early 1970s reception album was released in december 1970 but did not sell as much as least we can do and did not reach album charts in uk charisma hoped group could produce another single like refugees released earlier in year there was some interest in releasing killer as a single but band rejected this as they might have been pigeonholed as a hard rock band group felt there was some conflict of interest by having tony stratton smith both as manager and record company owner contemporary reviews of album were mainly positive to mixed melody maker praised brilliance of songs sounds enjoyed jackson s sax playing and record mirror thought band would be one of groups most likely to succeed in 1971 disc music echo were less favourable complaining that group s sound was distinctive but somehow mainly boring retrospective reviews have been positive in 2000 q magazine listed album as one of best progressive rock albums of all time saying texturally they were unmistakable no guitars just thick dark layers of organ and saxophone allmusic s mike degagne rated album 4 out of 5 noting that brooding tones of synthesizer and oscillator along with peter s distinct and overly ominous voice make it one of this british band s best efforts iron maiden s bruce dickinson and blur s graham coxon have both spoken favourably about album track listing personnel taken from sleeve notes van der graaf generator peter
