right thumb alt refer to caption an aac user indicates a series of numbers on an eye gaze communication board in order to convey a word augmentative and alternative communication aac encompasses communication methods used to supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in production or comprehension of spoken or written language aac is used by those with a wide range of speech and language impairments including congenital impairments such as cerebral palsy intellectual impairment and autism and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinson s disease aac can be a permanent addition to a person s communication or a temporary aid modern use of aac began in 1950s with systems for those who had lost ability to speak following surgical procedures during 1960s and 1970s spurred by an increasing commitment in west towards inclusion of disabled individuals in mainstream society and developing skills required for independence use of manual sign language and then graphic symbol communication grew greatly it was not until 1980s that aac began to emerge as a field in its own right rapid progress in technology including microcomputers and speech synthesis have paved way for communication devices with speech output and multiple options for access to communication for those with physical disabilities aac systems are diverse unaided communication uses no equipment and includes signing and body language while aided approaches use external tools aided communication methods can range from paper and pencil to communication books or boards to speech generating devices or devices producing written output symbols used in aac include gestures photographs pictures line drawings letters and words which can be used alone or in combination body parts pointers adapted mice or eye tracking can be used to select target symbols directly and switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection message generation is generally much slower than spoken communication and as a result rate enhancement techniques may be used to reduce number of selections required these techniques include prediction in which user is offered guesses of word phrase being composed and encoding in which longer messages are retrieved using a code evaluation of a user s abilities and requirements for aac will include individual s motor visual cognitive language and communication strengths and weaknesses evaluation requires input of family members particularly for early intervention respecting ethnicity and family beliefs are key to a family centered and ethnically competent approach studies show that aac use does not impede development of speech and may result in a modest increase in speech production users who have grown up with aac report satisfying relationships and life activities however they may have poor literacy and are unlikely to be in employment convention on rights of persons with disabilities defines augmentative and alternative communication as forms of communication including languages as well as display of text large print tactile communication plain language accessible multimedia and accessible information and communications technology convention on rights of persons with disabilities article 2 definitions scope augmentative and alternative communication is used by individuals to compensate for severe speech language impairments in expression or comprehension of spoken or written language asha fossett mirenda p 330 people making use of aac include individuals with a variety of congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy autism intellectual disability and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis traumatic brain injury and aphasia prevalence data vary depending on country and age disabilities surveyed but typically between 0 1 and 1 5 of population are considered to have such severe speech language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood and thus could benefit from aac beukelman mirenda pp 4 5 lindsay et al an estimated 0 05 of children and young people require high technology aac gross well known aac users include physicist stephen hawking broadcaster roger ebert and poet christopher nolan beukelman mirenda pp 6 8 ebert award winning films such as my left foot and diving bell and butterfly based on books by aac users christy brown and jean dominique respectively have brought lives of those who use aac to a wider audience lapointe walling history field was originally called augmentative communication term served to indicate that such communication systems were to supplement natural speech rather than to replace it addition of alternative followed later when it became clear that for some individuals non speech systems were their only means of communication aac users typically utilize a variety of aided and unaided communication strategies depending on communication partners and context fossett mirenda p 331 there were three relatively independent research areas in 1960s and 1970s that lead to field of augmentative and alternative communication first was work on early electromechanical communication and writing systems second was development of communication and language boards and lastly there was research on ordinary without disability child language development forms of aac unaided aac thumb alt refer to caption sign for interpreter in quebec sign language unaided aac systems are those that do not require an external tool and include facial expression vocalizations gestures and sign languages and systems mirenda beukelman mirenda p 36 informal vocalizations and gestures such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural communication and such signals may be used by those with profound disabilities beukelman mirenda pp 38 42 283 284 more formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language for example amer ind code is based on plains indian sign language and has been used with children with severe profound disabilities and adults with a variety of diagnoses including dementia aphasia and dysarthria beukelman mirenda pp 42 44 benefits of gestures and pantomime are that they are always available to user usually understood by an educated listener and are efficient means of communicating lloyd et al in contrast sign languages have a linguistic base and permit expression of an unlimited number of messages approaches to signing can be divided into two major categories those that encode an existing language and those that are languages in their own right pp 103 107 in united states of america signing exact english may be considered most widely used example of former and american sign language as a common example of latter signing is used alone or in conjunction with speech to support communication with individuals with a variety of disorders beukelman mirenda pp 43 51 specific hand shapes and movements of sign and gesture require an individual to have adequate fine motor and motor planning skills swanson sign languages require more fine motor coordination and are less transparent in meaning than gestural codes such as amer ind latter limits number of people able to understand person s communication without training daniloff daniloff vergara aided aac an aac aid is any device either electronic or non electronic that is used to transmit or receive messages such aids range from communication books to speech generating devices since skills areas of difficulty and communication needs of aac users vary greatly an equally diverse range of communication aids and devices is required gillam et al pp 356 357 low tech low tech communication aids are defined as those that do not need batteries electricity or electronics these are often very simple communication boards or books from which user selects letters words phrases pictures and or symbols to communicate a message millar scott p 4 depending on physical abilities and limitations users may indicate appropriate message with a body part light pointer eye gaze direction or a head mouth stick alternatively they may indicate yes or no while a listener scans through possible options scott pp 13 15 high tech high tech aac aids permit storage and retrieval of electronic messages with most allowing user to communicate using speech output glennen pp 62 63 such devices are known as speech generating devices or voice output communication aids schlosser blischak koul a device s speech output may be digitized and or synthesized digitized systems play recorded words or phrases and are generally more intelligible while synthesized speech uses text to speech software that can be harder to understand but that permits user to spell words and speak novel messages beukelman mirenda pp 105 106 high tech systems may be dedicated devices developed solely for aac or non dedicated devices such as computers that run additional software to allow them to function as aac devices jans clark pp 37 38 they may be static or dynamic in form static communication devices have symbols in fixed positions on paper overlays which are changed manually to increase vocabulary available some static devices have multiple levels with different words appearing on different levels beukelman mirenda p 84 on dynamic aac devices user can change symbols available using page links to navigate to appropriate pages of vocabulary and messages beukelman mirenda p 85 high tech devices vary in amount of information that they can store as well as their size weight and thus their portability glennen pp 59 60 access methods depend on abilities of user and may include use of direct selection of symbols

alt a user in a wheelchair faces a communication partner who holds a transparent piece of plastic between them plastic has letters of alphabet printed around edges a subject uses eye gaze to indicate choices on a transparent letter based communication board this is a form of direct selection technological advances have dramatically increased types of selection methods available for individuals with communication impairments in direct selection selection is made by pointing to desired symbol using a finger or an alternative pointer such as eye gaze a head stick head or eye controlled mouse to accommodate motor control difficulties some users use alternative activation strategies for example in timed activation user maintains selection of symbol for a predetermined period of time until it is recognized by system with release activation selection of item is only made when person releases contact from display beukelman mirenda pp 96 97 direct activation of an aac system is generally first choice of access method as it is faster and cognitively easier beukelman mirenda pp 102 103 those unable to do so may use indirect selection or scanning in this method items displayed for selection are scanned scanning may be visual using indicators such as lights highlighting and or contrasting borders or auditory using spoken prompts from a communication partner or device when desired message is reached aac user indicates choice using an alternative selection technique such as a switch vocalization or gesture beukelman mirenda pp 97 101 glennen p 73 several different patterns for switch access scanning are available in circular scanning items are displayed in a circle and then scanned one at a time it is often introduced first to children or beginning aac users because it is easiest to understand in linear scanning items are organized in rows and are scanned one at a time until a choice is made although more demanding than circular scanning it is still easy to learn finally in group item scanning items are grouped and groups scanned consecutively once a particular group is selected items within group are scanned one of most common group item strategies is row column scanning in which each row forms a group rows of items are scanned and when a row is selected items in row are scanned one at a time until a message is selected there are three main selection control techniques in scanning in automatic scanning scan proceeds at a pre determined speed and pattern until user selects an item in inverse scanning switch is held down to advance scan and released to choose desired iem in step scanning aac user activates one switch to move indicator through items and another switch to select item vocabulary organization vocabulary organization refers to way pictures words phrases and sentences are displayed on communication system blackstone 1993 in general goal is to facilitate efficient and effective communication especially when

of organizing and presenting symbols these are depictions of events people objects and related actions in a picture photograph or virtual environment representing a situation place or specific experience beukelman mirenda pp 338 339 blackstone 2004 they are similar to activity displays in that they contain vocabulary that is associated with specific activities or routines for example a photo of a child s room may be included in child s aac system objects and events within photograph are then used as symbols for communication research suggests that visual scene displays are easier than grid displays for young children or those with cognitive impairments to learn and use higginbotham et al drager et al 2004 rate enhancement strategies augmentative and alternative communication is typically much slower than speech university of washington 2009 with users generally producing 8 10 words per minute rate enhancement strategies can increase user s rate of output to around 12 15 words per minute and as a result enhance efficiency of communication there are two main options for increasing rate of communication encoding and prediction encoding is a technique permitting an aac user to produce an entire word sentence or phrase using only one or two activations of their aac system in numeric alpha numeric and letter encoding also known as abbreviation expansion words and sentences are coded as sequences of letters and numbers for example typing hh may retrieve hello how are you in iconic encoding strategies such as semantic compaction icons picture symbols are combined in a sequence to produce words or phrases prediction is a rate enhancement strategy in which device attempts to predict letter word or phrase being written by user user can then select correct prediction without needing to write full word word prediction software may determine words predicted based on their frequency in language association with other words past choices of user or grammatical suitability assessment and system implementation an evaluation of an individual s abilities limitations and communication needs is necessary to select appropriate aac techniques purpose of assessment is to identify potential aac approaches that can bridge discrepancies between a potential user s current communication and their present and future communication needs fossett mirenda pp 331 332 aac evaluations are often conducted by specialized teams which may include a speech language pathologist occupational therapist rehabilitation engineer physiotherapist social worker and a physician beukelman mirenda pp 118 125 mineo users family members and teachers are also key members of decision making team parette et al 2000 sensitivity to and respect of cultural diversity

groups presence of an aac device increases visibility of disability and is thus viewed as parette a user s motor abilities communication skills and needs cognition and vision are assessed in order to determine most appropriate match to a communication system depending on individual s physical status recommendations of an alternative access method a change in seating positioning a mounting system and or communication aid adaptations may be needed for example someone with spastic arm movements may require a key guard on top of keyboard or touchscreen to reduce selection of non target items person s needs and abilities determine symbols chosen and their organization with goal being that communication system can be used as efficiently as possible in different contexts with different communication partners and for different social purposes researcher janice light identified four social purposes of communicative interaction in aac expression of needs and wants to a listener transfer of information as in more general conversation development of social closeness through such things as jokes and cheering and finally social etiquette practices such as please and thank you these four purposes vary in terms of relative importance of content rate duration and focus of interaction it is important that aac systems selected also reflect priorities of individual and their family beukelman mirenda pp 8 10 light 1988 in western cultures professionals may see a communication device as helping to promote an individual s self determination i e ability to make one s own decisions and choices turnbull however cultural and religious factors may affect degree to which individual autonomy is a valued construct wehmeyer palmer beukelman mirenda pp 151 52 and influence family attitudes towards aac training can help user make use of their aac system to communicate effectively with others to control their environment through communication and to make choices decisions and mistakes beukelman mirenda pp 227 231 skilled users of aac show communicative competence in four interrelated areas linguistic operational social and strategic light mcnaughton 2014 linguistic competence refers to language skills in person s native language as well as linguistic code of symbol system selected operational competence involves skills in use and maintenance of tool of communication while social competence and strategic competence reflect knowledge and judgment in communicative interactions including compensations required for a slow speaking rate communication breakdowns and those unfamiliar with aac an aac user may require specific device programming and or training to achieve competency in these areas beukelman mirenda pp 10 14 light 1989 communication partners may also require training to notice and consistently interpret communication signals of a severely disabled individual particularly because there is a danger that learned helplessness can be result of repeated failure to communicate successfully beukelman mirenda p 187 parties may need assistance to avoid directive communication style that can lead a child user of aac not to develop a full range of communication skills such as initiating or taking lead in conversation using complex syntax asking questions making commands or adding new information pennington clarke wilkinson young aac users benefit from rich language and literacy experiences to foster vocabulary development discourse skills and phonological awareness all of which supports successful literacy learning communication partners are encouraged to provide augmented input with child such as signing or pointing to symbols and codes as they communicate including using individual s communication system themselves they also benefit from focussed and explicit reading instruction fallon et al 2004 blischak outcomes speech several reviews have found that use of aac does not impede development of speech in individuals with autism or developmental disabilities and in fact may result in modest gains being observed schlosser wendt millar et al a 2006 research review of 23 aac intervention studies found gains in speech production in 89 of cases studied with remainder showing no change a descriptive review looking specifically at picture exchange communication system pecs intervention studies found that several studies reported an increase in speech often during later phases while one noted little or no effect preston 2009 researchers hypothesize that using an aac device relieves pressure of having to speak allowing individual to focus on communication and that reduction in psychological stress makes speech production easier schlosser lloyd others speculate that in case of speech generating devices model of spoken output leads to an increase in speech production cress marvin language and literacy language and literacy have far reaching effects as they facilitate self expression and social interaction in a variety of settings koppenhaver et al furthermore literacy fosters independence by providing access to educational and vocational opportunities children whose disabilities require aac often experience developmental delays in language skills such as vocabulary knowledge length of sentences syntax and impaired pragmatic skills these delays may be due in part to fact that expressive language is limited by more than children s own language knowledge unlike speaking children children who use aac do not always have access to their aac system and don t select content available on device these external characteristics may impact language learning opportunities sutton soto 2002 most children in this category do not achieve literacy skills beyond that of a typically developing 7 8 year old sturm et al 2006 cognitive language and learning delays contribute to difficulty with literacy development sturm clendon but environmental factors also play a role most literate aac users often report having access to abundant reading and writing material at home as well as in school during childhood koppenhaver et al studies have shown that many children who use aac have literacy experiences that are reduced quality quantity and opportunity at home and at school as compared to children without disabilities light mcnaughton erickson koppenhaver yoder research suggests that with explicit reading instruction aac users can develop good literacy skills employment according to a 1997 u s census bureau report less than 10 of severely disabled individuals were employed despite various barriers to employment some aac users achieve success in educational endeavours and employment though often in lower paying jobs hamm mirenda mank et al factors that have been found to be related to employment are a strong work ethic and access to aac technology support of family and friends education and work skills mcnaughton et al individuals with

partner assisted scanning may be used in which aac user signals when desired letter is named by a communication partner when vertical and horizontal eye movements are functional a transparent alphabet board may be used in which aac user looks at desired letter and this is acknowledged by communication partner individuals with locked in syndrome have difficulty using high tech devices due to issues with motor control vision memory alertness and linguistic ability in particular a voluntary reliable and easily controlled muscle movement is necessary to access such a device such as head jaw hand or

with intellectual impairment were not provided with aac support because it was believed that they did not possess prerequisite skills for aac wilkinson hennig main systems used were manual signs communication boards and morse code though in early 1960s an electric communication device in form of a sip and puff typewriter controller named patient operated selector mechanism posm or possum was developed in united kingdom from 1960s onward sign language increased in acceptance and use in deaf community and aac also came to be viewed as acceptable for those with other diagnoses manual sign languages such as were advocated for those with both hearing and cognitive impairments and later for those with intellectual impairment or autism with normal hearing research into whether primates could learn to sign or use graphic symbols spurred further interest use of aac with those with cognitive impairments mirenda pp 5 9 use of amer ind hand signals opened field to aac techniques specifically for adult users were first used in canada in 1971 to provide communication to those not able to use traditional orthography their use quickly spread to other countries with improved technology keyboard communication devices developed in denmark netherlands and us increased in portability typed messages were displayed on a screen or strip of paper by end of 1970s communication devices were being commercially produced and a few such as had voice output countries such as sweden canada and united kingdom initiated government funded services for those with severe communication impairments including developing centres of clinical and research expertise late 1970s and 1980s saw a massive increase of aac related research publications and training as well first national and international conferences international society for alternative and augmentative communication isaac was founded in 1983 its members included clinicians teachers rehabilitation engineers researchers and aac users themselves organization has since played an important role in developing field through its peer reviewed journal conferences national chapters and its focus on aac in developing countries aac became an area of professional specialization a 1981 american speech language hearing association position paper for example recognized aac as a field of practice for speech language pathologists glennen p 10 at same time aac users and family members played an increasing prominent role in development of knowledge of aac through their writing and presentations by serving on committees and founding advocacy organizations from 1980s improvements in technology led to a greatly increased number variety and performance of commercially available communication devices and a reduction in their size and price alternative methods of access such eye pointing or scanning became available on communication devices speech output possibilities included digitized and synthesized speech with text to speech options available in german french italian spanish swedish and ewe aac services became more holistic seeking to develop a balance of aided and unaided strategies with goal of improving functioning in person s daily life and greater involvement of family increasingly individuals with acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinson s disease head injury and locked in syndrome received aac services in addition with challenge to notion of aac prerequisites those with severe to profound intellectual impairments began to be served courses on aac were developed for professional training programs and literature such as textbooks and guides were written to support students clinicians and parents 1990s brought a focus on greater independence for people with disabilities and more inclusion in mainstream society in schools students with special needs were placed in regular classrooms rather than segregated settings which led to an increased use of aac as a means of improving student participation in class interventions became more collaborative and naturalistic taking place in classroom with teacher rather than in a therapy room facilitated communication a method by which a facilitator guides arm of a person with severe communication needs as they type on a keyboard or letter board received wide attention in media and in field however it has been demonstrated that facilitator rather than disabled person is source of messages generated in this way consequently professional organizations and researchers and clinicians have rejected method as a pseudoscience rapid progress in hardware and software development continued including projects funded by european community first commercially available dynamic screen speech generating devices were developed in 1990s at same time synthesized speech was becoming available in more languages software programs were developed that allowed computer based production of communication boards high tech devices have continued to reduce in size and weight while increasing accessibility and capacities modern communication devices can also enable users to access internet and some can be used as environmental control devices for independent access of tv radio telephone etc robitaille pp 151 153 future directions for aac focus on improving device interfaces reducing cognitive and linguistic demands of aac and barriers to effective social interaction aac researchers have challenged manufacturers to develop communication devices that are more appealing aesthetically with greater options for leisure and play and that are easier to use light drager rapid advances in smartphone and tablet computer technologies has potential to radically change availability of economical accessible flexible communication devices mcnaughton light 2013 however user interfaces are needed that meet various physical and cognitive challenges of aac users jacobs android and other open source operating systems provide opportunities for small communities such as aac to develop accessibility features and software required other promising areas of development include access of communication devices using signals from movement recognition technologies that interpret body motions or electrodes measuring brain activity and automatic transcription of speech using speech recognition systems utterance based systems in which frequent utterances are organized in sets to improve speed of communication exchange are also in development similarly research has focussed on provision of timely access to vocabulary and conversation appropriate for specific interactions natural language generation techniques have been investigated newell p 67 black et al including use of logs of past conversations with conversational partners ashraf et al data from a user s schedule and from real time internet vocabulary searches luo et al as well as information about location from global positioning systems and other sensors patel radhakrishnan however despite frequent focus on technological advances in aac practitioners are urged to retain focus on communication needs of aac users future for aac will not be driven by advances in technology but rather by how well we can take advantage of those advancements for enhancement of communicative opportunities for individuals who have complex communication needs
