siege of malta also known as siege of valletta or french blockade was a two year siege and blockade of french garrison in valletta and three cities largest settlements and main port on mediterranean island of malta between 1798 and 1800 malta had been captured by a french expeditionary force during mediterranean campaign of 1798 and garrisoned with 3 000 men under command of claude henri belgrand de vaubois after british royal navy destroyed french mediterranean fleet at battle of nile on 1 august 1798 british were able to initiate a blockade of malta assisted by an uprising among native maltese population against french rule after its retreat to valletta french garrison faced severe food shortages exacerbated by effectiveness of british blockade although small quantities of supplies arrived in early 1799 there was no further traffic until early 1800 by which time starvation and disease was having a disastrous effect on health morale and combat capability of french troops in february 1800 a significant convoy under contre admiral jean baptiste perree sent from toulon made a determined effort to resupply garrison blockade squadron under rear admiral lord nelson intercepted convoy within sight of starving troops on malta perree was killed and his flagship captured in ensuing but brief battle of malta convoy 1800 following month ship of line guillaume tell set sail from valletta to toulon laden with soldiers but this too was intercepted and in a hard fought battle was forced to surrender to a larger british squadron these defeats rendered french position on valletta untenable and its surrender inevitable although vaubois held out for another five months he eventually surrendered on 4 september and malta was retained by britain french invasion of malta thumb napoleon landing in malta june 1798 on 19 may 1798 a french fleet sailed from toulon escorting an expeditionary force of over 30 000 men under general napoleon bonaparte force was destined for egypt bonaparte seeking to expand french influence in asia and force britain to make peace in french revolutionary wars which had begun in 1792 cole p 13 sailing southeast convoy collected additional transports from italian ports and at 05 30 on 9 june arrived off valletta heavily fortified port city on island of malta james vol 2 p 151 at this time malta and its neighbouring islands were ruled by knights of st john an old and influential feudal order weakened by loss of most of their revenue during french revolution order was composed of men from across europe including a significant proportion of frenchmen who ruled over majority maltese population of islands cole p 10 head of government was grand master ferdinand von hompesch zu bolheim who refused bonaparte s demand that his entire convoy be allowed to enter valletta and take on supplies insisting that malta s neutrality meant that only two ships could enter at a time cole p 8 thumb capitulation of malta to general bonaparte on receiving this reply bonaparte immediately ordered his fleet to bombard valletta and on 11 june general louis baraguey d hilliers directed an amphibious operation in which several thousand soldiers landed at seven strategic sites around island french knights deserted order and remaining knights failed to mount a meaningful resistance approximately 2 000 native maltese militia resisted for 24 hours retreating to valletta once city of mdina fell to general claude henri belgrand de vaubois cole p 9 although valletta was strong enough to hold out against a lengthy siege bonaparte negotiated a surrender with hompesch who agreed to turn malta and all of its resources over to french in exchange for estates and pensions in france for himself and his knights gardiner p 21 bonaparte then established a french garrison on islands leaving 4 000 men under vaubois while he and rest of expeditionary force sailed eastwards for alexandria on 19 june adkins p 13 battle of nile bonaparte s convoy was pursued across mediterranean by a british fleet of 14 ships under rear admiral sir horatio nelson who learned of invasion of malta while anchored off sicily and subsequently attempted to intercept french on their passage to egypt nelson s force overtook french fleet on night of 22 june in dark without discovering their presence and arrived off alexandria on 28 june ahead of bonaparte mostert p 254 believing that french must have had a different objective nelson turned northwards following day to investigate coast of anatolia and missed bonaparte s arrival on 30 june by less than 24 hours bradford p 187 unopposed bonaparte landed his army and marched on alexandria capturing city and turning inland fleet was ordered to anchor in nearby aboukir bay and await further instructions james vol 2 p 159 on 1 august nelson returned to egyptian coast and discovered french fleet at anchor attacking immediately nelson s ships managed to capture nine french ships of line and destroy two including flagship orient with only moderate damage to themselves mostert p 272 destruction of french mediterranean fleet granted control of sea to royal navy soon joined by navies of portugal naples russian empire and ottoman empire as part of hastily organised second coalition against france gardiner p 58 maltese uprising thumb canon francesco saverio caruana one of maltese insurgent leaders he later became bishop of malta on malta french had rapidly dismantled institutions of knights of st john including roman catholic church church property was looted and seized to pay for expedition to egypt an act that generated considerable anger among deeply religious maltese population on 2 september this anger erupted in a popular uprising during an auction of church property and within days thousands of maltese irregulars had driven french garrison into valletta gardiner p 67 valletta was surrounded by approximately 10 000 irregular maltese soldiers led by vitale and canon francesco saverio caruana maltese were armed with 23 cannon and a small squadron of coastal gunboats although there was intermittent skirmishing between garrison and maltese fortress was too strong for irregulars to assault in mid september a squadron of portuguese ships had arrived at island they included principe real 90 cannons captain de portugal 74 captain thomas stone sao sebastiao 74 captain mitchell afonso de albuquerque 74 captain donald campbell and brig falcao 24 captain duncan all were under command of domingos xavier de lima marquess of niza in addition british ship captain manley dixon and fireship captain george baker were attached to squadron portuguese government had sent this force from tagus to augment nelson s fleet after a brief stay off malta squadron continued to alexandria there nelson sent squadron back to blockade malta clowes p 376 late in september a british convoy consisting of 13 battered ships under captain sir james saumarez appeared off island survivors of battle of nile they were in urgent need of repair and unable to directly assist in siege james vol 2 p 188 nevertheless saumarez met with representatives of maltese and on 25 september sent an offer of truce to vaubois on their behalf vaubois replied vous sans doute que des francais sont dans la place le sort des sic ne vous regarde pointe quant a votre les soldats francais ne sont point habitues a ce style you might have forgotten that french hold this place fate of inhabitants is none of your concern as for your ultimatum french soldiers are not accustomed to such a tone unable to persuade french to give in saumarez instead provided maltese forces with 1 200 muskets with which to continue siege clowes p 374 saumarez unable to delay repairs any longer sailed for gibraltar at end of month on 12 october british ships of line hms alexander under captain alexander ball hms culloden under captain thomas troubridge and hms colossus under captain george murray joined niza s ships off malta marking formal start of blockade james vol 2 p 189 on same day vaubois withdrew last of his soldiers into fortified new city of valletta accompanied by approximately 100 maltese nationals who had joined french forces garrison numbered over 3 000 men and initially at least was well supplied in harbour lay ships of line dego and athenien and frigate all of which were former ships of maltese navy as well as newly arrived guillaume tell and frigates justice and diane survivors of battle of nile under rear admiral pierre charles villeneuve which had reached malta at end of september capture of gozo on 24 october after a ten day passage from naples bradford p 222 nelson joined blockade squadron in hms vanguard accompanied by hms minotaur on 28 october ball successfully completed negotiations with french garrison on small island of gozo 217 french soldiers there agreeing to surrender without a fight and transferring island its fortifications 24 cannon a large quantity of ammunition and 3 200 sacks of flour to british although island was formally claimed by king ferdinand of naples it was administered by british and maltese representatives whose first action was to distribute captured food supplies to island s 16 000 inhabitants malta and surrounding islands were not self sufficient and quickly challenge of feeding population became a strain on islands resources particularly with so many men under arms although now formally in command of islands king ferdinand refused to assist with supplies and responsibility was left to ball and his captains to arrange for transport of supplies from italy by end of year number of maltese troops in field had fallen from 10 000 to 1 500 supported by 500 british and portuguese marines from blockade squadron blockade fleet consisting of five british and four portuguese ships operated from st paul s bay and marsa sirocco now marsaxlokk on island of malta itself blockade thumb casa leoni command base for maltese insurgents thumb map of tal borg battery one of batteries built by maltese to bombard french positions and repel any counterattack 1799 was a frustrating year for british and maltese forces deployed against malta as efforts to secure sufficient forces to prosecute siege were repeatedly denied major general james st clair erskine commander of british army forces in mediterranean considered ongoing war of second coalition in italy and defence of menorca to be higher priorities than ball s siege while defeated neapolitans continued to refuse assistance a russian squadron under admiral fyodor fyodorovich briefly appeared off island in january but was almost immediately ordered to join russian and turkish forces besieging island of corfu gardiner p 68 in addition to difficulties allies faced in obtaining food for maltese population french succeeded in bringing supplies through blockade in early part of year in january 1799 a schooner reached valletta from ancona and in february frigate boudeuse evaded blockade and entered port with supplies from toulon in may a major french expedition under admiral etienne eustache bruix entered western mediterranean forcing nelson to recall his scattered fleet from across region temporarily raising blockade of malta clowes p 390 during this operation a number of french supply ships took advantage of absence of british squadron to enter valletta however despite these occasional supply ships french garrison was rapidly running out of food to conserve resources french forced civilian population out of city civilian population dropped from 45 000 in 1799 to 9 000 by 1800 nelson himself took nominal command of blockade while ball was made president of maltese national congress as liaison between maltese military and civilian commanders he directed distribution of supplies to maltese population which was beginning to suffer from disease brought about by food shortages he was replaced on alexander by his first lieutenant william harrington on 1 november nelson again offered terms of surrender to vaubois and was again rebuffed with reply jaloux de l estime de votre nation comme vous celle de la notre nous cette jusqu a l keen to deserve esteem your nation as you seek that of ours we are resolved to defend this fortress until end by this point nelson was conducting blockade at a distance based at neapolitan court in palermo there he indulged in gambling and social engagements becoming closer and closer to emma lady hamilton wife of ambassador sir william hamilton his behaviour was heavily criticised not just by his commanding officer vice admiral lord keith who had recently replaced earl st vincent but also by old friends such as thomas troubridge who wrote to him if you knew what your friends feel for you i am sure you would cut out all nocturnal parties i beseech your lordship leave off mostert p 365 in december 1799 erskine was replaced by lieutenant general henry edward fox who immediately redistributed 800 troops from garrison at messina to malta under brigadier general thomas graham these troops filled gap left by withdrawal of portuguese forces which had been ordered to return to lisbon disease began to spread within city as rations became scarcer arrival of an aviso in january 1800 with news of events of 18 brumaire that made bonaparte first consul of france prompted a brief respite and a public statement from vaubois that city would never be surrendered although conditions continued to deteriorate starvation and relief convoy battles at beginning of february 1800 neapolitan government reinstated in naples after being expelled year before finally agreed to participate in siege and 1 200 troops were embarked on a squadron led by vice admiral lord keith s flagship hms queen charlotte and landed on malta james vol 3 p 14 for a time both keith and nelson remained with blockade squadron which consisted of six ships of line along with a few neapolitan ships of line and several british and neapolitan frigates on 17 february a message arrived with squadron from frigate hms success which had been stationed off sicily to watch for french reinforcements captain shuldham peard reported that he was shadowing a squadron of six or seven french ships sailing in direction of malta bradford p 245 these vessels were a relief squadron sent from toulon with extensive food supplies and 3 000 additional troops under contre admiral jean baptiste perree in genereux one of ships of line that had escaped at nile two years earlier clowes p 419 on 18 february convoy was sighted by lookouts on alexander in ensuing chase success captured a french transport and attacked much larger genereux woodman p 141 although frigate was damaged in exchange success second broadside mortally wounded perree and delayed ship of line long enough for hms foudroyant under lord nelson and hms northumberland to join battle heavily outnumbered genereux surrendered bradford p 247 thumb capture of guillaume tell shortly after capture of genereux keith returned to italian coast in queen charlotte where his flagship was lost in a fire that killed more than 700 of its crew although keith was ashore at time grocott p 92 before departing keith issued strict instructions to nelson that he was not to return to palermo but was to confine any shore leave in sicily to syracuse nelson ignored order and by late march was in palermo conducting an open love affair with emma hamilton mostert p 366 in his absence troubridge took over command of blockade delegating temporarily to captain manley dixon dixon led squadron on 31 march when guillaume tell attempted to break out on valletta under decres spotted by frigate hms penelope under captain henry blackwood guillaume tell was chased northwards and engaged by first penelope and then by dixon s hms lion driving both ships back but suffering severe damage clowes p 421 eventually arrival of powerful foudroyant under captain sir edward berry proved too much for decres but he continued fighting for another two hours before he was forced to surrender his battered and dismasted ship in engagement he lost more than 200 men killed and wounded nelson s cruise in aftermath of these defeats at sea and with food supply in valletta dwindling british sent another demand for capitulation vaubois again refused with reply cette place est en trop bon etat et je suis moi meme trop jaloux de bien servir men de conserver mon honneur por vos propositions this place is in too good a situation and i am too conscious of service of my country and my honour to listen to your proposals in reality situation was dire during february prices of basic foodstuffs stood at 16 francs for a fowl 12 francs for a rabbit 20 sous for an egg 18 sous for a lettuce 40 sous for a rat and six francs per pound for fish for civilian typhus patients only food available was a horse flesh soup james vol 3 p 16 on 23 april nelson departed palermo in foudroyant with both sir william and emma hamilton on board as his guests party visited syracuse and then travelled on to valletta where berry took foudroyant so close to harbour that ship came under fire from french batteries no hits were scored but nelson was furious that emma had been taken into danger and immediately ordered berry to withdraw his anger was exacerbated by emma s refusal to retire from quarterdeck during brief exchange bradford p 249 from there foudroyant anchored at marsa sirocco where nelson and emma lived together openly and were hosted by troubridge and graham sir william hamilton a prominent antiquarian as well as a diplomat spent his time exploring island bradford p 250 by early june nelson and his party had returned to palermo beginning of a lengthy overland journey across europe to britain nelson also detached foudroyant and alexander from blockade again in defiance of keith s explicit orders to assist neapolitan royal family in their passage to livorno mostert p 374 enraged at nelson s disobedience keith publicly remarked that lady hamilton has had command of fleet long enough bradford p 251 in may troubridge returned to britain and was replaced in command by captain george martin while graham was superseded by major general henry pigot james vol 3 p 21 surrender british blockade continued to prevent french efforts to resupply valletta during early summer of 1800 and by august situation was desperate no horses or pack animals dogs cats fowls or rabbits still lived within city cisterns had been emptied and even firewood was in short supply so desperate was need for wood that frigate boudeuse trapped by blockade was broken up for fuel by beleaguered garrison with defeat now inevitable vaubois gave orders that frigates diane and justice were to attempt a breakout for toulon frigates given minimal crews of approximately 115 men each james vol 3 p 20 on 24 august when wind was favourable and night dark enough to obscure their movements frigates put to sea almost immediately lookouts on hms success sighted them and captain peard gave chase followed by hms genereux and northumberland diane under captain solen was too slow and peard soon overhauled under strength french ship which surrendered after a brief exchange of shot frigate later became hms niobe justice under captain jean villeneuve was faster however and outran its pursuers eventually making toulon only ship from malta to do so during siege woodman p 143 on 3 september with his men dying of starvation and disease at rate of more than 100 a day vaubois called a council of his officers at which they unanimously decided to surrender clowes p 422 next day envoys were sent to british and in afternoon general pigot and captain martin signed agreed terms with vaubois and villeneuve maltese were excluded from negotiations entirely although their commander alexander ball subsequently became first civil commissioner of malta terms of surrender were absolute island its dependencies fortifications and military supplies were all turned over to british control this included ships of line athenien and dego and frigate these were all french ships previously captured from order although only athenien was of sufficient standard to be incorporated into royal navy becoming hms athenienne other ships were broken up in their berths british also took two merchant ships and a variety of smaller warships clowes p 423 aftermath capture of malta returned control of central mediterranean to britain and was an important step in invasion and liberation of egypt from french rule in 1801 gardiner p 78 an essential condition of treaty of amiens in same year which brought an end to french revolutionary war was that british leave malta russian tsar alexander i had a long standing claim to island as titular head of knights of st john and demanded that it be turned over to russian control before agreeing any alliance with britain prime minister william pitt younger flatly refused mostert p 461 and napoleonic wars with france began soon afterwards in part due to failure of britain to comply with this clause of treaty island would remain in british hands until its independence in 1964 gardiner p 70 commemoration french surrender is one of three sieges that is celebrated on il victory day held
