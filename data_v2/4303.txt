award system of british indian army was expanded based on british practice for recognising actions of gallantry senior officers would be awarded distinguished service order junior officers military cross and enlisted men with military medal this system continued through second world war post independence british honours and awards system in india informally came to an end a short time later prime minister of india jawaharlal nehru decided to give gallantry awards for ongoing conflict in jammu and kashmir although india and pakistan still had option to award british honours leaders felt that it would not make sense to give same honour to personnel from opposing forces accordingly in june 1948 it was decided to institute new indian awards for gallantry param vir chakra pvc maha vir chakra mvc and vir chakra vrc after pvc mvc and vrc are second and third highest gallantry awards during wartime nehru entrusted implementation of pvc to major general hira lal atal first indian adjutant general of india he in turn requested savitri khanolkar wife of an indian army officer vikram khanolkar of sikh regiment to design medal for pvc coincidentally first pvc would be awarded to major somnath sharma brother in law of khanolkar s daughter despite gaining independence from british rule india still remained a dominion of united kingdom this meant that governor general of india could not approve establishment of awards without assent from british crown therefore a draft of royal warrant was sent to london for approval by king george vi however by mid 1948 it became clear that king s ratification would not be forthcoming for some time as author ian cardozo suggests how could king sanction awards for a war between two members of commonwealth also king would have not even have been a symbolic presence on awards therefore draft warrants to formally establish new gallantry awards were not put into effect on 1january 1949 a ceasefire was implemented in jammu and kashmir and as it was becoming too late to honour acts of heroism from 1947 1948 indo pakistani war nehru forwarded draft warrants to governor general chakravarti rajagopalachari to institute awards as your own but rajagopalachari felt that as india was still a dominion it would be inappropriate for him to establish awards without king s approval he instead suggested to nehru that as india was to become a republic on 26january 1950 it would be appropriate to announce establishment of awards on that date but with retroactive effect from 15august 1947 on 26january 1950 now celebrated as republic
