was inspired to develop plot for red sea sharks after reading a magazine article detailing continued existence of slave trade within arab world in which it was claimed that african pilgrims headed to mecca were being enslaved during journey herge included a reference to this slave trade in story s original french title coke en stock coke on board which referred to slave smuggler s use of coke as a codeword for enslaved people thumb left treasury al khazneh in petra depicted in book prior to writing story herge had read balzac et son monde balzac and his world a 1955 book written by his friend felicien marceau intrigued by work of honore de balzac herge was inspired by way in which balzac kept reusing characters from his previous stories and he subsequently adopted this trait for red sea sharks in which a wide range of characters from adventures of tintin make a reappearance herge also introduced a new character estonian pilot piotr skut who would later reappear in flight 714 to sydney to produce accurate illustrations for ramona herge and his assistant bob de moor traveled aboard a swedish cargo vessel ms reine astrid from antwerp to gothenburg and back during which they took photographs and drew sketches herge had also collected press clippings depicting christina a motor yacht owned by greek shipping magnate aristotle onassis and used them as basis for his depiction of rastapopoulos ship aircraft cars and machinery that appear in story were drawn by roger one of members of studios herge in one scene in latter part of story herge included a frogman whose depiction was drawn from a press clipping of lionel crabb his depiction of emir s hideaway palace cut from rock was based on al khazneh in petra jordan which he had seen in an issue of national geographic herge s growing interest in art was reflected in story as he included a copy of alfred sisley s le canal du loing at marlinspike hall he also included paintings by pablo picasso and joan miro aboard scheherazade muller s pseudonym in story mull pasha was based upon british soldier glubb pasha in final scene herge included cameos of both himself and his friend and colleague edgar p jacobs story began serialisation in belgium s tintin magazine in october 1956 before being serialised in french edition of magazine from december 1956 it was then published in book form by casterman in 1958 upon story s british publication in 1960 coke en stock was renamed red sea sharks racism allegations and alterations herge had been accused of exhibiting a racist attitude toward africans in an earlier story tintin in congo and potentially hoped to exonerate himself from such criticism by depicting tintin and haddock freeing african slaves in red sea sharks in preparing latter story he had consulted a colleague who worked for an african themed magazine l afrique et le monde africa and world they translated some of passages that herge wished to include in story into yoruba however in january 1962 an article in magazine jeune afrique criticised herge for a racist depiction of africans in story an accusation that would be echoed in other publications these claims focused on african characters simplistic use of pidgin language which was similar to speech patterns used in tintin in congo african you speak well effendi wicked arab very wicked poor black men not want to be slaves poor black men want to go to mecca haddock naturally i realise that but i repeat if you go there you ll be sold as slaves is that what you want african we not slaves effendi we good muslims we want to go to mecca herge biographer benoit peeters expressed view that for most part these attacks were extremely unfair herge was emotionally affected by accusations and made changes to book for its 1967 reprint accordingly here he changed africans speech patterns giving them improved grammar however he left haddock speaking pidgin in response to africans for this version he also made changes to emir s letter to tintin former version had been formal in its prose stating most esteemed and well beloved friend i entrust to you my son abdullah to improve his english here situation is serious should any misfortune befall me i count on you my friend to care for abdullah in herge s revised edition he adopts a more florid prose style this is to tell you oh highly esteemed friend that i entrust to you abdullah my adored son because here situation is serious should misfortune descend on me like hawk on an innocent gazelle for world is made of life and death i am sure that abdullah will find you with warmth and affection refuge and peace and in doing this you will be performing a fragrant act before allah herge also expressed regret that he depicted death of a shark in story later stating that i still believed that sharks were big evil beasts when writing red sea sharks critical analysis commenting on inclusion of a wide range of characters from adventures of tintin harry thompson referred to story as a tintin family reunion commenting that it was a story unusually full of type of people captain haddock liked to avoid michael farr believed that in reviving so many older characters herge had given red sea sharks a marked retrospective quality jean marc lofficier and randy lofficier thought that story was too crowded leaving little room for series regulars professor calculus or thomson and thompson and leaving introduced figure of skut as a nice supporting character but nothing more lofficiers stated that herge was doing some house cleaning of his past works and characters before embarking on something more serious and with more personal resonance tintin in tibet herge biographer benoit peeters described red sea sharks as a complex ambiguous even labyrinthine story which was undoubtedly book in which herge ventured furthest into creation of his own universe he thought that herge enters a new phase with red sea sharks as its author seems to know his family of characters better and better and he enjoys playing with them and his readers peeters noted that book was in some respects a continuation of land of black gold an assessment shared by thompson lofficiers and farr all of whom described it as a partial sequel to earlier book thompson added that red sea sharks atoned for relative failure of land of black gold believing that although it had a rather hasty finish it was a first rate thriller lofficiers awarded it four out of five stating that it was very effective as a modern political thriller and far more believable than calculus affair they also opined that it provided an effective political commentary on west s relationship with arab world in their analysis tintin and haddock seek to aid emir not because he is a good leader but for their own selfish purposes to get abdullah out of marlinspike just as western governments and corporations build alliances with arab leaders guilty of human rights abuses in order to benefit their own interests thompson felt that inclusion of slavery as a key theme led to this book being one of herge s more adult oriented adventures nevertheless farr noted that story contained a good measure of humour to balance out these darker elements farr drew comparisons with anthony powell s a dance to music of time a series of novels that was contemporary to red sea sharks and which was similarly inspired by balzac s human comedy herge biographer pierre assouline believed that red sea sharks represented culmination of his golden age which had begun with blue lotus he also commented that it almost seemed as if herge had regained pace and rhythm of his most creative period with this story in his psychoanalytical study of adventures of tintin literary critic jean marie apostolides expressed view that red sea sharks reflected a world in which traditional values have been degraded and everything including human life has become a commodity he added that rastapopoulos becomes embodiment of global market in this story tying together all of other characters and therefore replacing tintin as figure at centre of universe apostolides opined that red sea sharks amplifies theme of general equivalence of everything that is present in series serving as a kind of retrospective by introducing old characters and establishing new relationships between them he believed that theme of mirage pervaded story appearing repeatedly in such forms as abdullah s cuckoo clock which concealed a water and pseudonyms employed by various characters throughout narrative literary critic tom mccarthy stated that red sea sharks exhibited a number of themes that recurred throughout adventures of tintin he believed that a scene in which one of bab el ehr s men spies on emir in his mountain hideaway reflected a wider theme of eavesdropping that features throughout series mccarthy also highlighted tintin s actions in returning abdullah to khemed expressing view that it is part of a wider running theme throughout series in which hero takes an abandoned children to their home other instances included tintin s discovery of an adoptive family for orphan chang chong chen in blue lotus and delivery of lost gypsy child to her family in castafiore emerald adaptations in 1991 a collaboration between french studio ellipse and canadian animation company nelvana adapted 21 of stories among them red sea sharks into
