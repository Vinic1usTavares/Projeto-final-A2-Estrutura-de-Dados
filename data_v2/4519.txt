typhoon hattie known in philippines as typhoon was fifth tropical cyclone of a record six to hit japan during 1990 pacific typhoon season hattie originated from an area of disturbed weather that developed within western pacific monsoon trough towards end of september tracking westward disturbance initially was slow to develop although on september 30 system was classified as a tropical depression following an improvement of its convective structure and an increased in associated convection depression was upgraded into tropical storm hattie on october 1 following development of an eye hattie attained typhoon intensity on october 2 typhoon continued to slowly deepen as its forward speed slowed down despite a decrease in cloud top temperatures around eye hattie was estimated to have attained peak intensity on october 5 after recurving to north and then northeast hattie began to slowly weaken due to increased wind shear on october 7 hattie lost typhoon intensity and after tracking directly over tokyo transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on next day although inner core of typhoon hattie stayed offshore japan torrential rains were accountable for 68 landslides through country a total of 1 100 homes were flooded three people were killed one was reported missing and nineteen others were injured including six in kyoto elsewhere power lines were downed in 1 035 spots in okinawa mostly from sugar cane vegetables and flowers nationwide damage was estimated at 9 9 million 1990 usd meteorological history while typhoon gene was recurving just offshore japan an area of disturbed weather first developed in western pacific monsoon trough east of guam at 06 00 utc on september 28 joint typhoon warning center jtwc started tracking system additional organization was limited by strong westerly winds aloft but early on september 30 japan meteorological agency jma upgraded disturbance into a tropical depression thunderstorm activity subsequently flared up and an hour later jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for disturbance development of a central dense overcast prompted jtwc to designate system a tropical depression by noon on october 1 its convective structure improved and shower activity had increased based on this both jtwc and jma upgraded depression into tropical storm hattie tropical storm hattie tracked west northwest at a steady pace meanwhile hattie began to intensify at climatological rate of one dvorak t number per day due to decreased wind shear and improved upper level outflow thunderstorm activity quickly consolidated around a reformed low level circulation and jma upgraded hattie into a severe tropical storm on october 2 shortly thereafter hattie developed a small but distinct eye and based on satellite intensity estimates hattie was upgraded into a typhoon by both agencies later that day typhoon began to decelerate as it approached a break in subtropical ridge to its north despite a decrease in cloud top temperatures surrounding eye normally a sign of weakening increased dvorak intensity estimates justified jtwc raising intensity of hattie to at 00 00 utc on october 4 equal to a mid grade category 2 hurricane on united states based saffir simpson hurricane wind scale according to jtwc this would also be hattie s highest maximum sustained wind twenty four hours later jma estimated that hattie peaked in intensity with winds of and a barometric pressure of on evening of october 5 typhoon hattie began to recurve to north rounding aforementioned ridge after passing through ryukyu islands system maintained its intensity until that evening when increasing wind shear aloft began to take toll on cyclone shower and thunderstorm activity quickly decreased near center and both jtwc and jma agreed that hattie lost typhoon intensity on morning of october 7 hattie then accelerated to northeast passing directly over tokyo on october 8 after becoming devoid of all convection jtwc reported that hattie had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 06 00 utc that day jma followed suit at roughly same time though agency continued to track hattie for an additional 18 hours impact typhoon dropped heavy rainfall across a majority of japanese archipelago a peak rainfall total occurred of in city of miyazaki of which fell in a 24 hour time span and of which fell in an hour a maximum wind gust of was recorded at itokazu castle in okinawa flights and ferry services were suspended all schools and government offices were closed during passage of hattie storm in conjunction with typhoon flo and typhoon gene dropped of precipitation over okinawa this rainfall provided significant drought relief that forced officials to lift water rationing damage to military bases on okinawa totaled to 1 6 million across okinawa power lines were downed in 1 035 spots and agricultural damage totaled to y 926 million yen mostly from sugar cane vegetables and flowers on eastern end of japan s shikoku island in tokushima prefecture 687 homes were damaged and an additional 121 houses were destroyed there three people were killed and 14 were wounded as bus they were riding in was struck by a landslide a block wall of a house collapsed in nakamura injuring one person throughout kochi prefecture 81 homes were damaged damage in prefecture amounted to y 279 million yen heavy rains in miyazaki prefecture triggered 11 landslides there 507 homes were damaged and 56 were destroyed which resulted in 92 homeless a total of 43 dwellings were partially damaged in kagoshima prefecture including 13 near station fifty seven individuals lost their homes and two people were also injured ninety three homes were damaged and three more homes were destroyed in usuki in oita prefecture there were 10 landslides and roads were damaged in 15 locations one person was also rendered missing on entire island of kyushu 136 flights and many ferry services were cancelled on kii peninsula around 3 400 customers lost power in shirahama and nine homes suffered damage in osaka prefecture three people were hurt in city of shizuoka after a tree fell on a train in kyoto six train passengers were injured by flying glass when typhoon s powerful winds toppled trees onto their coach across mie prefecture sixteen dwellings were damaged and three more were flattened heavy rain associated with hattie led to 68 landslides through country extensive flooding affected 1 100 houses three people were killed one was reported missing and 19 others were injured damage was estimated at 9 9 million
