alt thumb archaeoraptor fossil archaeoraptor is informal generic name for a fossil chimera from china in an article published in national geographic magazine in 1999 magazine claimed that fossil was a missing link between birds and terrestrial theropod dinosaurs even prior to this publication there had been severe doubts about fossil s authenticity further scientific study showed it to be a forgery

a forgery many true examples of feathered dinosaurs have been found and demonstrate evolutionary connection between birds and other theropods scandal archaeoraptor was unveiled at a press conference held by national geographic magazine in october 1999 at same press conference plans were announced to return fossil to chinese authorities as it was illegally exported in november 1999 national geographic featured fossil in an article written by art editor christopher sloan article in general discussed feathered dinosaurs and origin of birds it claimed fossil was a missing link between terrestrial dinosaurs and birds that could actually fly and informally referred to it as archaeoraptor liaoningensis announcing it would later be formally named as such this name means ancient robber of liaoning this drew immediate criticism from storrs l olson curator of birds at national museum of natural history in washington d c writing in backbone newsletter of his museum he denounced publication of a scientific name in a popular journal without peer review as a nightmare dalton rex feathers fly over chinese fossil bird s legality and authenticity nature vol 403 17 february 2000 pp 689 690 on february 3 2000 national geographic issued a press release stating that fossil could be a composite and that an internal investigation had begun in that same month bill allen national geographic editor told nature that he was furious to learn that fossil might have been faked in march issue in forum section a letter from dr xu xing pointed out that tail section probably did not match upper body in october 2000 national geographic published results of their investigation in an article written by pulitzer prize winning investigative journalist lewis m simons simons concluded that fossil was a composite and that virtually everyone involved in project had made some mistakes chronology thumb this article from november 1999 issue of national geographic was retracted after fossil archaeoraptor liaoningensis was shown to be fraudulent according to national geographic s report story of archaeoraptor begins in july 1997 in china where farmers routinely dug in shale pits with picks and sold fossils to dealers for a few dollars this was an illegal practice but it was common then in this case one farmer found a rare fossil of a toothed bird complete with feather impressions fossil broke into pieces during collection nearby in same pit he found pieces including a feathered tail and legs he cemented several of these pieces together in a manner that he believed was correct he apparently knew that it would make a more complete looking and thus more expensive fossil it was sold in june 1998 to an anonymous dealer and smuggled to united states according to authorities in beijing no fossils may leave china legally by fall 1998 annual meeting of society of vertebrate paleontology held in utah united states rumors were circulating about a striking fossil of a primitive bird that was in private hands this fossil was presented by an anonymous dealer at a gem show in tucson arizona dinosaur museum in blanding utah purchased it in february 1999 museum is run by stephen a czerkas and his wife sylvia czerkas mr czerkas does not hold a university degree but he is a dinosaur enthusiast and artist he arranged for patrons of his museum including trustee dale slade to provide 80 000 for purchase of fossil in order to study it scientifically and prevent it from disappearing into an anonymous private collection czerkases contacted paleontologist phil currie who contacted national geographic society currie agreed to study fossil on condition that it was eventually returned to china national geographic society intended to get fossil formally published in peer reviewed science journal nature and then follow up immediately with a press conference and an issue of national geographic editor bill allen asked that all members of project keep fossil secret so that magazine would have a scoop on story slade and czerkases intended fossil to be crown jewel of dinosaur museum and planned to keep it on display there for five years sloan says that he flew to utah in spring of 1999 to convince stephen czerkas to return fossil to china immediately after publication or he would not write about it for national geographic and currie would not work on it czerkas then agreed currie then contacted institute of vertebrate paleontology and paleoanthropology in beijing and national geographic flew ivpp s xu xing to utah to be part of archaeoraptor team during initial examination of fossil on march 6 1999 it had already become clear to currie that left and right feet mirrored each other perfectly and that fossil had been completed by using both slab and counterslab he also noticed no connection could be seen between tail and body in july 1999 currie and czerkases brought fossil to high resolution x ray ct facility of university of texas austin founded and operated by dr timothy rowe to make ct scans rowe having made scans on july 29 determined that they indicated that bottom fragments showing tail and lower legs were not part of larger fossil he informed czerkases on august 2 that there was a chance of whole being a fraud during a subsequent discussion rowe and currie were pressured by czerkases to keep their reservations private currie in first week of september sent his preparator kevin aulenback to dinosaur museum in blanding to prepare fossil for better study aulenback concluded that fossil was a composite specimen of at least 3 specimens with a maximum of five separate specimens but czerkases angrily denied this and only reported this to currie currie did not inform national geographic of these problems on august 13 1999 team submitted a manuscript titled a new toothed bird with a dromaeosaur like tail under names of stephen czerkas currie rowe and xu to journal nature in london paper mentions in two places and includes a figure illustrating point that one of legs and tail are counterparts that were composited into main slab on august 20 nature rejected paper indicating to czerkases that national geographic had refused to delay publication leaving too little time for peer review authors then submitted paper to science which sent it out for peer review two reviewers informed science that specimen was smuggled out of china and illegally purchased and that fossil had been doctored in china to enhance its value science then rejected paper according to sloan czerkases did not inform national geographic about details of two rejections by that time november issue of national geographic was already in preparation for printing but archaeoraptor was never formally published in any peer reviewed journal national geographic went ahead and published without peer review fossil was unveiled in a press conference on october 15 1999 and november 1999 national geographic contained an article by christopher p sloan a national geographic art editor sloan described it as a missing link that helped elucidate connection between dinosaurs and birds original fossil was put on display at national geographic society in washington dc pending return to china in article sloan used name archaeoraptor liaoningensis but with a disclaimer so that it would not count as a nomenclatural act for purposes of scientific 8b of international code of zoological nomenclature 3rd edition in anticipation of czerkas being able to publish a peer reviewed description at some point in future after november national geographic came out storrs l olson curator of birds in national museum of natural history of smithsonian institution published an open letter on 1 november 1999 pointing out that specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and protesting prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs olson complained that sloan a journalist had usurped process of scientific nomenclature by publishing a name first in popular press this is worst nightmare of many zoologists that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist storrs l olson 1999 two open letters from storrs olson long in october 1999 after having been informed by currie of problems and seeing specimen for first time xu noticed that tail of archaeoraptor strongly resembled an unnamed maniraptoran dinosaur that he was studying later to be named microraptor zhaoianus he returned to china and traveled to liaoning province where he inspected fossil site and contacted a number of fossil dealers he eventually found a fairly complete fossil of a tiny dromaeosaur and tail of this new fossil corresponded so exactly to tail on archaeoraptor fossil that it had to be counterslab it even had two matching yellow oxide stains on december 20 1999 xu xing sent e mails to authors and sloan announcing that fossil was a fake dalton

communication in nature in 2001 describing his findings he concluded that apart from top part several specimens had been used to complete fossil a first for left femur a second for tibiae a third for both feet and at least one more for tail which alone consisted of five separate parts rowe t ketcham r a denison c colbert m xu x currie p j nature vol 410 29 march 2001 pp 539 540 in june 2000 fossil

confusion fossils involved in archaeoraptor scandal have led to ongoing confusion over taxon names in december 2000 microraptor was described in nature zhou et al 2002 examined upper body of archaeoraptor fossil and reported that it belonged to previously named genus yanornis dinosaur museum journal in 2002 czerkases published a volume through their dinosaur museum titled feathered dinosaurs and origin of flight in this journal they described and named several species of six species named in book five are disputed despite work of zhou et al 2002 czerkas and co author xu xing described upper portion of archaeoraptor fossil as a new bird genus in dinosaur museum journal article does include caveat that it might actually be a specimen of yanornis czerkas sylvia j ed 2002 feathered dinosaurs and origin of flight dinosaur museum journal volume 1 blanding utah usa dinosaur museum august 1 2002 thus this same fossil specimen has been named archaeoraptor and yanornis in different places across monographs in dinosaur museum journal stephen czerkas built a case for his controversial view that maniraptoran dinosaurs are secondarily flightless birds in so doing he criticized prominent paleontologists in text on cryptovolans czerkas accused dr mark norell of misinterpreting fossil bpm 1 3 13 as having long leg feathers due to blinding influences of preconceived ideas in fact though norell s interpretation was correct and czerkas added leg feathers to his own reconstruction of fossil in art that promotes traveling exhibit two other taxa that czerkas and his co authors named were later treated as junior synonyms by other authors czerkas cryptovolans was treated as microraptor and his was treated as padian kevin 2001 basal avialae in dinosauria in dinosauria second edition university of california press 2004 czerkas described noting that it was similar to sapeornis later specimens of sapeornis with skulls demonstrated that two were probably synonymous another taxon that czerkas assigned to and named utahdactylus was reviewed by dr chris bennett bennett found multiple misidentifications of bones and inconsistencies between czerkas diagrams and actual fossils bennett found specimen to be an indeterminate diapsid and criticized previous authors for publishing a species name when no diagnostic characters below class level could be verified he made utahdactylus a nomen dubium bennett s christopher 2007 reassessment of utahdactylus from jurassic morrison formation of utah journal of vertebrate paleontology 27 1 257 260 march 2007

museum paid a set fee to dinosaur museum to display this show in 2004 when show opened dr ji qiang told reporters from nature that about a dozen of fossils had left china illegally ji arranged with czerkases to assign accession numbers to three of most valuable specimens thus formally adding them to collection of chinese academy of geological sciences in beijing although they remain in possession of czerkases stephen czerkas denied ji s assertion that fossils were illegal sylvia czerkas told journal nature that she had worked out an agreement with officials of liaoning province in 2001 to borrow fossils and that they were to be repatriated in 2007 through march 2009 however show was scheduled for fresno metropolitan museum of art and science in california according to nature czerkases refused requests to make officials from liaoning available for interview many scientists consider it unethical to work on fossils if there is any chance that they have been smuggled and many disregard privately owned fossils altogether hopkin michael 2007 paleontology journal will fuel black market nature news 445 234 235 18 january 2007 some professionals feel that private collectors put fossils in private hands where science may not be able to access or study them some believe that private collectors may damage important fossils subject them to forgery and obscure their origins or evidence about their ages illegal dealers have also participated in and may encourage governmental corruption another philosophy argues that if scientists could bend their ethics and agree to publish on important private fossils this would encourage private holders to make them available for study fossil most recently appeared in an exhibition in wollaton hall near nottingham titled ground shakers to feathered flyers where it was exhibited along with fossils of and microraptor its main components taxonomic history in april 2000 olson published an article in backbone newsletter of national museum of natural history in this article he justified his views on evolution of birds but also revised and redescribed species archaeoraptor liaoningensis by designating just tail of original fraudulent specimen as type specimen storrs l olson 2000 countdown to piltdown at national geographic rise and fall of archaeoraptor backbone newsletter of department of vertebrate zoology national museum of natural history 13 2 april 1 3 to prevent tainted name archaeoraptor from entering literature this redescription assigned name to that part of chimeric specimen least likely to be classified under aves rather than to portion which was later shown to represent a true bird species olson presumed that national geographic article had already validly named fossil and he therefore failed to explicitly indicate name was new as demanded by article 16 of iczn as a condition for a name to be valid several months afterwards xu zhou and wang published their description of microraptor zhaoianus in nature creationism thumb microraptor zhaoianus scandal is sometimes used by creationists like kent hovind kirk cameron and ray comfort to cast doubt on hypothesis that birds evolved from dinosaurs many creationists insist that no missing links between birds and dinosaurs have been found and commonly point to archaeoraptor as evidence of misconduct performed to support evolutionary theory they see archaeoraptor as a piltdown bird however contrary to piltdown man archaeoraptor was not deliberately fabricated to support some evolutionary claim chambers paul 2002 bones of contention john murray publishers ltd london p 249 furthermore authenticity of archaeoraptor would not have been an essential proof for hypothesis that birds are theropods as this is sufficiently corroborated by other data paleontologist christopher brochu concluded in november 2001 that birds are derived theropod dinosaurs is no longer subject of scholarly dispute brochu christopher a 2001 progress and
