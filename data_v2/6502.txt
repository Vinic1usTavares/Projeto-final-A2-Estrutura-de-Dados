2005 key points from adrift lost blog filmfodder com retrieved on january 15 2009 entertainment weekly s jeff jensen called flashbacks among poorest and most clumsily integrated flashbacks we ve seen so far as he felt nothing new was learned and also disliked michael s on island storyline noting he got sense that actors and directors weren t quite sure what to make of these scenes jensen however complimented hatch scenes considering that terry o quinn s performance and his interaction with henry ian cusick were salvaging first mediocre episode of season jensen jeff september 29 2005 lost michael treads water locke goes deeper entertainment weekly retrieved on january 9 2009 ryan mcgee of zap2it thought that revealing hatch events through different perspectives a fresh narrative approach but complained about lack of plot advancement and considered raft storyline three times as long as needed with a really fake shark attack to boot ign s chris carabott gave episode an 8 2 out of 10 praising perrineau s performance and flashback but website later ranked adrift 80th out of 115 lost episodes jokingly saying that shark should have eaten michael and save us a lot of and they took him from my hands shout fests a similar list by los angeles times ranked episode as fourth worst of series describing it as boring new york magazine listed adrift in its twenty most pointless
