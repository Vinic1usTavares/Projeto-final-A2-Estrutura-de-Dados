daughter of a local landowner john shaw of bargarran saw one of her family s servants catherine campbell steal a drink of milk shaw reported theft to her mother whereupon campbell cursed her wishing that devil would haul her soul through hell four days later shaw encountered agnes naismith an old woman reputed to be a witch following day 22 august shaw became violently ill with fits similar to symptoms reported a few years earlier in american salem witch trials of 1693 after eight weeks shaw s parents took her to see eminent glasgow physician matthew brisbane who could find no cause for her symptoms for eight days after her visit shaw seemed to have recovered but then fits returned with increased violence she would become as stiff as a corpse and be senseless and motionless shaw s parents took her back to dr brisbane and by time they arrived back in glasgow she had begun to pull out of her mouth balls of hair she claimed had been put there by those who were afflicting her soon she began to pull other trash out of her mouth including straw coal gravel chicken feathers and cinders during her fits she was sometimes heard to be talking to invisible catherine campbell pleading for a return to their former friendship with brisbane unable to provide any rational explanation for shaw s condition her family and their local parish minister concluded that she must be possessed and being tormented by witches a common occurrence in england and scotland and a central element in salem witch trials a few years earlier church set up a weekly fast and prayer meeting at bargarron house and shaw s father appealed to authorities that those named by his daughter as tormenting her should be arrested she had initially identified only catherine campbell and agnes naismith but as time wore on she implicated others and eventually 35 were accused ten were male and twenty female genders and identities of remaining five are unknown investigation and trial at request of presbytery of paisley scottish privy council set up a commission to investigate case under chairmanship of lord blantyre hearing opened on 5 february 1697 commission s task was to decide whether there was a prima facie case against those accused by shaw before they were committed for trial seven were subsequently summoned to appear before a second commission in paisley margaret lang john lindsay james lindsay john reid catherine campbell margaret fulton and agnes naismith they were charged with murder and tormenting a number of people including christian shaw their advocate james roberston argued that prosecution was obliged to rule out possibility that events surrounding case could be explained by natural causes before a conviction could be safely secured matthew brisbane gave evidence stating that he had been unable to find any such cause for shaw s condition james hutchison minister of about north of paisley delivered a sermon to commission it was commonplace at time for a member of clergy to preach to court in scottish witch trials and they were not infrequently instrumental in securing convictions hutchison placed great store on presence of witches marks on bodies of accused and cast doubt on natural explanations of those marks offered by some physicians and however doctors may say such and such things of it a witches mark we know not upon what ground it may be that they have been and bribed to say such things jury confronted by a threat from prosecutor that if they acquitted defendants they would be accessory to all murders tortures and seductions etc whereof those enemies of heaven and earth shall hereafter be guilty when they get out found all seven of accused guilty executions one of those convicted james reid committed suicide by hanging himself in his prison cell using his handkerchief attached to a nail in wall remaining six were hanged and then burned on gallow green in paisley on 10 june 1697 last mass execution for witchcraft in western europe john and james lindsay brothers from mill near houston aged 11 and 14 respectively held each other s hands as they were hanged together catherine campbell after having been carried struggling and screaming to gallows called down wrath of god and devil on her accusers before being despatched margaret fulton appeared to have become insane and spoke cheerfully about visits to and abode of fairies on backs of magical horses margaret lang admitted to consorting with devil but said that she had renounced sin and was reconciled with god agnes naismith laid a dying woman s curse on everyone present and their descendants for many years afterwards every tragedy in town was blamed on witches curse one account of executions states that some of condemned were still alive when their bodies were burned and that executioners borrowed a walking stick from an onlooker with which to push their victims moving limbs back into fire its owner mark refused to take it back after it had been in contact with witches modern interpretation anxiety induced in christian shaw by catherine campbell s curse may have brought on a conversion disorder in young girl modern name for what was once known as hysteria term conversion derives from sigmund freud s idea that anxiety can be converted into physical symptoms such as seizures displayed by shaw michael wasser has commented that witch trials tended to occur at times of crisis such as scotland experienced during late 1690s glorious revolution of 1688 although it had restored presbyterian polity of kirk nevertheless left many disappointed at low moral tone and lack of religious enthusiasm of their compatriots glencoe massacre of 1692 and subsequent inquiry had eroded moral legitimacy of government and a series of harvest failures from 1695 onwards led to a period of famine there was also threat of a french invasion as bargarron witches were being tried taxes and troops were being levied in west to repel expected invaders in 1839 a small hole was discovered in wall of shaw s bedroom at bargarron house which by then had become a local attraction through which an accomplice may have passed items she supposedly removed from her mouth aftermath shortly after trial in 1697 former scottish secretary of state james johnstone observed that parliaments of france and other judicatories who are persuaded of being of witches never try them now because of experience they have had that it s impossible to distinguish possession from nature in disorder shaw married reverend john millar parish minister of kilmaurs ayrshire in 1719 he died two years later after which shaw went on to become a successful businesswoman she was involved in manufacture of thread at first in a small way but as quality of her product began to be recognised on an increasingly large scale her bargarran trademark thread became a mark of quality and others in area began to emulate her techniques starting an industry in which paisley once dominated world and which shaped town s history last known record of shaw is her marriage in february 1737 to william livingstone a prosperous edinburgh businessman tribute in may 2008 a memorial was built at cross in paisley
