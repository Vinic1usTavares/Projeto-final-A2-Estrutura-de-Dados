his stepson abbas was governor of neighbouring district of al ibn al sallar had hoped to be named vizier by new ruler al zafir but latter chose ibn masal instead infuriated ibn al sallar refused to

unwilling to in end caliph provided ibn masal with his own funds to hire mercenaries for action against ibn al sallar ibn al sallar entered cairo on 10 december and installed himself in vizier s palace for moment al zafir was forced to submit to new strongman appointing him vizier and conferring him honorific titles al malik al adil righteous ruler al sayyid al ajal most noble master amir al

as ibn masal was among tribes of upper egypt trying to raise additional troops furthermore caliph was unreconciled to new situation and conspired to have ibn al sallar killed in retaliation in january 1150 ibn al sallar gathered caliphal guard al khass an elite corps of cadets comprising sons of high dignitaries and officials and executed most of them sending rest to serve on empire s frontiers he then sent an army under his stepson abbas along with tala i ibn ruzzik to confront ibn masal and his ally badr ibn rafi two armies met in battle at in province of on 19 february 1150 in which ibn masal was defeated and killed abbas brought his severed head back to cairo as a token of victory unsurprisingly relationship between caliph and vizier remained extremely hostile according to usama ibn munqidh two despised each other with caliph conspiring to kill ibn al sallar and latter seeking to depose caliph mutual hatred of both men was only kept in check by grave external threats faced by empire from crusader kingdom of jerusalem ibn al sallar entertained notion of an alliance and joint action with zengid ruler of aleppo nur al din but this did not come to pass as latter was focused on capturing damascus at time nevertheless following sack of by crusaders in 1151 2 ibn al sallar mobilized fatimid navy to raid christian shipping along coasts of levant from jaffa to tripoli lebanon fleet inflicted significant casualties and returned victorious this success strengthened ibn al sallar s position domestically but was hollow as neither fatimids nor nur al din followed it up in contrast in early 1153 crusaders launched an attack on fatimid outpost of ascalon garrison of ascalon comprised men of local tribe of and a 400 600 strong cavalry force sent from cairo every six months in march 1153 ibn al sallar prepared to send reinforcements to city both naval and military while fleet was being prepared under personal supervision of ibn al sallar army left cairo for force was led by his stepson abbas and usama ibn according to historian al maqrizi this mission displeased abbas who would much rather have continued to spend his time savouring pleasures of cairo his ambition inflamed by usama who suggested that he could become sultan of egypt if only he so desired abbas decided to kill his stepfather plot was hatched with agreement of caliph abbas sent his son nasr a favourite of caliph back to in cairo to stay with his grandmother in palace of ibn al sallar ostensibly to spare him from dangers of war during night nasr entered chamber of ibn al sallar and murdered him in his sleep he then sent a message by carrier pigeon to his father who quickly returned to cairo to claim vizierate for himself showing ibn al sallar s severed head to populace assembled before bab al dhahab gate abandoned to its fate ascalon fell to crusaders in august 1153 neither abbas nor al zafir survived for long al zafir was killed by nasr in april 1154 and replaced by his five year old son al fa iz bi nasr allah when abbas executed two of al zafir s brothers remaining fatimid princes appealed to tala i ibn ruzzik for aid abbas and nasr were forced to flee to syria where abbas was killed while nasr was captured by crusaders and handed back to fatimids for execution legacy historian thierry bianquis assesses ibn al sallar as a man of no discernible qualities whatsoever whose greed led to brutal and vindictive crimes described in some detail by chroniclers ibn zafir and ibn these had made him widely unpopular so that his murder was welcomed at time as vizier ibn al sallar raised pay of army restoring its order and discipline and reactivated fatimid fleet for first time since 1125 unlike army fleet showed itself to be an effective force during this period ibn al sallar was also active in promoting sunni islam in egypt against isma ili doctrine espoused by fatimids he ordered construction of a shafi i madrasa in alexandria known as al and completed in 1151 2 and may have been responsible for appointment of shafi i abu l ma ali ibn al as chief qadi of egypt he was also responsible for commissioning a number of other buildings including several mosques and madrasas his rise to power and downfall mark beginning of end for fatimid state from al zafir on caliphs were underage youths sidelined and mere puppets at hands of strongmen who vied for vizierate
