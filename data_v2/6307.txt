surtsey surtr s island in icelandic is a volcanic island located in vestmannaeyjar archipelago off southern coast of iceland at surtsey is southernmost point of iceland it was formed in a volcanic eruption which began below sea level and reached surface on 14 november 1963 eruption lasted until 5 june 1967 when island reached its maximum size of since then wave erosion has caused island to steadily diminish in size its surface area was most recent survey 2007 shows island s maximum elevation at above sea level new island was named after surtr a fire jotunn or giant from norse mythology it was intensively studied by volcanologists during its eruption and afterwards by botanists and other biologists as life forms gradually colonised originally barren island undersea vents that produced surtsey are part of vestmannaeyjar submarine volcanic system part of fissure of sea floor called mid atlantic ridge vestmannaeyjar also produced famous eruption of on island of heimaey in 1973 eruption that created surtsey also created a few other small islands along this volcanic chain such as jolnir and other unnamed peaks most of these eroded away fairly quickly it is estimated that surtsey will remain above sea level for another 100 years geology formation scheme of surtseyan eruption water vapour ash layers of lava and magma magma dike eruption was unexpected and almost certainly began some days before it became apparent at surface sea floor at eruption site is below sea level and at this depth volcanic emissions and explosions would be suppressed quenched and dissipated by water pressure and density gradually as repeated flows built up a mound of material that approached sea level explosions could no longer be contained and activity broke surface first noticeable indications of volcanic activity were recorded at seismic station in iceland from 6 to 8 november which detected weak tremors emanating from an epicentre approximately west south west at a distance of location of surtsey another station in reykjavik recorded even weaker tremors for ten hours on 12 november at an undetermined location when seismic activity ceased until 21 november that same day people in coastal town of vik away noticed a smell of hydrogen sulphide on 13 november a fishing vessel in search of herring equipped with sensitive thermometers noted sea temperatures sw of eruption center were higher than surrounding waters eruption at surface thumb right 250px surtsey s ash column rises over newly forming island at 07 15 utc on 14 november 1963 cook of ii a trawler sailing these same waters spotted a rising column of dark smoke southwest of boat captain thought it might have been a boat on fire and ordered his crew to investigate instead they encountered explosive eruptions giving off black columns of ash indicating that a volcanic eruption had begun to penetrate surface of sea by 11 00 same day eruption column had reached several kilometres in height at first eruptions took place at three separate vents along a northeast by southwest trending fissure but by afternoon separate eruption columns had merged into one along erupting fissure over next week explosions were continuous and after just a few days new island formed mainly of scoria measured over in length and had reached a height of as eruptions continued they became concentrated at one vent along fissure and began to build island into a more circular shape by 24 november island measured about violent explosions caused by meeting of lava and sea water meant that island consisted of a loose pile of volcanic rock scoria which was eroded rapidly by north atlantic storms during winter however eruptions more than kept pace with wave erosion and by february 1964 island had a maximum diameter of over explosive phreatomagmatic eruptions caused by easy access of water to erupting vents threw rocks up to a kilometre 0 6 mi away from island and sent ash clouds as high as up into atmosphere loose pile of unconsolidated tephra would quickly have been washed away had supply of fresh magma dwindled and large clouds of dust were often seen blowing away from island during this stage of eruption new island was named after fire jotunn surtur from norse mythology is genitive case of surtur plus ey island three french journalists representing magazine paris match notably landed there on 6 december 1963 staying for about 15 minutes before violent explosions encouraged them to leave journalists jokingly claimed french sovereignty over island but iceland quickly asserted that new island belonged to it permanent island by early 1964 though continuing eruptions had built island to such a size that sea water could no longer easily reach vents and volcanic activity became much less explosive instead lava fountains and flows became main form of activity these resulted in a hard cap of extremely erosion resistant rock being laid down on top of much of loose volcanic pile which prevented island from being washed away rapidly effusive eruptions continued until 1965 by which time island had a surface area of on 28 december 1963 submarine activity to northeast of surtsey caused formation of a ridge high on sea floor this seamount was named surtla but never reached sea level eruptions at surtla ended on 6 january 1964 and it has since been eroded from its minimum depth

diminished but at end of may that year an eruption began at a vent off northern shore by 28 may an island had appeared and was named syrtlingur little surtsey new island was washed away during early june but reappeared on 14 june eruptions at syrtlingur were much smaller in scale than those that had built surtsey with average rate of emission of volcanic materials being about a tenth of rate at main vent activity was short lived continuing until beginning of october 1965 by which time islet had an area of once eruptions had ceased wave erosion rapidly wore island away and it disappeared beneath waves on 24 october during december 1965 more submarine activity occurred southwest of surtsey and another island was formed it was named jolnir and over following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance activity at jolnir was much weaker than activity at main vent and even weaker than that seen at syrtlingur but island eventually grew to a maximum size of in height covering an area of during july and early august 1966 like syrtlingur though after activity ceased on 8 august 1966 it was rapidly eroded and dropped below sea level during october 1966 effusive eruptions on main island returned on 19 august 1966 with fresh lava flows giving it further resistance to erosion eruption rate diminished steadily though and on 5 june 1967 eruption ended volcano has been dormant ever since total volume of lava emitted during three and a half year eruption was about one cubic kilometre 0 24 cu mi and island s highest point was above sea level at that time since end of eruption erosion has seen island diminish in size a large area on southeast side has been eroded away completely while a sand spit called north point has grown on north side of island it is estimated that about of material has been lost due to erosion this represents about a quarter of original above sea level volume of island its maximum elevation has diminished to recent development thumb 250px right island of surtsey in 1999 thumb right 250px north spit of surtsey in january 2009 following end of eruption scientists established a grid of benchmarks against which they measured change in shape of island in 20 years following end of eruption measurements revealed that island was steadily subsiding and had lost about one metre in height rate of subsidence was initially about per year but slowed to a year by 1990s it had several causes settling of loose tephra forming bulk of volcano compaction of sea floor sediments underlying island and downward warping of lithosphere due to weight of volcano volcanoes in vestmannaeyjar archipelago are typically monogenetic and so island is unlikely to be enlarged in future by further eruptions heavy seas around island have been eroding it ever since island appeared and since end of eruption almost half of its original area has been lost island currently loses about of its surface area each year future thumb right 250px other islands in archipelago show effects of centuries of erosion this island is unlikely to disappear entirely in near future eroded area consisted mostly of loose tephra easily washed away most of remaining area is capped by hard lava flows which are much more resistant to erosion in addition complex chemical reactions within loose tephra within island have gradually formed highly erosion resistant tuff material in a process known as on surtsey this process has happened quite rapidly due to high temperatures not far below surface estimates of how long surtsey will survive are based on rate of erosion seen up to present day assuming that current rate does not change island will be mostly at or below sea level by 2100 however rate of erosion is likely to slow as tougher core of island is exposed an assessment assuming that rate of erosion will slow exponentially suggests that island will survive for many centuries an idea of what it will look like in future is given by other small islands in vestmannaeyjar archipelago which formed in same way as surtsey several thousand years ago and have eroded away substantially since they were formed biology settlement of life a classic site for study of from founder populations that arrive from outside surtsey was declared a nature reserve in 1965 while eruption was still in active progress today only a few scientists are permitted to land on surtsey only way anyone else can see it closely is from a small plane this allows natural ecological succession for island to proceed without outside interference in 2008 unesco declared island a world heritage site in recognition of its great scientific value plant life in spring of 1965 surtsey research society colonization of land accessed 2015 01 23 archived by webcite r at https www webcitation org first vascular plant was found growing on northern shore of surtsey mosses became visible in 1967 and lichens were first found on surtsey lava in 1970 plant colonisation on surtsey has been closely studied vascular plants in particular as they have been of far greater significance than mosses lichens and fungi in development of vegetation mosses and lichens now cover much of island during island s first 20 years 20 species of plants were observed at one time or another but only 10 became established in nutrient poor sandy soil as birds began nesting on island soil conditions improved and more vascular plant species were able to survive in 1998 first bush was found on island a tea leaved willow salix which can grow to heights of up to by 2008 69 species of plant had been found on surtsey of which about 30 had become established this compares to approximately 490 species found on mainland iceland more species continue to arrive at a typical rate of roughly 2 5 new species per year birds thumb right 150px first puffin nests were found on surtsey in 2004 expansion of bird life on island has both relied on and helped to advance spread of plant life birds use plants for nesting material but also continue to assist in spreading of seeds and fertilize soil with their guano birds first began nesting on surtsey three years after eruptions ended with fulmar and guillemot first species to set up home twelve species are now regularly found on island a gull colony has been present since 1984 although gulls were seen briefly on shores of new island only weeks after it first appeared gull colony has been particularly important in developing plant life on surtsey and gulls have had much more of an impact on plant colonisation than other breeding species due to their abundance an expedition in 2004 found first evidence of nesting atlantic puffins which are extremely common in rest of archipelago as well as providing a home for some species of birds surtsey has also been used as a stopping off point for migrating birds particularly those en route between europe and iceland species that have been seen briefly on island include whooper swans various species of geese and common ravens although surtsey lies to west of main migration routes to iceland it has become a more common stopping point as its vegetation has improved in 2008 14th bird species was detected with discovery of a common raven s nest according to a 30 may 2009 report a golden plover was nesting on island with four eggs new family moves onto surtsey island no parties allowed 30 may 2009 marine life soon after island s formation seals were seen around island they soon began basking there particularly on northern spit which grew as waves eroded island seals were found to be breeding on island in 1983 and a group of up to 70 made island their breeding spot grey seals are more common on island than harbour seals but both are now well established presence of seals attracts orcas which are frequently seen in waters around vestmannaeyjar archipelago and now frequent waters around surtsey on submarine portion of island many marine species are found starfish are abundant as are sea urchins and limpets rocks are covered in algae and seaweed covers much of submarine slopes of volcano with its densest cover between below sea level other life insects arrived on surtsey soon after its formation and were first detected in 1964 original arrivals were flying insects carried to island by winds and their own power some were believed to have been blown across from as far away as mainland europe later insect life arrived on floating driftwood and both live animals and carcasses washed up on island when a large grass covered tussock was washed ashore in 1974 scientists took half of it for analysis and discovered 663 land invertebrates mostly mites and springtails great majority of which had survived crossing establishment of insect life provided some food for birds and birds in turn helped many species to become established on island bodies of dead birds provide sustenance for carnivorous insects while fertilisation of soil and resulting promotion of plant life provides a viable habitat for herbivorous insects some higher forms of land life are now colonising soil of surtsey first earthworm was found in a soil sample in 1993 probably carried over from heimaey by a bird however next year earthworms were not found slugs were found in 1998 and appeared to be similar to varieties found in southern icelandic mainland spiders and beetles have also become established human impact only other significant human impact is a small prefabricated hut which is used by researchers while staying on island hut includes a few bunk beds and a solar power source to drive an emergency radio and other key electronics all visitors check themselves and belongings to ensure no seeds are accidentally introduced by humans to this ecosystem it is believed that some young boys tried to introduce potatoes which were promptly dug up once discovered an improperly handled human defecation resulted in a tomato plant taking root which was also destroyed in 2009 a weather station for weather observations and a webcam were installed on surtsey surtsey
