and corruption of atlantic city on june 4 2008 winter had been interested in creating a series set in 1920s feeling that it had never properly been explored before it was for this reason that he decided to focus his adaption of novel on prohibition era section on september 1 2009 it was announced that academy award winning director martin scorsese would direct pilot it would be first time he had directed an episode of television since an episode of steven spielberg s amazing stories in 1986 production would be very ambitious with some even speculating it would be too large scale for television i kept thinking this is pointless how can we possibly afford a boardwalk or an empire says creator terence winter we can t call it boardwalk empire and not see a boardwalk production would eventually build a boardwalk in an empty lot in brooklyn new york at cost of five million dollars despite a reported budget of up to 50 million pilot s final budget came in at 18 million on why he chose to return to television scorsese said what s happening past 9 to 10 years particularly at hbo is what we had hoped for in mid 60s with films being made for television at first we d hoped there would be this kind of freedom and also ability to create another world and create longform characters and story that didn t happen in 1970s 1980s and in 1990s i think and of course hbo is a trailblazer in this i ve been tempted over years to be involved with them because of nature of long form and their development of character and plot he went on to praise network hbo by saying a number of episodes in so many of their series they re thoughtful intelligent and brilliantly put together it s a new opportunity for storytelling it s very different from television of past casting thumb upright steve buscemi plays enoch nucky thompson scorsese is an actor magnet commented winter everybody wants to work with him i had all these pictures on my wall and i thought i d really better write some good stuff for these people in casting role of nucky thompson based upon real life atlantic city political boss enoch l johnson winter wanted to stray from real life johnson as much as possible if we were going to cast accurately what real nucky looked like we d have cast jim idea of casting steve buscemi in lead role came about when scorsese mentioned wanting to work with actor whom winter knew well having worked with him on sopranos winter sent script out to buscemi who responded very enthusiastically i just thought wow i m almost sorry i ve read this because if i don t get it i m going to be so sad my response was terry i know you re looking at other actors and he said no no steve i said we want you explained scorsese i love range he has his dramatic sense but also his sense of humor casting of buscemi was soon followed by michael pitt best known for his role in bernardo bertolucci film dreamers he was soon joined by kelly macdonald vincent piazza and michael shannon who had just received an oscar nomination for his role in sam mendes film revolutionary road filming filming for pilot took place at various locations in and around new york city in june 2009 in creating visual effects for series company turned to brooklyn based effects company brainstorm digital says glenn allen visual effects producer for boardwalk empire and co founder of brainstorm it s our most complex job to date everything is hd now so we have to treat it like a feature film anytime you get to work on a period piece it s more fun comments visual effects artist chris pinkus who used archival photographs postcards and architectural plans to recreate atlantic city boardwalks as accurately as possible we got to explore what old atlantic city was really like piers were one of toughest parts because every summer they would change new houses new advertisements it took two months for firm to complete all visual effects for pilot reception critical reception pilot episode received acclaim from television critics tv guide s matt roush praised marriage of scorsese and winter saying it brilliantly marries martin scorsese s virtuosic cinematic eye to terence winter s panoramic mastery of rich character and eventful story and finished his review by stating it s most purely and enjoyable storytelling hbo has delivered in ages like a movie that you never want to end variety s brian lowry praised show for returning network hbo to top form saying this is quite simply television at its finest occupying a sweet spot that for all able competition still remains unique to hbo an expensive explicit character driven program tackling material no broadcast network or movie studio would dare touch for those wondering when channel would deliver another franchise to definitively put it on top of world ma wait is over go directly to boardwalk one of unexpected joys of boardwalk empire though lies in way show revels in oddities of its time peeling back layers of polite society to reveal a giddy shadow world of criminals and politicians collaborating to keep liquor flowing says online magazine salon s heather havrilesky who went on to call pilot breathtaking roberto bianco from usa today said in his review that boardwalk empire was extravagantly produced shockingly violent and as cold and hard as ice boardwalk empire brings us back to world s former playground at start of prohibition and brings hbo back to forefront of tv series race however not all critical reviews were favorable nancy franklin of new yorker felt that series too closely echoed sopranos and went on to say that first episode alone cost nearly twenty million dollars and it looks authentic in a way that paradoxically seems lifeless you re constantly aware that you re watching a period piece albeit one with some vivid scenes and interesting details chris barsanti from popmatters affords show six out of ten remarking that series doesn t begin in most thought proving manner and added that character of jimmy darmody is a dud and michael pitt gives a one note performance aaron riccio of slant praised series overall awarding it three and a half stars but commented that show was too big and had too many subplots plots that boardwalk empire does settle on are too complex for a single episode he said while this style of drawn out season long storytelling can work writers don t establish enough tension up front to carry back heavy narrative accolades s result 63rd directors guild of america awards outstanding directing for a drama series martin scorsese 63rd primetime emmy
