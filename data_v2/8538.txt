cast and crew shared stereotypes of region from american culture sadly people in america and los angeles have these perceptions she said but once you get off plane you realise it s like manhattan without trees she continued as iraq dominated discourse in america and across world bigelow believed that filmmakers would continue to explore conflict making jordan natural place to film according to

it gives you a clear viewpoint of where you are as an artist and story you would like to tell it was a great experience to be there cinematography for film bigelow sought to immerse audiences into something that was raw immediate and visceral impressed with cinematographer barry ackroyd s work on united 93 and wind that shakes barley bigelow invited him to work on her film while film was independently produced and filmed on a low budget bigelow used four super 16 mm cameras to capture multiple perspectives saying that s how we experience reality by looking at microcosm and macrocosm simultaneously eye sees differently than lens but with multiple focal lengths and a muscular editorial style lens can give you that microcosm macrocosm perspective and that contributes to feeling of total immersion in staging film s action sequences bigelow did not want to lose a sense of geography and used multiple cameras to allow her to look at any particular set piece from every possible perspective editing hurt locker was edited by chris innis and bob murawski artful editing and all avid workflow propel hurt locker avid com two editors worked with almost 200 hours of footage from multiple hand held cameras in use during shoot adding to challenge boal s screenplay had a non traditional asymmetrical episodic structure there was no traditional villain and tension was derived from characters internal conflicts and suspense from explosives and snipers this movie is kind of like a horror film where you re unable to see killer says innis you know a bomb could go off at any minute but you never know just when it s going to happen so ideas of alfred hitchcock about making your audience anxious were influential for us when we did editing karen idelson editors get in rhythm variety 12 january 2010the raw footage was described as a hodge of disconnected nausea inducing motion that was constantly crossing 180 degree line innis spent first eight weeks editing film on location in jordan before returning to los angeles where she was joined by murawski process took over eight months to complete guy lodge crafts of hurt locker in contention january 7 2010 goal was to edit a brutally realistic portrayal of realities of war using minimal special effects or technical enhancement innis stated that they really wanted film to retain that newsreel documentary quality too many stage y effects would have been distracting editing in this film was all about restraint editing on location led to additional complications in post production production was unwilling to risk sending undeveloped film through high security airports where cans could be opened x rayed or damaged accordingly film was hand carried on a flight by a production assistant from amman to london after super 16mm film was transferred to at a lab in london video dailies were transported by plane back to middle east to be imported into editing system whole journey would take anywhere from three days to a week and was described by innis as modern day equivalent of shipping via donkey cart low production budget and lack of a developed film infrastructure in area hampered process according to innis we were working with grainy super 16mm film editing in standard definition we tried doing ftp downloads but at time facilities in jordan simply couldn t handle it producer tony mark later negotiated use of a local radio station late at night to receive low grade quicktime clips over internet so crew would not be shooting blindly reception critical response hurt locker received widespread acclaim

which assigns a normalized score gave film an average score of 95 out of 100 based on 35 critics indicating universal acclaim roger ebert of chicago sun times rated film as best of 2009 writing hurt locker is a great film an intelligent film a film shot clearly so that we know exactly who everybody is and where they are and what they re doing and why he applauded how suspense was built calling film spellbinding ebert considered renner a leading contender for academy awards writing his performance is not built on complex speeches but on a visceral projection of who this man is and what he feels he is not a hero in a conventional sense he eventually ranked it second best film of decade behind only synecdoche new york richard corliss of time magazine also spoke highly of renner s performance calling it a highlight of film corliss wrote he s ordinary pudgy faced quiet and at first seems to lack screen charisma to carry a film that supposition vanishes in a few minutes as renner slowly reveals strength confidence and unpredictability of a young russell crowe merging of actor and character is one of big things to love about this movie it s a creepy marvel to watch james in action he has cool aplomb analytical acumen and attention to detail of a great athlete or a master psychopath maybe both corliss praised film s steely calm tone reflective of its main character corliss summarized hurt locker is a near perfect movie about men in war men at work through sturdy imagery and violent action it says that even hell needs heroes a o scott of new york times called hurt locker best american feature film yet made about war in iraq you may emerge from hurt locker shaken exhilarated and drained but you will also be thinking movie is a viscerally exciting adrenaline soaked tour de force of suspense and surprise full of explosions and hectic scenes of combat but it blows a hole in condescending assumption that such effects are just empty spectacle or mindless noise scott noticed that film reserved criticism of war but wrote of how director handled film s limits ms bigelow practicing a kind of hyperbolic realism distills psychological essence and moral complications of modern warfare into a series of brilliant agonizing set pieces he also applauded convergence of characters in film saying that it focuses on three men whose contrasting temperaments knit this episodic exploration of peril and bravery into a coherent and satisfying story kenneth turan of los angeles times wrote that performances of renner mackie and geraghty would raise their profiles considerably and said their characters reveal their for aspects such as renner s character being playful with an iraqi boy turan applauded boal s lean and compelling script and said of bigelow s direction bigelow and her team bring an awesome ferocity to re creating unhinged mania of bomb removal in an alien culturally unfathomable atmosphere guy westwell of sight sound wrote that cinematographer barry ackroyd provided sharp handheld coverage and that paul n j s sound design uses barely perceptible ringing of tinnitus to amp up tension westwell praised director s skill careful mapping of subtle differences between each bomb play with point of view and attenuation of key action sequences lends film a distinctive quality that can only be attributed to bigelow s clever confident direction critic noted film s different take on iraq war writing that it confronts fact that men often take great pleasure in war he concluded this unapologetic celebration of a testosterone fuelled lust for war may gall yet there is something original and distinctive about film s willingness to admit that for some men and many moviegoers war carries an intrinsic dramatic charge amy taubin of film comment described hurt locker as a structuralist war movie and a totally immersive off charts high anxiety experience from beginning to end taubin praised ackroyd s brilliant cinematography with multiple viewpoints she said of film s editing bob murawski and chris innis s editing is similarly quick and nervous rapid changes in pov as they cut from one camera s coverage to another s makes you feel as if you like characters are under threat from all sides joe morgenstern of wall street journal called it a first rate action thriller a vivid evocation of urban warfare in iraq a penetrating study of heroism and a showcase for austere technique terse writing and a trio of brilliant performances toronto star critic peter howell said just when you think battle of iraq war dramas has been fought and lost along comes one that demands to be seen if you can sit through hurt locker without your heart nearly pounding through your chest you must be made of granite entertainment weekly s film critic lisa schwarzbaum gave film rare a rating calling it an intense action driven war pic a muscular efficient standout that simultaneously conveys feeling of combat from within as well as what it looks like on ground this ain t no war videogame derek elley of variety found hurt locker to be gripping as a thriller but felt that film was weakened by its fuzzy and hardly original psychology elley wrote that it was unclear to know where drama lay these guys get by on old fashioned guts and instinct rather than sissy hardware but it s not a pure men under stress drama either critic also felt that script showed signs of artificially straining for character depth anne thompson also writing for variety believed hurt locker to be a contender for best picture particularly based on unique subject matter pursued by a female director and on being an exception to other films about iraq war which had performed poorly tara mckelvey from american prospect wrote that film is pro u s army propaganda although it suggests it is anti war with opening statement war is a drug she continues you feel empathy for soldiers when they shoot and in this way full impact of iraq war at least as it was fought in 2004 becomes clear american soldiers shot at iraqi civilians even when for example they just happened to be holding a cell phone and standing near an ied she concludes for all graphic violence bloody explosions and literally human butchery that is shown in film hurt locker is one of most effective recruiting vehicles for u s army that i have seen john pilger journalist and documentarian criticized film in new statesman writing that it offers a vicarious thrill via yet another standard issue psychopath high on violence in somebody else s country

conditions writing for huffington post iraq veteran kate said that hurt locker is hollywood s version of iraq war and of soldiers who fight it and their version is inaccurate she described film as being more accurate than other recently released war films but expressed concerns that a number of errors among them wrong uniforms lack of radio communication or misbehavior of soldiers would prevent service members from enjoying film author brandon friedman also a combat veteran of iraq and afghanistan shared a similar view at hurt locker is a high tension well made action movie that will certainly keep most viewers on edges of their seats but if you know anything about army or about operations or life in iraq you ll be so distracted by nonsensical sequences and plot twists that it will ruin movie for you it certainly did for me friedman criticized inaccuracy of film s representation of combat saying in real life eod techs don t conduct dangerous missions as autonomous three man teams without communications gear another thing you ll rarely hear in combat is an eod e 7 suggesting to two or three of his guys that they leave scene of an explosion in an iraqi city by saying c mon

enjoyed it and called it best iraq movie to date troy steward another combat veteran wrote on blog that while film accurately depicted scale of bomb violence and relations between iraqis and troops just about everything else wasn t realistic steward went on to say i was amazed that a movie so bad could get any kind of accolades from anyone a review published march 8 2010 in air force times cited overall negative reviews from bomb experts in iraq attached to 4th brigade 1st armored division quoting a bomb disposal team leader who called film s portrayal of a bomb expert grossly exaggerated and not appropriate and describing lead character as more of a run and gun cowboy type exactly kind of person that we re not looking for another bomb disposal team member said that lead character s swagger would put a whole team at risk our team leaders don t have that kind of invincibility complex and if they do they aren t allowed to operate a team leader s first priority is getting his team

scenes are so disconnected with reality to be almost parody former british bomb disposal officer guy marot said james makes us look like hot headed irrational adrenaline junkies with no self discipline it s immensely disrespectful to many officers who have lost their lives on other hand henry engelhardt an adjutant with national explosive ordnance disposal association having twenty years experience in bomb complimented film s atmosphere and depiction of difficulties of job saying of course no film is realistic in all its details but important things were done very well lawsuits sarver
