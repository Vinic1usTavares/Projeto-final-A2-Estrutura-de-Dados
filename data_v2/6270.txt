of producers on album were mostly unknown local producers legacy said we have no big producers on our album all of our producers are like kids our age everything compliments each other because style and music are so new to game composition many critics noted several songs are built on same formula of you re a jerk with allmusic noting that dot com colors and so dope which chorus is a sound bite from 1992 film class act all have cheesy drum machines samples and off kilter lyric approach that make jerk so good review also said r b ballad tie me down featuring smooth auto tuned vocals from ray j b a s s inspired slow jam new girl and rollicking cashmere which bumps along like a new jack rap jam are nice diversions on album split los angeles times said album begins to lose circulation toward its end when pair lose their lambent wit in favor of mawkish lover boy ballads better left to sean kingston albums jeff weiss of newspaper used tie me down as an example noting that its sounds have a saccharine sappiness and contrived tone that feels at odds with otherwise organic sounding album some points of work were inspired by pharrell williams kanye west and other hip hop style eccentrics songs on album have heavy lyrical underlies noted by several critics comic esque way 2 many described as talking about a string of almost conquests better left unvanquished chick had a cold sore that looked like john mccain on cashmere ben j and legacy try to outdo each other to win attention of a young woman but predictably she spurns them both lyrics also cover their difference in style as seen in cricketz as legacy raps jeans stay skinny like i starve my fabric another damn thing you ll never see me care about another man s jeans jon caramanica of new york times responded baggy has been de rigueur in hip hop for so long it s easy to forget that 25 years ago rappers gladly wore tight denim now it s cause for a fight some of lyrics use double entendre with duo referring to themselves as rejects and jerks on dot com which los angeles times called both a double entendre for dance moves spurring craze and illustrative of their generation s reclamation of formerly nerdy archetypes

critical response tim sendra of allmusic gave album three out of five stars review and said album had cheesy drum machines samples and off kilter lyric approach that make jerk so good duo stick to template of jerk considering uniqueness of sound they ve created and also fact that it s a debut record made by teenagers and an impressive and unfailingly fun debut at that review goes on to point out that reliance on jerk sound can be a little monotonous there are enough variations along way to keep things interesting he also says duo s flow is not incredible but they spit convincingly if you were looking for undisputedly pop rap with a fresh sound and a light lyrical touch new boyz debut is a fine destination xxl said that album delivered unexpected lyrical talent but that it lacked sonic variety review also goes on to say that album is no hip hop classic but rather breath of fresh air rap needs jeff weiss of los angeles times gave album three stars commenting that album is a catchy and charismatic debut that should engender pleasant teen nostalgia in anyone old enough to vote and help explain why for last six months kids have been saying out with old in with new boyz review also said that album successfully strikes a balance between introducing a new sound minimalist bass heavy bounce of jerk music and style skinny jeans vans and colors that ain t even on rainbow with traditional teenage themes girls desire for self expression adults who don t understand girls result is a west coast antidote to south s veritable monopoly on homeroom rap a relentlessly breezy and fun ride through lives of a pair of class clowns bent on enjoying face cards that fate dealt selby times said that album is about as happening as it gets for teenage music with an attitude even if it makes adults eyes roll in disgust wendy roby of bbc said that but overall their sheer chutzpah wins you over and with its day glo tongue wedged so very firmly in its cheek skinny jeanz and a mic is hard to resist jon caramanica of new york times called album one of year s most charming rap debuts and certainly least expected in a separate review he named album sixth best album of year commenting emerging from southern california s jerk scene this teenage duo made an album that s appealingly young simultaneously wide eyed and knowingly lewd djbooth net s nathan slavik was less positive
