pelvicachromis pulcher is a freshwater fish of cichlid family endemic to nigeria and cameroon species is popular amongst aquarium hobbyists and is most commonly sold under name kribensis although species has other common names including various derivatives and color morphs of kribensis krib common krib red krib super red krib and rainbow krib along with rainbow cichlid and purple cichlid description thumb left pair more colorful female in front in wild male p pulcher grow to a maximum length of approximately and a maximum weight of females are smaller and deeper bodied growing to a maximum length of and a maximum weight of both sexes have a dark longitudinal stripe that runs from caudal fin to mouth and pink to red abdomens intensity of which changes during courtship and breeding dorsal and caudal fins also may bear gold ringed eye spots or ocelli males show colour polymorphisms in some populations collected at single localities juveniles are monomorphic until approximately six months of age distribution habitat and predators pelvicachromis pulcher is native to southern nigeria and to coastal areas of cameroon where it occurs in warm acidic to neutral ph 5 6 6 2 soft water 12 22 mg l 1 caco3 populations of p pulcher also occur outside its natural range in hawaii usa as a by product of ornamental fish trade species inhabits both slow and fast moving water though it is only found where patches of dense vegetation are available other fish that share habitat of p pulcher include other pelvicachromis species pelvicachromis taeniatus other cichlid species guntheri cristatus and h fasciatus tilapia mariae and t along with and species species is prey for a number of predators including and niloticus nile perch in natural habitat p pulcher have been observed excavating defending and sheltering in caves dug underneath plants and these holes are also used for breeding not all p pulcher however claim territories and many live in large non reproductive aggregates diet despite suggestion in some aquarium literature that species feeds on worms crustaceans and insects analysis of stomach contents of wild p pulcher suggests this is incorrect a study by 1985 of 161 individuals showed that main food items were diatoms green algae pieces of higher plants along with blue green algae invertebrates though consumed were found to be relatively uncommon food items for wild fish sexual dimorphism and reproduction thumb left larval p pulcher like other pelvicachromis species p pulcher is sexually dimorphic males have pointed pelvic dorsal and anal fins while female s pelvic dorsal and anal fins are more rounded in appearance in addition males are larger lack gold sheen to dorsal fin and have a more elongated spade shaped caudal fin despite suggestion in aquarium literature that species forms monogamous pairs formation of polygynous harems is not uncommon in natural habitat species are secretive cave spawners although detailed information on their reproductive biology in wild is limited in wild species is known to breed in holes excavated beneath aquatic and semi aquatic plants in captivity artificial caves are readily accepted as breeding sites however these too are excavated prior to egg laying eggs are adhesive and are frequently laid in rows of ca 10 on upper surface of cave and produce a clutch that ranges in size from 40 to 100 both male and female provide active brood care typically lasting 21 28 days which includes guarding herding and feeding it is noteworthy however that female is predominantly responsible for fry care while male is primarily involved in territorial defence as in all pelvicachromis species gender ratio of female to male fry increases with ph this ratio is also known to vary at different locales in wild breeding pairs of p pulcher have been known to adopt similarly aged fry from conspecifics in aquarium trials and it has been suggested this may be an adaption to reduce predation on their own fry male colour polymorphism may be indicative of behavioural differences for example red males obtained from a single site were found to be more aggressive and more polygamous than yellow males obtained from same site in addition species has been demonstrated to engage in cooperative territorial defence where multiple males defend a single territory taxonomy pelvicachromis pulcher was originally described as pelmatochromis pulcher by george boulenger in 1901 subsequently a number of junior synonyms pelmatochromis pelmatochromis and misidentifications pelmatochromis kribensis pelmatochromis var kribensis and pelmatochromis pulcher var kribensis were brought into use some of these synonyms are still in use by aquarium hobbyists which complicates identification of this species many of common and trade names used for this species such as kribensis krib rainbow krib are derived from erroneous binomial pelmatochromis kribensis genus pelmatochromis was revised by thys van den in 1968 when genus pelvicachromis was erected with p pulcher designated as type species etymology of this species is as follows pelvicachromis latin pelvic or belly greek a fish perhaps a perch pulcher latin pretty or beautiful in aquarium thumb a female p pulcher displaying her full vivid breeding colouration note dark black around magenta coloured stomach pelvicachromis pulcher is a popular cichlid for aquarium selective breeding an albino form of species has been developed for aquarium trade unlike normal albinism trait is not inherited in p pulcher trait is incompletely dominant like many albino animals red and yellow pigments are retained however albino p pulcher also show patches of melanin in dorsal and caudal fin around ocelli 1982 reports that matings from these albino forms with red and yellow pigments produce 25 wild coloured offspring and 75 albino fry albino fry were themselves divided into completely forms and forms which retained colouration of their parents see also list of freshwater aquarium fish species pelvicachromis taeniatus references external links about com com fishbase everything you
