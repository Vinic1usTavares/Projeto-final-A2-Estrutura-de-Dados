leader joseph stalin after a contest in 1943 stalin praised song for fulfilling what a national anthem should be though he criticized song s orchestration in response alexandrov blamed problems on

meeting president putin thumb russian national anthem lyrics once was world s smallest book after selecting music by alexandrov for national anthem stalin needed new lyrics he thought that song was short and because of great patriotic war that it needed a statement about impending defeat of germany by red army poets sergey mikhalkov and gabriel el registan were called to moscow by one of stalin s staffers and were told to fix lyrics to alexandrov s music they were instructed to keep verses same but to find a way to change refrains which described a country of soviets because of difficulty of expressing concepts of great patriotic war in song that idea was dropped from version which el registan and mikhalkov completed overnight after a few minor changes to emphasize russian motherland stalin approved anthem and had it published on 7 november 1943 including a line about stalin ing us to keep faith with people revised anthem was announced to all of ussr on january 1 1944 and became official on march 15 1944 after stalin s death in 1953 soviet government examined his legacy government began de stalinization process which included downplaying role of stalin and moving his corpse from lenin s mausoleum to kremlin wall necropolis in addition anthem lyrics composed by mikhalkov and el registan were officially scrapped by soviet government in 1956 anthem was still used by soviet government but without any official lyrics in private this anthem became known song without words mikhalkov wrote a new set of lyrics in 1970 but they were not submitted to presidium of supreme soviet until may 27 1977 new lyrics which eliminated any mention of stalin were approved on 1 september and were made official with printing of new soviet constitution in october 1977 in credits for 1977 lyrics mikhalkov was mentioned but references to el registan who died in 1945 were dropped for unknown reasons patrioticheskaya pesnya with impending collapse of soviet union in early 1990 a new national anthem was needed to help define reorganized nation and to reject soviet past chairman of supreme soviet of russian sfsr boris yeltsin was advised to revive god save tsar with modifications to lyrics however he instead selected a piece composed by mikhail glinka piece known as patrioticheskaya pesnya was a wordless piano composition discovered after glinka s death patrioticheskaya pesnya was performed in front of supreme soviet of rsfsr on november 23 1990 song was decreed by supreme soviet to be new russian anthem that same day this anthem was intended to be permanent which can be seen from parliamentary draft of constitution approved and drafted by supreme soviet congress of people s deputies and its constitutional commission with latter formally headed by president of russia draft among other things reads that national anthem of russian federation is patriotic song composed by mikhail glinka text of national anthem of russian federation shall be endorsed by federal law but conflict between president and congress made passage of that draft less likely congress shifted onto more and more rewriting of 1978 russian constitution while president pushed forward with new draft constitution which doesn t define state symbols after 1993 russian constitutional crisis and just one day before constitutional referendum i e on december 11 1993 yeltsin then president of russian federation issued a presidential decree on december 11 1993 retaining patrioticheskaya pesnya official anthem for russia but this decree was provisional since draft constitution which was passed a day later explicitly referred this matter to legislation enacted by parliament according to article 70 of constitution state symbols which are an anthem flag and coat of arms required further definition by future legislation as it was a constitutional matter it had to be passed by a two thirds majority in duma between 1994 and 1999 many votes were called for in state duma to retain patrioticheskaya pesnya as official anthem of russia however it faced stiff opposition from members of communist party of russian federation who wanted soviet anthem restored because any anthem had to be approved by a two thirds supermajority this disagreement between duma factions for nearly a decade prevented passage of an anthem call for lyrics when patrioticheskaya pesnya was used as national anthem it never had official lyrics anthem struck a positive chord for some people because it did not contain elements from soviet past and because public considered glinka to be a patriot and a true russian however lack of lyrics doomed patrioticheskaya pesnya various attempts were made to compose lyrics for anthem including a contest that allowed any russian citizen to participate a committee set up by government looked at over 6000 entries and 20 were recorded by an orchestra for a final vote eventual winner was viktor s be glorious russia however none of lyrics were officially adopted by yeltsin or russian government one of reasons that partially explained lack of lyrics was original use of glinka s composition praise of tsar and of russian orthodox church other complaints raised about song were that it was hard to remember uninspiring and musically complicated it was one of few national anthems that lacked official lyrics during this period only other wordless national anthems in period from 1990 to 2000 were my of belarus until 2002 marcha real of spain and of bosnia and herzegovina modern adoption thumb alt a video showing inside and outside of kremlin during
