1984 85 south west indian ocean cyclone season was an average cyclone season tropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by regional specialised meteorological centre in reunion first storm formed in mid november though it was not officially named a few days later first official storm of year anety formed in december one storm formed during january 1985 two tropical cyclones formed towards end of month three more systems developed in a short period of time in early to mid february after nearly two more months of inactivity an unusually powerful late season storm developed helisaonina in mid april which was strongest storm of year while a number of storms during season reached severe tropical storm status only one of those intensified further even though two tropical cyclones this year made landfall no known damage was recorded seasonal summary during season advisories were issued by meteo france s mfr meteorological office at reunion at time mfr area of warning responsibility was from coast of africa to 80deg e and agency primarily used dvorak technique to estimate intensities of tropical cyclones joint typhoon warning center jtwc which is a joint united states navy united states air force task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for region also tracked a long lived tropical storm in november in addition to 8 storms mfr named which is comparable to average of nine named storms per year following season boundary for basin was extended to 90deg e systems tropical storm 01s according to jtwc a tropical depression formed on november 9 quite far from land however system was never monitored by mfr tracking southwest throughout its lifetime jtwc upgraded system into a tropical storm on november 11 twelve hours later storm attained peak intensity of storm gradually weakened and at on november 14 it fell to a depression on november 17 01s was no more moderate tropical storm anety early on november 20 jtwc reported that a tropical depression had developed shortly thereafter mfr reported that a tropical disturbance had formed low moved west southwest while gradually deepening late on november 20 mfr upgraded system into a moderate tropical storm storm failed to intensify further as it had moved onshore northern madagascar by november 21 mfr estimated that storm weakened back into a disturbance after emerging into mozambique channel anety reportedly re intensified back to moderate tropical storm status while making its closest approach to african mainland storm resumed weakening while turning back southeast on november 23 both agencies stopped monitoring system moderate tropical storm bobalahy during morning hours of december 2 a tropical cyclone developed in extreme western portion of australian basin after crossing 80dege boundary that at that time separated two basins following day mfr classified system as a tropical depression early on december 4 agency upgraded system into a moderate tropical storm moving steadily southwest it gradually intensified only to turn west on december 5 that day mfr reported that moderate tropical storm bobalahy had attained peak intensity of around that time jtwc estimated that bobalahy attained peak intensity of after maintaining peak intensity for a day or so bobalahy resumed a southwesterly path far from land while slowly weakening on december 6 mfr downgraded system into a tropical depression jtwc followed suit next day now moving south southwest jtwc stopped issuing advisories on system as it had become extratropical however mfr continued to monitor remnants of system for four more days severe tropical storm celestina well away from land jtwc reported that a tropical disturbance developed on january 1 initially storm remained weak but later on january 11 jtwc noted that system had intensified into a tropical storm continuing to intensify storm moved towards southwest on january 12 mfr first classified system within six hours it was declared a moderate tropical storm as celestina made a turn towards south southwest mfr estimated that celestina attained peak intensity as a severe tropical storm at 0600 utc on january 13 according to jtwc storm briefly developed hurricane force winds however celestina began to weakened thereafter moving south celestina was situated roughly east of madagascar furthermore on january 15 celestina briefly re intensified while undergoing a counterclockwise loop by january 18 celestina resumed a weakening trend by that night mfr downgraded system into a tropical depression as it was now moving south southwest storm was re upgraded into a moderate tropical storm three days later on january 21 however this trend was short lived and that evening jtwc stopped monitoring system mfr followed suit at 0600 utc on january 23 during its lifetime severe tropical storm celestina brought rains to reunion peaking at in trois severe tropical storm ditra severe tropical storm ditra originated from a tropical depression that jtwc first warned on january 26 at first storm moved southwest but once it developed gale force winds system turned south at 1800 utc on january 27 mfr started monitoring low early next morning mfr upgraded system into a moderate tropical storm twelve hours later jtwc estimated that ditra had intensified into winds equal to a category 1 on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale sshws during early morning hours of january 29 ditra intensified into a severe tropical storm as storm briefly turned west southwest shortly thereafter jtwc announced that ditra had attained its peak intensity of while jtwc suggests that storm gradually weakened during this time mfr suggests that ditra continued to intensify they estimated that ditra peaked in intensity on 0600 utc january 30 around this time ditra made its closet approach to reunion passing about south southeast of island after maintaining this intensity for several hours ditra rapidly weakened as it accelerated to southeast it steadily weakened and late on january 31 jtwc reportedly downgraded system into a depression both agencies stopped monitoring tropical depression ditra following day on january 29 passed just east of rodrigues bringing heavy rains moderate tropical storm esitera on february 9 mfr first classified system as a tropical depression about east of northern tip of madagascar never warned on by jtwc storm moved southwest after briefly weakening into a tropical disturbance storm suddenly re intensified into a moderate tropical storm as esitera re curved to southwest on february 11 mfr stopped keeping an eye on system moderate tropical storm gerimena on february 11 mfr reported that a moderate tropical storm formed over east of reunion storm erratically drifted south for two days when jtwc declared system a tropical depression subsequently system turned north northwest and slowed data from mf suggests that moderate tropical storm gerimena rapidly degenerated tropical disturbance before slowly re intensifying however jtwc suggests it gradually intensified before turning west jtwc upgraded system into a tropical storm midday on february 14 according to jtwc gerimena reached a secondary peak with winds of before weakening a little meanwhile mfr upgraded system back to moderate tropical storm status slowly intensifying gerimena turned south although jtwc suggest that gerimena briefly weakened on january 18 while turning east data from mfr shows that gerimena did not weaken until 1800 utc february 19 on january 20 however both agencies agree that gerimena started to re intensify next day jtwc reported that storm intensified into a hurricane even though mfr suggests that system was just a disturbance by that time not long after becoming a hurricane jtwc remarked that cyclone gerimena had attained peak intensity shortly thereafter data from jtwc suggests that gerimena weakened as it turned southeast then it turned east southeast on february 24 gerimena briefly level off in intensity while turning back to south furthermore jtwc stopped keeping an eye on gerimena at 0000 utc on february 26 as storm re curved east however mfr continued to track gerimena until march 4 as it fluctuated in intensity for several days storm dropped heavy rainfall on reunion reaching severe tropical storm feliska on february 12 mfr first designated what would later become feliska while it was centered north of mozambique channel next day mfr downgraded feliska into a tropical depression hours later jtwc first monitored system drifting east depression gradually intensified mfr reported that system regained moderate tropical storm intensity at 1800 utc that day early on february 13 jtwc upgraded feliska into a tropical storm as it turned north while slowing gaining strength feliska turned east by 0000 utc february 16 mfr declared that feliska attained peak intensity moreover jtwc suggested that feliska had peaked in intensity with winds of thereafter feliska turned south and start a slow weakening trend on february 17 feliska briefly weakened into a tropical depression that night feliska was re upgraded into a moderate tropical storm as it made landfall along northeastern madagascar at that time of landfall jtwc estimated that feliska was still a tropical storm after moving inland mfr stopped monitoring system though jtwc kept tracking feliska for another 24 hours as it headed southeast tropical cyclone helisaonina on april 10 mfr reportedly classified a low far from any land masses later that day jtwc upgraded helisaonina into a tropical depression after turning from west to southwest on april 11 mfr upgraded system into a severe tropical storm at 0600 utc next day jtwc upgraded system into a hurricane while mfr upgraded system into tropical cyclone intensity that evening jtwc announced that it had developed winds equivalent to category 2 intensity two days after becoming a severe tropical storm on april 13 jtwc upgraded helisaonina to equivalent to a category 3 hurricane while undergoing a counterclockwise loop jtwc reported that cyclone helisaonina had peaked in intensity with winds at that time 000 utc april 14 mfr estimated it attained peak wind speed with winds of after attaining peak intensity storm weakened rapidly as it began to move west northwest later that morning mfr downgraded system into a severe tropical storm by april 15 mfr downgraded system into a tropical depression that very day jtwc reported that winds of helisaonina had fallen below hurricane force during morning hours of april 17 jtwc downgraded helisaonina into a depression shortly thereafter mfr stopped monitoring system after re curving just east of madagascar helisaonina dissipated according to jtwc on april 18
