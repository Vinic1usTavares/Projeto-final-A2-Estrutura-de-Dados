stropharia caerulea commonly known as blue roundhead is an inedible species of agaric fungus in family strophariaceae it is a common species found in europe and north america where it grows as a in meadows roadsides hedgerows gardens and woodchip mulch s caerulea was officially described to science in 1979 although it was known to be a distinct species for about two centuries before that taxon stropharia cyanea as defined by risto tuomikoski in 1953 and used by several later authors is a synonym of s caerulea fruit bodies mushrooms of stropharia caerulea feature a greenish blue cap sparsely covered in white flecks of veil at margin and a sticky glutinous surface texture gills on cap underside have an adnate or sinuate attachment to stipe they are initially pale purplish brown becoming darker brown in age as spores mature greenish stipe is covered in white scales up to a thin transient ring it is similar in appearance to its less common relative stropharia aeruginosa but that species has a more robust ring on its stipe more scales on cap and darker gills with white edges taxonomy in 1953 finnish scientist risto tuomikoski observed that well known stropharia aeruginosa had a lookalike species that was characterized by a brown spore print an indistinct temporary ring on stipe and chrysocystidia lining gill edges tuomikoski called this lookalike stropharia cyanea a name he based on james bolton s 1820 taxon agaricus cyaneus later researchers confirmed existence and widespread european distribution of this taxon tuomikoski s use of name s cyanea however was incorrect as bolton s type refers to purple brown spored species s aeruginosa despite this misapplied name s cyanea has persisted in some contemporary field guides stropharia caerulea was first mentioned in scientific literature by james bolton in 1788 under name agaricus this usage is not considered valid according to nomenclatural rules because it was used by christian hendrik persoon to refer to another species in his 1801 synopsis methodica fungorum which is a sanctioned work stropharia caerulea was officially described by mycologist hanns kreisel in 1979 from collections made near germany transferred species to psilocybe in 1995 but today this genus is mostly reserved for species that contain psychoactive compounds psilocybin and psilocin although psilocybin had once been reported from s caerulea subsequent analyses have not revealed any traces of substance in fruit bodies specific epithet caerulea is latin for blue mushroom is commonly known as blue roundhead french mycologist regis has called mushroom verdigris agaric but numerous other authors use this name to refer instead to stropharia aeruginosa description thumb left a prominent characteristic is smooth and scaly surface upper and lower stipe texture divided by a short lived annular zone fruitbodies have conical to flattened caps measuring in diameter they usually have a low broad umbo colour of cap depends on its age ranging from pale blue green to yellowish bluish green there is often a whitish zone around margin which invariably has bluish green tints when moist cap is sticky with a cuticle that may be readily peeled dry caps are smooth and shiny gills are initially pale purplish brown becoming darker brown in age as spores mature they have an adnate or sinuate attachment to stipe stipe has a short lived annular ring zone above this zone stipe is smooth while below it is fibrous and scaly flesh is colourless although it may have tinges of blue in cap and stipe and lacks any distinctive odour or flavour stropharia cyanea fruit bodies are not edible spore print is brown spores typically measure 8 0 9 0 by 4 0 5 5 um and have an ellipsoid to oblong to ovoid shape depending on viewing angle basidia spore bearing cells are narrowly club shaped four spored and have dimensions of 24 40 by 7 12 um found on gill edge are club shaped measuring 30 55 by 4 40 um with a neck that is 2 5 um wide on gill face are 40 60 by 5 18 um with a 2 4 um wide neck clamp connections are abundant in all tissues of s caerulea fungus produces spiny cells produced on short branches on mycelium similar species thumb right lookalike s aeruginosa has white scales around its cap margin there are a few greenish stropharia with which s caerulea might be confused stropharia is an uncommon species that grows in meadows it has a more slender form than s caerulea a soft spongy stipe and flesh with an odour similar to fresh pepper microscopically it has a dense palisade of slender with a spherical tip non staining cheilocystidia on gill edge this gives gills of young fresh fruit bodies a whitish edge a feature that is absent from s caerulea another lookalike s aeruginosa is less common than s caerulea it is distinguished from latter by well developed ring zone on its stipe darker gills with white edges and more numerous whitish scales around cap margin additionally s aeruginosa has more stable colours than s caerulea colouration of which tends to quickly wash out however collections of stropharia often show characteristics that are intermediate between two or more species making them difficult to identify accurately habitat distribution and ecology stropharia caerulea is a saprophytic fungus that fruits singly or in groups it grows in or on meadows roadsides hedgerows gardens and woodchip mulch in europe it is often found in beech woods in alkaline soil it is a common species found throughout europe where it fruits from july to november although also found in north america generally fruiting from august to october full extent of its distribution there is unknown fruitbodies of stropharia caerulea form mycelial cords rootlike structures consisting of a dense mass of hyphae which create extensive underground networks that move nutrients and allow fungus to forage for resources these cords are often associated with stems and rhizomes of common nettle urtica dioica these mycelial systems development and species s interactions with other cord forming wood basidiomycetes have been investigated mycelia of stropharia caerulea form a fractal structure characterized by a dense relatively slowly extending front a formation associated with finding relatively homogeneously distributed nutrients equivalent to short range foraging an increase in supply of soil nitrogen or phosphorus increases fractal branching of mycelia allowing increased uptake of nutrients notes references external links category fungi described in 1979 category fungi of europe category
