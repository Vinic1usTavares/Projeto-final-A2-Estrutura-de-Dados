william edgar borah june 29 1865 january 19 1940 was an outspoken republican united states senator one of best known figures in idaho s history a progressive who served from 1907 until his death in 1940 borah is often considered an isolationist for he led irreconcilables senators who would not accept treaty of versailles senate ratification of which would have made u s part of league of nations borah was born in rural illinois to a large farming family he studied at university of kansas and became a lawyer in that state before seeking greater opportunities in idaho he quickly rose in law and in state politics and after a failed run for house of representatives in 1896 and one for united states senate in 1903 was elected to senate in 1907 before he took his seat in december of that year he was involved in two prominent legal cases one murder conspiracy trial of big bill haywood gained borah fame though haywood was found not guilty and other a prosecution of borah for land fraud made him appear a victim of political malice even before his acquittal in senate borah became one of progressive insurgents who challenged president william howard taft s policies though borah refused to support former president theodore roosevelt s third party bid against taft in 1912 borah reluctantly voted for war in 1917 and once it concluded he fought against versailles treaty and senate did not ratify it remaining a maverick borah often fought with republican presidents in office between 1921 and 1933 though coolidge offered to make borah his running mate in 1924 borah campaigned for hoover in 1928 something he rarely did for presidential candidates and never did again deprived of his post as chairman of senate foreign relations committee when democrats took control of senate in 1933 borah agreed with some of new deal legislation but opposed other proposals he ran for republican nomination for president in 1936 but party regulars were not inclined to allow a longtime maverick to head ticket in his final years he felt he might be able to settle differences in europe by meeting with hitler though he did not go this has not enhanced his historical reputation borah died in 1940 his statue presented by state of idaho in 1947 stands in national statuary hall collection childhood and early career william edgar borah was born in jasper township illinois near fairfield in wayne county his parents were farmers elizabeth west and william nathan borah borah was distantly related to katharina von bora catholic nun who left her convent in 16th century and married reformer martin luther his borah ancestors came to america in about 1760 fought in revolutionary war and moved west with frontier young william e borah was seventh of ten children and third son although borah was not a good student at an early age he began to love oratory and written word borah was educated at tom s prairie school near fairfield when borah exhausted its rudimentary resources his father sent him in 1881 to southern illinois academy a cumberland presbyterian academy at enfield to train for ministry 63 students there included two future u s senators borah and wesley jones who would represent state of washington two often debated as schoolboys instead of becoming a preacher borah was in 1882 expelled for hitching rides on illinois central to spend night in town of carmi he ran away from home with an itinerant shakespearean company but his father persuaded him to return in his late teenage years he became interested in law and later stated i can t remember when i didn t want to be a lawyer there is no other profession where one can be absolutely independent with his father finally accepting his ambition to be a lawyer rather than a clergyman borah in 1883 went to live with his sister sue in lyons kansas her husband ansel m lasley was an attorney borah initially worked as a teacher but became so engrossed in historical topics at town library that he was ill prepared for class he and school parted ways in 1885 borah enrolled at university of kansas and rented an inexpensive room in a professor s home in lawrence he studied alongside students who would become prominent such as william allen white and fred funston borah was working his way through college but his plans were scuttled when he contracted tuberculosis in early 1887 he had to return to lyons where his sister nursed him to health and he began to read law under his brother in law lasley s supervision borah passed bar examination in september 1887 and went into partnership with his brother in law mayor of lyons appointed borah as city attorney in 1889 but young lawyer felt that he was destined for bigger things than a small kansas town suffering in hard times that persisted on prairie in late 1880s and early 1890s following advice attributed to horace greeley borah chose to go west and grow up with country in october 1890 uncertain of his destination he boarded union pacific railroad in omaha on advice of a gambler on board train borah decided to settle in boise idaho his biographer marian c mckenna said that boise was as far west as his pocketbook would take him pre senate career idaho lawyer idaho had been admitted to union earlier in 1890 and boise state capital was a boom town where police and courts were not yet fully effective borah s first case was referred to him by gambler who had advised him on board train young attorney was asked to defend a man accused of murder for shooting a chinese immigrant in back borah gained an unasked for dismissal when judge decided that killing a chinese male was at worst manslaughter borah prospered in boise both in law and in politics in 1892 he became head of republican state central committee he served as political secretary to governor william j mcconnell in 1895 borah married governor s daughter mary mcconnell they were married until borah s death but had no children together idaho a mining state was fraught with labor tensions and related violence was common by both employers and workers in 1899 there was a strike and a large group of miners dynamited facilities belonging to a mining company that refused to recognize union they had hijacked a train to travel to destroy company s plant someone in mob shot and killed a governor frank steunenberg declared martial law and had more than one thousand miners arrested paul corcoran secretary of union was charged with murder borah was engaged as a prosecutor in a trial that began at wallace on july 8 1899 prosecution witnesses testified to having seen corcoran sitting on top of train rifle in hand and later leaping to platform defense contended that given sharp curves and rough roadbed of rail line no one could have sat on top of train nor jumped from it without severe injury borah took jury to train line and demonstrated how corcoran could have acted he drew on his skills as a teenage rail rider to ride top of train and jump from it to platform without injury corcoran was convicted but his death sentence was commuted he was pardoned in 1901 after steunenberg left office borah gained wide acclaim for his dramatic prosecution of case senate contender in 1896 borah joined many idahoans including senator fred dubois in bolting republican party to support presidential campaign of democrat william jennings bryan free silver which bryan advocated was extremely popular in idaho borah thus became a silver republican in opposition to campaign of republican presidential candidate former ohio governor william mckinley borah ran for house of representatives that year but knew that with silver vote split between himself and a democrat populist fusion candidate he had little chance of winning he concentrated on making speeches aimed at gaining a legislature that would re elect dubois until 1913 state legislatures chose senators bryan dubois and borah were all defeated in 1898 borah supported spanish american war and remained loyal to silver republicans by 1900 borah deemed silver issue of minimal importance due to increased gold production and national prosperity with other former silverites he made an unapologetic return to republican party he made speeches for mckinley who was re elected bryan however took idaho s electoral votes for a second time dubois though nominally remaining a silver republican gained control of state democratic party and was returned to us senate by idaho legislature borah s legal practice had made him prominent in southern idaho and in 1902 he sought election to senate by this time a united republican party was deemed likely to defeat democratic populist combine that had ruled idaho for past six years 1902 idaho state republican convention showed that borah had likely most support among people but choice of senator was generally dictated by caucus of majority party in legislature in 1902 election republicans retook control electing a governor of their party as well as state s only house member and a large majority in legislature three other republicans were seeking senate seat including weldon b heyburn a mining lawyer from northern part of state when legislature met in early 1903 borah led on early caucus ballots but then other candidates withdrew and backed heyburn he was chosen by caucus and then by legislature there were many rumors of corruption in choice of heyburn and borah determined that defeat would not end his political career he decided to seek seat of senator dubois by then a democrat when it was filled by legislature in early 1907 at state convention at pocatello in 1904 borah made a speech in support of election of theodore roosevelt for a full term as president which was widely applauded but old guard republicans in idaho opposed him and they were determined to defeat borah in his second bid for senate same year dubois damaged his prospects for a third term by his opposition to appointment of h smith woolley a member of church of jesus christ of latter day saints many idahoans adhered to that faith as assayer in charge of united states assay office at boise dubois had advanced politically through anti mormonism in 1880s but issue was more or less dead in idaho by 1904 woolley was confirmed by u s senate despite dubois s opposition and rufus g cook in his article on affair suggested that dubois was baited into acting by borah and his supporters result was that borah attacked dubois for anti mormonism in both 1904 and 1906 which played well in heavily mormon counties in southeast idaho borah campaigned to end caucus s role in selecting republican nominee for senate arguing that it should be decided by people in a convention he drafted a resolution based on one passed by 1858 illinois republican convention that had endorsed abraham lincoln for senate in his unsuccessful race against stephen douglas he made a deal with a potential republican rival governor frank gooding whereby borah would be nominated for senate and gooding for re election and on august 1 1906 both men received state convention s endorsement by acclamation dubois was democratic choice and borah campaigned in support of president roosevelt argued that republicans had brought nation prosperity and urged law and order voters re elected gooding and selected a republican legislature which in january 1907 retired dubois by electing borah to senate haywood trial lumber accusations borah presented his credentials at senate prior to formal beginning of his first term on march 4 1907 until 1933 congress s regular session began in december allowing borah time to participate in two major trials one of these boosted him to national prominence for his role in prosecution of big bill haywood and other with borah as defendant placed him at risk of going to prison haywood was tried for conspiracy in murder of ex governor steunenberg who was assassinated on december 30 1905 by a bomb planted on gate at his home in caldwell borah who viewed steunenberg as a father figure was among prominent idahoans who hurried to caldwell and who viewed steunenberg s shattered body and bloodstained snow suspicion quickly fell on a man registered at a local hotel who proved to be harry orchard an explosives expert and assassin many labor leaders were embittered against steunenberg for his actions while in office and orchard implicated four of them three who could be found including haywood were extradited from colorado to idaho in february 1906 as legal challenges through courts case became a campaign issue both for gooding who had signed extradition warrant and for borah who joined prosecution team and stated that trying case was more important to him than being sent to senate while haywood defendants awaited trial borah and others were indicted in federal court for land fraud having to do with acquisition by barber lumber company for which borah had been counsel of title to timber land claims individuals had filed for claims and then sold them to barber company although they had sworn that claims were for their own use united states attorney for idaho norman m ruick had expanded grand jury from 12 members to 22 before he could get a majority vote to indict borah by a 12 10 margin indictment was perceived to be political with ruick acting on behalf of idaho republicans who had lost state party leadership to new senator roosevelt took a wait and see attitude upsetting borah who considered resigning his senate seat even if exonerated haywood was first tried of three defendants jury selection began on may 9 1907 and proceedings in boise continued for over two months courtroom corridors and even lawn outside were often filled counsel for prosecution included borah and future governor james h hawley famed attorney clarence darrow led defense team a highlight of trial was borah s cross examination of haywood who denied personal animus against steunenberg and any connection with death another was borah s final argument for prosecution in rebuttal to darrow on july 25 and 26 borah recalled night of ex governor s murder although darrow won day gaining an acquittal for haywood trial transformed borah from an obscure freshman senator into a national figure but borah still had to face a jury on land fraud charge which he did in september 1907 a trial held then at roosevelt s insistence ruick had asked for more time but borah wanted matter disposed of before congress met in december borah refused to challenge indictment at trial his counsel allowed ruick free rein judge commented on ruick s inability to tie borah to any offense defense case consisted almost entirely of borah s testimony and jury quickly acquitted him setting off wild celebrations in boise roosevelt dismissed ruick as us attorney in 1908 senator 1907 1940 progressive insurgent 1907 1913 when borah went to washington for senate s regular session in december 1907 he was immediately a figure of note not only for dramatic events in idaho but for keeping his western habits including wearing a ten gallon hat it was customary then for junior senators to wait perhaps a year before giving their maiden speech but at roosevelt s request in april 1908 borah spoke in defense of president s dismissal of more than 100 african american soldiers in brownsville affair in texas cause of their innocence had been pressed by fiery ohio senator joseph b foraker soldiers were accused of having shot up a texas town near their military camp borah said that their alleged actions were as wrongful as murder of steunenberg accusations were later re investigated government concluded that soldiers had been accused because of racist officials in town and in 1972 long after deaths of roosevelt borah and most of soldiers their dishonorable discharges from military were reversed republican leaders had heard that borah was an attorney for corporations who had prosecuted labor leaders they believed him sympathetic to their old guard positions and assigned him to important committees borah believed in rights of unions so long as they did not commit violent acts when borah staked out progressive positions after his swearing in rhode island senator nelson aldrich powerful chairman of senate finance committee hoped to put pressure on him through westerner s corporate clients only to find that he had given up those representations before coming to washington borah became one of a growing number of progressive republicans in senate yet borah often opposed liberal legislation finding fault with it or fearing it would increase power of federal government throughout his years in senate in which he would serve until his death in 1940 his idiosyncratic positions would limit his effectiveness as a reformer after roosevelt s hand picked successor as president former secretary of war william howard taft was inaugurated in march 1909 congress battled over what became payne aldrich tariff at time tariffs were main source of government revenue and conflicts over them were passionate party platform had promised tariff reform which progressive insurgents like borah took to mean tariff reductions old guard legislators like senator aldrich disagreed and final version actually raised rates by about one percent battles alienated borah from taft who in a speech at winona minnesota described new law as best tariff country had ever had borah and other progressives had proposed an income tax to be attached to tariff bill when this was unacceptable to taft who feared supreme court would strike it down again borah repackaged it as a constitutional amendment which passed senate unanimously and then house and to surprise of many passed requisite number of state legislatures by 1913 to become sixteenth amendment borah also had a hand in other constitutional amendment to be ratified in 1913 seventeenth amendment providing for direct election of senators by people in 1909 due to borah s influence idaho legislature passed an act for a statewide election for us senators with legislators in theory bound to choose winner by 1912 over 30 states had similar laws borah promoted amendment in senate in 1911 and 1912 until it passed congress and after a year it was ratified by states with power to elect senators having passed to people according to mckenna popular borah secured for himself a life option on a seat in senate borah opposed taft over a number of issues and in march 1912 announced his support of candidacy of roosevelt over taft for republican presidential nomination most delegates to 1912 republican national convention in chicago selected by primary supported roosevelt but as most states held conventions to select delegates taft s control of party machinery gave him advantage a number of states especially in south had contested delegate seats matters which would be initially settled by republican national committee borah was idaho s republican national committeeman and was one of those designated by roosevelt campaign to fight for it on rnc as taft controlled committee borah found few victories borah was among those who tried to find a compromise candidate and was spoken of for that role but all such efforts failed when it became clear taft would be renominated roosevelt and his supporters bolted party former president asked borah to chair organizational meeting of his new progressive party but idahoan refused borah would not countenance leaving republican party and did not support any of presidential candidates democrats nominated new jersey governor woodrow wilson when roosevelt came to boise on a campaign swing in october borah felt he had to greet former president and sit on platform as roosevelt spoke though he was unwilling to endorse him roosevelt told in his speech of a long list of state delegate votes he said had been stolen from him and after each turned to borah and asked isn t that so senator borah giving him no choice but to nod it is not clear whether borah voted for roosevelt or taft he later stated both at different times main issue in idaho was borah s re election which was so popular that those disgruntled at senator for not supporting taft or roosevelt kept quiet idahoans helped elect wilson but sent 80 republican legislators out of 86 to boise with two of six democrats pledged to support borah if necessary who on january 14 1913 returned william borah for a second term wilson years prewar 1913 1917 republicans both lost presidency with wilson s inauguration and went into minority in senate in reshuffle of committee assignments that followed borah was given a seat on foreign relations he would occupy it for next quarter century becoming one of america s leading figures on international affairs borah generally approved of many of wilson s proposals but found reasons to vote against them he voted against federal reserve act of 1913 after gaining a concession that no banker would initially be appointed to federal reserve board borah believed monopolies public and private should be broken up and believed new federal trade commission would prove a means for trusts to control their regulators he voted against bill and stated he would not support confirmation of first commissioners clayton antitrust act borah opined was merely a means by which congress could appear to be dealing with trusts without actually doing so in 1913 and early 1914 borah clashed with wilson and his secretary of state bryan over latin american policy borah believed that there was an ongoing temptation for u s to expand into latin america which construction of panama canal had made worse if u s did so local population would have to be subjugated or incorporated into american political structure neither of which he deemed possible believing that nations should be left unmolested by greater powers borah decried american interference in latin american governments he and wilson clashed over policy towards mexico then in throes of revolution wilson decided that mexican government led by victoriano huerta must pledge elections in which huerta would not run before being recognized although borah disliked huerta as too close to pre revolutionary leadership he felt that mexicans should decide who ran mexico and argued against wilson s plan after world war i began in 1914 it was borah s view that u s should keep completely out of it and he voted for legislation requested by wilson barring armament shipments to belligerents borah was disquieted when wilson permitted credits to great britain and france after refusing them loans as credits served same purpose furthering war he was vigilant in support of neutral rights of united states and was outraged both by 1915 sinking of lusitania by germans and by infringements against americans by british forces borah was spoken of as a possible candidate for president in 1916 but gained little support old guard disliked him almost as much as they did roosevelt while others questioned whether a man so free from discipline of party could lead its ranks borah stated he lacked money to run he did work behind scenes to find a candidate that would reunite republicans and holdout progressives a member of a joint committee of two parties conventions to seek re unification borah achieved a friendly reception when he addressed progressive convention republicans nominated charles evans hughes and progressive leaders reluctantly backed him but some former roosevelt supporters refused to support hughes borah campaigned for republican presidential candidate something he would do only once more for hoover in 1928 but wilson narrowly won re election world war and versailles treaty 1917 1920 after germany resumed unlimited submarine warfare in early 1917 many considered u s entry into war inevitable though borah expressed hope it might still be avoided nevertheless he supported wilson on legislation to arm merchant ships and voted in favor when president requested a declaration of war in april 1917 he made it clear that in his view u s was going in to defend its own rights and had no common interest with allies beyond defeat of central powers he repeated this often through war united states sought no territory and had no interest in french and british desires for territory and colonies borah though a strong war supporter was possibly most prominent wartime advocate of progressive views opposing draft and espionage act of 1917 and pressing wilson for statements of limited war aims borah s term was to expire in 1919 never a wealthy person and hard hit by high cost of living in wartime washington he considered leaving senate and practicing law in a major new york firm however he felt needed in senate and in idaho as both of state s seats would be up for election in november 1918 due to death of borah s junior colleague james h brady even president wilson urged borah s re election in a letter to former senator dubois borah received two thirds of vote in his bid for a third term while former governor gooding narrowly won brady s seat nationally republicans retook control of senate with a 49 47 majority that war would not last long beyond election was clear in final days of 1918 congressional midterm election campaign which was fought in part to decide which party would control postwar peace process wilson hoped for a treaty based on fourteen points and had urged formation of a postwar organization to assure peace borah well aware u s would play a large role at peace table saw such an organization as a trap that would inevitably involve u s whenever conflict developed in europe he decided to oppose wilson s plan despite his personal admiration for president like many westerners borah held agrarian ideals and linked them with a policy of isolationism and avoiding foreign entanglements he believed had served nation well borah took pains throughout battle to stress that he had opposed principle of a league before it became a partisan issue according to mckenna in borah s league fight of partisanship jealousy or personal hostility there is no trace thumb left borah seated at left lodge and california s hiram johnson refuse to yield their seats to peace republicans felt wilson was making a political issue of peace especially when president urged a democratic congress prior to 1918 election and attended paris peace conference in person taking no republicans on his delegation wilson had felt his statement was only chance of getting a senate that might ratify a treaty for a postwar organization to keep peace and deemed conciliation pointless in paris wilson and other leaders negotiated what would become league of nations an international organization that world leaders hoped that through diplomacy and if necessary force would assure peace republican senatorial opinion ranged from irreconcilables like borah who would not support any organization to those who strongly favored one none wanted wilson to go into 1920 presidential election with credit for having sorted out europe once general terms of treaty of versailles which included charter of league of nations were presented by wilson in february 1919 henry cabot lodge of massachusetts incoming senate majority leader decided on a strategy rather than outright opposition republicans would offer reservations to treaty that wilson could not accept a week after wilson presented treaty borah declined an invitation to white house extended to him and other senate and house members on foreign relations committees alleging there was no chance of common ground though he wrote to wilson s private secretary that no insult was intended in following months borah was a leader of irreconcilables an especial target was article x of charter obligating all members to defend each other s independence irreconcilables argued that this would commit u s to war without its consent borah stated that u s might be forced to send thousands of men if there was conflict in armenia other provisions were examined borah proposed that u s representatives in paris be asked to press issue of irish independence but senate took no action borah found provisions of treaty regarding germany to be shocking in their vindictiveness and feared they might snuff out new weimar republic at birth small republican majority in senate made irreconcilable votes necessary to lodge s strategy and he met with borah in april 1919 persuading him to go along with plan of delay and reservations as most likely to succeed as it would allow initial popular support for wilson s proposal to diminish neither senator really liked or trusted other but they formed a wary pact to defeat treaty lodge was also chairman of senate foreign relations committee and he delayed treaty by convening a lengthy series of hearings presiding over a committee packed with irreconcilables including borah as these hearings continued in summer of 1919 wilson undertook a speaking tour by train to get public to press senate for ratification a tour that ended in his collapse in months that followed an ailing wilson refused any compromise borah helped write majority report for committee recommending 45 amendments and 4 reservations in november 1919 senate defeated both versions of treaty of versailles with and without what were called lodge reservations borah delighted proclaimed day greatest since end of civil war following january senate considered treaty again and lodge wanted to convene a bipartisan group of senators to find a compromise borah threatening party schism met with lodge behind closed doors and lodge withdrew his plan senate voted once more in march 1920 on treaty with a version of lodge reservations and it failed again according to robert james maddox in his book on borah s influence on american foreign policy irreconcilables dictated to majority leader as though they were majority borah as much as any man deserves credit or blame for league s defeat harding and coolidge years borah was determined to see that republican presidential candidate in 1920 was not pro league he supported his fellow irreconcilable california senator hiram johnson who had been roosevelt s running mate in 1912 borah alleged bribery on part of leading candidate for republican nomination general leonard wood and was snubbed when he demanded to know league views of wood s main rival illinois governor frank lowden when 1920 republican national convention met in chicago in june delegates faced a deadlock both as to who should head ticket and as to contents of league plank of party platform league fight was decided with borah s endorsement by using language proposed by former secretary of state elihu root supporting a league rather than league presidential stalemate was harder to resolve a hater both of political intrigue and of tobacco borah played no part in smoke filled room discussions as republicans attempted to break deadlock he was initially unenthusiastic about eventual nominee ohio senator warren g harding his colleague on foreign relations committee as he was disappointed at failure of johnson s candidacy and disliked harding s vague stance on league nevertheless borah strongly endorsed harding and his running mate massachusetts governor calvin coolidge who were victorious borah later stated he would have left senate had harding lost borah proved as idiosyncratic as ever in his views with harding as president original idea for washington naval conference of 1921 22 came from a resolution he introduced in december 1920 after new secretary of state charles hughes took idea borah became an opponent convinced conference would lead united states into league of nations through back door in 1921 when harding nominated former president taft as chief justice borah was one of four senators to oppose confirmation borah stated that taft at 63 was too old and as a politician had been absent for decades from practice of law in 1922 and 1923 borah spoke against passage of dyer anti lynching bill which had passed house a strong supporter of state sovereignty he believed that punishing state officials for failure to prevent lynchings was unconstitutional and that if states could not prevent such murders federal legislation would do no good bill was defeated by filibuster in senate by southern democrats when another bill was introduced in 1935 and 1938 borah continued to speak against it by that time saying that it was no longer needed as number of lynchings had dropped sharply harding s death in august 1923 brought calvin coolidge to white house borah had been dismayed by harding s conservative views and believed coolidge had shown liberal tendencies as a governor he met with coolidge multiple times in late 1923 and found new president interested in his ideas on policies foreign and domestic borah was encouraged when coolidge included in his annual message to congress a suggestion that he might open talks with soviet union on trade bolshevik government had not been recognized since 1917 october revolution and borah had long urged relations under pressure from old guard coolidge quickly walked back his proposal depressing borah who concluded president had deceived him in early 1924 teapot dome scandal broke and although coolidge had no involvement in affair some of implicated cabinet officers including attorney general harry daugherty remained in office backed by old guard coolidge sought support of borah in crisis his price was daugherty s firing president stalled borah and when daugherty eventually resigned under pressure it was due more to events than borah when president was nominated for election in his own right at 1924 republican national convention he offered vice presidential nomination to borah by one account when coolidge asked borah to join ticket senator asked which position on it he was to occupy prospect of borah as vice president appalled coolidge s cabinet members and other republican officials and they were relieved when he refused borah spent less than a thousand dollars on his senate re election campaign that fall and gained a fourth term with just under 80 percent of vote coolidge and his vice presidential choice charles g dawes easily won though borah did no campaigning for coolidge dawes ticket alleging his re election bid required his full attention senator lodge died in november 1924 making borah senior member of foreign relations committee and he took its chairmanship he could have become judiciary committee chairman instead as death of frank of connecticut made borah senior republican on that committee as well foreign relations chairmanship greatly increased his influence one quip was that new secretary of state frank b kellogg created policy by ringing borah s doorbell borah continued to oppose american interventions in latin america often splitting from republican majority over matter borah was an avid horseback rider and coolidge is supposed to have commented after viewing him exercising in rock creek park that it must bother senator to be going in same direction as his horse borah was involved through 1920s in efforts for outlawry of war chicago lawyer salmon levinson who had formulated plan to outlaw war labored long to get mercurial borah on board as its spokesman maddox suggested that borah was most enthusiastic about this plan when he needed it as a constructive alternative to defeat actions such as entry into world court that he deemed entangling u s abroad by time of 1924 election levinson was frustrated with borah but coolidge s statement after election that outlawry was one of issues he proposed to address briefly resurrected borah s enthusiasm only to have it fall away again it was not until 1927 when french foreign minister aristide briand proposed u s and his nation enter into an agreement to outlaw war that borah became interested again though it took months of pestering by levinson in december 1927 borah introduced a resolution calling for a multilateral version of briand s proposal and once kellogg briand pact was negotiated and signed by various nations secured ratification for that treaty by senate hoover and fdr borah hoped to be elected president in 1928 but his only chance was a deadlocked republican convention he was reluctant to support secretary of commerce herbert hoover for president backing ohio senator frank willis instead but after willis collapsed and died at a campaign rally in late march borah began to find hoover more to his liking idahoan s support for hoover became more solid as campaign began to shape as a rural urban divide borah was a strong backer of prohibition and fact that hoover was another dry influenced borah in his support senator disliked democratic candidate new york governor al smith an opponent of prohibition considering him a creature of tammany hall though montana senator thomas j walsh commented on borah s recent conversion to hoover and some progressives were disheartened borah undertook a lengthy campaign tour warning that he saw success of tammany in national politics as nothing less than a national disaster hoover was elected and thanked borah for enormous effect of his support he offered to make borah secretary of state though deploring loss to senate but borah declined thumb upright 1 3 hoover seated with senators and cabinet officers 1930 borah stands directly behind his chair borah was not personally harmed by stock market crash of october 1929 having sold any stocks and invested in government bonds thousands of americans had borrowed on margin and were ruined by crash congress in june 1930 passed hawley smoot tariff sharply increasing rates on imports borah was one of 12 republicans who joined democrats in opposing bill which passed senate 44 42 borah was up for election in 1930 and despite a minimal campaign effort took over 70 percent of vote in a bad year for republicans when he returned to washington for lame duck session of senate beginning in december borah pressed passage of legislation that would help business and suggested that members of congress turn back their salary to treasury economy continued to worsen in winter of 1931 and borah urged relief legislation stating that opponents argued that for government to feed this woman and her sick children would destroy her self respect and make a bad citizen of her does anyone believe it it is a cowardly imputation on helpless i resent it and i repudiate it when congress reconvened in december 1931 republicans nominally controlled senate by tie breaking vote of vice president charles curtis but as hoover later wrote there was no real majority as borah and other progressives were against administration after bonus army marched on washington borah and hoover agreed that no action should be taken on their demands so long as ex soldiers remained in capital borah considered their presence intimidating to congress but was angered when they were forcibly dispersed borah considered

only sixteen republicans remained in senate most progressives when congress met in january 1937 but borah retained much influence as he was liked and respected by democrats many of roosevelt s new deal policies such as nra were struck down by supreme court during roosevelt s first term but he had no opportunities to make an appointment to court in his first four years in 1937 he proposed what came to be known as court packing scheme that for every justice over age of seventy an additional one could be appointed this would give roosevelt six picks but would require congress to pass legislation to which borah was immediately opposed believing it would be death of supreme court as an independent institution although he refused to take lead in bipartisan opposition borah wrote a

and other clauses of versailles treaty and saw much of value in his new social and economic programs but he was utterly disgusted and alienated by nazi treatment of jews this did not initially lead

risk a compromise of its faith and a coarsening of its character by active entanglement with old world john chalmers vinson in his volume on borah s involvement with war outlawry movement believed that senator spoke for a large part of american public he was archetype of absolute insistence on unfettered national will that has been loosely described as isolationism further he represented struggle to preserve in full traditions of a small republic remote from strong neighbors against inroads of recurring crises faced by a world power according to leroy ashby in his book on borah he

nations borah perceived threats everywhere thumb upright left statue of borah in statuary hall in capitol by bryant baker 1947 borah s effectiveness as a reformer was undercut by his tendency to

disastrous results borah s comment regretting that he could not have talked to hitler has been repeatedly cited as evidence of naivete in those who believe in power of pure diplomacy conservative commentator charles krauthammer referred to statement in at least three of his columns making an analogy to negotiating with china in 1989 with north korea in 1994 and with iran in 2006 and it was
