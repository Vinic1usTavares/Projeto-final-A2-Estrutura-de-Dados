meteor class was a pair of two avisos built for german kaiserliche marine imperial navy in late 1880s and early 1890s class comprised two ships and unlike earlier avisos built for fleet which were designed to fill a variety of roles meteor class was intended to protect fleet s capital ships from torpedo boat attacks they were armed with a battery of four quick firing guns both vessels suffered from serious problems that rendered them unfit for service namely poor seakeeping and excessive vibration of their propeller shafts as a result they saw little service with comets only periods in commission being to test what were unsuccessful attempts to correct problems meteor had a somewhat more active career serving with fleet in 1893 1894 and then as a fishery protection ship in 1895 1896 but she too spent most of her existence laid up both vessels were decommissioned in 1896 and struck from naval register in 1911 meteor was then used as a barracks ship while comet became a storage hulk two ships were broken up in 1919 and 1921 respectively design imperial navy began building small avisos in 1880s to serve in main fleet in german waters these vessels were intended to support battle line as scouts for fleet as flotilla leaders for fleet s torpedo boats and as a screen against enemy torpedo boats unlike contemporary german unprotected cruisers their designs emphasized offensive capability and high speed rather than a long cruising radius in 1888 german naval command decided that future avisos should be focused solely on defense against hostile torpedo boats compared to earlier s meteor design was slightly smaller and displaced around 25 percent less than earlier vessels primary alterations included a more powerful propulsion system a new gun armament of quick firing guns and slightly thicker armor plating meteor and comet proved to be failures in service they suffered from severe vibration and their small size rendered them poor sea boats these defects significantly curtailed their careers and they spent most of their existence in reserve meteor class was second to last aviso design produced by imperial navy followed only by by 1890s german naval designers had taken best characteristics of avisos and contemporary unprotected cruisers and combined them in of light cruisers first vessels of that type of warship general characteristics and machinery thumb left meteor during her short active career meteor and comet were long at waterline and long overall they had a beam of and a maximum draft of forward meteor displaced as designed and up to at full combat load while comet was slightly heavier at and respectively their hulls were constructed from transverse steel frames meteor was initially fitted with a single pole mainmast while comet had pole mainmast along with a smaller mast further aft for wireless telegraphy in 1901 1902 meteor was fitted with second mast as well meteor class ships had a crew of 7 officers and 108 enlisted men ships carried several smaller boats including one yawl one dinghy and one cutter they were poor sea boats they were very unstable in anything but calm weather they also vibrated excessively due to severe cavitation particularly at high speeds both ships were however very maneuverable vessels their metacentric height was their propulsion system consisted of two vertical 3 cylinder triple expansion engines that drove a pair of wide three bladed screw propellers steam for engines was provided by four coal fired locomotive boilers that were trunked into two funnels on centerline ships were equipped with a pair of electric generators with a combined output of at 67 volts steering was controlled by a single rudder ships propulsion system varied slightly in performance meteors engines were rated at for a top speed of though she exceeded both figures on sea trials reaching a speed of comets engines were rated for and which she did not exceed on her trials both ships had a range of approximately at armament and armor ships were armed with four sk l 30 guns placed in single pivot mounts two side by side forward and two side by side aft guns were supplied with between 462 and 680 rounds of ammunition and they had a range of they also carried three torpedo tubes one mounted submerged in bow and other two in deck mounted launchers on broadside they were supplied with eight torpedoes both ships were protected with steel armor they had a thick deck with thick sloped sides conning tower had thick plating on sides with a 15 mm thick roof ships

date unknown after meteor entered service problems with her design became apparent attempts to remedy defects and sea trials to determine efforts effectiveness occupied much of ship s first two years in service this period also saw ship take part in training exercises with rest of german fleet by 1893 comet had also entered service and she also underwent ultimately ineffective modifications following her initial trials meteor was employed as a fisheries protection vessel in 1895 1896 though she proved unsuited to task owing to her small size which limited amount of coal she could store and thus amount of time she could remain on patrol in germany s coastal waters as a result she was withdrawn from that service in late 1896 comet never saw an extended period of active service her only periods in commission were to conduct trials after alterations were made to ship she too was laid up in 1896 both ships were reclassified as light cruisers in 1899 and then reduced to harbor guard ships in 1904 both were struck from naval register in 1911 with meteor becoming a barracks ship in kiel and comet being converted into a storage hulk for naval mines meteor and comet were sold for scrapping in 1919 and 1921 respectively notes references category avisos of imperial german navy
