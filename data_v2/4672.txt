myxobolus cerebralis is a myxosporean parasite of salmonids salmon trout and their allies that causes whirling disease in farmed salmon and trout and also in wild fish populations it was first described in rainbow trout in germany a century ago but its range has spread and it has appeared in most of europe including russia united states south africa canada and other countries in 1980s m cerebralis was found to require a tubificid oligochaete a kind of segmented worm to complete its life cycle parasite infects its hosts with its cells after piercing them with polar filaments ejected from nematocyst like capsules whirling disease afflicts juvenile fish fingerlings and fry and causes skeletal deformation and neurological damage fish whirl forward in an awkward corkscrew like pattern instead of swimming normally find feeding difficult and are more vulnerable to predators mortality rate is high for fingerlings up to 90 of infected populations and those that do survive are deformed by parasites residing in their cartilage and bone they act as a reservoir for parasite which is released into water following fish s death m cerebralis is one of most economically important myxozoans in fish as well as one of most pathogenic it was first myxosporean whose pathology and symptoms were described scientifically parasite is not transmissible to humans taxonomy taxonomy and naming of both m cerebralis and of myxozoans in general have complicated histories it was originally thought to infect fish brains hence specific epithet cerebralis and nervous systems though it soon was found to primarily infect cartilage and skeletal tissue attempts to change name to myxobolus which would more accurately describe organism failed because of nomenclature rules later organisms previously called triactinomyxon dubium and t class were found to be in fact triactinomyxon stages of m cerebralis life cycle of which was expanded to include triactinomyxon stage similarly other were folded into life cycles of various today myxozoans previously thought to be multicellular protozoans are considered animals by most scientists though their status has not officially changed recent molecular studies suggest they are related to bilateria or cnidaria with cnidaria being closer morphologically because both groups have extrusive filaments bilateria were somewhat closer in some genetic studies but those were found to have used samples that were contaminated by material from host organism and a 2015 study confirms they are cnidarians morphology thumb 150px right diagram of structure of a stage spore of myxobolus cerebralis has many diverse stages ranging from single cells to relatively large spores not all of which have been studied in detail triactinomyxon stage stages that infect fish called triactinomyxon spores are made of a single style that is about 150 micrometers um long and three processes or tails each about 200 micrometers long a sporoplasm packet at end of style contains 64 germ cells surrounded by a cellular envelope there are also three polar capsules each of which contains a coiled polar filament between 170 and 180 um long polar filaments in both this stage and in myxospore stage see picture above rapidly shoot into body of host creating an opening through which sporoplasm can enter sporoplasm stage upon contact with fish hosts and firing of polar capsules sporoplasm contained within central style of triactinomyxon migrates into epithelium or gut lining firstly this sporoplasm undergoes mitosis to produce more amoeboid cells which migrate into deeper tissue layers to reach cerebral cartilage myxosporean stage myxospores which develop from cell stages inside fish hosts are lenticular they have a diameter of about 10 micrometers and are made of six cells two of these cells form polar capsules two merge to form a binucleate sporoplasm and two form protective valves myxospores are infective to oligochaetes and are found among remains of digested fish cartilage they are often difficult to distinguish from related species because of morphological similarities across genera though m cerebralis is only myxosporean ever found in salmonid cartilage other visually similar species may be present in skin nervous system or muscle life cycle thumb 260px life cycle of m cerebralis myxobolus cerebralis has a two host life cycle involving a salmonid fish and a tubificid oligochaete so far only worm known to be susceptible to m cerebralis infection is tubifex tubifex though what scientists currently call t tubifex may in fact be more than one species first myxospores are ingested by tubificid worms in gut lumen of worm spores extrude their polar capsules and attach to gut epithelium by polar filaments shell valves then open along suture line and binucleate germ cell penetrates between intestinal epithelial cells of worm this cell multiplies producing many amoeboid cells by an asexual cell fission process called as a result of multiplication process intercellular space of epithelial cells in more than 10 neighbouring worm segments may become infected around 60 90 days sexual cell stages of parasite undergo and develop into each of which contains eight triactinomyxon stage spores these spores are released from oligochaete anus into water alternatively a fish can become infected by eating an infected oligochaete infected tubificids can release triactinomyxons for at least a year triactinomyxon spores are carried by water currents where they can infect a salmonid through skin penetration of fish by these spores takes only a few seconds within five minutes a sac of germ cells called a sporoplasm has entered fish epidermis and within a few hours sporoplasm splits into individual cells that will spread through fish within fish both intracellular and extracellular stages reproduce in its cartilage by asexual meaning new cells grow from within old cells final stage within fish is creation of myxospore which is formed by they are released into environment when fish decomposes or is eaten some recent research indicates some fish may expel viable myxospores while still alive myxospores are extremely tough it was shown that myxobolus cerebralis spores can tolerate freezing at for at least 3 months aging in mud at for at least 5 months and passage through guts of northern pike esox lucius or mallards anas platyrhynchos without loss of infectivity to worms triactinomyxons are much shorter lived surviving 34 days or less depending on temperature pathology right thumb 250px skeletal deformation in a mature brook trout caused by m cerebralis infection m cerebralis infections have been reported from a wide range of salmonid species eight species of atlantic salmonids salmo four species of pacific salmonids oncorhynchus four species of char salvelinus grayling thymallus thymallus and hucho hucho lom j i 1992 protozoan parasites of fishes elsevier amsterdam m cerebralis causes damage to its fish hosts through attachment of triactinomyxon spores and migrations of various stages through tissues and along nerves as well as by digesting cartilage fish s tail may darken but aside from lesions on cartilage internal organs generally appear healthy other symptoms include skeletal deformities and whirling behavior tail chasing in young fish which was thought to have been caused by a loss of equilibrium but is actually caused by damage to spinal cord and lower brain stem experiments have shown that fish can kill myxobolus in their skin possibly using antibodies but that fish do not attack parasites once they have migrated to central nervous system this response varies from species to species in t tubifex release of triactinomyxon spores from intestinal wall damages worm s mucosa this may happen thousands of times in a single worm and is believed to impair nutrient absorption spores are released from worm almost exclusively when temperature is between 10 degc and 15 degc so fish in warmer or cooler waters are less likely to be infected and infection rates vary seasonally susceptibility fish size age concentration of triactinomyxon spores and water temperature all affect infection rates in fish as does species of fish in question disease has most impact on fish less than five months old because their skeletons have not ossified this makes young fish more susceptible to deformities and provides m cerebralis more cartilage on which to feed in one study of seven species of many strains brook trout and rainbow trout except one strain were far more heavily affected by m cerebralis after two hours of exposure than other species were while bull trout chinook salmon brown trout and arctic grayling were least severely affected while brown trout may harbor parasite they typically do not show any symptoms and this species may have been m cerebralis original host this lack of symptoms in brown trout meant that parasite was only discovered after nonnative rainbow were introduced in europe diagnosis thumb normally uniform trout cartilage is scarred with lesions in which m cerebralis spores develop weakening and deforming connective tissues moderate or heavy clinical infection of fish with whirling disease can be presumptively diagnosed on basis of changes in behavior and appearance about 35 to 80 days after initial infection though injury or deficiency in dietary tryptophan and ascorbic acid can evoke similar signs so conclusive diagnosis may require finding myxospores in fish s cartilage in heavy infections only examining cartilage microscopically may be needed to find spores in less severe infections most common test involves digestion of cranial cartilage with proteases pepsin and trypsin pepsin trypsin digest before looking for spores head and other tissues can be further examined using histopathology to confirm whether location and morphology of spores matches what is known for m cerebralis serological identification of spores in tissue sections using an antibody raised against spores is also possible parasite identity can also be confirmed using polymerase chain reaction to amplify 415 base pair

because species is endemic to this region giving native fish stocks a degree of immunity rainbow trout most susceptible species to this parasite are not native to europe successfully reproducing feral populations are rare so few wild rainbow trout are young enough to be susceptible to infection on other hand they are widely reared for restocking sport fishing waters and for aquaculture where this parasite has its greatest impact hatching and rearing methods designed to prevent infection of rainbow trout fry have proved successful in europe these techniques include hatching eggs in spore free water and rearing fry to ossification stage in tanks or raceways these methods give particular attention to quality of water sources to guard against spore introduction during water exchanges fry are moved to earthen ponds only once they are considered to be clinically resistant to parasite after skeletal ossification occurs impact in new cerebralis was first found in new zealand in 1971 parasite

disarmed they would be unable to infect fish but further research is needed to find an effective treatment some strains of fish are more resistant than others even within species using resistant strains may help reduce incidence and severity of whirling disease in aquaculture there is also some circumstantial evidence that fish populations can develop resistance to disease over time whirling disease foundation news july 2003 research on whirling disease resistant rainbow trout additionally may avoid m cerebralis infections by not using earthen ponds for raising young fish this keeps them away from possibly infected tubificids and makes it easier to eliminate spores and oligochaetes through filtration chlorination and ultraviolet bombardment to minimise tubificid populations techniques include periodic disinfection of hatchery or aquaculture ponds and rearing of small trout indoors in pathogen free water smooth faced concrete or plastic lined raceways that are kept clean and free of contaminated water keep aquaculture facilities free of disease lastly some drugs such as fumagillin and have been shown to impede spore development which reduces infection rates for example one study showed that feeding fumagillin to o mykiss reduced number of infected fish from between 73 and 100 to between 10 and 20 unfortunately this treatment is considered unsuitable for wild trout populations and no drug treatment has ever been shown to be effective in studies required for united states food and drug administration approval recreational and sports fishers can help to prevent spread of
