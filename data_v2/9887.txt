mantises are an order mantodea of insects that contains over 2 400 species in about 430 genera in 15 families largest family is mantidae mantids mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats they have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks their elongated bodies may or may not have wings but all mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey their upright posture while remaining stationary with forearms folded has led to common name praying mantis closest relatives of mantises are termites and cockroaches blattodea which are all within superorder dictyoptera mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects phasmatodea other elongated insects such as grasshoppers orthoptera or other unrelated insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantispidae mantises are mostly ambush predators but a few ground dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey they normally live for about a year in cooler climates adults lay eggs in autumn then die eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in spring females sometimes practice sexual cannibalism eating their mates after copulation mantises were considered to have supernatural powers by early civilizations including ancient greece ancient egypt and assyria a cultural trope popular in cartoons imagines female mantis as a femme fatale mantises are among insects most commonly kept as pets taxonomy and evolution over 2 400 species of mantis in about 430 genera are recognized they are predominantly found in tropical regions but some live in temperate areas systematics of mantises have long been disputed mantises along with stick insects phasmatodea were once placed in order orthoptera with cockroaches now blattodea and rock crawlers now kristensen 1991 combined mantodea with cockroaches and termites into order dictyoptera suborder mantodea name mantodea is formed from ancient greek words mantis meaning prophet and eidos meaning form or type it was coined in 1838 by german entomologist hermann burmeister order is occasionally called mantes using a latinized plural of greek mantis name mantid properly refers only to members of family mantidae which was historically only family in order other common name praying mantis applied to any species in order though in europe mainly to mantis religiosa comes from typical prayer like posture with folded forelimbs vernacular plural mantises used in this article was confined largely to us with mantids predominantly used as plural in uk and elsewhere until family mantidae was further split in 2002 bragg p e 1996 mantis mantid mantids mantises mantis study group newsletter 1 4 ehrmann r 2002 mantodea der welt natur und tier munster one of earliest classifications splitting an all inclusive mantidae into multiple families was that proposed by beier in 1968 recognizing eight families though it was not until ehrmann s reclassification into 15 families in 2002 that a multiple family classification became universally adopted klass in 1997 studied external male genitalia and postulated that families chaeteessidae and metallyticidae diverged from other families at an early date however mantidae and thespidae are still both considered polyphyletic so mantodea will have to be revised thumb mantidflies mantispidae related to lacewings but unrelated to mantises have raptorial forelegs somewhat like those of mantises but their wings and antennae differ visibly alt mantispidae looks much like a mantis without leathery forewings earliest mantis fossils are about 135 million years old from siberia fossils of group are rare by 2007 only about 25 fossil species were known fossil mantises including one from japan with spines on front legs as in modern mantises have been found in cretaceous amber most fossils in amber are nymphs compression fossils in rock include adults fossil mantises from crato formation in brazil include long described in 2003 as in modern mantises front legs were adapted for catching prey well preserved specimens yield details as small as 5 mm through x ray computed tomography because of superficially similar raptorial forelegs mantidflies may be confused with mantises though they are unrelated their similarity is an example of convergent evolution mantidflies do not have tegmina leathery forewings like mantises their antennae are shorter and less thread like and raptorial tibia is more muscular than that of a similar sized mantis and bends back further in preparation for shooting out to grasp

male alt mantis wings forewing leathery hind wing triangular mantises have large triangular heads with a beak like snout and mandibles they have two bulbous compound eyes three small simple eyes and a pair of antennae articulation of neck is also remarkably flexible some species of mantis can rotate their heads nearly 180deg mantis thorax consists of a prothorax a mesothorax and a metathorax in all species apart from genus prothorax which bears head and forelegs is much longer than other two thoracic segments prothorax is also flexibly articulated allowing for a wide range of movements of head and fore limbs while remainder of body remains more or less immobile thumb left raptorial foreleg showing unusually long coxa which together with trochanter gives impression of a femur femur itself is proximal segment of grasping part of leg alt raptorial foreleg of a mantis armed with long spines mantises have two spiked grasping forelegs raptorial legs in which prey items are caught and held securely in most insect legs including posterior four legs of a mantis coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of leg in raptorial legs however coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment about as long as femur which is a spiky part of grasping apparatus see illustration located at base of femur is a set of spines usually four in number but ranging from none to as many as five depending on species these spines are preceded by a number of tooth like tubercles which along with a similar series of tubercles along tibia and apical claw near its tip give foreleg of mantis its grasp on its prey foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage made of four or five segments and ending in a two toed claw with no arolium mantises can be loosely categorized as being long winged brachypterous short winged vestigial winged or apterous wingless if not wingless a mantis has two sets of wings outer wings or tegmina are usually narrow and leathery they function as camouflage and as a shield for hind wings which are clearer and more delicate abdomen of all mantises consists of 10 tergites with a corresponding set of nine sternites visible in males and seven visible in females abdomen tends to be slimmer in males than females but ends in a pair of cerci in both sexes vision thumb left head of showing compound eyes and labrum alt head of a mantis with large compound eyes and labrum mantises have stereo vision they locate their prey by sight their compound eyes contain up to 10 000 ommatidia a small area at front called fovea has greater visual acuity than rest of eye and can produce high resolution necessary to examine potential prey peripheral ommatidia are concerned with perceiving motion when a moving object is noticed head is rapidly rotated to bring object into visual field of fovea further motions of prey are then tracked by movements of mantis s head so as to keep image centered on fovea eyes are widely spaced and laterally situated affording a wide binocular field of vision and precise stereoscopic vision at close range dark spot on each eye that moves as it rotates its head is a this occurs because ommatidia that are viewed head on absorb incident light while those to side reflect it as their hunting relies heavily on vision mantises are primarily diurnal many species however fly at night and then may be attracted to artificial lights mantises in family liturgusidae collected at night have been shown to be predominately males this is probably true for most mantises nocturnal flight is especially important to males in locating less mobile females by detecting their pheromones flying at night exposes mantises to fewer bird predators than diurnal flight would many mantises also have an auditory thoracic organ that helps them avoid bats by detecting their echolocation calls and responding evasively diet and predation thumb left mantis eating a common butterfly perseus alt mantis eating a butterfly mantises are generalist predators of arthropods majority of mantises are ambush predators that only feed upon live prey within their reach they either camouflage themselves and remain stationary waiting for prey to approach or stalk their prey with slow stealthy movements larger mantises sometimes eat smaller individuals of their own species as well as small vertebrates such as lizards frogs small birds and fishes thumb tenodera sinensis feeding on a cricket alt mantis eating a cricket most mantises stalk tempting prey if it strays close enough and will go further when they are especially hungry once within reach mantises strike rapidly to grasp prey with their spiked raptorial forelegs some ground and bark species pursue their prey in a more active way for example members of a few genera such as ground mantises entella and ligariella run over dry ground seeking prey much as tiger beetles do thumb ligariella a ground mantid that runs down its prey fore gut of some species extends whole length of insect and can be used to store prey for digestion later this may be advantageous in an insect that feeds intermittently chinese mantises live longer grow faster and produce more young when they are able to eat pollen antipredator adaptations mantises are preyed on by vertebrates such as frogs lizards and birds and by invertebrates such as spiders large species of hornets and ants some hunting wasps such as some species of also paralyse some species of mantis to feed their young generally mantises protect themselves by camouflage most species being cryptically colored to resemble foliage or other backgrounds both to avoid predators and to better snare their prey those that live on uniformly colored surfaces such as bare earth or tree bark are dorsoventrally flattened so as to eliminate shadows that might reveal their presence species from different families called flower mantises are aggressive mimics they resemble flowers convincingly enough to attract prey that come to collect pollen and nectar some species in africa and australia are able to turn black after a molt towards end of dry season at this time of year bush fires occur and this coloration enables them to blend in with fire ravaged landscape fire melanism thumb upright aggressive mimicry malaysian orchid mantises are camouflaged pink or yellow matching coloration of local orchids when directly threatened many mantis species stand tall and spread their forelegs with their wings fanning out wide fanning of wings makes mantis seem larger and more threatening with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs if harassment persists a mantis may strike with its forelegs and attempt to pinch or bite as part of bluffing deimatic threat display some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from abdominal spiracles mantises lack chemical protection so their displays are largely bluff when flying at night at least some mantises are able to detect echolocation sounds produced by bats when frequency begins to increase rapidly indicating an approaching bat they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward safety of ground often preceded by an aerial loop or spin if caught they may slash captors with their raptorial legs mantises like stick insects show rocking behavior in which insect makes rhythmic repetitive side to side movements functions proposed for this behavior include enhancement of crypsis by means of resemblance to vegetation moving in wind however repetitive swaying movements may be most important in allowing insects to discriminate objects from background by their relative movement a visual mechanism typical of animals with simpler sight systems rocking movements by these generally sedentary insects may replace flying or running as a source of relative motion of objects in visual field as ants may be predators of mantises genera such as and like many other arthropods avoid attacking them exploiting this behavior a variety of arthropods including some early instar mantises mimic ants to evade their predators reproduction and life history mating season in temperate climates typically takes place in autumn while in tropical areas mating can occur at any time of year to mate following courtship male usually leaps onto female s back clasping her thorax and wing bases with his forelegs he then arches his abdomen to deposit and store sperm in a special chamber near tip of female s abdomen female lays between 10 and 400 eggs depending on species eggs are typically deposited in a froth mass produced by glands in abdomen this froth hardens creating a protective capsule which together with egg mass is called an ootheca depending on species ootheca can be attached to a flat surface wrapped around a plant or even deposited in ground despite versatility and durability of eggs they are often preyed on especially by several species of parasitoid wasps in a few species mostly ground and bark mantises in family tarachodidae mother guards eggs cryptic maurus positions herself on bark with her abdomen covering her egg capsule ambushing passing prey and moving very little until eggs hatch an unusual reproductive strategy is adopted by brunner s stick mantis from southern united states no males have ever been found in this species and females breed parthenogenetically ability to reproduce by parthenogenesis has been recorded in at least two other species viridis and sp although these species usually reproduce sexually bragg p e 1987 a case of parthenogenesis in a mantis bulletin of amateur entomologists society 46 356 160 dickie s 1996 parthenogenesis in mantids mantis study group newsletter 1 5 in temperate climates adults do not survive winter and eggs undergo a diapause hatching in spring as in closely related insect groups in superorder dictyoptera mantises go through three life stages egg nymph and adult mantises are among hemimetabolous insects for smaller species eggs may hatch in 3 4 weeks as opposed to 4 6 weeks for larger species nymphs may be colored differently from adult and early stages are often mimics of ants a mantis nymph grows bigger as it molts its exoskeleton molting can happen five to 10 times before adult stage is reached depending on species after final molt most species have wings though some species remain wingless or brachypterous short winged particularly in female sex lifespan of a mantis depends on species smaller ones may live 4 8 weeks while larger species may live 4 6 months sexual cannibalism thumb sexual cannibalism in mantis religiosa sexual cannibalism is common among most predatory species of mantises in captivity it has sometimes been observed in natural populations where about a quarter of male female encounters result in male being eaten by female around 90 of predatory species of mantises exhibit sexual cannibalism adult males typically outnumber females at first but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in adult stage possibly because females selectively eat smaller males in tenodera sinensis 83 of males escape cannibalism after an encounter with a female but since multiple matings occur probability of a male s being eaten increases cumulatively female may begin feeding by biting off male s head as they do with regular prey and if mating has begun male s movements may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in abdomen not head removal of male s head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance later this behavior appeared to be an artifact of intrusive laboratory observation whether behavior is natural in field or also result of distractions caused by human observer remains controversial mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in laboratory or field such as bright lights or moving scientists chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum so that they were not hungry actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed male engages female in a courtship dance to change her interest from feeding to mating under such circumstances female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing colored eyespots on inside of her front legs reason for sexual cannibalism has been debated experiments show that females on low quality diets have a higher chance to engage in sexual cannibalism compared to females on high quality diets some consider that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring this theory is supported by a quantifiable increase in duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized in some cases doubling both duration and chance of fertilization this is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males for at this time females most frequently cannibalize their mates an increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount a hungry female who would be likely to cannibalize her mate relationship with humans in literature and art one of earliest mantis references is in ancient chinese dictionary which gives its attributes in poetry where it represents courage and fearlessness and a brief description a later text bencao great history of medical material annotated and arranged by types based upon classics and historical works from 1108 gives accurate details of construction of

today referred to both in english and chinese as northern praying mantis and southern praying mantis both are very popular in china and have also been exported to west in recent decades in mythology and religion mantis was revered by southern african khoi and san in whose cultures man and nature were intertwined for its praying posture mantis was even named god of khoi in afrikaans language that had developed among first european settlers however at least for san mantis was only one of manifestations of a trickster deity who could assume many other forms such as a snake hare or vulture

in on each side daily south argued that a pet insect was no weirder than a pet rat or ferret and that while a pet mantis was unusual it would not bark shed or need shots or a litter box for pest control gardeners who prefer to avoid pesticides may encourage mantises in hope of controlling insect pests however mantises do not have key attributes of biological pest control agents they do not specialize in a single pest insect and do not multiply rapidly in response to an increase in such a prey species but are general predators they eat whatever they can catch including both harmful and beneficial insects they therefore have negligible value in biological control two species chinese mantis and european mantis were deliberately introduced to north america in hope that they would serve as pest controls for agriculture they have spread widely in both united states and canada mantis like robot a prototype robot inspired by forelegs of praying mantis has front legs that allow robot to walk climb steps and grasp objects multi jointed leg provides dexterity via a rotatable joint future models may include a more spiked foreleg to improve grip and ability to support more weight
