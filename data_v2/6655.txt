decision to suspend jones for a year however express owner willis claimed that investigation was botched because magley was an nbl canada coach that had faced jones in previous games aftermath thumb right cliff clinkscales right was signed by halifax hurricanes and reinstated by late august 2015 it became a strong possibility that a new nbl canada team would be created in halifax for 2015 16 season a new ownership group led by former rainmen advisor and ceo of corporate research associates in don mills soon confirmed that defunct team s reincarnation would compete for next season mills expected a group of 25 shareholders to help start up organization many of whom personally paid for rainmen s flights and hotels in last season he chose to not include levingston in ownership group but allowed him to assume position as team s general manager mills said there would not be a new team in halifax without andre we decided that only way we would go forward to raise money was if andre was part of solution despite this he preferred to break ties with rainmen franchise it was not disclosed who paid for 250 000 fee required for a team to register in nbl canada on october 20 2015 team was announced as halifax hurricanes mills commented we think it s kind of an appropriate name from where we re located and from a sports team s point of view what it really says is energy and power so some of descriptions of hurricanes sort of suit kind of team that we want as well hurricanes also signed cliff clinkscales and mike glover as its first players and hired hugo lopez as head coach mills aimed for lower ticket prices at team s games for express head coach bill jones was replaced by his brother tony jones who assumed position of interim head coach until february 20 2016 at this time bill was reinstated into nbl canada with tony remaining with windsor as an assistant coach bill said what happened in that game 7 was not bill jones it happened in heat of moment and is something i ll probably regret for rest of my life magley said that his concern with future of express organization helped him make decision to reinstate jones who he believed would help team s fan support grow at beginning of new season on december 31 2015 clinkscales and tony benett were both reinstated after applying to return to league two players received unanimous support from nbl canada board of governors bennett was only suspended for two games and received a 500 fine while clinkscales still had a 5 000 fine on march 11 2016 rainmen player tyrone watson was also reinstated to league after
