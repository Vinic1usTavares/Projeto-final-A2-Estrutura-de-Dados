thumbnail christ on cross 1870 by carl heinrich bloch showing skies darkened crucifixion darkness is an episode in three of canonical gospels in which sky becomes dark in daytime during crucifixion of jesus christian apologist tertullian in ad 197 considered this not an eclipse but a portent which he claimed was recorded in roman archives third century christian commentator origen offered two natural explanations for darkness that it might have been eclipse presumably of ad 29 described by phlegon of tralles or that it might have been clouds modern scholars have found no contemporary references to darkness outside new testament but have found mention of it in ancient writings that reference sources lost to us today such as those of greek historian thallus some scholars favour natural explanations such as a khamsin sand storm others note that similar accounts were associated in ancient times and in old testament with deaths of notable figures and see phenomenon as a literary invention that attempts to convey a sense of power of jesus in face of death or a sign of god s displeasure with jewish people biblical account oldest biblical reference to crucifixion darkness is found in gospel of mark written around year 70 in its account of crucifixion on eve of passover it says that after jesus was crucified at nine in morning darkness fell over all land or all world can mean either from around noon sixth hour until 3 o clock ninth hour it adds immediately after death of jesus that curtain of temple was torn in two from top to bottom gospel of matthew has an almost identical wording from noon on darkness came over whole land or earth until three in afternoon author includes dramatic details including an earthquake and raising of dead which were also common motifs in jewish apocalyptic literature earth shook and rocks were split tombs also were opened and many bodies of saints who had fallen asleep were raised gospel of luke has none of details of matthew version mentions tearing of temple veil immediately before death of jesus and provides obscuring of sun as cause of darkness it was now about noon and darkness came over whole land or earth until three in afternoon while sun s light failed or sun was eclipsed and curtain of temple was torn in two it appears that luke s gospel originally explained event as an eclipse majority of manuscripts of gospel of luke have greek phrase sun was darkened but earliest manuscripts say sun s light failed or sun was in eclipse this earlier version is likely to have been original one amended by later scribes to correct what they assumed was an error since they knew that an eclipse was impossible during passover one early christian commentator even suggested that text had been deliberately corrupted by opponents of church to make it easier to attack in account of crucifixion given in gospel of john there is no mention of darkness tearing of veil or raising of dead later versions apocryphal writers a number of accounts in apocryphal literature built on accounts of crucifixion darkness gospel of peter probably from second century expanded on canonical gospel accounts in creative ways as one writer puts it accompanying miracles become more fabulous and apocalyptic portents are more vivid in this version darkness which covers whole of judaea leads people to go about with lamps believing it to be night fourth century gospel of nicodemus describes how pilate and his wife are disturbed by a report of what had happened and judeans he has summoned tell him it was an ordinary solar eclipse another text from fourth century purported report of pontius pilate to tiberius claimed darkness had started at sixth hour covered whole world and during subsequent evening full moon resembled blood for entire night in a fifth or sixth century text by pseudo dionysius areopagite author claims to have observed a solar eclipse from heliopolis at time of crucifixion ancient historians no contemporary references to this darkness have been found outside of new testament tertullian in his of ad 197 referred to biblical crucifixion darkness and claimed that an independent account of omen was held in roman archives and yet nailed upon cross he exhibited many notable signs by which his death was distinguished from all others at his own free will he with a word dismissed from him his spirit anticipating executioner s work in same hour too light of day was withdrawn when sun at very time was in his meridian blaze those who were not aware that this had been predicted about christ no doubt thought it an eclipse you yourselves have account of world portent still in your archives in ad 248 crucifixion darkness story was used by christian apologist origen as an example of biblical account being supported by non christian sources when pagan critic celsus claimed that jesus could hardly be a god because he had performed no great deeds origen responded in against celsus by recounting darkness earthquake and opening of tombs as proof that incident had happened origen referred to a description by phlegon of tralles of an eclipse accompanied by earthquakes felt in other parts of empire during reign of tiberius probably that of 29 ce in his commentary on matthew however origen offered a different approach answering criticisms that there was no mention of this incident in any of many non christian sources he insisted that it was local to palestine and therefore would have gone unnoticed outside to suggestions it was merely an eclipse origen pointed out that this was impossible and suggested other explanations such as heavy clouds drawing only on accounts given in matthew and mark which make no mention of sun in ninth century byzantine historian george syncellus quoted from third century christian historian sextus julius africanus who remarked that thallos dismisses this darkness as a solar eclipse george syncellus chapter 391 it is not known when chronicler thallus lived and it is unclear whether he himself made any reference to crucifixion explanations miracle because it was known in ancient and medieval times that a solar eclipse could not take place during passover solar eclipses require a new moon while passover only takes place during a full moon it was considered a miraculous sign rather than a naturally occurring event astronomer johannes de sacrobosco wrote in his sphere of world eclipse was not natural but rather miraculous and contrary to nature modern writers who regard this as a miraculous event tend either to see it as operating through a natural phenomenon such as volcanic dust or heavy cloud cover or avoid explanation completely reformation study bible for instance simply states this was a supernatural darkness natural phenomenon thumb khamsin dust storm in egypt in 2007 gospel of luke account states and sun was darkened luke 23 45 however biblical details do not accord with an eclipse a solar eclipse could not have occurred on or near passover when jesus was crucified and would have been too brief to account for three hours of darkness maximum possible duration of a total solar eclipse is seven minutes and 31 1 seconds only total eclipse visible in jerusalem in this era occurred late in year ad 29 on 24 november at 11 05 am around sea of galilee it would have been visible for just one minute and forty nine seconds blockquote some writers explained crucifixion darkness in terms of heavy cloud cover or aftermath of a volcanic eruption a popular work of nineteenth century described it as an oppressive gloom and suggested this was a typical phenomenon related to earthquakes charles ellicott a new testament commentary for english readers 1878 page 176 in his 2011 book unlike his 1983 paper humphreys accepted that luke was referring to sun and proposed a khamsin dust storm that tends to occur from march to may and typically obscures sun for several hours scribal error in 1983 colin humphreys and w g waddington noted that reference to a solar eclipse is missing in some versions of luke and argued that reported sun s darkness could be accounted for by confusion with a partial lunar eclipse that had taken place on 3 april ad 33 lunar eclipses can last much longer than solar ones in other words humphreys and waddington speculated that apparent reference in luke s gospel to a solar eclipse could have been result of a scribe wrongly amending luke s original text this is a claim that historian david described as indefensible astronomer bradley e schaefer moreover stated that lunar eclipse would not have been visible in jerusalem during daylight hours literary creation a common view in modern scholarship is that account in synoptic gospels is a literary creation of gospel writers intended to heighten importance of what they saw as a theologically significant event burton mack describes it as a fabrication by author of gospel of mark while g b caird and joseph fitzmyer conclude that author did not intend description to be taken literally w d davies and dale allison similarly conclude it is probable that without any factual basis darkness was added in order to wrap cross in a rich symbol and or assimilate jesus to other worthies image of darkness over land would have been understood by ancient readers as a cosmic sign a typical element in description of death of kings and other major figures by writers such as philo dio cassius virgil plutarch and josephus geza vermes describes darkness account as part of jewish eschatological imagery of day of lord it is to be treated as a literary rather than historical phenomenon notwithstanding naive scientists and over eager television documentary makers tempted to interpret account as a datable eclipse of sun they would be barking up wrong tree interpretations thumb 220px earliest crucifixion in an illuminated manuscript from syriac gospels ad 586 note sun and moon in sky this sequence plays an important part in gospel s literary narrative author of mark s gospel has been described as operating here at peak of his rhetorical and theological powers one suggestion is that darkness is a deliberate inversion of transfiguration alternately jesus s earlier discourse about a future tribulation mentions sun being darkened and can be seen as foreshadowing this scene striking details such as darkening of sky and tearing of temple veil may be a way of focusing reader away from shame and humiliation of crucifixion one professor of biblical theology concluded it is clear that jesus is not a humiliated criminal but a man of great significance his death is therefore not a sign of his weakness but of his power when considering theological meaning of event some authors have interpreted darkness as a period of mourning by cosmos itself at death of jesus others have seen it as a sign of god s judgement on jewish people sometimes connecting it with destruction of city of jerusalem in year 70 or as symbolising shame fear or mental suffering of jesus fitzmyer compares event to a contemporary description recorded in josephus antiquities of jews which recounts unlawful acts against gods from which we believe very sun turned away as if it too were loath to look upon foul deed josephus antiquities book xiv 12 3 text at wikisource many writers have adopted an intertextual approach looking at earlier texts from which author of mark gospel may have drawn in particular parallels have often been noted between darkness and prediction in book of amos of an earthquake in reign of king of judah on that day says lord god i will make sun go down at noon and darken earth in broad daylight particularly in connection with this reference read as a prophecy of future darkness can be seen as portending end times another likely literary source is plague narrative in book of exodus in which egypt is covered by darkness for three days it has been suggested that author of matthew s gospel changed text slightly to more closely match this source commentators have also drawn comparisons with description of darkness in genesis creation narrative with a prophecy regarding mid day darkness by jeremiah and with an end times prophecy in book of zechariah roman literary sources have also been postulated namely those on apotheosis of mythical king romulus and
