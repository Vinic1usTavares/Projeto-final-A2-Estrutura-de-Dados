discussing recent events two share a long passionate kiss production right 210px thumb birth of william was supposed to allude to birth of jesus christ writing and casting existence was written during filming which led to kim manners director of episode helping with script because of this several of action scenes such as fight at fbi headquarters were manners ideas according to manners last scene with doggett and reyes in kersh s office was birth of new x files without david duchovny as a lead from here on monica reyes became a main character on show star trek next generation regular denise crosby briefly appears as scully s gynecologist episode features last appearance of nicholas lea sans series finale reportedly lea had become tired of role and was growing weary of ambiguous nature of character when lea learned that his character was to be killed off in existence he reportedly welcomed news night episode aired lea wrote on his personal website i felt that krycek wasn t getting a fair shake anyway i wanted more in depth ideas about character and it never came to pass it kind of stopped being fun to play kessenich p 146 final scene of episode featuring mulder and scully kissing almost was not filmed initially script called for mulder to kiss scully s forehead both duchovny and manners argued that scene was mundane and that they had been teasing and doing that bull for so long that they wanted a real kiss at this point during birth of scully s child several allusions to story of birth of jesus are made including mulder following a star to find scully and lone gunmen bringing gifts for baby much like three wise men scully s child was portrayed by jerry shiban who is son of john shiban a producer who worked on x files as well as lone gunmen he was first of seven babies to represent character and only one to play baby william for a single episode effects and filming right 250px thumb chris carter included a scene with whale calls after listening to a paul winter album episode featured several elaborate cgi scenes first scene with vertebrae was entirely computer generated by visual effects head john wash according to director kim manners most difficult scene to shoot was in elevator with mitch pileggi and nicholas lea conversely manners favorite scene was one in which skinner kills krycek manners himself proposed uniqueness of shot which features a cgi bullet going straight through krycek s head extra money was budgeted for krycek s death mitch pileggi was very happy when he was told he would be killing krycek he explained when they came to me and told me that i was one that was going to kill krycek i was elated not because i wanted nick to go away or anything it was just from a character stand point skinner just wanted to kill krycek so bad hurwitz and knowles p 197 manners later called it one of his favorite scenes he d ever directed and one of best scenes he s seen in a long time on television car scene with gillian anderson and annabeth gish was shot at kanan road malibu anderson and gish sat in what is known as an insert car while crew sat in a pickup car in front of them birth scene was filmed at paramount ranch gish had never filmed with guns before joining x files so producers hired a retired lapd officer to teach her more about firearms she also did some shooting practices before returning to set fbi garage scenes were shot in century city and took a total of four days to finish episode also contains a scene wherein reyes serenades scully with karaoke renditions of whale calls gish later noted that series creator chris carter gave me a tape of whale songs which was hysterical to be playing in my trailer carter was inspired to write scene after a friend gave him a paul winter album that incorporated whale sounds into music carter later explained that i just thought it was kind of much like reyes character to appreciate that reception ratings existence premiered on may 20 2001 in united states on

while offering a positive opinion in regards to finale as a whole he felt that existence dragged more so than essence resulting in a less interesting episode he also felt that overarching mythology of series had long ago become too convoluted to make sense but that human pieces of show still work and that includes doggett contra costa times columnists george avalos and michael liedtke were pleased with episode noting that last scene was beautifully written avalos and liedtke also reacted positively to death of alex krycek at hands of skinner saying it was best scene in episode despite their praise however they stressed that existence was not as exciting as previous episode essence or 1998 x files feature film jessica morgan of television without pity gave episode an a rating noting that season eight s finale goes out with a big fat juicy kiss between mulder and scully at long last gareth wigmore of tv zone was positive toward both essence and existence wigmore gave episodes a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote reason that this two parter works is that its plot is simple enough for audience to still have a handle on not all reviews were positive robert shearman and lars pearson in
