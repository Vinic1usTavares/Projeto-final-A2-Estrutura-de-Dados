sarus crane antigone antigone is a large nonmigratory crane found in parts of indian subcontinent southeast asia and australia tallest of flying birds standing at a height up to they are a conspicuous species of open wetlands in south asia seasonally flooded dipterocarp forests in southeast asia and eucalyptus dominated woodlands and grasslands in australia sarus crane is easily distinguished from other cranes in region by overall grey colour and contrasting red head and upper neck they forage on marshes and shallow wetlands for roots tubers insects crustaceans and small vertebrate prey like other cranes they form long lasting pair bonds and maintain territories within which they perform territorial and courtship displays that include loud trumpeting leaps and dance like movements in india they are considered symbols of marital fidelity believed to mate for life and pine loss of their mates even to point of starving to death main breeding season is during rainy season when pair builds an enormous nest island a circular platform of reeds and grasses nearly 2 m in diameter and high enough to stay above shallow water surrounding it increased agricultural intensity is often thought to have led to declines in sarus crane numbers but they also benefit from wetland crops and construction of canals and reservoirs stronghold of species is in india where it is traditionally revered and lives in agricultural lands in close proximity to humans elsewhere species has been extirpated in many parts of its former range description thumb left in flight black primaries contrast with otherwise grey wings bharatpur india adult sarus crane is very large with grey wings and body a bare red head and part of upper neck a greyish crown and a long greenish grey pointed bill in flight long neck is held straight unlike that of a heron which folds it back and black wing tips can be seen crane s long pink legs trail behind them this bird has a grey ear covert patch orange red irises and a greenish grey bill juveniles have a yellowish base to bill and brown grey head is fully feathered bare red skin of adult s head and neck is brighter during breeding season this skin is rough and covered by papillae and a narrow area around and behind head is covered by black bristly feathers sexes do not differ in plumage although males are on average larger than females males of indian population can attain a maximum height around making them world s tallest extant flying bird weight of nominate race individuals is while five adult a a sharpii averaged across distribution range weight can vary from height typically from and wingspan from thumb right view of head while individuals from northern populations are among heaviest cranes alongside red crowned and wattled cranes and largest in their range birds from australia tend to be smaller in australia sarus can easily be mistaken for more widespread brolga brolga has red colouring confined to head and not extending into neck body mass in australian sarus cranes was found to average in males and in females with a range for both sexes of thus australian sarus cranes average about 25 lighter than northern counterparts and are marginally lighter on average than brolgas distribution and habitat species has historically been widely distributed on lowlands of india along gangetic plains extending south to godavari river west to coastal gujarat tharparkar district of pakistan and east to west bengal and assam species no longer breeds in punjab though it winters regularly in state sarus cranes are rare in west bengal and assam and are no longer found in state of bihar in nepal its distribution is restricted to western and central lowland plains with most of population occurring in and districts two distinct populations of sarus cranes occur in southeast asia northern population in china and myanmar and southern population in cambodia and vietnam sarus used to extend to thailand and further east into philippines but may now be extinct in both these countries in 2011 24 captive bred cranes raised from five founders were reintroduced into thailand a reasonably sized population of over 150 cranes has recently been discovered breeding in rice fields in delta myanmar with additional cranes confirmed in states of kachin shan and rakhine in australia they are found only in north east and are partly migratory in some areas global range has shrunk and largest occupied area and largest known population is in india increasing paddy fields accompanied by an increase in network of irrigation canals during and prior to green revolution may have facilitated increases in distribution and numbers of sarus cranes due to an increase in reliable moisture levels in various locations in india although now found mainly at a low elevation on plains some historical records exist from highland marshes further north in sar and in kashmir sarus crane breeds in some high elevation regions such as near pong dam in himachal pradesh where populations may be growing in response to increasing rice cultivation along reservoir in rice dominated districts of uttar pradesh sarus crane abundance estimated as occupancy was highest in western districts intermediate in central districts and minimal in eastern districts sarus crane abundance was positively associated with percentage of wetlands on landscape and negatively with percentage of area under rice cultivation until recently little was known of sarus crane ecology from australia breeding records confirmed sightings of nests with eggs or of adult birds with flightless young were known from only three locations all in gulf plains in queensland two records are from near normanton town one of adults with flightless chicks seen about 30 km west of town and another of adults incubating eggs seen 7 km south of town third record is a one month study that provides details of 32 nests located within 10 km around morr morr cattle station in gilbert river floodplains a 3 000 km survey along gulf of carpentaria located 141 territorial breeding pairs spread out across floodplains of mitchell gilbert and flinders rivers carefully mapping of breeding areas of sarus cranes in australia is needed to understand their distribution range they are uncommon in kakadu national park where species is often hard to find among more numerous brolgas flocks in non breeding season are commonly seen in atherton tablelands in eastern queensland in india sarus cranes preferentially use wetlands for nesting but also nest in uncultivated patches amid flooded rice paddies called in gujarat and in rice paddies especially when wetlands are not available to breeding pairs breeding pairs are territorial and prefer to forage in natural wetlands though wetland crops like rice and wheat are also frequented in south western uttar pradesh sarus cranes were found in wetlands of all sizes with larger numbers in larger wetlands in australia wintering non breeding sarus cranes forage in areas with intensive agriculture primarily maize sugarcane groundnuts and smaller patches of cattle grazing areas in atherton tablelands in eastern queensland they were observed to feed on grain nuts and insects from a range of crop fields including stubble of maize and peanut crops hay crops fields with potato legumes and seed crops and after harvest in fields of sugarcane grass and fodder crops territorial breeding sarus crane pairs in northern queensland along gulf of carpentaria use a range of habitats but preferentially use low open woodland on quaternary alluvial plains in outer river deltas and levees with a vegetation of cunninghamii eucalyptus corymbia confertiflora melaleuca spp atalaya grevillea striata eucalyptus c polycarpa c confertiflora and c bella taxonomy and systematics thumb left all cranes have a raised and much reduced hind toe this species was described by linnaeus in 1758 and placed in genus ardea that included larger herons edward blyth published a monograph on cranes in 1881 in which he considered sarus crane of india to be made up of two species grus and grus antigone most modern authors recognize one species with three disjunct populations that are sometimes treated as subspecies although status of one extinct population from philippines is uncertain sarus cranes in india referred to as a a antigone are largest and in east from myanmar is replaced by a population that extends into southeast asia referred to as a a sharpii sarus cranes from indian subcontinent are well marked and differentiated from south eastern population by having a white collar below bare head and upper neck and white tertiary remiges population in australia initially placed in a a sharpii sometimes spelt but amended to conform to rules of latin grammar was separated and named as race a a sometimes spelt or even gilli prior to a genetic analysis a 2005 genetic analysis suggested that these three populations are representatives of a formerly continuous population that varied clinally australian subspecies was designated only in 1988 with species itself first noticed in australia in 1966 and regarded as a recent immigrant native australians however differentiated sarus and brolga and called sarus crane that dips its head in blood sarus cranes of australian population are similar to those in southeast asia in having no white on neck and tertiary remiges but are distinguished by a larger grey patch of ear coverts australian population shows most recent divergence from ancestral form with an estimated 3000 generations of breeding within australia an additional subspecies a a was suggested for population once found but now extinct in philippines no distinctive character is known of this population thumb displaying india analysis of mitochondrial dna from a limited number of specimens suggested that gene flow occurred within continental asian populations until 20th century reductions in range and that australia was colonized only in late pleistocene some 35 000 years ago this has been corroborated by ndna microsatellite analyses on a large and widely distributed set of individuals in sample this study further suggests that australian population shows low genetic variability as there exists possibility of limited hybridization with genetically distinct brolga australian sarus crane can be expected to be an incipient species sarus crane was formerly placed in genus grus but a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that genus as then defined was polyphyletic in resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera four species including sarus crane were placed in resurrected genus antigone that had originally been erected by german naturalist ludwig reichenbach in 1853 etymology common name sarus is from hindi name saras for species hindi word is derived from sanskrit word for lake bird sometimes corrupted to while indians held species in veneration british soldiers in colonial india hunted bird calling it serious or even cyrus generic and specific names after antigone daughter of oedipus who hanged herself may relate to bare skin of head and neck ecology and behaviour thumb left foraging in marshland bharatpur unlike many other cranes that make long migrations sarus cranes are largely nonmigratory and few populations make relative short distance migrations in south asia four distinct population level behaviours have been noted first is wintering population of a small number of sarus cranes that use wetlands in state of punjab during winters source of this population is unclear but is very likely to be from growing population in himachal pradesh second is expanding population consisting of cranes appearing in new areas following new irrigation structures in sem arid and arid areas primarily in gujarat and rajasthan third is seasonally migratory population also primarily in arid zone of gujarat and rajasthan cranes from this population aggregates in remaining wetlands and reservoirs during dry summer and breeding pairs set up territories during rainy season july october remaining on territories throughout winter november march fourth population is perennially resident and found in areas such as southwestern uttar pradesh where artificial and natural water sources enable cranes to stay in same location throughout year migratory populations are also known from southeast asia and australia in southeast asia cranes congregate in few remnant wetlands during dry season in australia flocks aggregate on atherton highlands where agriculture is conducive for sarus cranes breeding pairs maintain territories that are defended from other cranes using a large repertoire of calls and displays in uttar pradesh less than a tenth of breeding pairs maintain territories at wetlands while rest of pairs are scattered in smaller wetlands and agricultural fields non breeding birds form flocks that vary from 1 430 birds in semi arid areas breeding pairs and successfully fledged juveniles depart from territories in dry season and join non breeding flocks in areas with perennial water supply as in western plains of uttar pradesh breeding pairs maintain perennial territories largest known flocks are from 29 km2 keoladeo national park with as many as 430 birds and from unprotected community owned wetlands in etawah mainpuri etah and kasganj districts in uttar pradesh ranging from 245 412 birds flocks of over 100 birds are also reported from gujarat in india and australia sarus crane populations in keoladeo national park have been noted to drop from over 400 birds in summer to just 20 birds during monsoon in areas with perennial wetlands on landscape such as in western uttar pradesh numbers of non breeding sarus cranes in flocks can be relatively stable throughout year in etawah mainpuri etah and kasganj districts non breeding sarus cranes form up to 65 of regional population breeding pairs in australia similarly defend territories from neighbouring crane pairs and nonbreeding birds are found in flocks frequently mixed with brolgas in their breeding grounds in north eastern australia non breeding sarus cranes constitute less than 25 of population in some years they roost in shallow water where they may be safe from some ground predators adult birds do not moult their feathers annually but feathers are replaced about once every two to three years feeding thumb feeding juvenile lumbini nepal sarus cranes forage in shallow water usually with less than depth of water or in fields frequently probing in mud with their long bills in dry season after breeding sarus cranes in pring sarus crane conservation area cambodia used wetlands with 8 10 cm of water they are omnivorous eating insects especially grasshoppers aquatic plants fish perhaps only in captivity frogs crustaceans and seeds occasionally tackling larger vertebrate prey such as water snakes piscator sarus cranes may in rare cases feed on eggs of birds and turtles plant matter eaten includes tubers corms of aquatic plants grass shoots as well as seeds and grains from cultivated crops such as groundnuts and cereal crops such as rice in dry season cranes flocking in southeast asian wetlands are in areas with an abundance of and e spiralis both of which produce tubers on cranes are known to feed in their breeding grounds in north eastern australia isotopic analyses on molted feathers revealed sarus crane diets to comprise a great diversity of vegetation and restricted to a narrow range of trophic levels courtship and breeding thumb long coiled trachea that produces trumpeting calls sarus cranes have loud trumpeting calls these calls are as in other cranes produced by elongated trachea that form coils within sternal region pairs may indulge in spectacular displays of calling in unison and posturing these include dancing movements that are performed both during and outside breeding season and involve a short series of jumping and bowing movements made as one of pair circles around other dancing may also be a displacement activity when nest or young is threatened cranes breed mainly during monsoons in india from july to october although a second brood may occur and breeding has been recorded in all months they build large nests platforms made of reeds and vegetation in wet marshes or paddy fields nest is constructed within shallow water by piling up rushes straw grasses with their roots and mud so that platform rises above level of water to form a little island nest is and conspicuous being visible from afar and defended fiercely by pair data collated over a century from south asia show sarus cranes nesting throughout year more focused observations however show nesting patterns to be closely tied to rainfall patterns an exception to this rule was unseasonal nesting observed in artificially flooded keoladeo ghana national park and in marshes created by irrigation canals in kota district of rajasthan india based on these observations unseasonal nesting or nesting outside of monsoon of sarus cranes were thought to be due to either presence of two populations some pairs raising a second brood and unsuccessful breeding by some pairs in normal monsoon season prompting them to nest again when conditions such as flooded marshes remain a comprehensive assessment of unseasonal nesting based on collation of over 5 000 breeding records however showed that unseasonal nesting by sarus cranes in south asia was very rare and was only carried out by pairs that did not succeed in raising chicks in normal nesting season unseasonal nests were initiated in years with unusual rainfall patterns when rainfall extended beyond normal june october period and when rainfall volume was higher than normal or when artificial wet habitats were created by man made structures such as reservoirs and irrigation canals to enhance crop production nest initiation in northern queensland is also closely tied to rainfall patterns with most nests being initiated immediately after first major rains thumb upright left egg museum de toulouse nests can be more than 2 m 6 ft in diameter and nearly 1 m 3 ft high pairs show high fidelity to nest site often refurbishing and reusing a nest for as many as five breeding seasons clutch is one or two eggs rarely three or four which are incubated by both sexes for about 31 days range 26 35 days eggs are chalky white and weigh about 240 grams when disturbed from nest parents may sometimes attempt to conceal eggs by attempting to cover them with material from edge of nest eggshells are removed by parents after chicks hatch either by carrying away fragments or by swallowing them about 30 of all breeding pairs succeed in raising chicks in any year and most of successful pairs raise one or two chicks each with brood sizes of three being rare one survey in australia found 60 of breeding pairs to have successfully fledged chicks this high success rate is attributed to above normal rainfall that year chicks are fed by parents for first few days but are able to feed independently after that and follow their parents for food when alarmed parent cranes use a low korr rr call that signals chicks to freeze and lie still young birds stay with their parents until subsequent breeding season in captivity birds breed only after their fifth year sarus crane is widely believed to pair for life but cases of divorce and mate replacement have been recorded mortality factors thumb upright a pair with young in velavadar eggs are often destroyed at nest by jungle corvus and house crows c splendens in india in australia suspected predators of young birds include dingo canis dingo and fox vulpes vulpes while brahminy kites haliastur indus have been known to take eggs removal of eggs by farmers to reduce crop damage or children in play or by migrant labourers for food or opportunistic egg collection during trips to collect forest resources are prominent causes of egg mortality between 31 and 100 of nests with eggs can fail to hatch eggs for these reasons chicks are also prone to predation estimated at about 8 and collection at nest but more than 30 die of unknown reasons breeding success percentage of eggs hatching and surviving to fledging stage has been estimated at about 20 in gujarat and 51 58 in south western uttar pradesh in areas where farmers are tolerant nests in flooded rice fields and those in wetlands have similar rates of survival pairs that nest later in season have a lower chance of raising chicks successfully but this improves when territories have more wetlands nest success percentage of nests in which at least one egg hatched for 96 sarus nests that were protected by locals during 2009 2011 via a payment for conservation program was 87 more pairs are able to raise chicks in years with higher total rainfall and when territory quality was undisturbed due to increased farming or development permanent removal of pairs from population due to developmental activities caused reduced population viability and was a far more important factor impacting breeding success relative to total annual rainfall breeding success in australia has been estimated by counting proportion of young of year in wintering flocks in crop fields of atherton tablelands in north eastern queensland young birds constituted 5 32 to 7 36 of wintering population between 1997 and 2002 it is not known if this variation represents annual differences in conditions in breeding areas or if it included biases such as different proportions of breeding pairs traveling to atherton to over winter it is also not known how these proportions equate to more standard metrics of breeding success such as proportions of breeding pairs succeeding in raising young birds one multi floodplain survey in australia found 60 of all breeding pairs to have raised at least one chick with 34 of successful pairs fledging two chicks each breeding success and proportions of pairs that raised two chicks each was similar in each floodplain thumb left age and plumage is known about diseases and parasites of sarus crane and their effects on wild bird populations a study conducted at rome zoo noted that these birds were resistant to anthrax endoparasites that have been described include a trematode from liver of a captive crane at london zoo and a from an australian bird like most birds they have bird lice and species recorded include and indicum in captivity sarus cranes have been known to live for as long as 42 years flower 1938 notes only 26 years in captivity premature adult mortality is often result of human actions accidental poisoning by chlorpyrifos and treated seeds used in agricultural areas has been noted adults have been known to fly into power lines and die of electrocution this is responsible for killing about 1 of local population each year conservation status thumb left two adults with a subadult in middle there were about an estimated 15 20 000 mature sarus cranes left in wild in 2009 indian population is less than 10 000 but of three subspecies is healthiest in terms of numbers they are considered sacred and birds are traditionally left unharmed and in many areas they are unafraid of humans they used to be found on occasion in pakistan but have not been seen there since late 1980s population in india has however declined estimates of global population suggest that population in 2000 was at best about 10 and at worst just 2 5 of numbers that existed in 1850 many farmers in india believe that these cranes damage standing crops particularly rice although studies show that direct feeding on rice grains resulted in losses amounting to less than one percent and trampling could account for grain loss of about attitude of farmers tends to be positive in spite of these damages and this has helped in conserving species within agricultural areas role of rice paddies and associated irrigation structures may be particularly important for birds conservation since natural wetlands are increasingly threatened by human activity conversion of wetlands to farmland and farmland to more urban uses are major causes for habitat loss and long term population decline compensating farmers for crop losses has been suggested as a measure that may help but needs to be implemented judiciously so as not to corrupt and remove existing local traditions of tolerance farmers in sarus crane wintering areas in australia are beginning to use efficient methods to harvest crops which may lead to lowered food availability farmers are also transitioning from field crops to perennial and tree crops that have higher returns this may reduce available foraging habitat for cranes and may increase conflict with farmers in remaining few crop fields a review of literature and assessment of abundance of sarus cranes in nepal suggests that past field methods were either inadequate or incomplete to properly estimate abundances and that population of cranes in nepal may be on increase australian population is greater than 5 000 birds and may be increasing however southeast asian population has been decimated by war and habitat change such as intensive agriculture deforestation and draining of wetlands and by mid 20th century had disappeared from large parts of its range which once stretched up to southern china some 1500 2000 birds are left in several fragmented subpopulations though recent surveys in myanmar have discovered previously unknown breeding populations in several locations payment to locals to guard nests and help increase breeding success has been attempted in northern cambodia nest success of protected nests was significantly higher than that of unprotected nests and positive population level impacts were apparent however program also caused local jealousies leading to deliberate disturbance of nests and did nothing to alleviate larger scale and more permanent threats due to habitat losses leading to conclusion that such payment for conservation programs are at best a short term complement and not a substitute to more permanent interventions that include habitat preservation little known philippine population became extinct in late 1960s sarus crane is classified as vulnerable on iucn red list threats include habitat destruction and or degradation hunting and collecting as well as environmental pollution and possibly diseases or competing species effects of inbreeding in australian population once thought to be a significant threat due to hybridization with brolgas producing hybrid birds called is now confirmed to be minimal suggesting that it is not a major threat new plans for developing floodplain areas of northern queensland may have detrimental impacts on breeding sarus crane populations and require to incorporate needs of cranes via conservation of a diversity of habitats that are currently found in region species has been extirpated in malaysia and philippines reintroduction programs in thailand have made use of birds from cambodia attempts to reintroduce birds to eastern thailand have shown some promise in culture thumb left floating feather a painting by melchior d hondecoeter 1680 of birds in menagerie of william iii of england at het loo palace showing a sarus crane in background species is venerated in india and legend has it that poet valmiki cursed a hunter for killing a sarus crane and was then inspired to write epic ramayana species was a close contender to indian peafowl as national bird of india among gondi people tribes classified as five god worshippers consider sarus crane as sacred meat of sarus was considered taboo in ancient hindu scriptures it is widely believed that sarus pairs for life and that death of one partner leads to other pining to death they are a symbol of marital virtue and in parts of gujarat it is a custom to take a newly wed couple to see a pair of sarus cranes thumb a plate by johann michael seligmann published between 1749 and 1776 based on a work by george edwards although venerated and protected by indians these birds were hunted during colonial period it was noted that killing a bird would lead to its surviving partner trumpeting for many days and it was traditionally believed that other would starve to death even sport hunting guides discouraged shooting these birds according to 19th century british zoologist thomas c young birds were good to eat while older ones were worthless for table eggs of sarus crane are however used in folk remedies in some parts of india young birds were often captured and kept in menageries both in india and in europe in former times they were also successfully bred in captivity early in 17th century by emperor jehangir who also noted that eggs were laid with an interval of two days and that incubation period was 34 days they were also bred in zoos in europe and united states in early 1930s indian state of uttar pradesh has declared sarus crane as its official state bird an indian 14 seater
