la reforma is a plio pleistocene caldera on baja california peninsula in mexico it is part of eleven volcanoes in baja california which formed with gulf of california during miocene about ten million years ago previously a volcanic arc had existed on peninsula caldera s basement consists of granites and monzonites formed between cretaceous and middle miocene caldera has a diameter of and is surrounded by a rim high its highest point is high above sea level formation of caldera was accompanied by eruption of a ignimbrite after eruption volcanic activity continued in and around caldera forming lava domes lava flows and a resurgent dome that rises above caldera margin other volcanoes in area include el aguajito and tres virgenes geography and structure thumb right 250px el virgen one of three virgenes volcanoes to west of la reforma la reforma is located in municipality mulege in east central baja california mexico just south of frontier between departments baja california and baja california sur and north of santa rosalia other volcanic centres in neighbourhood are tres virgenes and el aguajito first identified as santa ana caldera in 1984 west of la reforma offshore east of la reforma lies virgenes high a submarine elevated platform probably associated with basaltic intrusions at intersection of two volcanic ridges isla tortuga a volcanic island formed on a fracture zone is also to east of la reforma la reforma caldera has a diameter of and height of its rim ranges from it is a semicircular structure around cabo virgenes which reaches gulf of california at la reforma in northwest and punta las cuevas in southeast a tectonic block inside caldera rises above rim of caldera it is a resurgent dome formed by welded tuff highest point of dome is alternative theories are that la reforma is a dome which was eroded to form a circular pattern or a set of tectonic blocks although dome was thought to be formed by older comondu volcanics it appears to be a product of la reforma activity geology la reforma is one of 11 volcanic centres in baja california in addition to la reforma tres virgenes other centres are cerro prieto el san quintin volcanic field volcanic province san luis island volcanic field san borja volcanic field punta volcanic complex and la subduction of guadalupe plate farallon plate beneath baja california was prevalent in region until 12 5 11 million years ago volcanic activity since then is due to tectonic changes associated with development of gulf of california earlier subduction related volcanism during miocene formed volcanic deposits of comondu group when subduction was active it triggered formation of andesitic rocks known as andesite of sierra santa lucia in area around la reforma these are local manifestations of comondu group volcanics from activity occurring 24 to 13 million years ago last subduction related volcanism producing santa rosalia dacite was between 13 and 12 million years ago subsequently rifting in santa rosalia basin was accompanied by volcanism which laid down basalts basaltic andesite of formation 11 9 million years ago el morro tuff 9 8 million years ago and cerro san lucas unit 9 5 7 7 million years ago volcanism in area is linked to formation of santa rosalia basin expressed as gulf of california about ten million years ago as part of tectonic activity of basin and range province gulf s formation was accompanied by volcanic activity calc alkaline at first and later alkaline and tholeiitic interaction between san andreas fault and east pacific rise triggered formation of a transform boundary in gulf 3 5 million years ago baja california is currently moving northwest at a rate of as part of this movement of earth s tectonic plates santa rosalia basin formed through crustal extension and was filled by a number of miocene pleistocene layers of rock some of which are exposed in la reforma basin s formation was influenced by faults running northwest to southeast and other fault systems are also active in area rocks based on outcrop analysis crystalline basement composed of granitic and rocks dates to cretaceous oldest dated sample being 91 2 2 million years old this rock a granite may be part of a plutonic basement younger basement rocks comprise miocene marine sediments and volcanics pertaining to comondu group andesite of sierra santa lucia is found west southwest of santa rosalia basin basaltic la esperanza formation is also in area age formation lithologies notes holocene fluvial sediments late pleistocene volcanics basaltic cones middle pleistocene rhyolitic lava flows early pleistocene ignimbrites and pantellerite tuff pliocene ash and pumice flows basaltic dykes late miocene marine sediments middle to late miocene comondu group andesite lava flows early to middle miocene andesite breccia oligocene to early miocene fluvial sandstones and conglomerates felsic tuffs cretaceous crystalline basement granites monzonites composition lava flow deposits are composed of andesite basalt and dacite and lava domes consist of rhyolite plagioclase apatite magnetite and zirconia are common mineral components of rocks most common minerals in ignimbrites are feldspar and clinopyroxene while fayalite is rare in addition to these minerals youngest rocks are andesites which contain amphibole area contains well known and bearing resources in marine sediments that were deposited during pliocene and concentrations in minerals surrounding la reforma range from 242 to 38 847 and 22 to 17 407 ppm respectively some rocks of pliocene were erupted in a submarine environment and have been converted into palagonite which has a glassy structure la reforma volcanic rocks feature an anomalous chemistry resembling calc alkaline magma series even though la reforma is not a subduction zone volcano this is consistent with geochemistry of nearby tres virgenes although one pyroclastic flow at la reforma was considered climate climate is arid average precipitation in area is per year of which falls in winter most precipitation falls on tres virgenes in santa rosalia average temperatures range from in january to in august area was probably more humid during winter in pleistocene and certainly colder oxygen isotope ratios of tres virgenes waters indicate that temperatures during time of wisconsin glaciation were colder than today eruptive history volcanism at la reforma began during pliocene with ash flows and pumice flows later activity became subaerial and generated pillow lava of local volcanoes la reforma was first to emerge from sea four to five million years ago basaltic dykes formed volcanic activity at la reforma occurred between 1 6 and 1 4 million years ago and at least four ignimbrites have been found there a major ignimbrite forming eruption occurred during early pleistocene with formation of pantellerite tuff eruption covered about with of ignimbrite ignimbrite is rich in fiamme andesitic effusive activity occurred on flanks of caldera before and after its collapse activity after caldera s formation created lava domes and rhyolitic lava flows along its ring faults one flow was dated at 1 090 000 110 000 years old and domes are 1 4 to 1 2 million years old la reforma eruption products were later partially buried by activity from el aguajito where volcanic activity had migrated to basaltic cones which erupted 600 000 years ago on caldera s flanks despite their location are not part of la reforma volcano like isla tortuga and tres virgenes they are controlled by tectonic processes that accompanied rifting of sea of cortez also rivers deposited sediments inside caldera itself seismic activity still occurs at tres virgenes volcano la reforma could still experience large scale explosive volcanism especially in its southwestern part resurgent doming occurred in centre of caldera causing miocene age rocks including to be exposed at its centre a combination between this doming and uplift of surrounding land of baja california peninsula raised pleistocene sea deposits to over average pace of uplift is hot springs exist in area and chemical and isotope characteristics indicate that a small amount of their water comes from magma implying that a magma chamber still exists beneath la reforma temperatures of hot springs range from geothermal energy has been harnessed from tres virgenes for over ten years currently in baja california cerro prieto and tres virgenes are principal sources for geothermal energy but a number of other sites on peninsula could be used in future for power generation references bibliography category volcanoes of mexico category volcanism of mexico category geology of mexico category landforms of baja california sur category natural
