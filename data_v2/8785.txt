shale oil extraction is an industrial process for unconventional oil production this process converts kerogen in oil shale into shale oil by pyrolysis hydrogenation or thermal dissolution resultant shale oil is used as fuel oil or upgraded to meet refinery feedstock specifications by adding hydrogen and removing sulfur and nitrogen impurities shale oil extraction is usually performed above ground ex situ processing by mining oil shale and then treating it in processing facilities other modern technologies perform processing underground on site or in situ processing by applying heat and extracting oil via oil wells earliest description of process dates to 10th century in 1684 great britain granted first formal extraction process patent extraction industries and innovations became widespread during 19th century industry shrank in mid 20th century following discovery of large reserves of conventional oil but high petroleum prices at beginning of 21st century have led to renewed interest accompanied by development and testing of newer technologies as of 2010 major long standing extraction industries are operating in estonia brazil and china its economic viability usually requires a lack of locally available crude oil national energy security issues have also played a role in its development critics of shale oil extraction pose questions about environmental management issues such as waste disposal extensive water use waste water management and air pollution history thumb right 250 px alt in this vertical retort oil shale is processed in a cast iron vessel which is

wheeled container delivers oil shale to hopper alexander c kirk s retort used in mid to late 19th century was one of first vertical oil shale retorts its design is typical of retorts used in end of 19th and beginning of 20th century in 10th century arabian physician masawaih al mardini mesue younger wrote of his experiments in extracting oil from some kind of bituminous shale first shale oil extraction patent was granted by british crown in 1684 to three people who had found a way to extract and make great quantities of pitch tarr and out of a sort of stone modern industrial extraction of shale oil originated in france with implementation of a process invented by alexander in 1838 improved upon a decade later in scotland using a process invented by james young during late 19th century plants were built in australia brazil canada and united states 1894 invention of pumpherston retort which was much less reliant on coal heat than its predecessors marked separation of oil shale industry from coal industry china manchuria estonia new zealand south africa spain sweden and switzerland began extracting shale oil in early 20th century however crude oil discoveries in texas during 1920s and in middle east in mid 20th century brought most oil shale industries to a halt in 1944 us recommenced shale oil extraction as part of its synthetic liquid fuels program these industries continued until oil prices fell sharply in 1980s last oil shale retort in us operated by unocal corporation closed in 1991 us program was restarted in 2003 followed by a commercial leasing program in 2005 permitting extraction of oil shale and oil sands on federal lands in accordance with energy policy act of 2005 shale oil extraction is in operation in estonia brazil and china in 2008 their industries produced about 930 000 metric tonnes 17 700 barrels per day of shale oil australia us and canada have tested shale oil extraction techniques via demonstration projects and are planning

bottom of chart indicating that extraction is followed by refining which involves thermal and chemical treatment and hydrogenation yielding liquid fuels and useful byproducts overview of shale oil extraction shale oil extraction process decomposes oil shale and converts its kerogen into shale oil a petroleum like synthetic crude oil process is conducted by pyrolysis hydrogenation or thermal dissolution efficiencies of extraction processes are often evaluated by comparing their yields to results of a fischer assay performed on a sample of shale oldest and most common extraction method involves pyrolysis also known as retorting or destructive distillation in this process oil shale is heated in absence of oxygen until its kerogen decomposes into condensable shale oil vapors and non condensable combustible oil shale gas oil vapors and oil shale gas are then collected and cooled causing shale oil to condense in addition oil shale processing produces spent oil shale which is a solid residue spent shale consists of inorganic compounds minerals and char a carbonaceous residue formed from kerogen burning char off spent shale produces oil shale ash spent shale and shale ash can be used as ingredients in cement or brick manufacture composition of oil shale may lend added value to extraction process through recovery of by products including ammonia sulfur aromatic compounds pitch asphalt and waxes heating oil shale to pyrolysis temperature and completing endothermic kerogen decomposition reactions require a source of energy some technologies burn other fossil fuels such as natural gas oil or coal to generate this heat and experimental methods have used electricity radio waves microwaves or reactive fluids for this purpose two strategies are used to reduce and even eliminate external heat energy requirements oil shale gas and char by products generated by pyrolysis may be burned as a source of energy and heat contained in hot spent oil shale and oil shale ash may be used to pre heat raw oil shale for ex situ processing oil shale is crushed into smaller pieces increasing surface area for better extraction temperature at which decomposition of oil shale occurs depends on time scale of process in ex situ retorting processes it begins at and proceeds more rapidly and completely at higher temperatures amount of oil produced is highest when temperature ranges between ratio of oil shale gas to shale oil generally increases along with retorting temperatures for a modern in situ process which might take several months of heating decomposition may be conducted at temperatures as low as temperatures below are preferable as this prevents decomposition of limestone and dolomite in rock and thereby limits carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption hydrogenation and thermal dissolution reactive fluid processes extract oil using hydrogen donors solvents or a combination of these thermal dissolution involves application of solvents at elevated temperatures and pressures increasing oil output by cracking dissolved organic matter different methods produce shale oil with different properties classification of extraction technologies industry analysts have created several classifications of technologies used to extract shale oil from oil shale by process principles based on treatment of raw oil shale by heat and solvents methods are classified as pyrolysis hydrogenation or thermal dissolution by location a frequently used distinction considers whether processing is done above or below ground and classifies technologies broadly as ex situ displaced or in situ in place in ex situ processing also known as above ground retorting oil shale is mined either underground or at surface and then transported to a processing facility in contrast in situ processing converts kerogen while it is still in form of an oil shale deposit following which it is then extracted via oil wells where it rises in same way as conventional crude oil unlike ex situ processing it does not involve mining or spent oil shale disposal aboveground as spent oil shale stays underground by heating method method of transferring heat from combustion products to oil shale may be classified as direct or indirect while methods that allow combustion products to contact oil shale within retort are classified as direct methods that burn materials external to retort to heat another material that contacts oil shale are described as indirect by heat carrier based on material used to deliver heat energy to oil shale processing technologies have been classified into gas heat carrier solid heat carrier wall conduction reactive fluid and volumetric heating methods heat carrier methods can be sub classified as direct or indirect following table shows extraction technologies classified by heating method heat carrier and location in situ or ex situ classification of processing technologies by heating method and

ex situ processing technologies may be differentiated by size of oil shale particles that are fed into retorts as a rule gas heat carrier technologies process oil shale lumps varying in diameter from while solid heat carrier and wall conduction technologies process fines which are particles less than in diameter by retort orientation ex situ technologies are sometimes classified as vertical or horizontal vertical retorts are usually shaft kilns where a bed of shale moves from top to bottom by gravity horizontal retorts are usually horizontal rotating drums or screws where shale moves from one end to other as a general rule vertical retorts process lumps using a gas heat carrier while horizontal retorts process fines using solid heat carrier by complexity of technology in situ technologies are usually classified either as true in situ processes or modified in situ processes true in situ processes do not involve mining or crushing oil shale modified in situ processes involve drilling and fracturing target oil shale deposit to create voids in deposit voids enable a better flow of gases and fluids through deposit thereby increasing volume and quality of shale oil produced ex situ technologies internal combustion internal combustion technologies burn materials typically char and oil shale gas within a vertical shaft retort to supply heat for pyrolysis typically raw oil shale particles between and in size are fed into top of retort and are heated by rising hot gases which pass through descending oil shale thereby causing decomposition of kerogen at about shale oil mist evolved gases and cooled combustion gases are removed from top of retort then moved to separation equipment condensed shale oil is collected while non condensable gas is recycled and used to carry heat up retort in lower part of retort air is injected for combustion which heats spent oil shale and gases to between and cold recycled gas may enter bottom of retort to cool shale ash union a and superior direct processes depart from this pattern in union a process oil shale is fed through bottom of retort and a pump moves it upward in superior direct process oil shale is processed in a horizontal segmented doughnut shaped traveling grate retort internal combustion technologies such as paraho direct are thermally efficient since combustion of char on spent shale and heat recovered from shale ash and evolved gases can provide all heat requirements of retort these technologies can achieve 80 90 of fischer assay yield two well established shale oil industries use internal combustion technologies kiviter process facilities have been operated continuously in estonia since 1920s and a number of chinese companies operate fushun process facilities common drawbacks of internal combustion technologies are that combustible oil shale gas is diluted by combustion gases and particles smaller than can not be processed uneven distribution of gas across retort can result in blockages when hot spots cause particles to fuse or disintegrate hot recycled solids hot recycled solids technologies deliver heat to oil shale by recycling hot solid particles typically oil shale ash these technologies usually employ rotating kiln or fluidized bed retorts fed by fine oil shale particles generally having a diameter of less than some technologies use particles even smaller than recycled particles are heated in a separate chamber or vessel to about and then mixed with raw oil shale to cause shale to decompose at about oil vapour and shale oil gas are separated from solids and cooled to condense and collect oil heat recovered from combustion gases and shale ash may be used to dry and raw oil shale before it is mixed with hot recycle solids in galoter and enefit processes spent oil shale is burnt in a separate furnace and resulting hot ash is separated from combustion gas and mixed with oil shale particles in a rotating kiln combustion gases from furnace are used to dry oil shale in a dryer before mixing with hot ash tosco ii process uses ceramic balls instead of shale ash as hot recycled solids distinguishing feature of alberta taciuk process atp is that entire process occurs in a single rotating multi chamber horizontal vessel because hot recycle solids are heated in a separate furnace oil shale gas from these technologies is not diluted with combustion exhaust gas another advantage is that there is no limit on smallest particles that retort can process thus allowing all crushed feed to be used one disadvantage is that more water is used to handle resulting finer shale ash thumb 540px center alt diagram of alberta taciuk processor retort it is a horizontal cylinder high and wide raw oil shale is fed from right side and it moves to a section where it is dried and by hot oil shale ash temperature in this section is around at same time raw oil shale in this section serves to cool resultant oil shale ash before its removal in retorting section temperature is around oil vapors are removed through vapor tube spent oil shale is again heated in combustion section to a temperature of and ash is generated ash is then sent to retorting section as a heat carrier or to cooling zone for removal alberta taciuk processor retort conduction through a wall these technologies transfer heat to oil shale by conducting it through retort wall shale feed usually consists of fine particles their advantage lies in fact that retort vapors are not combined with combustion exhaust combustion resources process uses a hydrogen fired rotating kiln where hot gas is circulated through an outer annulus oil tech staged electrically heated retort consists of individual inter connected heating chambers stacked atop each other its principal advantage lies in its modular design which enhances its portability and adaptability red leaf resources ecoshale in capsule process combines surface mining with a lower temperature heating method similar to in situ processes by operating within confines of an earthen structure a hot gas circulated through parallel pipes heats oil shale rubble an installation within empty space created by mining would permit rapid reclamation of topography a general drawback of conduction through a wall technologies is that retorts are more costly when scaled up due to resulting large amount of heat conducting walls made of high temperature alloys externally generated hot gas in general externally generated hot gas technologies are similar to internal combustion technologies in that they also process oil shale lumps in vertical shaft kilns significantly though heat in these technologies is delivered by gases heated outside retort vessel and therefore retort vapors are not diluted with combustion exhaust petrosix and paraho indirect employ this technology in addition to not accepting fine particles as feed these technologies do not utilize potential heat of combusting char on spent shale and thus must burn more valuable fuels however due to lack of combustion of spent shale oil shale does not exceed and significant carbonate mineral decomposition and subsequent co2 generation can be avoided for some oil shales also these technologies tend to be more stable and easier to control than internal combustion or hot solid recycle technologies reactive fluids kerogen is tightly bound to shale and resists dissolution by most solvents despite this constraint extraction using especially reactive fluids has been tested including those in a supercritical state reactive fluid technologies are suitable for processing oil shales with a low hydrogen content in these technologies hydrogen gas h2 or hydrogen donors chemicals that donate hydrogen during chemical reactions react with coke precursors chemical structures in oil shale that are prone to form char during retorting but have not yet done so reactive fluid technologies include igt hytort high pressure h2 process donor solvent processes and chattanooga fluidized bed reactor in igt hytort oil shale is processed in a high pressure hydrogen environment chattanooga process uses a fluidized bed reactor and an associated hydrogen fired heater for oil shale thermal cracking and hydrogenation laboratory results indicate that these technologies can often obtain significantly higher oil yields than pyrolysis processes drawbacks are additional cost and complexity of hydrogen production and high pressure retort vessels plasma gasification several experimental tests have been conducted for oil shale gasification by using plasma technologies in these technologies oil shale is bombarded by radicals ions radicals crack kerogen molecules forming synthetic gas and oil air hydrogen or nitrogen are used as plasma gas and processes may operate in an arc plasma arc or plasma electrolysis mode main benefit of these technologies is processing without using water in situ technologies in situ technologies heat oil shale underground by injecting hot fluids into rock formation or by using linear or planar heating sources followed by thermal conduction and convection to distribute heat through target area shale oil is then recovered through vertical wells drilled into formation these technologies are potentially able to extract more shale oil from a given area of land than conventional ex situ processing technologies as wells can reach greater depths than surface mines they present an opportunity to recover shale oil from low grade deposits that traditional mining techniques could not extract during world war ii a modified in situ extraction process was implemented without significant success in germany one of earliest successful in situ processes was underground gasification by electrical energy method a process exploited between 1940 and 1966 for shale oil extraction at in sweden prior to 1980s many variations of in situ process were explored in united states first modified in situ oil shale experiment in united states was conducted by occidental petroleum in 1972 at logan wash colorado newer technologies are being explored that use a variety of heat sources and heat delivery systems wall conduction thumb alt

technology developed concept of oil shale volumetric heating using radio waves radio frequency processing during late 1970s this technology was further developed by lawrence livermore national laboratory oil shale is heated by vertical electrode arrays deeper volumes could be processed at slower heating rates by installations spaced at tens of meters concept presumes a radio frequency at which skin depth is many tens of meters thereby overcoming thermal diffusion times needed for conductive heating its drawbacks include intensive electrical demand and possibility that groundwater or char would absorb undue amounts of energy radio frequency processing in conjunction with critical fluids is being developed by raytheon together with cf technologies and tested by schlumberger microwave heating technologies are based on same principles as radio wave heating although it is believed that radio wave heating is an improvement over microwave heating because its energy can penetrate farther into oil shale formation microwave heating process was tested by global resource corporation electro petroleum proposes electrically enhanced oil recovery by passage of direct current between cathodes in producing wells and anodes located either at surface or at depth in other wells passage of current through oil shale formation results in resistive joule heating economics

what conditions shale oil is economically viable according to united states department of energy capital costs of a ex situ processing complex are 3 10 billion various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when shale oil production cost in a given region is lower than price of petroleum or its other substitutes according to a survey conducted by rand corporation cost of producing shale oil at a hypothetical surface retorting complex in united states comprising a mine retorting plant upgrading plant supporting utilities and spent oil shale reclamation would be in a

profit when crude oil prices are higher than 30 per barrel 190 m3 while some technologies at full scale production assert profitability at oil prices even lower than 20 per barrel 130 m3 to increase efficiency of oil shale retorting and by this viability of shale oil production researchers have proposed and tested several co pyrolysis processes in which other materials such as biomass peat waste bitumen or rubber and plastic wastes are retorted along with oil shale some modified technologies propose combining a fluidized bed retort with a circulated fluidized bed furnace for burning by products of pyrolysis char and oil shale gas and thereby improving oil yield increasing throughput and decreasing retorting time other ways of improving economics of shale oil extraction could be to increase size of operation to achieve economies of scale use oil shale that is a by product of coal mining such as at fushun china produce specialty chemicals as by in estonia co generate electricity from waste heat and process high grade oil shale that yields more oil per shale processed a possible measure of viability of oil shale as an energy source lies in ratio of energy in extracted oil to
