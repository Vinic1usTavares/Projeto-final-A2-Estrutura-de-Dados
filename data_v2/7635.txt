visibility believing fog to have cleared sufficiently ship s commander ordered yorck to get underway in early hours of 4 november ship entered a german minefield in haze struck two mines and sank with heavy loss of life wreck was dismantled progressively between 1920s and 1980s to reduce navigational hazard it posed design thumb left plan and elevation of roon class two roon class cruisers were ordered in 1902 as part of fleet expansion program specified by second naval law of 1900 two ships were incremental developments of preceding s most significant difference being a longer hull additional space was used to add a pair of boilers which increased horsepower by and speed by launch of british battlecruiser in 1907 quickly rendered all of armored cruisers that had been built by world s navies obsolescent yorck was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward she displaced as built and fully loaded ship had a crew of 35 officers and 598 enlisted men though this was frequently augmented with an admiral s staff during periods where ship served as a flagship she was propelled by three vertical triple expansion steam engines with steam provided by sixteen coal fired water tube boilers ship s propulsion system developed a total of and yielded a maximum speed of on trials falling short of her intended speed of she carried up to of coal which enabled a maximum range of up to at a cruising speed of she was armed with four sk l 40 guns arranged in two twin gun turrets one on either end of superstructure her secondary armament consisted of ten sk l 40 guns four were

after 1907 s autumn maneuvers yorck went into drydock for an extensive overhaul from 11 september to 28 october during which time friedrich carl temporarily replaced her as flagship while she was out of service pohl was replaced by kadm august von heeringen who raised his flag aboard yorck upon her return from shipyard ship went on a major cruise into atlantic ocean from 7 to 28 february 1908 with other ships of scouting group during cruise ships conducted various tactical exercises and experimented with using their wireless telegraphy equipment at long distances they stopped in vigo spain to replenish their coal for voyage home on 1 may new armored cruiser joined i scouting group replacing yorck as group flagship another atlantic cruise followed in july and august this time cruise was made in company with battleship squadrons of high seas fleet prince heinrich had pressed for such a cruise previous year arguing that it would prepare fleet for overseas operations and would break up monotony of training in german waters though tensions with britain over developing anglo german naval arms race were high fleet departed kiel on 17 july passed through kaiser wilhelm canal to north sea and continued to atlantic yorck stopped in funchal in madeira and a coruna spain during cruise fleet returned to germany on 13 august autumn maneuvers followed from 27 august to 12 september yorck

returned to north sea and rejoined high seas fleet on 3 november yorck participated in first offensive operation of war conducted by german fleet i scouting group by now commanded by radm hipper was to bombard yarmouth on british coast while bulk of high seas fleet sailed behind providing distant support in event that raid provoked a british counterattack yorck and rest of iii scouting group provided reconnaissance screen for main fleet hipper s ships inflicted little damage and minelayers laid minefields off coast which later sank british submarine upon returning to wilhelmshaven late that day german ships encountered heavy fog that prevented them from safely navigating defensive minefields that had been laid outside port instead they anchored in schillig roadstead yorcks commander kzs pieper believed fog to have cleared sufficiently to allow vessel to return to port so he ordered ship to get underway pilot refused to take responsibility for maneuvering ship owing to great danger of trying to pass through minefields under foggy conditions at 04 10 yorck struck a mine and began to turn to exit minefield striking a second mine shortly thereafter she quickly sank with heavy loss of life though sources disagree on number of fatalities naval historian v e tarrant states that 127 out of a crew of 629 were rescued while erich groner indicates that there were only 336 deaths naval historians hans hildebrand albert rohr and hans otto steinmetz concur with groner on number of fatalities and note that 381 men including pieper were rescued by coastal defense ship for his reckless handling of ship pieper was tried in a court martial convicted and sentenced to two years imprisonment for negligence disobedience of orders and homicide through negligence wreck located between and was initially marked to allow vessels to pass safely beginning in 1926 wreck was partially scrapped to reduce navigational hazard to deeper draft vessels more work was done in 1936 1937 for same reason during a series of construction programs to expand entrance to jade after world war ii ship s turrets were removed in 1969 and remaining parts of hull were demolished in 1983 to
