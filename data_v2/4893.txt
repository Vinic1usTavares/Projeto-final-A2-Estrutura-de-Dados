people weinstein said they both love them and seem to really hate them at same time he also said that they enjoy writing for characters such as abe and mr burns because of their out and because he and oakley get to use dictionaries for looking up old time slang executive producer david mirkin thought it was difficult to make abe funny because he is a boring and tedious character he thinks that even though abe s doing all these complaints what makes him funny is that things he says are actually funny in context of boring and tedium mirkin thought this was a big challenge and bill and josh pulled it off very well when episode was in production oakley s wife rachel pulido was an enthusiastic barbie collector oakley therefore spent a lot of time going to barbie conventions across united states
