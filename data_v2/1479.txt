thumb christopher mcdonald brad bird and eli marienthal in march 2012 at iron giant screening at la animation festival jennifer aniston as annie hughes hogarth s mother who is widow of a military pilot harry connick jr as dean mccoppin a beatnik artist and junkyard owner bird felt it appropriate to make character a member of beat generation as they were viewed as mildly threatening to small town values during that time an outsider himself he is among first to recognize giant as no threat vin diesel as iron giant a fifty foot metal eating robot created for an unknown purpose giant involuntarily reacts defensively if he recognizes anything as a weapon immediately attempting to destroy it giant s voice was originally to be electronically modulated but filmmakers decided they needed a deep resonant and expressive voice to start with so they hired diesel james gammon as foreman marv loach a power station employee who follows robot s trail after it destroys station gammon also voices floyd cloris leachman as mrs hogarth s schoolteacher christopher mcdonald as kent mansley a paranoid federal government agent sent to investigate sightings of iron giant logo on his official government car says he is from bureau of unexplained phenomena john mahoney as general shannon rogard an experienced and military leader in washington d c who strongly dislikes mansley eli marienthal as hogarth hughes named for illustrator burne hogarth an intelligent energetic and curious 9 year old boy with an active imagination marienthal s performances were videotaped and given to animators to work with which helped develop expressions and acting for character m emmet walsh as earl a sailor and first man to see robot in addition ollie johnston and frank thomas voice train engineers briefly seen near start of film johnston and thomas who were animators and members of disney s nine old men were cited by bird as inspirations for his career which he honored by incorporating their voices and likenesses into film production development origins of film lie in book iron man 1968 by poet ted hughes who wrote novel for his children to comfort them in wake of their mother sylvia plath s suicide in 1980s rock musician pete townshend chose to adapt book for a concept album it was released as iron man a musical in 1989 in 1991 richard bazley who later became film s lead animator pitched a version of iron man to don bluth while working at his studio in ireland he created a story outline and character designs but bluth passed on project after a stage musical was mounted in london des mcanuff who had adapted tommy with townshend for stage believed that iron man could translate to screen and project was ultimately acquired by warner bros entertainment in late 1996 while developing project on its way through studio saw film as a perfect vehicle for brad bird who at time was working for turner feature animation developing ray gunn turner entertainment had recently merged with warner bros parent company time warner and bird was allowed to transfer to warner bros animation studio to direct iron giant after reading original iron man book by hughes bird was impressed with mythology of story and in addition was given an unusual amount of creative control by warner bros this creative control involved introducing two new characters not present in original book dean and kent setting film in america and discarding townshend s musical ambitions who did not care either way reportedly remarking well whatever i got paid bird would expand upon his desire to set film in america in 1950s in a later interview ted hughes original story s author died before film s release his daughter frieda hughes did see finished film on his behalf and loved it pete townshend who this project originally started with and who stayed on as film s executive producer enjoyed final film as well townshend pete 2012 who i am a memoir new york city harper collins publishers writing tim mccanlies was hired to write script though bird was somewhat displeased with having another writer on board as he wanted to write screenplay himself he later changed his mind after reading mccanlies then unproduced screenplay for secondhand lions in bird s original story treatment america and ussr were at war at end with giant dying mccanlies decided to have a brief scene displaying his survival stating you can t kill e t and then not bring him back mccanlies finished script within two months mccanlies was given a three month schedule to complete a script and it was by way of film s tight schedule that warner bros didn t have time to mess with us as mccanlies said question of giant s backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep story focused on his relationship with hogarth bird considered story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements such as paranoid fifties sci fi movies with innocence of something like yearling hughes himself was sent a copy of mccanlies script and sent a letter back saying how pleased he was with version in letter hughes stated i want to tell you how much i like what brad bird has done he s made something all of a piece with terrific sinister gathering momentum and ending came to me as a glorious piece of amazement he s made a terrific dramatic situation out of way he s developed iron giant i can t stop thinking about it bird combined his knowledge from his years in television to direct his first feature he credited his time working on family dog as essential to team building and his tenure on simpsons as an example of working under strict deadlines he was open to others on his staff to help develop film he would often ask crew members their opinions on scenes and change things accordingly one of his priorities was to emphasize softer character based moments as opposed to more frenetic scenes something bird thought was a problem with modern filmmaking there has to be activity or sound effects or cuts or music blaring it s almost as if audience has remote and they re going to change channels he commented at time storyboard artist teddy newton played an important role in shaping film s story newton s first assignment on staff involved being asked by bird to create a film within a film to reflect hygiene type movies that everyone saw when bomb scare was happening newton came to conclusion that a musical number would be catchiest alternative and duck and cover sequence came to become one of crew members favorites of film nicknamed x factor by story department head jeffery lynch producers gave him artistic freedom on various pieces of film s script animation financial failure of warner s previous animated effort quest for camelot which made studio reconsider animated films helped shape iron giants production considerably three quarters of animation team on that team helped craft iron giant by time it entered production warner bros informed staff that there would be a smaller budget as well as time frame to get film completed although production was watched closely bird commented they did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good bird regarded trade off as having one third of money of a disney or dreamworks film and half of production schedule but payoff as having more creative freedom describing film as fully made by animation team i don t think any other studio can say that to level that we can a small part of team took a weeklong research trip to maine where they photographed and videotaped five small cities they hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to minutiae we shot store fronts barns forests homes home interiors diners every detail we could including bark on trees said production designer mark whiting bird stuck to elaborate scene planning such as detailed animatics to make sure there were no budgetary concerns team initially worked with macromedia s director software before switching to adobe after effects full time bird was eager to use then nascent software as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves software became essential to that team dubbed macro early on to help studio grasp story reels for film these also allowed bird to better understand what film required from an editing perspective in end he was proud of way film was developed noting that we could imagine pace and unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences with bird offering suggestions by drawing onto screen with a marker lead animator bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among crew who were unified in their mission to create a good film bird cited his favorite moment of film s production as occurring in editing room when crew gathered to test a sequence in which giant learns what a soul is people in room were spontaneously crying it was pivotal there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something he recalled he opted to give film s animators portions to animate entirely rather than standard process of animating one character in a throwback to way disney s first features were created exception were those responsible for creating giant himself who was created using computer generated imagery due to difficulty of creating a metal object in a fluid like manner they had additional trouble with using computer model to express emotion giant was designed by filmmaker joe johnston which was refined by production designer mark whiting and steve markowski head animator for giant using software team would animate giant on twos every other frame or twelve frames per second when interacting with other characters to make it less obvious it was a computer model bird brought in students from calarts to assist in minor animation work due to film s busy schedule he made sure to spread out work on scenes between experienced and younger animators noting you overburden your strongest people and others if you let your top talent monopolize best assignments hiroki itokazu designed all of film s cgi props and vehicles which were created in a variety of software including alias systems corporation s maya alias poweranimator a modified version of pixar s renderman softimage creative environment cambridge animation s animo now part of toon boom technologies avid elastic reality and adobe photoshop art of norman rockwell edward hopper and n c wyeth inspired design whiting strove for colors both evocative of time period in which film is set and also representative of its emotional tone for example hogarth s room is designed to reflect his youth and sense of wonder that was blended with a style reminiscent of 1950s illustration animators studied chuck jones hank ketcham al hirschfeld and disney films from that era such as 101 dalmatians for inspiration in film s animation music score for film was composed and conducted by michael kamen making it only film directed by bird to not to be scored by his future collaborator michael giacchino bird s original temp score a collection of bernard herrmann cues from 50s and 60s sci fi films initially scared kamen believing sound of orchestra is important to feeling of film kamen decided to comb eastern europe for an old fashioned sounding orchestra and went to prague to hear vladimir ashkenazy conduct czech philharmonic in strauss s an alpine symphony eventually czech philharmonic was orchestra used for film s score with bird describing symphony orchestra as an amazing collection of musicians score for iron giant was recorded in a rather unconventional manner compared to most films recorded over one week at in prague music was recorded without conventional uses of syncing music in a method kamen described in a 1999 interview as being able to play music as if it were a piece of classical repertoire kamen s score for iron giant won annie award for music in an animated feature production on november 6 1999 post production bird opted to produce iron giant in widescreen specifically wide 2 39 1 cinemascope aspect ratio but was warned against doing so by his advisers he felt it was appropriate to use format as many films from late 1950s were produced in such widescreen formats he hoped to include cinemascope logo on a poster partially as a joke but 20th century fox owner of trademark refused bird later recalled that he clashed with executives who wished to add characters such as a sidekick dog set film in present day and include a soundtrack of hip hop this was due to concerns that film was not merchandisable to which bird responded if they were interested in telling story they should let it be what it wants to be film was also initially going to released under warner bros family entertainment banner logo for which featured mascot bugs bunny in a tuxedo as seen in film s teaser trailer bird was against this for a multitude of reasons and eventually got confirmation that executives bob daley and terry semel agreed instead bird and his team developed another version of logo to resemble classic studio logo in a circle famously employed in looney tunes shorts he credited executives lorenzo di bonaventura and courtney with helping him achieve his vision noting that they were open to his opinion according to a report from time of its release iron giant cost 50 million to produce with an additional 30 million going towards marketing though box office mojo later reported its budget as 70 million it was regarded as a lower budget film in comparison to films distributed by walt disney pictures themes iron giant primarily deals with concept of existentialism as well as nature of humanity this is exemplified by dean s statement that you are who you choose to be which hogarth later relays to giant when he began work on film bird was in midst of coping with death of his sister susan who was shot and killed by her estranged husband in researching its source material he learned that hughes wrote iron man as a means of comforting his children after his wife sylvia plath committed suicide specifically through metaphor of title character being able to re assemble itself after being damaged these experiences formed basis of bird s pitch to warner bros which was based around idea what if a gun had a soul and didn t want to be a gun completed film was also dedicated to hughes and susan mccanlies commented that at a certain point there are deciding moments when we pick who we want to be and that plays out for rest of your life adding that films can provide viewers with a sense of right and wrong and expressed a wish that iron giant would make us feel like we re all part of humanity which is something we need to feel when some critics compared film to e t extra terrestrial 1982 bird responded by saying e t doesn t go kicking ass he doesn t make army pay certainly you risk having your hip credentials taken away if you want to evoke anything sad or genuinely heartfelt release marketing we had toy people and all of that kind of material ready to go but all of that takes a year burger king and like wanted to be involved in april we showed them movie and we were on time they said you ll never be ready on time no we were ready on time we showed it to them in april and they said we ll put it out in a couple of months that s a major studio they have 30 movies a year and they just throw them off dock and see if they either sink or swim because they ve got next one in right behind it after they saw reviews they warner bros were a little writer tim mccanlies on warner bros marketing approach iron giant was a commercial failure during its theatrical release consensus among critics was that its failure was in part due to poor promotion from warner bros this was largely attributable to reception of quest for camelot after its release warner would not give bird and his team a release date for their film until april 1999 after wildly successful test screenings studio was shocked by response test scores were their highest for a film in 15 years according to bird they had neglected to prepare a successful marketing strategy for film such as cereal and fast food tie ins with little time left before its scheduled release bird remembered that studio produced only one teaser poster for film which became its eventual poster brad ball who had been assigned role of marketing film was candid after its release noting that studio did not commit to a planned burger king toy plan ign stated that in a mis marketing campaign of epic proportions at hands of warner bros they simply didn t realize what they had on their hands studio needed an 8 million opening to ensure success but they were unable to properly promote it preceding release they nearly delayed film by several months to better prepare they said we should delay it and properly lead up to its release and i said you guys have had two and a half years to get ready for this recalled bird press outlets took note of its absence of marketing with some reporting that studio had spent more money on marketing for intended summer blockbuster wild wild west instead warner bros scheduled sunday sneak preview screenings for film prior to its release as well as a preview of film on online platform home media and television syndication after criticism that it mounted an ineffective marketing campaign for its theatrical release warner bros revamped its advertising strategy for video release of film including tie ins with honey nut cheerios aol and general motors and secured backing of three u s congressmen ed markey mark foley and howard berman awareness of film was increased by its february 2000 release as a pay per view title which also increased traffic to film s web site iron giant was released on vhs and dvd on november 23 1999 with a laserdisc release following on december 6 warner spent 35 million to market home video release of film vhs edition came in three versions pan and scan pan and scan with an affixed giant toy to clamshell case and a widescreen version all of initial widescreen home video releases were in 1 85 1 incorrect aspect ratio for film in 2000 television

thanksgiving special edition dvd was released on november 16 2004 in 2014 bird entered discussions with warner bros regarding possibility of releasing iron giant on blu ray on april 23 he wrote on twitter that wb i have been talking but they want a bare bones disc i want better and encouraged fans to send tweets to warner bros home entertainment in favor of a special edition blu ray of film

no need for extending story iron giant appeared in steven spielberg s 2018 film ready player one replacing ultraman from book due to licensing issues where he fights alongside rx 78 2 gundam against
