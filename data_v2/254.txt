henry mcnish 11 september september 1930 often referred to as harry mcneish or by nickname chippy was carpenter on sir ernest shackleton s imperial trans antarctic expedition of 1914 1917 he was responsible for much of work that ensured crew s survival after their ship endurance was destroyed when it became trapped in pack ice in weddell sea he modified small boat james caird that allowed shackleton and five men including mcnish to make a voyage of hundreds of miles to fetch help for rest of crew after expedition he returned to work in merchant navy and eventually emigrated to new zealand where he worked on docks in wellington until poor health forced his retirement he died destitute in ohiro benevolent home in wellington early life harry chippy mcnish was born in 1874 in former lyons lane near present site of library in port glasgow renfrewshire scotland he was part of a large family being third of eleven children born to john and mary jane nee wade mcnish his father was a journeyman shoemaker mcnish held strong socialist views was a member of united free church of scotland and detested bad language he married three times in 1895 to jessie smith who died in february 1898 in 1898 to ellen timothy who died in december 1904 and finally to lizzie littlejohn in 1907 there is some confusion as to correct spelling of his name he is variously referred to as mcnish mcneish and in alexander macklin s diary of expedition macnish mcneish spelling is common notably in shackleton s and frank worsley s accounts of expedition and on mcnish s headstone but mcnish is also widely used identifying accompanying diary entry as being from diary of henry chippy mcnish and appears to be correct version on a signed copy of expedition photo his signature appears as h macnish but his spelling is in general idiosyncratic as revealed in diary he kept throughout expedition there also is a question regarding mcnish s nickname chippy was a traditional nickname for a shipwright both this and shorter chips as in wood chips from carpentry seem to have been used imperial trans antarctic expedition endurance aim of imperial trans antarctic expedition was to be first to cross antarctic continent from one side to other mcnish was apparently attracted by shackleton s advertisement for expedition although there are doubts as to whether advertisement ever appeared thumb left crew have their hair cut aboard endurance mcnish is on left shaving greenstreet s head thumb left 220px endurance trapped in pack ice mcnish s work prevented it flooding but he could do nothing to stop it being crushed mcnish at 40 was one of oldest members of crew of endurance shackleton though was seven months older he suffered from piles and rheumatism in his legs he was regarded as somewhat odd and unrefined but also highly respected as a carpenter frank worsley captain of endurance refers to him as a splendid shipwright pipe smoking scot was however only man of crew that shackleton was not dead certain of his scots accent was described as rasping like frayed cable wire during initial stage of voyage to antarctica from buenos aires he was kept busy with a number of routine tasks he worked on pram dinghy nancy endurance made a small chest of drawers for shackleton specimen shelves for biologist robert clark instrument cases for leonard hussey meteorologist and put up wind screens to protect helmsman he constructed a false deck extending from poop deck to chart room to cover extra coal that ship had taken on board he also acted as ship s barber as ship pushed into pack ice in weddell sea it became increasingly difficult to navigate mcnish constructed a six foot wooden semaphore on bridge to enable navigating officer to give helmsman directions and built a small stage over stern to allow propeller to be watched in order to keep it clear of heavy ice when ship became trapped in pack ice his duties expanded to constructing makeshift housing and once it became clear that ship was doomed to altering sledges for journey over ice to open water he built quarters where crew took their meals nicknamed ritz and cubicles where men could sleep these were all christened as well mcnish shared sailors rest with alfred cheetham third officer assisted by crew he constructed kennels for dogs on upper deck once endurance became trapped and crew were spending days on ice mcnish erected goalposts and football became a daily fixture for men to pass time in evening mcnish joined frank wild tom crean james mcilroy worsley and shackleton playing poker in wardroom pressure from ice caused endurance to start to take on water to prevent ship from flooding mcnish built a cofferdam caulking it with strips of blankets and nailing strips over seams standing for hours up to his waist in freezing water as he worked he could not prevent pressure from ice crushing ship though and was experienced enough to know when to stop trying once ship had been destroyed he was put in charge of rescuing stores from what had been ritz with mcnish in charge it took only a couple of hours to open deck far enough to retrieve a good quantity of provisions on ice right thumb mcnish s cat mrs chippy had to be killed after ship was destroyed during his watch one night while crew were camped on ice a small part of ice floe broke away and he was only rescued due to quick intervention of men of next watch who threw him a line allowing him to jump back to safety shackleton reported that mcnish calmly mentioned his narrow escape next day after further cracks appeared in ice mrs chippy cat mcnish had brought on board had to be shot after loss of endurance as it was obvious he would not survive harsh conditions mcnish apparently never forgave shackleton for giving order mcnish proposed building a smaller craft from wreckage of ship but was overruled with shackleton instead deciding to head across ice to open water pulling ship s three lifeboats mcnish had been suffering with piles and homesickness from almost before voyage had begun and once ship was lost his frustration began to grow he vented his feelings in his diary targeting his tent mates language in great pain while pulling sledges across ice mcnish briefly rebelled refusing to take his turn in harness and protesting to frank worsley that since endurance had been destroyed crew was no longer under any obligation to follow orders accounts vary as to how shackleton handled this some report that he threatened to shoot mcnish others that he read him ship s articles making it clear that crew were still under obligation until they reached port mcnish s assertion would have normally been correct duty to master and pay normally stopped when a ship was lost but articles crew had signed for endurance had a special clause inserted in which crew agreed to perform any duty on board in boats or on shore as directed by master and owner aside from this mcnish really had no choice but to comply he could not survive alone and could not continue with rest of party unless he obeyed orders eventually shackleton decided that attempt to pull boats had been a mistake and decided that only solution was to wait for movement of ice to bring party to open water as supplies began to dwindle party grew hungry mcnish records that he smoked himself sick trying to alleviate pangs of hunger and although he thought shooting of dogs terribly sad he was happy to eat meat they provided stating their flesh tastes a treat it is a big treat for us after being so long on seal meat when ice finally brought camp to edge of pack ice shackleton decided that three boats james caird stancomb wills and dudley docker should make initially for elephant island mcnish had prepared boats as best he could for a long journey in open ocean building up their sides to give them a higher clearance from water elephant island and james caird on sea journey to elephant island mcnish was in james caird with shackleton and frank wild as they approached island wild who had been at tiller for 24 hours straight was close to collapse so shackleton ordered mcnish to relieve him mcnish was not in a much better state himself and despite terrible conditions he fell asleep after half an hour boat swung around and a huge wave drenched him this was enough to wake him but shackleton seeing mcnish too was exhausted ordered him to be relieved after crew had made it to elephant island shackleton decided to take a small crew and make for south georgia where there was a possibility that they would find crews from whaling ships to help effect a rescue for rest of men mcnish was called upon by shackleton to make james caird seaworthy for long voyage and was selected as part of crew possibly because shackleton was afraid of effect he would have on morale if left behind with other men for his part mcnish seemed happy to go he was unimpressed by island and chances of survival for men overwintering there right thumb 250px voyages of james caird trip to elephant island is shown in green voyage to south georgia in blue mcnish used mast of another of boats stancomb wills to strengthen keel and build up small 22 foot 6 7 m long boat so it would withstand seas during 800 mile 1480 km trip he caulked it using a mixture of seal blood and flour and using wood and nails taken from packing cases and runners of sledges he built a makeshift frame which was then covered with canvas shackleton was worried boat bore a strong likeness to stage scenery only giving appearance of sturdiness he later admitted that crew could not have lived through voyage without it when launching boat mcnish and john vincent were thrown from deck into sea although soaked both were unharmed and managed to exchange some clothes with elephant island party before james caird set off mood on board was buoyant and mcnish recorded in his diary on 24 april 1916 mood did not last though conditions aboard small craft during trip were terrible with crew constantly soaked and cold mcnish impressed shackleton with his ability to bear up under strain more so than younger vincent who collapsed from exhaustion and cold six men split into two watches of four hours three of men would handle boat while other three lay beneath canvas decking attempting to sleep mcnish shared a watch with shackleton and crean all men complained of pains in their legs and on fourth day out from elephant island mcnish suddenly sat down and removed his boots revealing his legs and feet were white and puffy with early signs of trench foot on seeing state of mcnish s feet shackleton ordered all men to remove their boots south georgia crew of james caird reached south georgia on 10 may 1916 15 days after setting out from elephant island they landed in cave cove on king haakon bay it was on wrong side of island but it was a relief for all of them to make land mcnish wrote in his diary they found albatross chicks and seals to eat but despite relative comfort of island compared to small boat they still urgently needed to reach whaling station at husvik on other side of island to fetch help for men on elephant island it was clear that mcnish and vincent could not continue so shackleton left them in care of timothy mccarthy camped in upturned james caird and with worsley and crean made hazardous trip over mountains mcnish took screws from james caird and attached them to boots of men making journey to help them grip ice he also fashioned a crude sledge from driftwood he found on beach but it proved too clumsy to be practical when shackleton s party set off on 18 may 1916 mcnish accompanied them for a few hundred yards but he was unable to go any further he shook hands with each of men wished them good luck and then shackleton sent him back putting mcnish in command of remaining men shackleton charged him to wait for relief and if none had come by end of winter to attempt to sail to east coast once shackleton s party had crossed mountains and arrived in husvik he sent worsley with one of whaler s ships samson to pick up mcnish and other men after seeing emaciated and drawn mcnish on his arrival at whaling station shackleton recorded that he felt that rescue had come just in time for him polar medal left thumb 200px polar medal was instituted in 1904 for members of captain scott s first expedition to antarctic whatever true story of rebellion on ice neither worsley nor mcnish ever mentioned incident in writing shackleton omitted it entirely from south his account of expedition and referred to it only tangentially in his diary everyone working well except carpenter i shall never forget him in this time of strain and stress event was recorded in ship s log but log entry was struck during sea voyage in james caird shackleton being impressed by carpenter s show of grit and spirit nevertheless mcnish s name appeared on list of four men not recommended for polar medal in letter sent by shackleton on his return macklin thought denial of medal unjustified macklin believed that shackleton may have been influenced in his decision by worsley who shared a mutual enmity with mcnish and had accompanied shackleton back from antarctica members of scott polar research institute new zealand antarctic society and caroline alexander author of endurance have criticised shackleton s denial of award to mcnish and there is an ongoing campaign to have him awarded medal posthumously later life memorials and records thumb right mcnish s grave in karori cemetery with statue of mrs chippy which was added by new zealand antarctic society his last name is here spelled mcneish after expedition mcnish returned to merchant navy working on various ships he often complained that his bones permanently ached due to conditions during journey in james caird he would reportedly sometimes refuse to shake hands because of pain he divorced lizzie littlejohn on 2 march 1918 by which time he had already met his new partner agnes martindale mcnish had a son named tom and martindale had a daughter named nancy although she is mentioned frequently in his diary it appears mcnish was not nancy s father he spent 23 years in navy in total during his life but eventually secured a job with new zealand shipping company after making five trips to new zealand he moved there in 1925 leaving behind his wife and all of his carpentry tools he worked on waterfront in wellington until his career was ended by an injury destitute he would sleep in wharf sheds under a tarpaulin and relied on monthly collections from dockworkers he was found a place in ohiro benevolent home but his health continued to deteriorate he died on 24 september 1930 in wellington hospital he was buried in karori cemetery wellington on 26 september 1930 with full naval honours hms dunedin which happened to be in port at time provided twelve men for firing party and eight bearers however his grave remained unmarked for almost thirty years new zealand antarctic society nzac erected a headstone on 10 may 1959 in 2001 it was reported that grave was untended and surrounded by weeds but in 2004 grave was tidied and a life size bronze sculpture of mcnish s beloved cat mrs chippy was placed on his grave by nzac his grandson tom believes this tribute would have meant more to him than receiving polar medal in 1958 british antarctic survey named a small island in his honour mcneish island which lies in approaches to king haakon bay south georgia island was renamed mcnish island in 1998 after his birth certificate was presented to united kingdom antarctic place names committee on 18 october 2006 a small oval wall plaque commemorating his achievements was unveiled at port glasgow library in his home town and earlier in same year he was subject of an exhibition at mclean museum and art gallery greenock his journals are held in alexander turnbull library in wellington new zealand notes a for location of mcnish s birth see map b there was little doubt as to his skill as a shipwright even before he was called upon for modifications to boats he was never seen to take measurements producing perfect work by eye macklin commented that all work he did was first class and even thomas orde lees who disliked him grudgingly admitted he was an expert wooden ship s man c mrs chippy was discovered to be a male a month after voyage started but by that time name had stuck d wife in this source probably refers to agnes martindale who was his partner but not his wife mcnish was already divorced by
