there have been two separate generations of trams in rouen first generation tramway was a tram network built in rouen normandy northern france that started service in 1877 and finally closed in 1953 there were no trams at all in rouen between 1953 and 1994 when modern rouen tramway opened horse drawn carriages and omnibuses had started at end of 18th century and progressively improved but were no longer enough to provide urban services in an age of industrial and demographic growth local officials therefore adopted tramway as a new mode of transport at first they were horse drawn and later steam powered tramway was electrified in 1896 network spread quickly through various city centre districts on right bank of seine to reach suburbs of northern plateau hills of bonsecours in east skirting around textile valley of river in west crossing river and serving in south suburbs and industrial districts of left bank at its largest it covered of route longest network in france during belle epoque and contributed to success of events in town s history such as colonial exhibition of 1896 and norman millennium festival of 1911 although 1920s saw a slight growth in traffic network s expansion slowed to a halt private motoring had arrived to put an end to its monopoly rising power of buses and trolleybuses great depression in france and above all second world war that ravaged rouen and normandy condemned tramway to death last trams stopped running in 1953 after seventy six years of service however in 1994 a new rouen tramway came to norman capital first tramways horse and steam thumb right a horse drawn tram on rue jeanne d arc rouen was integrated into french kingdom after philip ii of france annexed normandy in 1204 and it continued as one of largest cities in kingdom under ancien regime it prospered during 19th century with traditional trades of textiles and rouen manufactory faience alongside newer chemical and papermaking industries navigable seine emptying at rouen had been parisians route to sea ever since middle ages napoleon bonaparte said rouen and le havre form a single town of which seine is high street rouen and orleans were first large cities to be connected by rail to paris on 3 may 1843 after franco prussian war of 1870 1871 economy of first industrial revolution under second empire and ever growing population obliged rouen city authorities to rethink travel facilities both within city centre and between it and expanding suburbs urban services always horse drawn either carriages or omnibuses on most profitable routes were not enough to satisfy needs of a town that already numbered with its suburbs more than people from 1873 to 1875 city fathers commissioned a study into building railways connecting most populous areas of rouen a decree was signed on 5 may 1876 committing to a publicly owned standard gauge network and to horse drawn carriages nine lines stretching or 1 370 chains were decreed details of lines

close railway links between city and great britain that remained for nearly half a century naturally mr harding wanted to promote his company s machines so he long made his views known to municipal authorities finally convinced they authorised him to use steam power from maromme line 1 entering service on 29 december 1877 merryweather sons whose depot was on avenue du mont riboudet provided tram units small and light these reversible locomotives had two coupled axles fully covered by a wooden body they looked same as a normal carriage so as not to frighten horses these steam carriages had

1878 he also started steam traction from darnetal line 2 started 23 june 1879 on other hand lines that went through narrow local streets remained horse drawn when first opened line 4 opened 3 october 1878 line 5 opening 12 december 1878 line 6 opened 6 february 1879 and line 3 opened 27 september 1879 line 9 was not constructed because of technical difficulties opening dates for more than six years twenty three locomotives coexisted with horse drawn trams on rouen network speed and regularity of steam trams pleased passengers speed limit was between mont riboudet and maromme but they were also expensive frequent stops let boilers cool down so coal consumption was high moreover steam power angered both residents who accused them of being dirty and rough riding and coachmen whose animals were scared by driver s horn and infernal noise of trains operation thus was totally horse drawn from 1884 ctr thus found itself in charge of a cavalry of around 350 horses stabled at trianon and maromme depot at mont riboudet having been disposed of electrification thumb right upright 1 1 rouen tram on rue grand pont in 1895 mediocrity of horse drawn service and prospect of great colonial exposition due to open in rouen on 1 april 1896 made town officials think of extension and electrification of network councillors were sent on study trips both in france and abroad one councillor even spent a year in united states at last after much debate town accepted ctr s proposals electrification was contracted to company of thomson houston who built first network ten lines of standard gauge

service on 19 july on sotteville line after teething troubles new mode of transport had considerable success in 1896 it transported over fifteen million passengers tram sheds holding 50 vehicles were expanded to accommodate 25 more during first year of service these were classic with two axles powered by two motors one on each axle and had room for 40 passengers description of rolling stock with its popular success network could be completed line 10 extension to saint etienne du rouvray was opened on 16 april 1899 an 11th line was constructed from maromme to notre dame de opened 17 december 1899 and a 12th from church of saint sever to saint maur sea wall 6 february 1908 rouen tramways had of lines largest electric network in france trams were up to three cars long and ran at at 20 minute intervals dynamism of public transport in rouen was an inspiration to baron empain who through intermediary of his colleague proposed creation of a second complementary network he met numerous difficulties to which ctr was no stranger but on 17 july 1899 a new company to be called a sister company of better known cgt was granted concession over five routes lines description 1 gare d orleans

per route mile in 1908 over 20 million people used public transport in rouen 19 million with ctr 1 6 million with cgt in 1908 cgt disposed of second network to because of administrative problems a serious accident at monumental on 6 november runaway tram derailed at foot of a steep slope at bottom of avenue leading to rouen s main cemetery one person was killed and three injured see and a considerable deficit this became an opportunity for rival crt who in 1910 took over cgt s running rights and so were finally rid of competition ctr was now master of all of public transport in rouen and its suburbs having also absorbed tramway and funicular railway of bonsecours on 25 september 1909 it reorganised its service to be more integrated it also expanded service with later running trams and extended line 12 first to champ de courses opened 1 january 1910 then to bois guillaume opened 4 june 1911 and mont saint aignan opened 15 march 1913 this last section running over local authority

war i thumb right and conductress during world war i 1916 world war i did not affect tram service in rouen as much as it did elsewhere after a short period of disruption during great august 1914 mobilisation ctr maintained normal service during four years of war it overcame its reduced staffing levels with overtime abolition of leave and redeployment of depot personnel nearly all conductors were promoted to motormen to their great satisfaction at end of 1916 women aged 24 or over in 1916 reduced to 23 or over in 1918 joined men on trams but sexism at that time being norm female motormen were only allowed on easy lines of mont saint aignan bois guillaume and monumental and were not allowed on steep gradients to satisfy military requirements network extended champ de courses track to chateau du madrillet headquarters of an important bef base it also built a connection to transport injured arriving by train at gare saint sever to main hospitals of rouen these installations constructed in record time disappeared when war ended operational difficulties and closure thumb left upright 1 05 tram near gare de rouen rive droite gare rue verte recovery and competition during world war i track and rolling stock received little maintenance and by end of war they were in a state while expenses had increased dramatically problem became a crisis after serious fire at trianon depot on 30 november 1921 which destroyed 70 of 155 trams of ctr successive fare rises provided a stopgap but with new convention of 29 december 1923 company announced a reorganisation of network a competitor had also arrived bus trams had always attracted criticism over their limited capacity slowness and discomfort and their encumbrance to motor cars in city centre another accident on monumental line on 5 october 1925 hastened inevitable trams lost their first route fightback through innovation thumb right upright 1 05 left bank of seine between gare de saint sever and gare d orleans against these setbacks ctr still had a record year in 1928 with over 30 million journeys but from 1929 buses took to narrow streets in city centre as well as routes with low tram traffic such as chartreux maromme and circular tramways continued as going concerns and started large programmes of renovation and modernisation in dozen or so years before world war ii between 1928 and 1932 75 first generation trams were rebuilt to allow one man operation rouen workshops presently devised two prototypes of classical design but with double folding doors at front and safety devices compressed air on one of prototypes electrical on other which became basis for a series of 25 vehicles named these new locomotives reused some elements of state cars on railway 25 new trailing cars completed new rolling stock in 1931 a revolutionary pedal controlled locomotive was built equipped with disc brakes but lack of funds meant no more came of it description of rolling stock 1930s also saw arrival of trolleybus having twin advantages of electrical traction and pneumatic tyres these newcomers supplanted old trams on mont saint aignan line from sotteville and saint etienne du rouvray in 1938 tram sheds were enlarged for arrival of ten reversible trams bought from paris world war ii and after thumb left upright 1 05 two trams at place de l hotel de ville world war ii hit rouen hard including its transport network in 1939 before war started mobilisation and requisition had reduced service frequency german advance in 1940 blew up city s bridges on 9 june 1940 rouen transporter bridge was destroyed which split tram network in two until 1946 with german occupation lines were progressively reopened but service was reduced difficulties became such during this period that directors of managing director of ctr m was killed in bombing of 17 august 1942 had to improvise mobile workshops heavy bombing raids of spring 1944 in particular destruction of central part of rue lemire stopped trams running nazi occupation ended on 30 august 1944 and liberation slowly healed town s wounds it had been a catastrophe for network of 76 trams in circulation in 1939 24 had been destroyed and 25 damaged track and overhead lines had been mutilated trianon depot had been bombed several times still service was slowly restored thanks to staff s hard work and above all passengers help in shunting trailing cars in 1945 38 locomotives and 14 trailing cars were operational but despite restoration of service across seine on 20 april 1946 war had struck a fatal blow rouen was full of out of date equipment and so trams were progressively replaced by buses and trolleybuses in march 1950 municipality decided definitely to close tramway but its actual closure came somewhat later it was not until saturday 28 february 1953 that last tram ran on champ de courses line 76 years after network s first service but did not forget tram s services rendered organising a first class funeral just before last scheduled run a parade of honour made up of three trams ran from hotel de ville to trianon depot cheered by crowds bonsecours funicular railway and tramway thumb right upright 0 75 bonsecours funicular railway climbing monte d towards its terminus bonsecours is a commune on a plateau to southwest of rouen until 1890 only an infrequent bus service linked it to rouen however it attracted many hikers with its splendid panoramas over meandering seine and pilgrims visiting shrine to virgin mary early projects a first railway project for mountain later known by name was presented in 1876 by cordier it was one of far flung ideas that railway companies often had in 19th century because classical rail has poor adherence cordier designed a raceway made of two granite rails embedded in concrete with a continuous guide rail between them line with a terminus at quai de la bourse would be served by steam carriages with a capacity of only 30 places but capable of running on public streets as well as its special track because of its technical complexity line would have been hugely expensive 1 1 gradient to bonsecours requiring no fewer than 30 viaducts spanning overall project was soon abandoned construction in 1892 bonsecours was finally connected to world below when two swiss engineers ludwig and built a funicular railway with water filled counterweights on 8 june 1892 it was formally declared open to public and first ran eleven days later on 19 june this mountain railway long and rising ran from banks of river seine to esplanade of basilica each car could hold 90 people 50 seated and its water tank could be filled in five minutes there were twelve journeys each way daily more on busier days but ferry service from its terminus at epaulet to rouen was irregular and by end of century it had a dangerous rival tramway thumb left motor no 6 in cutting rails and sleepers can be easily seen with another track at a lower level on right of picture at first in 1899 tramway was designed to be steam powered but by 1895 this had changed to electromotive power line was built by ctb and first ran on 21 may 1899 it was between two termini pont corneille and crossroads of rn 14 and roads with timetabling of up to 7 trams trams had greater power than their rouen counterparts with motors they could climb steep gradients up to 9 100 and could accommodate 48 passengers with 42 more in a trailing car new ownership and closure thumb right upright 0 75 bon secours tramway on coast at summit monument to joan of arc seventy two daily journeys each way brought tramway success and it transported nearly passengers in 1901 compared to for funicular which was clearly in a dire state financially passengers in 1898 figures were so catastrophic that on 25 november 1905 ctb sacked management of mountain railway and liquidated defunct operations continued and ctr took over both tracks on 25 december 1909 although tramway was always well used tickets sold in 1913 clientele of funicular continued to fall tickets collected same year and some daily receipts were less than 1 franc lacking passengers funicular closed on 25 may 1915 and tramway became monopoly service for bonsecours this date should not be confused with that for rouen service which continued until february 1953 trianon tramway thumb left map of trianon tramway left bank at start of 20th century suburbs of left bank were quickest growing areas of rouen in particular communes of sotteville a large railway town and grand quevilly but these towns did not have good enough public transport although ctr had constructed some lines they did not well serve residents wishing for rapid transit between suburbs and city centre line 4 of ctr with its central terminus at place beauvoisine ran only as far as trianon roundabout at edge of jardin des plantes a southern extension was planned to bruyeres roundabout a meeting point of several roads to new districts and to racecourse where major horse racing events took place each thursday but it was always delayed in 1903 a sotteville man m hulin owner and proprietor of chateau des bruyeres grew tired of these delays and asked for concession for a narrow gauge horse drawn tramway which would connect trianon roundabout to racecourse via elbeuf road being long two years passed in discussing project s profitability profit for both hulin and m dagan engineer from corps of bridges and roads and for tendering construction of line to a contractor other than ctr this time for reflection led to abandoning horse drawn trams in favour of mechanical traction and moving terminus from racecourse entrance to vast cemetery that authorities intended to build in end cemetery was never built on this site and so did not add any passenger traffic to line close to a shooting range ctr did not oppose line which would not compete with their own so it was made a public local may be surprising that trianon tramway chose steam whereas rouen trams were electric but trianon services were more rural with lower population density than more urban rouen ones if this were not guiding factor trianon tramway could have all been part of rouen network but this idea did not last long on 10 march 1905 small train in town thumb right trianon tramway at its terminus on route d elbeuf near jardin des plantes to right an urban electric tramcar returning to rouen line was put into service on 1 april 1906 well before official opening date of 28 april this short route opened solely for passenger traffic traced a rectangle between trianon roundabout and racecourse narrow gauge rails being established beside rue d elbeuf between trees lining road and fences separating adjacent land much of which was owned by hulin service was provided by two diesel electric locomotives built by turgan workshops each with room for 16 people this statement is contradicted in some published articles by and by relevant information in departmental archives relating to m chief engineer and more so those contained in soulier report given to conseil general of seine on 6 may 1908 imply that diesel electric locomotives were definitely used before steam locomotives see and and fuel depot was sited near to racecourse service was particularly frequent thirty journeys each way per day entire line took 10 minutes to traverse at a maximum speed of first months service did not meet hulin s expectations passenger numbers were much lower than expected coefficient of coefficient of use of a railway is usually calculated by dividing expenses by receipts in many railway articles it is given as inverse so that a positive result appears better than 1 which may not be clear to reader was catastrophic 0 39 in 1906 a law was passed instituting a weekly day of rest so it was decided from 12 january 1907 to extend line to madrillet roundabout at edge of rouvray forest which was popular for sunday walks this double track extension was inaugurated on 27 august 1907 same year diesel electric locomotives whose terrible noise frightened horses to chagrin of their owners were is no record of fate of old locomotives perhaps they were bought for network in drome which used same kind of infrastructure it is even possible that they were made into carriages as happened in la baule by electromotive traction two orenstein koppel 0 4 t suffix signifies a tank engine water tank was built onto chassis of locomotive itself so that a separate tender wagon was not required steam locomotives headed two open carriages each taking 16 passengers their chimneys were fitted with spark arresters to prevent forest fires around rouvray brief life thumb left upright 0 65 turgan diesel electric locomotive at time of photograph was taken at valence depot but same type ran on trianon line line was never profitable coefficient of use fell to 0 32 in 1907 and passenger numbers fell to from previously except on thursdays horse racing day and sundays where tramway took amorous walkers to forest paths trams went with few passengers often with none what is more high number of return journeys reduced possibility of making connections in rouen passengers on small line may have had to wait a long time at trianon roundabout for a connection to city centre situation so preoccupied that in january 1908 it replaced hulin always driving force and asked conseil general to authorise a reduction in service frequency but it also proposed to use four car trams instead of two car trams on busy days although departmental authorities accepted extra cars they would only allow reduction of service with much red tape as can be seen from this extract from report of soulier conseiller general of rouen it is well understood that at moment it is only a minimum society is always free to put in place number of trains necessary to transport passengers who present themselves that if it will satisfy this requirement its proper interest is guaranteed and in giving greater public satisfaction its infrastructure will be wisely used instead of it travelling empty for part of day to detriment of its business being given lower frequency of service on weekdays and saturdays except thursdays racing we can perfectly accept reduction to ten trips to those going from racecourse to forest but concerning part of journey from trianon to racecourse it is imperative that chief engineer keeps minimum to 30 otherwise there will be a kind of abandonment of line because for this small distance it will not be possible to get reasonable traffic with more frequent departures service modifications lowered operating expenses but coefficient of use went down dramatically 0 33 for first ten months of 1908 decision to axe line was made on 1 november 1908 two strategic errors had been made wanting a service independent of ctr s network and putting its terminus out of town railway was officially disbanded by a decree of 14 september 1911 rails were lifted public highway restored no trace of tramway remains modern tramway right thumb new rouen tramway in 1953 one of largest electric tramways in france disappeared but in 1980s rouen and other large cities such as nantes and grenoble decided that increasing traffic jams and desire to diversify public transport needed a new mode of public transport discussions started in 1982 under guidance of syndicate of several trades grouping together communes of greater rouen representing nearly inhabitants in 1986 technical and construction study centre put forward a report supporting construction of a modern tramway a pre project was launched in september 1987 and led to declaration of public utility on 22 april 1991 construction work was undertaken by gec alsthom and on 17 december 1994 first line of modern rouen tramway was inaugurated see also rouen tramway notes references sources further reading external links rouen tramway on site of photos of last trams in
