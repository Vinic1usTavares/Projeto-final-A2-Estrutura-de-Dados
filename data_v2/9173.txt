black parade until their october 7 2007 mexico city performance on stage band donned black marching uniforms similar to those worn by beatles for album sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band 1967 live performance was theatrical with way assuming character of a member of black parade his mannerisms were compared to bob geldof s performance of lead character in movie adaption of pink floyd s wall 1979 david bowie s performance as ziggy stardust with freddie mercury s stage presence there are also similarities to alice cooper in his welcome to my nightmare period video welcome to black parade
