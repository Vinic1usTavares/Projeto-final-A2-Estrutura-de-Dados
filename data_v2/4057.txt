time battle atb system in which time flows continuously for both player and enemies during combat this system was first established in final fantasy iv but in that game there was no way to visibly anticipate which character s turn would come up next in final fantasy v player can see which playable character s turn is next in battle in form of a time gauge or atb bar which fills according to a character s speed when selected character s turn arrives player can execute one of several commands such as attacking enemy with an equipped weapon using a special ability or item or changing character s row position atb mechanic with a gauge as seen in final fantasy v would be used in four following main titles in series and remains a staple mechanic of franchise job system main feature of gameplay of final fantasy v is job system players can freely select jobs also called classes for their characters to master allowing each character to gain special abilities and potentially master all 22 jobs 26 in game boy advance version each character begins with only freelancer class to gain access to new jobs players must acquire crystal shards this system is an improved version of one in

in conjunction with regular experience points characters gain job levels after accumulating ap as with regular levels required amount of experience increases after each job level ap and job levels do not transfer from class to class as job levels increase new skills become available for character to use in a new form of customization characters learn job specific abilities that may be transferred to a new job for example a character with knight job who has also earned job levels as a black mage may set black magic as a secondary command enabling both black mage and knight abilities in battle nature of these abilities varies while some serve as special commands in battle others may be innate to class or activated automatically when conditions are met such as thief s caution skill which prevents rear attacks from enemies this system allows for deeper customization of characters plot setting backstory of final fantasy v is revealed in phases through cutscenes and interactions with non
