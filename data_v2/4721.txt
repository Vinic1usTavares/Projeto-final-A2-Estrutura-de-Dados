battle of bardia was fought between 3 and 5 january 1941 as part of operation compass first military operation of western desert campaign of second world war it was first battle of war in which an australian army formation took part first to be commanded by an australian general and first to be planned by an australian staff 6th australian division major general iven mackay assaulted strongly held italian fortress of bardia libya assisted by air support and naval gunfire and under cover of an artillery barrage 16th australian infantry brigade attacked at dawn from west where defences were known to be weak sappers blew gaps in barbed wire with bangalore torpedoes and filled in and broke down sides of anti tank ditch with picks and shovels this allowed infantry and 23 matilda ii tanks of 7th royal tank regiment to enter fortress and capture all their objectives along with 8 000 prisoners in second phase of operation 17th australian infantry brigade exploited breach made in perimeter and pressed south as far as a secondary line of defences known as switch line on second day 16th australian infantry brigade captured township of bardia cutting fortress in two thousands more prisoners were taken and italian garrison now held out only in northern and southernmost parts of fortress on third day 19th australian infantry brigade advanced south from bardia supported by artillery and six operational matilda tanks its advance allowed 17th australian infantry brigade to make progress as well and two brigades reduced southern sector of fortress italian garrisons in north surrendered to 16th australia infantry brigade and support group of 7th armoured division outside fortress in all some 36 000 italian prisoners were taken victory at bardia enabled allied forces to continue advance into libya and capture almost all of cyrenaica in turn this would lead to operation sonnenblume german intervention in fighting in north africa changing nature of war in that

mediterranean sea area in between is dominated by high ground close coast highest is jebel akhdar in northern cyrenaica between benghazi in east and derna in north about 150 km away tobruk lies about

are only tracks in interior battle area of operation compass december 1940 to february 1941 italy declared war on united kingdom on 10 june 1940 bordering on italian colony of libya was kingdom of egypt although a neutral country egypt was occupied by british under terms of anglo egyptian treaty of 1936 which allowed british military forces to occupy egypt if suez canal was threatened a series of cross border raids and skirmishes began on frontier between libya and egypt on 13 september 1940 an italian force advanced across frontier into egypt reaching sidi barrani on 16 september where advance was halted until logistical difficulties could be overcome italy s position in centre of mediterranean made it unacceptably hazardous to send ships from britain to egypt via that route so british reinforcements and supplies for area had to travel around cape of good hope for this reason it was more convenient to reinforce general sir archibald wavell s middle east command with troops from australia new zealand and india nonetheless even when britain was threatened with invasion after battle of france and equipment was urgently required to re equip british expeditionary force after its losses in dunkirk evacuation troops and supplies were still despatched to middle east command a convoy that departed united kingdom in august 1940 brought guns stores ammunition and three armoured regiments including 7th royal tank regiment equipped with matilda ii tanks on 9 december 1940 western desert force under command of major general richard o connor attacked italian position at sidi barrani position was captured 38 000 italian soldiers were taken prisoner and remainder of italian force was driven back western desert force pursued italians into libya and 7th armoured division established itself to west of bardia cutting off land communications between strong italian garrison there and tobruk on 11 december wavell decided to withdraw 4th indian division and send it to sudan to participate in east african campaign 6th australian division major general iven mackay was brought forward from egypt to replace it and mackay assumed command of area on 21 december 1940 geography unlike great sand sea coastal portion of libyan desert is stony rather than sandy but it is no less arid and supports little vegetation close to coast ground was broken by wadis military vehicles could traverse stony desert with little difficulty although heat dust and wind caused their rapid deterioration because it was so thinly populated bombs and shells could be used with minimal risk of civilian casualties winter nights could be bitterly cold yet days could still be uncomfortably hot there was almost no food or water and little shelter from cold heat or wind desert was however relatively free from disease planning and preparation italian after disaster at sidi barrani and withdrawal from egypt xxiii corps generale di corpo d armata lieutenant general annibale bergonzoli faced british from within strong defences of bardia mussolini wrote to bergonzoli i have given you a difficult task but one suited to your courage and experience as an old and intrepid soldier task of defending fortress of bardia to last i am certain that electric beard and his brave soldiers will stand at whatever cost faithful to last bergonzoli replied i am aware of honour and i have today repeated to my troops your message simple and unequivocal in bardia we are and here we stay bergonzoli had approximately 45 000 defenders under his command italian divisions defending perimeter of bardia included remnants of four divisions northern gerfah sector was held by 2nd 28 october blackshirt division centre ponticelli sector by 1st 23 march blackshirt division and elements of 62nd marmarica infantry division and southern mereiga sector by 63rd infantry division and rest of 62nd marmarica infantry division bergonzoli also had remnants of disbanded 64th catanzaro infantry division some 6 000 frontier guard gaf troops three companies of bersaglieri part of dismounted vittorio emanuele cavalry regiment and a machine gun company of 60th infantry division these divisions guarded an perimeter which had an almost continuous antitank ditch extensive barbed wire fence and a double row of strong points strong points were situated approximately apart each had its own antitank ditch concealed by thin boards they were each armed with one or two cannone da 47 32 m35 47 mm antitank guns and two to four machine guns weapons were fired from concrete sided pits connected by trenches to a deep underground concrete bunker which offered protection from artillery fire trenches had no fire steps and weapons pits lacked overhead cover each post was occupied by a platoon or company inner row of posts were similar except that they lacked antitank ditches posts were numbered sequentially from south to north with outer posts bearing odd numbers and inner ones even numbers actual numbers were known to australians from markings on maps captured at sidi barrani and were also displayed on posts themselves in southern corner was a third line of posts known as switch line there were six defensive minefields and a scattering of mines in front of some other posts major tactical defect of this defensive system was that if enemy broke through posts could be picked off individually from front or rear thumb 300px alt soldier in steel helmet on a motorcycle rides past two small tracked vehicles captured italian l3 tankettes in background is township of bardia and its

large number of gun models many of them quite old created difficulties with supply of spare parts older guns often had worn barrels which caused problems with accuracy ammunition stocks were similarly old and perhaps as many as two thirds of fuses were out of date resulting in excessive numbers of dud rounds there were also several machine gun models with seven types of ammunition in use breda 30 principal light machine gun had a low rate of fire and a reputation for jamming fiat revelli modello 1914 was a bulky and complicated weapon that was also prone to stoppages some of these had been rebuilt as fiat revelli modello which while an improvement were still unreliable principal medium machine gun breda m37 had shortcomings main one being that it used 20 round strips of cartridges which gave it a reduced rate of fire shortages of raw materials coupled with increased technological sophistication of modern weapons led to production problems that frustrated efforts to supply italian army with best available equipment result was that firepower of italian defenders was neither as great nor as effective as it should have been as a mobile reserve there were thirteen m13 40 medium tanks and a hundred and fifteen l3 35 tankettes l3s were generally worthless m13 40s were effective medium tanks with four machine guns and a turret mounted 47 mm antitank gun for its main armament that were in many ways equal of british armoured fighting vehicles 20 mm of armour on m13 40s while much thicker than that of tankettes could still be penetrated by british 2 pounder and tankettes were no match for british matildas in either armour or firepower none of tanks at bardia were fitted with a radio making a coordinated counter attack difficult bergonzoli knew that if bardia and tobruk held out a british advance further into libya eventually must falter under logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line not knowing how long he had to hold out bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks of food and water so that o connor could not simply starve him out hunger and thirst adversely affected morale of italian defenders that had already been shaken by defeat at sidi barrani so too did medical conditions undermine morale particularly lice and dysentery results of poor sanitation allied 6th australian division had been formed in september 1939 as part of second australian imperial force prime minister robert menzies ordered that all commands in division were to go to reservists rather than to regular officers who had been publicly critical of defence policies of right wing politicians these policies favoured royal australian navy which received majority of defence spending in interwar period result was that when war came army s equipment was of world war i vintage and its factories were only capable of producing small arms fortunately these world war i era small arms lee enfield rifle and vickers machine gun were solid and reliable weapons that would remain in service throughout war they were augmented by more recent bren light machine gun most other equipment was obsolescent and would have to be replaced but new factories were required to produce latest items such as 3 inch mortars 25 pounder field guns and motor vehicles war cabinet approval for their construction was slow in coming training of 6th australian division in palestine while vigorous and realistic was therefore hampered by shortages of equipment these shortages were gradually remedied by deliveries from british sources similarly no 3 squadron raaf had to be sent to middle east without aircraft or equipment and supplied by royal air force at expense of its own squadrons thumb 300px alt six officers pose for a formal group portrait

of staff of xiii corps as western desert force was renamed on 1 january 1941 had been a student at staff college camberley along with mackay s chief of staff colonel frank berryman at a time when o connor had been an instructor there harding later considered 6th australian division staff as good as any that i came across in that war and highly efficient australian doctrine emphasised importance of initiative in its junior leaders and small units were trained in aggressive patrolling particularly at night as it moved into position around bardia in december 1940 6th australian division was still experiencing shortages it had only two of its three artillery regiments and only 2 1st field regiment was equipped with new 25 pounders which it had received only that month 2 2nd field regiment was still equipped with twelve 18 pounders and twelve 4 5 inch howitzers only a squadron of 2 6th cavalry regiment was on hand as rest of regiment was deployed in defence of frontier posts at al and siwa oasis 2 1st machine gun battalion had been diverted to britain and its place taken by a british army machine gun battalion 1st northumberland fusiliers 2 1st antitank regiment had likewise been diverted so each infantry brigade had formed an antitank company but only eleven 2 pounders were available instead of 27 required infantry battalions were particularly short of mortars and ammunition for boys anti tank rifle was in short supply to make up for this o connor augmented brigadier edmund herring s 6th australian division artillery with part of xiii corps artillery 104th essex yeomanry

pounders and bofors 37 mm guns italian gun positions were located using sound ranging by 6th survey regiment royal artillery these positions disclosed themselves by firing at australian patrols which now went out nightly mapping antitank ditch and barbed wire obstacles aerial photographs of positions were taken by westland lysander aircraft of no 208 squadron raf escorted by gloster gladiator biplane fighters of no 3 squadron raaf british intelligence estimated strength of italian garrison at 20 000 to 23 000 with 100 guns and discounted reports of six medium and seventy light tanks as exaggerated a serious intelligence failure at a meeting with mackay on christmas eve 1940 o connor visited mackay at divisional headquarters and directed him to prepare an attack on bardia o connor recommended that this be built around 23 matilda tanks of 7th royal tank regiment lieutenant colonel r m that remained in working order attack was to be made with only two brigades leaving third for a subsequent advance on tobruk mackay did not share o connor s optimism about prospect of an easy victory and proceeded on assumption that bardia would be resolutely held requiring a well planned attack similar to that required to breach hindenburg line in 1918 plan developed by mackay and his chief of staff colonel frank berryman involved an attack on western side of bardia defences by 16th australian infantry brigade brigadier arthur tubby allen at junction of gerfah and ponticelli sectors attacking at junction of two sectors would confuse defence defences here were weaker than in mereiga sector ground was favourable for employment of matilda tanks and good observation for artillery was possible there was also prospect that an attack here could split fortress in two 17th australian infantry brigade brigadier stanley savige would then exploit breach in fortress defences in second phase most of artillery grouped as frew group under british lieutenant colonel j h frowen would support 16th australian infantry brigade 17th would be supported by 2 2nd field regiment in event artillery density 96 guns for an attack on an front was comparable to battle of st quentin canal in september 1918 when 360 guns supported an attack on a front mackay insisted that attack required 125 rounds per gun it had to be postponed to 3 january for this ammunition to be brought forward

this is a q war captured italian vehicles and fuel were used to haul supplies where possible on 12 december a reserve mechanical transport company took over 80 italian 5 and 6 ton diesel trucks that had been captured at sidi barrani they were joined on 15 december by fifty 7 1 2 ton trucks that arrived from palestine british were unfamiliar with diesel engines and a lack of spare parts indifferent maintenance and hard use under desert conditions soon took their toll leading to many breakdowns by end of december western desert force vehicle fleet was only 40 per cent of its establishment strength supplies were stocked at 8 field supply depot at sallum where a jetty was constructed by royal engineers troops of 16th infantry brigade began working at port on 18 december they were soon joined by two pioneer companies of cyprus regiment and a pioneer detachment from palestine regiment stores were hauled to 8 field supply depot by new zealand 4th mechanical transport

field supply depot with seven days supply of fuel stores and 500 rounds per gun of ammunition effort to do so proceeded satisfactorily despite italian air raids and blinding sand storms last minute efforts were made to rectify 6th australian division s remaining equipment shortages over last few days before battle some 95 additional vehicles were obtained of which 80 were assigned to hauling ammunition a consignment of 11 500 sleeveless leather jerkins for protection against cold and barbed wire were distributed as were 350 sets of captured italian wire cutters 17th australian infantry brigade finally received its 3 inch mortars but found them lacking their sights an officer dashed back to cairo to obtain these in time some 300 pairs of gloves and of marking tape arrived with only hours to go gloves were distributed but tape did not reach 16th infantry brigade in time so rifle cleaning was torn into strips and used instead battle air and naval operations thumb 240px alt gunners

bayonets two companies succeeded in taking 400 prisoners 2 2nd infantry battalion lieutenant colonel f o chilton found that it was best to keep skirmishing forward throughout this advance because going to ground for any length of time meant sitting in middle of enemy artillery concentrations that inflicted further casualties australian troops made good progress six tank crossings were readied

was able to quickly capture posts 20 and 23 at this point one tank ran out of ammunition anti tank fire already had blown off track of another in attack on post 20 nonetheless posts 18 and 21 were captured without armoured support using now familiar tactics of grenades wire cutting and assault with darkness approaching macfarlane attempted to capture post 16 but defenders beat him off he

perimeter held by 1st battalion italian 158th infantry regiment and 3rd battalion italian 157th infantry regiment instead in what military historians consider one of most disastrous example of a co seeking to make his mark godfrey decided instead to launch an attack in defiance of clear instructions he had received and against all basic military logic and common sense although poorly planned and executed godfrey s attack managed to capture post 7 and part of post 9 but post 11 resisted stubbornly that evening brigadier savige came forward to 2 5th infantry battalion s position to determine situation which he accurately evaluated as extremely confused attack was stagnant savige adopted a plan of walker s for a night attack which began at 1230 macfarlane advanced on post 16 he sent a platoon around flank to silently cut wire on western side while he led another platoon against northern side a bren gunner opened fire prematurely alerting defenders but macfarlane s men were able to overrun post same tactic was used to capture post macfarlane was supposed to capture post but was unable to find it in dark his troops attempted to capture it at dawn but defenders were alert and they responded with heavy fire with help of a 2 inch mortar second attempt was successful meanwhile captain g h halliday s d company moved southwards against post 19 he drew defenders attention with a demonstration by one platoon in front of post while rest of company moved around post and attacked silently from rear this maneuver took defenders by surprise and d company captured post and 73 prisoners at halliday repeated this tactic against post 14 which was taken at 0400 with 64 prisoners capturing two posts cost one australian killed and seven wounded a third attempt against post 17 failed previous attacks had alerted post and d company came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire a furious battle raged until post fell shortly before dawn another 103 italians were captured at a cost of two australians killed and nine wounded between casualties and men detached as prisoner escorts d company strength fell to 46 men and halliday elected to halt for night although australian progress had been slower than that achieved during break in phase 17th infantry brigade had achieved remarkable results another ten posts representing of perimeter had been captured switch line had been breached and thousands of italian defenders had been captured for italians halting australian advance would be an immensely difficult task bardia falls on afternoon of 3 january berryman met with allen jerram and frowen at allen s headquarters at post 40 to discuss plans for next day it was agreed that allen would advance on bardia and cut fortress in two supported by frowen s guns every available tank macarthur onslow s bren gun carriers and 2 8th infantry battalion which mackay had recently allocated from reserve allen gave orders accordingly during afternoon 6th cavalry regiment was pulled back to become brigade reserve and 2 5th infantry battalion relieved 2 2nd to free it to advance next day that evening berryman came to conclusion that unless italian defence collapsed soon 16th and 17th infantry brigades would become incapable of further effort and brigadier horace robertson s 19th infantry brigade would be required mackay was more sanguine about situation and reminded berryman that his orders had been to capture bardia with only two brigades while they were discussing matter o connor and harding arrived at 6th division headquarters and o connor readily agreed to change of plan 2 1st infantry battalion began its advance on schedule at 0900 but lead platoon came under heavy machine gun fire from post 54 and italian artillery knocked out supporting mortars 3rd regiment royal horse artillery engaged italian guns and platoon withdrew colonel eather then organised a formal attack on post 54 for 1330 following a bombardment of post by artillery and mortars italian guns were silenced when an australian shell detonated a nearby ammunition dump australians then captured post about a third of its defenders had been killed in fighting remaining 66 surrendered this prompted a general collapse of italian position in north posts 56 and 61 surrendered without a fight and white flags were raised over posts 58 60 63 and 65 and gun positions near post

isolated logistical and administrative units were being overrun recognising that situation was hopeless general bergonzoli and his staff had departed on foot for tobruk during afternoon in a party of about 120 men general giuseppe commander of italian tenth army considered possibility of sending a force to relieve bardia fortress but in end concluded that such an operation had no chance of success final drive on morning of 5 january 19th infantry brigade launched its attack on meriega sector starting from bardia road and following a creeping barrage southward with support of six matilda tanks all that remained in working order others had been hit by shells immobilised by mines or had simply broken down company commanders of lead battalion 2 11th infantry battalion did not receive their final orders until 45 minutes before start time at which point start line was away as a consequence battalion arrived late and intended two company attack had to be carried out by just one captain
