and obscure although sonic team was responsible for sonic gems collections creation they had limited involvement in development of games included on compilation for example sega am2 made sonic fighters and sonic r was primarily developed by traveller s tales most of games included are emulated but sonic fighters is a port at beginning of gems collections development sonic team made a list of most wanted games for compilation team considered games they felt were high quality in graphics gameplay and overall nature sonic cd and vectorman were considered for inclusion in mega collection but were deferred to gems collection producer yuji naka said storage constraints prevented sonic cd from inclusion in mega collection am3 s segasonic hedgehog 1993 was omitted due to problems emulating its trackball controls am2 assisted in porting sonic fighters marking its first release on a home console windows versions of sonic cd and sonic r were used in sonic gems collection both games received visual upgrades sonic cds opening sequence is presented in fullscreen and sonic r has higher resolution textures during development sonic team hoped that each region s version of sonic gems collection would be identical in content however streets of rage games and bonanza bros had to be omitted from north american localization due to fears of a teen rating from entertainment software rating board esrb team also wished to include both japanese and north american sonic cd soundtracks but storage and licensing problems resulted in japan only receiving its respective soundtrack and all other regions using north american version sonic gems collection was announced in may 2005 and was playable at electronic entertainment expo e3 it was released on august 11 2005 in

copies outside japan in 2006 gamecube version was branded a player s choice game indicating it sold a million units reviewers considered sonic cd compilation s strongest feature so much that nintendo powers steve t and electronic gaming monthly egm said it was worth buying for sonic cd alone juan castro ign found that sonic cd still holds its own against modern platformers praising its unique time travel oriented gameplay level design visuals and sound castro called it one of best games in sonic series and was no less fun than its original release ryan davis gamespot found sonic cd superior to other games in compilation and tom bramwell eurogamer declared rejoice for sonic cd just don t rejoice for anything else because it s mostly rubbish many reviewers were also pleased by inclusion of vectorman games castro called it pinnacle of 16 bit gaming praising its melding of boss fights action and platforming and saying it aged well bramwell and phil theobald gamespy agreed critics generally felt sonic r and sonic fighters were mediocre castro theobald and davis compared sonic fighters unfavorably to virtua fighter games with davis calling it dated and simplistic jeuxvideo coms superpanda in a negative review of compilation argued that sonic fighters was too short and had control issues but that sonic r was on par with sonic cd in terms of quality praising game s graphics and claiming that it was compilation s most beautiful game castro was less positive he found its ideas clever and considered it an interesting departure from normal racing games but thought ideas were poorly implemented and controls were awkward however he still thought game was enjoyable and that its soundtrack was unique theobald voiced a similar opinion considering it a concept that works better in theory than in practice conversely davis said sonic rs laughably bad soundtrack was its only redeeming quality bramwell considered it too odd and short to be worth player s time six game gear sonic games were criticized for their uneven quality and poor emulation theobald liked that games were available from start but was puzzled why other six games were left out he also considered selection random why sonic 2 but no sonic castro was intrigued that they were all on one disc but thought their screen displays were bad and said you d probably be better off dusting your old game gear and finding those old games rather than playing them on sonic gems collection of game gear games davis preferred sonic 2 sonic triple trouble and tails but disliked rest he heavily criticized their emulation quality noting their frequent frame rate drops bramwell joked they were present on disc for educational purposes he lambasted their resolutions and encouraged readers to ignore them entirely some reviewers found compilation incomplete davis and theobald both criticized exclusion of streets of rage games in north american version davis stated he preferred them over vectorman and theobald said sega should have just let compilation get a teen rating from esrb theobald was also disappointed that compilation lacked segasonic hedgehog knuckles chaotix and other game gear games jeremy parish 1up com said even combining sonic mega collection and sonic gems collection would provide players an incomplete sonic collection lambasting exclusion of knuckles chaotix and sonic hedgehog pocket adventure and feeling master system sonic games should have been included not game gear ones superpanda said he would have preferred knuckles chaotix over game gear games and also considered its exclusion of saturn version of sonic 3d blast a disappointment reviewers were generally divided over whether sonic gems collection would leave players satisfied egm summed it up as a woefully uneven mix but one sonic fans should check out if they wanted sonic cd castro said compilation was decent and worth its price tag but was not as solid as sonic mega collection theobald found it weak and that only sonic cd and vectorman would appeal to casual gamers bramwell was sarcastic if this sort of thing matters to you if you still can t bear to unplug your dreamcast and you do own virtua fighter 4 and all others and think they re brilliant this is for you when famitsu named best games of 2005 it ranked sonic gems collection among bottom of playstation 2 and gamecube releases notes
