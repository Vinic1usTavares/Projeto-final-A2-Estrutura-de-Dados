sport by their father playing football in winter and cricket in summer miller s father an engineer and emphasised importance of technique over power miller benefited as he was of small stature during his childhood and could not rely on brute strength miller yearned to be a horse racing jockey as he felt that he would not have physique to succeed in cricket or football miller received his secondary education at academically selective melbourne high school where his mathematics teacher was incumbent australian cricket captain bill woodfull he was an academically poor student who neglected his studies but excelled at sports he made school s first choice cricket team at age of 14 and gained attention for his technical and defensive ability which was compared to that of woodfull miller was rejected by st kilda cricket club so he joined south melbourne in district competition making his first grade debut at start of 1935 36 season still only tall in one match he scored 61 runs to orchestrate a lower order fightback in a low scoring match against woodfull s carlton team prompting his teacher to award him a silver eggcup during maths class it remained one of his most treasured possessions in following year miller grew and began to play cricket and football with more power leaving school at end of year 10 having just turned 17 miller played cricket for victorian colts for two seasons before breaking through to be selected for his first class debut late in 1937 38 season he played sporadically until making his sheffield shield debut during 1939 40 season and scoring his maiden century during this time miller played exclusively as a batsman he was yet to become a fast bowler miller s football career also took off starting in 1937 miller played for brighton football club in victorian football association for three years mainly as a defender at start of his fourth season he restricted bob pratt regarded as best forward of time to one goal for match and was named

and dundee and his paternal grandfather arrived in australia in april 1849 family lived in a one level terrace house in sunshine which at time was a separate town of 900 people west of melbourne s city centre area was and remains a working class area town s lifeblood was farm machinery maker h v mckay which employed a large proportion of population miller s father started as a teacher in warracknabeal in rural victoria before working as an engineer for mckay in ballarat until a transfer brought him to sunshine early schooling sunshine offered open fields and three miller boys quickly took a liking to sport during their childhood playing australian rules football in winter and cricket in summer their father had played cricket for warracknabeal winning a premiership in local league in 1900 les taught boys to play with a side on stance and underlined importance of orthodox batting technique reminding his sons to maintain a high leading elbow when hitting ball they were taught to rely on a solid defence concentration and self control in mould of leading victorian and australian test batsman of era bill ponsford perry p 12 miller began his schooling in sunshine where he quickly became known for his diminutive height he was one of smallest children in school at age of seven miller moved to inner eastern middle class melbourne suburb of elsternwick whitington p 43 where his parents had purchased a two storey house with a spacious garden that allowed children to play sport by this time his elder brothers had given him derisive nickname weedy miller s small size and age deficit meant that he conceded a strength advantage to his brothers in backyard cricket matches this forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power which held him in good stead for his future career whenever miller managed to dismiss his brothers and earn himself some batting time he typically played with a straight bat in a watchful manner as it was difficult for him to remove his brothers meaning that his opportunities with bat were rare miller and his friends would loiter outside ponsford s home just away in hope of catching a glimpse of their hero perry p 13 whitington p 45 like miller in his backyard ponsford was known for his powers of concentration and was first person to score two quadruple centuries in first class cricket perry p 14 miller often practised for hours

47 but he continued to play cricket and australian football at age of 12 he played for an under 15 victorian schoolboys cricket team that toured queensland under captaincy of future test batsman merv harvey at time miller stood only and wielded a sawn off bat his shots did not travel far but he impressed observers with manner in which he moved his feet and stroked ball miller s small stature in a contact sport such as football forced him to rely on physical courage something for which he became famed perry p 16 however his lack of height prompted him to turn to horseracing miller saw his first melbourne cup in 1926 at age of seven and had been fascinated ever since caulfield racecourse was only a short distance from family home and miller spent many early mornings watching trainers and jockeys go through their routines he eventually persuaded his father to let him take lessons aside from being attracted to racing culture miller felt that as he appeared destined to be a small person he was more likely to have a successful career as a jockey than in cricket or football perry p 17 melbourne high school thumb melbourne high school cricket team miller is standing at right truscott is

high school a selective government institution that accepted students through an academic exam at start of 1934 school s emphasis on scholastic and sporting excellence and its culture was more in line with that of a private school than a standard government school australian test captain bill woodfull was on teaching staff as miller s mathematics teacher because he did little study and focused his energy on sport miller was a mediocre student perry p 18 in addition to cricket and football miller played baseball and competed in swimming this disappointed woodfull a disciplined man who invoked school s motto honour work in exhorting his students to work hard as australia was attempting to emerge from depths of great depression despite being australia s captain woodfull refused to involve himself in coaching of school s cricket teams feeling that it would intrude on responsibilities of sports teachers despite this woodfull watched students at cricket training and quickly noticed miller s skills perry p 19 aged 14 and still under miller was selected in school s first xi with his pads flapping against his stomach and sporting a sawn down bat miller batted at no 6 and scored 44 on his senior debut although his lack of power was obvious miller s control and solidity prompted spectators to call him same nickname that was accorded to woodfull who had a similarly strong defensive style melbourne went on to win match perry p 20 and miller impressed his captain keith truscott who fought for his selection and took him under his wing truscott later became an ace fighter pilot in royal australian air force and miller would follow in his footsteps truscott s social influence compounded distractions from miller s study miller failed all eight of his subjects at end of 1934 and with an average mark of 25 was class dunce he scored zero in his final exam for woodfull s geometry class perry p 21 and was forced to repeat year 9 perry p 22 club cricket keith truscott miller s schoolboy

kilda cricket club but his protege could not find a place in any of club s five teams whitington p 48 joining local sub district cricket club elsternwick miller did not get to bat or bowl on debut and was then dropped to second xi after his first match for poor fielding nevertheless former victorian state player hughie carroll spotted miller s talent and lured him to rival south melbourne club however elsternwick used competition rules to prevent miller from playing for so he continued to play in former s second choice team in meantime miller continued to play for his school with steady results scoring 30 and 25 in two matches against melbourne s main rival university high school a loosening of zoning rules allowed miller to start competing for south melbourne in following season however rules required south melbourne to play miller in their first xi else st kilda could reclaim him so he made his district cricket debut for south at start of 1935 36 season after a trial in nets perry p 23 at this stage miller was just tall test batsman keith rigg recalled his first encounter with diminutive youngster in a district match it was at south melbourne that miller met ian johnson and lindsay hassett his future australia teammates and captains on debut against st kilda miller scored only 11 not out after batting for 62 minutes at no 7 but observers felt young batsman would succeed if he physically grew miller passed his exams at end of 1935 and continued his development on field he began to develop a leg break and googly and represented his school against a visiting schoolboy team from ceylon miller scored an unbeaten 28 to prevent a loss and later cited experience as helping to broaden his horizons towards other cultures assisted by cross training in baseball his improved fielding skills saw him placed in slips and he was named as melbourne high school s cricket sports champion for 1936 perry p 24 miller averaged 86 with bat and took 13 wickets at an average of 9 23 including innings figures of seven wickets for 29 runs against st kevin s and 3 5 against university high 7 29 means that bowler took seven wickets but conceded 29 runs in doing so these performances prompted woodfull to write in school magazine that miller has test possibilities perry p 25 in march miller played for south melbourne against carlton who were captained by woodfull south melbourne batted first and collapsed to 5 6 5 6 means that batting team has lost five wickets in process of scoring six runs sixth wicket fell at 32 bringing miller to crease he guided his team

let him bowl for first time small batsman took his first wicket in district cricket when test paceman laurie nash took a high leaping catch miller s performance prompted carlton to donate a silver eggcup as a memento for sterling performance woodfull presented miller with trophy during algebra class it was one of few sports trophies that miller kept in later life during 1936 miller underwent a sudden growth spurt including a three month period during which he added to his height he began to play football with more physical aggression and developed ability to leap high and take airborne marks perry p 28 increase in size allowed miller to become longest kicker in school team having grown in a year miller was unrecognisable to hassett upon his return to south melbourne following season perry p 29 eventually miller reached in height thwarting his ambition to be a jockey although he never lost his love for racetrack representative beginnings at start of 1936 37 season miller was

highest average he scored three half centuries and a 102 against northcote perry p 32 at this stage miller was a solid slow and steady batsman who accumulated his runs gradually but age predicted that his physical growth would open his horizons opining once he fills out he is rather tall for his weight miller should become a brilliant aggressive batsman perry p 31 in early february 1938 late in summer he made his first class debut for victoria as an 18 year old and hit 181 in 289 minutes against tasmania at melbourne cricket ground with his increased power miller began to loft ball over
