implacable class aircraft carrier was a class of two aircraft carriers built for royal navy during world war ii derived from design of they were faster and carried more aircraft than older ships they were initially assigned to home fleet when completed in 1944 and attacked targets in norway as well as subsequently they were assigned to british pacific fleet bpf was first ship to go to pacific and attacked japanese controlled oil refineries in sumatra en route she participated in operation iceberg invasion of okinawa in march april 1945 s arrival in pacific was delayed by a refit and she did not begin operations against japanese until june sister ships participated in attacks on japanese home islands in july and august indefatigable was only carrier chosen to continue operations after most of bpf withdrew to prepare for further operations in early august after japanese formal surrender in september implacable ferried allied troops and prisoners of war back to australia and canada for rest of year sisters returned home in 1946 indefatigable was used for rest of year to transport troops before being placed in reserve in 1947 and implacable became training carrier for home fleet indefatigable was converted into a training ship and reactivated in 1950 for service with home fleet implacable was relegated to reserve that same year and modified into a training ship in 1952 sisters were scheduled for modernisation during mid 1950s but it was cancelled as modernisation of carrier in queue ahead of them proved to be too expensive and lengthy sisters were decommissioned in 1954 and sold for scrap in 1955 56 background and description implacable class had its origin as an improved version of illustrious class aircraft carriers for 1938 naval programme while still remaining within available from tonnage allowed by second london naval treaty initial change was to increase carriers speed to no less than which required addition of a fourth steam turbine and associated propeller shaft offsetting additional weight of machinery meant reductions in armour thicknesses in hangar deck and bulkheads at ends of hangar at same time director of naval construction dnc was developing a different modified illustrious design design d to carry an additional dozen aircraft a total of 48 in a lower hangar that also incorporated additional machinery of initial design with sacrifice of even more armour hangar height was initially planned as in upper hangar to accommodate new fairey albacore torpedo bomber and in lower hangar to accommodate taller amphibious aircraft but a later change in policy raised upper hangar height to design d was submitted to board of admiralty on 2 august 1938 and approved on 17 november in april 1939 lower hangar s height was reduced to 14 feet to compensate for thickening of hangar side armour to and idea of carrying amphibians in hangar was abandoned friedman pp 141 44 implacable class ships were long overall and at waterline their beam was friedman p 366 at waterline and they had a draught of at deep load ships were significantly overweight and displaced at deep load brown 1977 p 49 their complement was approximately 2 300 officers and enlisted men in 1945 hobbs p 109 they had metacentric heights of at light load and at deep load as completed friedman p 151 ships had four parsons geared steam turbines each driving one shaft using steam supplied by eight admiralty 3 drum boilers chesneau 1980 p 20 turbines were designed to produce a total of enough to give them a maximum speed of friedman p 367 on sea trials ships reached speeds of with implacable class carried a maximum of of fuel oil which gave them a range of at armoured flight deck had a maximum width of friedman p 154 arrestor cables crash barricades aircraft catapult and lifts were designed to handle aircraft up to in weight carriers were fitted with nine arrestor cables aft that were designed to stop landing at speeds of up to they were backed up by three crash barricades to prevent landing aircraft from crashing into aircraft parked on ship s bow in case of damage to rear flight deck implacable class ships also mounted three additional forward arrestor cables to permit aircraft to land over bow a single bh3 hydraulic catapult was fitted on forward part of flight deck to launch 20 000 pound aircraft at lighter aircraft could be launched at a maximum speed of ships were equipped with two lifts on centreline forward of which measured and served only upper hangar and aft lift which served both hangars upper hangar was long and lower hangar was long both had a uniform width of roberts pp 62 64 both hangars had a height of only 14 feet which precluded storage of lend lease vought f4u corsair fighters as well as many post war aircraft and helicopters in case of fire upper hangar could be divided by two fire curtains and lower hangar had one fire curtain designed to stow 48 aircraft in their hangars use of a permanent deck park allowed implacable class to accommodate up to 81 aircraft crewmen maintenance personnel and facilities needed to support these additional aircraft were housed in lower hangar ships were provided with of aviation gasoline brown 1977 pp 48 49 friedman p 144 only enough for approximately five sorties per aircraft brown 1977 pp 48 49 hobbs p 108 armament electronics and armour ships main armament consisted of sixteen qf mark ii dual purpose guns in eight powered rp 10 mk ii twin gun turrets four in sponsons on each side of hull unlike illustrious class ships roofs of gun turrets were flat and flush with flight deck gun had a maximum range of at an elevation of 45deg and a ceiling of campbell pp 52 55 their light anti aircraft defences included five octuple mounts for qf 2 pounder pom pom anti aircraft guns two on flight deck forward of island one on aft part of island and two in sponsons on port side of hull a single quadruple 2 pounder mount was also fitted on port side of hull friedman pp 144 367 2 pounder gun had a maximum range of campbell p 71 two ships were also fitted with approximately sixty oerlikon 20 mm autocannon in varying numbers of single and twin gun mounts these guns had a maximum range of but many were replaced by 40 mm bofors aa guns when ships were transferred to pacific war as 20 mm shell was unlikely to destroy a kamikaze before it hit ship bofors gun had a maximum range of campbell pp 67 75 two additional quadruple pom pom mounts were added to implacable before she joined british pacific fleet in 1945 after war more oerlikons were exchanged for bofors guns by april 1946 sisters had 11 12 bofors guns and 19 30 oerlikons each friedman pp 149 154 4 5 inch guns were controlled by four mk v m fire control directors each mounting a type 285 gunnery radar two of directors were positioned on flight deck one each fore and aft of island a third was on island aft of funnel and fourth director was on port side of hull below flight deck each director sent its data to a fuze keeping clock aa fire control system for gunnery calculations each pom pom was provided with its own mk iv director that carried a range only type 282 gunnery radar campbell pp 15 16 18 19 friedman p 144 hobbs p 111 specifics of implacable class ships radar suite is not readily available in published sources they were fitted with type 277 surface search height finding radar on top of bridge and a type 293 target indicator radar on foremast ships probably carried type 279 and type 281b early warning radars based on radars fitted aboard illustrious class carrier late in war friedman pp 145 149 151 hobbs pp 111 113 implacable class ships had a flight deck protected by of armour sides of hangars were designed to be thick to protect hangar from low level attacks with semi armour piercing bombs but were supposedly thickened to late in design process at cost of reducing height of lower hangar naval historian norman friedman wrote ironically it appears that ships were actually built with 1 5 inch armour friedman pp 142 43 ends of hangars were protected by 2 inch bulkheads and armour of hangar deck ranged from in thickness friedman p 142 waterline armour belt was thick but only covered central portion of ship to form armoured citadel belt was closed by 1 5 to 2 inch transverse bulkheads fore and aft underwater defence system was a layered system of liquid and air filled compartments as used in illustrious class and was estimated to be able to resist a explosive charge magazines for 4 5 inch guns lay outside armoured citadel and were protected by 2 to 3 inch thick roofs 4 5 inch sides and 1 5 to 2 inch ends friedman pp 134 139 142 planned modernisation two implacables were tentatively scheduled to be modernised in 1953 55 with implacable following victorious draft staff requirements were drawn up in july 1951 this included combining two hangars into a single hangar strengthening flight deck and aircraft handling equipment to deal with aircraft enlarging lifts to adding a gallery deck between hangar and flight deck to accommodate additional personnel required addition of steam catapults and increase of her aviation fuel stowage to other desired improvements were new boilers to increase her endurance more space for latest radars and replacement of her anti aircraft armament with british version of 3 70 mark 26 gun and sextuple mounts for bofors guns friedman pp 305 10 by october 1951 estimated completion date for modernisation was already a year past initial estimate of april 1954 implacable was scheduled to begin her modernisation in april 1953 for completion in 1956 but director of dockyards pointed out that existing schedules prevented her from beginning any earlier than april 1955 unless modernisations of two cruisers and guided missile test ship rfa girdle ness were delayed controller of navy asked if time and cost of reconstruction could be reduced but minimum modifications were most expensive as they involved structural alterations controller ordered director of dockyards to plan for rebuilding implacable between june 1953 and december 1956 even after latter protested that even a limited modernisation would require about three quarters of structural work of original plan and that shortage of skilled workers already insufficient for victorious by herself would delay work on both ships in order to reduce amount of structural work requirement to replace boilers was cancelled and ship would receive existing radars instead of systems then still under development in january 1952 ship s new armament was finalized at six twin gun 3 70 mounts and three sextuple bofors mounts five months later admiralty decided that victorious would be last fleet carrier modernised as experience showed that process would take longer and cost more than was practicable friedman pp 310 11 hobbs p 109 ships 1995 p pp 109 shipbuilding and engineering co govan march

barracudas rear aboard implacable preparing for a mission off norway 26 november 1944 two ships were originally planned but only one carrier was included in 1938 naval programme as other was delayed a year by government while under construction ships had their forward lift enlarged to take non folding aircraft like hawker sea hurricane and early models of supermarine seafire flight deck was widened abreast forward lift splinter protection was added as were seven diesel generators each in their own watertight compartment all these changes increased ships displacement by at deep load implacables construction was suspended in 1940 in favour of escorts needed in battle of atlantic so that two carriers were launched within days of each other she embarked portions of her air wing for training in late august and was assigned to home fleet on 7 october at scapa flow after working up she joined ships searching for tirpitz a week later and some of her fairey fireflies spotted battleship off hakoya island near tromso subsequently her fireflies successfully attacked targets in norway hobbs pp 109 10 in late october carrier s seafires arrived and she participated in operation athletic off norwegian coast sinking four warships and two merchant ships and damaging a german submarine rohwer pp 368 69 in november and december implacable provided air cover for minelaying operations and attacked german shipping off norwegian coast on 15 december she began a refit at rosyth preparatory to her transfer to bpf which included augmenting her light aa armament hobbs p 110 when refit was completed on 10 march 1945 ship embarked an enlarged air wing with 81 aircraft 48 seafires 12 fireflies and 21 grumman tbf avenger torpedo bombers largest number of aircraft aboard a british carrier up to that time implacable arrived at sydney australia in may and joined other carriers of 1st aircraft carrier squadron 1st acs at manus island after their return from invasion of okinawa in june on 14 15 june carrier attacked japanese naval base at truk rohwer p 420 after working up with other carriers ship sailed with 1st acs on 6 july to rendezvous with american carriers of task force 38 off japanese home island of honshu ten days later british carriers began flying sorties against japanese targets on honshu on 17 july and implacables aircraft before departing area on 11 august to replenish flew over 1 000 sorties she arrived at sydney on 24 august and spent most of rest of year ferrying allied prisoners of war and soldiers back to australia and canada in january 1946 together with her sister indefatigable and several other ships she made a number of port visits in australia and new zealand ship was refitted in sydney in preparation for her return home on 3 june where she became deck landing training carrier for home fleet implacable temporarily became a trials carrier in october 1947 as her own air group was not yet ready and she was refitted from october to december 1948 in preparation of service as home fleet flagship she embarked a squadron each of de havilland sea hornets and blackburn firebrands in april 1949 and became flagship of admiral sir philip vian on 29 april a squadron of de havilland sea vampires flew from her deck later that year and her air group was augmented by a squadron of fairey barracudas in 1950 implacable was placed in reserve in september 1950 and slowly converted into a training ship by addition of extra accommodation and classrooms including addition of a deckhouse on her flight deck she was recommissioned on january 1952 as flagship of home fleet training squadron together with indefatigable she was present during coronation fleet review of queen elizabeth ii on 15 june 1953 four months later implacable ferried a battalion of troops from plymouth to trinidad in response to a crisis in british guiana she was decommissioned on 1 september 1954 and sold for breaking up on 27 october 1955 hobbs pp 110 11 thumb

fireflies and barracudas hobbs p 112 on 17 july she participated in operation mascot an attack on tirpitz that was foiled by german smoke screens following month indefatigables aircraft provided air cover to minelaying operations and attacked targets in norway she was also assigned to a series of attacks on tirpitz operation goodwood in late august which failed to significantly damage battleship rohwer pp 349 50 indefatigable was assigned to bpf in november and she arrived in colombo ceylon on 10 december where she joined 1st acs together with other carriers of bpf she attacked oil refineries in sumatra in january 1945 operation lentil and operation meridian before sailing to sydney to prepare for operations in pacific bpf joined american fifth fleet at ulithi on 20 march and attacked airfields on sakishima islands south of okinawa beginning on 26 march as part of preparations for operation iceberg during these operations indefatigable became first british carrier to be hit by a kamikaze when one penetrated combat air patrol cap and struck base of her island on 1 april bomb carried by kamikaze did not detonate and this limited casualties to 21 men killed and 27 wounded mccart p 155 damage to ship was minimal and flight deck was back in operation thirty minutes later after okinawa had been secured bpf arrived back at sydney on 7 june and indefatigable was delayed rejoining operations as she required repairs to her machinery she departed manus on 12 july and reached coast of japan eight days later her aircraft began attacking targets in inland sea on 24 july most of bpf withdrew as planned on 10 august to prepare for operation olympic invasion of kyushu scheduled for november but indefatigable and several other ships remained to represent britain at end of operations ship s aircraft flew missions on 13 and 15 august during last of these missions her seafires shot down eight of twelve mitsubishi a6m zeros while losing one of their own and an avenger gunner shot down another japanese aircraft after ceasefire her aircraft continued to fly cap and flew reconnaissance missions looking for allied prisoners of war hobbs p 113 indefatigable arrived at sydney on 18 september and began a leisurely refit that lasted until 15 november after touring australia and new zealand she arrived at spithead on 15 march 1946 where she was modified to accommodate over 1 900 passengers she ferried troops to and from australia ceylon singapore and america for rest of year before being placed in reserve at beginning of 1947 mccart pp 156 65 ship was modified for use as a training ship and recommissioned in 1950 for service with home fleet training squadron she was decommissioned at rosyth in october 1954 and towed to gareloch in june 1955 where she was listed for
