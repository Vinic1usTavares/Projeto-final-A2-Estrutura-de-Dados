british army during world war i fought largest and most costly war in its long history bourne 2001 pp 118 119 unlike french and german armies british army was made up exclusively of volunteers as opposed to conscripts at beginning of conflict chappell 2003 p 4 furthermore british army was considerably smaller than its french and german counterparts chappell 2003 p 3 thumb 300px men of wiltshire regiment attacking near thiepval 7 august 1916 during battle of somme photo taken by ernest brooks during world war i there were four distinct british armies first comprised approximately 247 000 soldiers of regular army over half of which were posted overseas to garrison british empire supported by some 210 000 reserves and a potential 60 000 additional reserves this component formed backbone of british expeditionary force bef which was formed for service in france and became known as old second army was provided by approximately 246 000 strong territorial force initially allocated to home defence but used to reinforce bef after regular army suffered heavy losses in opening battles of war third army was kitchener s army comprising men who answered lord kitchener s call for volunteers in 1914 1915 and which went into action at battle of somme in 1916 fourth army was reinforcement of existing formations with conscripts after introduction of compulsory service in january 1916 by end of 1918 british army had reached its maximum strength of 3 820 000 men and could field over 70 divisions vast majority of british army fought in main theatre of war on western front in france and belgium against german empire some units were engaged in italy and salonika against austria hungary and bulgarian army while other units fought in middle east africa and mesopotamia mainly against ottoman empire and one battalion fought alongside japanese army in china during siege of tsingtao war also posed problems for army commanders given that prior to 1914 largest formation any serving general in bef had commanded on operations was a division expansion of british army saw some officers promoted from brigade to corps commander in less than a year army commanders also had to cope with new tactics and weapons that were developed with move from manoeuvre to trench warfare both infantry and artillery had to learn how to work together during an offensive and when in defence they learned how to combine forces to defend front line later in war when machine gun corps and tank corps were added to order of battle they were also included in new tactical doctrine men at front had to struggle with supply problems there was a shortage of food and disease was rife in damp rat infested conditions along with enemy action many soldiers had to contend with new diseases trench foot trench fever and trench nephritis when war ended in november 1918 british army casualties as result of enemy action and disease were recorded as 673 375 killed and missing with another 1 643 469 wounded rush to demobilise at end of conflict substantially decreased strength of british army from its peak strength of 3 820 000 men in 1918 to 370 000 men by 1920 organization british army during world war i could trace its organisation to increasing demands of imperial expansion framework was voluntary system of recruitment and regimental system which had been defined by cardwell and childers reforms of late 19th century british army had been prepared and primarily called upon for empire matters and ensuing colonial wars in last years of 19th century army was involved in a major conflict second boer war 1899 1902 which highlighted shortcomings in its tactics leadership and administration 1904 esher report recommended radical reform such as creation of an army council a general staff abolition of office of commander in chief of forces and creation of a chief of general staff cassidy 2006 p 78 haldane reforms of 1907 formally created an expeditionary force of seven divisions one cavalry six infantry reorganised volunteers into a new territorial force of fourteen cavalry brigades and fourteen infantry divisions and changed old militia into special reserve to reinforce expeditionary force cassidy 2006 p 79 at outbreak of war in august 1914 british regular army was a small professional force it consisted of 247 432 regular troops organised in four regiments of guards grenadier with 3 battalions coldstream with 3 battalions scots with 2 battalions irish with 1 battalion 68 regiments of line and rifle brigade despite its name this was an infantry regiment 31 cavalry regiments artillery and other support arms tucker roberts 2005 p 504 most of line infantry regiments had two regular battalions one of which served at home and provided drafts and replacements to other which was stationed overseas while also being prepared to be part of expeditionary force royal fusiliers worcestershire regiment middlesex regiment king s royal rifle corps and rifle brigade prince consort s own had four regular battalions two of which served overseas almost half of regular army 74 of 157 infantry battalions and 12 of 31 cavalry regiments was stationed overseas in garrisons throughout british empire royal flying corps was part of british army until 1918 at outbreak of war it consisted of 84 aircraft regular army was supported by territorial force which numbered some 246 000 men in september 1913 and on outbreak of war was deployed in home defence beckett 2011 p 2008 p 53 in august 1914 there were three forms of reserves army reserve of retired soldiers was 145 350 strong they were paid 3 shillings and 6 pence a week 17 5 pence worth about ps70 per week in 2013 terms and had to attend 12 training days per year special reserve had another 64 000 men and was a form of part time soldiering similar to territorial force a special reservist had an initial six months full time training and was paid same as a regular soldier during this period they had three or four weeks training per year thereafter national reserve had some 215 000 men who were on a register that was maintained by territorial force county associations these men had military experience but no other reserve obligation and only some 60 000 were classified as willing or able to serve an active role at home or abroad mitchinson 2005 p 29 regulars and reserves at least on paper totalled a mobilised force of almost 700 000 men although only 150 000 men were immediately available to be formed into british expeditionary force bef that was sent to continent this consisted of six infantry divisions and one of cavalry by contrast french army in 1914 mobilised 1 650 000 troops and 62 infantry divisions while german army mobilised 1 850 000 troops and 87 infantry divisions addington 1984 p 92 britain therefore began war with six regular and fourteen territorial infantry divisions during war a further six regular 14 territorial 36 kitchener s army and six other divisions including naval division from royal navy were formed tucker roberts 2005 p 505 in 1914 each british infantry division consisted of three infantry brigades each of four battalions with two machine guns per battalion 24 in division they also had three field artillery brigades with fifty four 18 pounder guns one field howitzer brigade with eighteen howitzers one heavy artillery battery with four 60 pounder guns two engineer field companies one royal engineer signals company one cavalry squadron one cyclist company three field ambulances four army service corps horse drawn transport companies and divisional headquarters support detachments tucker roberts 2005 p 2005 pp 25 26 single cavalry division assigned to bef in 1914 consisted of 15 cavalry regiments in five brigades they were armed with rifles unlike their french and german counterparts who were only armed with shorter range carbine cavalry division also had a high allocation of artillery compared to foreign cavalry divisions with 24 13 pounder guns organised into two brigades and two machine guns for each regiment when dismounted cavalry division was equivalent of two weakened infantry brigades with less artillery than infantry division by 1916 there were five cavalry divisions each of three brigades serving in france 1st 2nd 3rd divisions in cavalry corps and 1st and 2nd indian cavalry divisions in indian cavalry corps each brigade in indian cavalry corps contained a british cavalry regiment gudmundsson anderson 2007 p 29 over course of war composition of infantry division gradually changed and there was an increased emphasis on providing infantry divisions with organic fire support by 1918 a british division consisted of three infantry brigades each of three battalions each of these battalions had 36 lewis machine guns making a total of 324 such weapons in division additionally there was a divisional machine gun battalion equipped with 64 vickers machine guns in four companies of 16 guns each brigade in division also had a mortar battery with eight stokes mortars artillery also changed composition of its batteries at start of war there were three batteries with six guns per brigade they then moved to four batteries with four guns per brigade and finally in 1917 to four batteries with six guns per brigade to economise on battery commanders in this way army would change drastically over course of war reacting to various developments from mobile war fought in opening weeks to static trench warfare of 1916 and 1917 cavalry of bef represented 9 28 of army by july 1918 it would only represent 1 65 infantry would decrease from 64 64 in 1914 to 51 25 of army in 1918 while royal engineers would increase from 5 91 to 11 24 in 1918 chandler 2003 p 212 british expeditionary force thumb august 1914 london volunteers await their pay at st martin in fields under terms of entente cordiale british army s role in a european war was to embark soldiers of british expeditionary force bef which consisted of six infantry divisions and five cavalry brigades that were arranged into two army corps i corps under command of douglas haig and ii corps under command of horace smith dorrien chandler 2003 p 211 at outset of conflict british indian army was called upon for assistance in august 1914 20 percent of 9 610 british officers initially sent to france were from indian army while 16 percent of 76 450 other ranks came from british indian army by end of 1914 after battles of mons le cateau aisne and ypres old regular british army had been virtually wiped out although it managed to stop german advance in october 1914 7th division arrived in france forming basis of british iii corps cavalry had grown into its own corps of three divisions by december 1914 bef had expanded fielding five army corps divided between first and second armies chappell 2003 p 7 as regular army s strength declined numbers were made up first by territorial force then by volunteers of field marshal kitchener s new army by end of august 1914 he had raised six new divisions by march 1915 number of divisions had increased to 29 territorial force was also expanded raising second and third battalions and forming eight new divisions which supplemented its peacetime strength of 14 divisions third army was formed in july 1915 and with influx of troops from kitchener s volunteers and further reorganisation fourth army and reserve army which became fifth army were formed in 1916 recruitment and conscription in august 1914 300 000 men had signed up to fight and another 450 000 had joined up by end of september chandler 2001 p 11 recruitment remained fairly steady through 1914 and early 1915 but it fell dramatically during later years especially after somme campaign which resulted in 360 000 casualties a prominent feature of early months of volunteering was formation of pals battalions many of these pals who had lived and worked together joined up and trained together and were allocated to same units policy of drawing recruits from amongst local population ensured that when pals battalions suffered casualties whole towns villages neighbourhoods and communities back in britain were to suffer disproportionate losses with introduction of conscription in january 1916 no further pals battalions were raised conscription for single men was introduced in january 1916 four months later in may 1916 it was extended to all men aged 18 to 41 military service act 1916 specified that men from ages of 18 to 41 were liable to be called up for service in army unless they were married or widowed with children or served in one of a number of reserved occupations which were usually industrial but which also included clergymen and teachers this legislation did not apply to ireland despite its then status as part of united kingdom but see conscription crisis of 1918 by january 1916 when conscription was introduced 2 6 million men had volunteered for service a further 2 3 million were conscripted before end of war by end of 1918 army had reached its peak strength of four million men analysis of death records from hundred days in 1918 suggests that around 60 of those who died were conscripts and that despite recent lowering of age limit for service on western front to eighteen and a half average age was still in mid twenties although incompleteness of records makes it hard to say whether these dead men were a representative sample of bef as a whole assertions that late war bef consisted largely of conscripted boys should therefore be treated with caution furthermore although there were certainly many cases of men being sent to regiments from parts of country other than their own many battalions were still filled with men from their traditional local areas same as earlier in war caution therefore should be employed before accepting claims that there was a deliberate attempt to destroy regiment and nationalise army eg by dunn in war infantry knew 1938 hine 2018 p 298 women also volunteered and served in a non combatant role by end of war 80 000 had enlisted they mostly served as nurses in queen alexandra s imperial military nursing service qaimns first aid nursing yeomanry voluntary aid detachment vad and from 1917 in army when women s army auxiliary corps waac was founded waac was divided into four sections cookery mechanical clerical and miscellaneous most stayed on home front but around 9 000 served in france commanders thumb field marshal douglas haig 1st earl haig in 1914 no serving british officer of british expeditionary force bef had controlled a formation larger than a division on active operations gardner 2003 p 1 first commander in chief of bef appointed in august 1914 was field marshal john french his last active command had been cavalry division in second boer war commander of british i corps in 1914 was douglas haig french had remarked in 1912 that haig would be better suited to a position on staff than a field command gardner 2003 p 11 like french haig was a cavalryman his last active command had been during second boer war first as a senior staff officer in cavalry division then commanding a brigade sized group of columns gardner 2003 p 10 first commander of british ii corps was lieutenant general james grierson a noted tactician who died of a heart attack soon after arriving in france liddell hart 1933 p 33 french wished to appoint lieutenant general herbert plumer in his place but against french s wishes kitchener instead appointed lieutenant general horace smith dorrien who had begun his military career in zulu war in 1879 and was one of only five officers to survive battle of isandlwana tucker roberts 2005 p 1096 he had built a formidable reputation as an infantry commander during sudan campaign and second boer war gardner 2003 p 13 after second boer war he was responsible for a number of reforms notably forcing an increase in dismounted training for cavalry this was met with hostility by french as a cavalryman by 1914 french s dislike for smith dorrien was well known within army gardner 2003 p 14 after failed offensive at battle of loos in 1915 french was replaced as commander of bef by haig who remained in command for rest of war he became most famous for his role as its commander during battle of somme battle of passchendaele and hundred days offensive series of victories leading to german surrender in 1918 haig was succeeded in command of first army by general charles carmichael monro who in turn was succeeded by general henry horne in september 1916 only officer with an artillery background to command a british army during war blaxland 1968 p 14 general plumer was eventually appointed to

promoted from ranks sheffield 2000 pp 3 4 officer corps during war consisted of regular officers from peacetime army officers who had been granted permanent commissions during war officers who had been granted temporary commissions for duration of war territorial army officers commissioned during peacetime officers commissioned from ranks of pre war regular and territorial army and temporary officers commissioned from ranks for duration of war alone sheffield 2000 p 29 in september 1914 lord kitchener announced that he was looking for volunteers and regular ncos to provide officers for expanding army most of volunteers came from middle class with largest group from commercial and clerical occupations 27 followed by teachers and students 18 and professional men 15 sheffield 2000 p 31

rapid promotion war also noticeably lowered age of battalion commanding officers in 1914 they were aged over 50 while average age for a battalion commanding officer in bef between 1917 and 1918 was 28 connelly 2006 p 22 by this stage it was official policy that men over 35 were no longer eligible to command battalions blaxland 1968 p 7 this trend was reflected amongst junior officers anthony eden was adjutant of a battalion when aged 18 and served as brigade major in 198th brigade while still only aged 20 robbins 2005 p 43 war also provided opportunities for advancement onto general staff especially in early days when many former senior officers were recalled from retirement some of these were found wanting due to their advanced age their unwillingness to serve or a lack of competence and fitness most were sent back into retirement before first year of war was over leaving a gap that had to be filled by lower ranking officers criticism of quality of staff work in crimean war and second boer war had led to sweeping changes under haldane staff college camberley was greatly expanded and lord kitchener established another staff college at quetta for indian army officers in 1904 nonetheless when war broke out in august 1914 there were barely enough graduates to staff bef four month long staff courses were introduced and filled with regimental officers who upon completing their training were posted to various headquarters as a result staff work was again poor until training and experience slowly remedied situation in 1918 staff officers who had been trained exclusively for static trench warfare were forced to adapt to demands of semi open warfare marshall cornwall 1977 pp 9 15 during course of war 78 british and dominion officers of rank of brigadier general and above were killed or died during active service while another 146 were wounded gassed or captured davies and maddocks 1995 p 22 doctrine british official historian brigadier james edward edmonds in 1925 recorded that british army of 1914 was best trained best equipped and best organized british army ever sent to war edmunds 1925 pp 10 11 this was in part due to haldane reforms and army itself recognising need for change and training training began with individual training in winter followed by squadron company or battery training in spring regimental battalion and brigade training in summer and division or inter divisional exercises and army manoeuvres in late summer and autumn beckett simpson 1985 p 47 common doctrine of headquarters at all levels was outlined in field service pocket book which haig had introduced while serving as director of staff studies at war office in 1906 second boer war had alerted army to dangers posed by fire zones that were covered by long range magazine fed rifles in place of volley firing and frontal attacks there was a greater emphasis on advancing in extended order use of available cover use of artillery to support attack flank and converging attacks and fire and movement army expected units to advance as far as possible in a firing line without opening fire both to conceal their positions and conserve ammunition then to attack in successive waves closing with enemy decisively cavalry practised reconnaissance and fighting dismounted more regularly and in january 1910 decision was made at general staff conference that dismounted cavalry should be taught infantry tactics in attack and defence badsey 2007 p 227 they were only cavalry from a major european power trained for both mounted cavalry charge and dismounted action and equipped with same rifles as infantry rather than short range carbines badsey 2008 p 198 cavalry were also issued with entrenching tools prior to outbreak of war as a result of experience gained during second boer war infantry s marksmanship and fire and movement techniques had been inspired by boer tactics and was established as formal doctrine by colonel charles monro when he was in charge of school of musketry at shorncliffe in 1914 british rifle fire was so effective that there were some reports to effect that germans believed they were facing huge numbers of machine guns rankin 2008 pp 55 army concentrated on rifle practice with days spent on ranges dedicated to improving marksmanship and obtaining a rate of fire of 15 effective rounds a minute at one sergeant set a record of 38 rounds into a target set at in 30 seconds jarymowycz starry 2008 p 124 in their 1914 skill at arms meeting 1st battalion black watch recorded 184 marksmen 263 first class shots 89 second class shots and four third class shots at ranges from beckett simpson 1985 p 56 infantry also practised squad and section attacks and fire from cover often without orders from officers or ncos so that soldiers would be able to act on their own initiative beckett simpson 1985 p 48 in last exercise before war it was noted that infantry made wonderful use of ground advances in short rushes and always at double and almost invariably fires from a prone position weapons british army was armed with short magazine lee enfield mk iii smle mk iii which featured a bolt action and large magazine capacity that enabled a trained rifleman to fire 20 30 aimed rounds a minute world war i accounts tell of british troops repelling german attackers who subsequently reported that they had encountered machine guns when in fact it was simply a group of trained riflemen armed with skennerton 1988 p 159 heavy vickers machine gun proved itself to be most reliable weapon on battlefield with some of its feats of endurance entering military mythology one account tells of action by 100th company of machine gun corps at high wood on 24 august 1916 this company had 10 vickers guns it was ordered to give sustained covering fire for 12 hours onto a selected area away to prevent german troops forming up there for a counterattack while a british attack was in progress two companies of infantry were allocated as ammunition rations and water carriers for gunners two men worked a belt filling machine non stop for 12 hours keeping up a supply of 250 round belts they used 100 new barrels and all of water including men s drinking water and contents of latrine buckets to keep guns cool in that 12 hour period 10 guns fired just short of one million rounds between them one team is reported to have fired 120 000 at close of operation it is alleged that every gun was working perfectly and that not one had broken down during whole period hogg 1971 p 62 lighter lewis gun was adopted for land and aircraft use in october 1915 skennerton 1988 p 6 lewis gun had advantage of being about 80 faster to build than vickers and far more portable hogg 1971 p 27 by end of world war i over 50 000 lewis guns had been produced they were nearly ubiquitous on western front outnumbering vickers gun by a ratio of about 3 1 ford 2005 p 71 stokes mortar was rapidly developed when it became clear that some type of weapon was needed to provide artillery like fire support to infantry weapon was fully man transportable yet also capable of firing reasonably powerful shells at targets beyond range of rifle grenades

infantry tactics thumb british infantry advancing in support during battle of morval 25 september 1916 part of battle of somme after race to sea manoeuvre warfare gave way to trench warfare a development for which british army had not prepared expecting an offensive mobile war army had not instructed troops in defensive tactics and had failed to obtain stocks of barbed wire hand grenades or trench mortars griffiths griess 2003 p 63 in early years of trench warfare normal infantry attack formation was based on battalion which comprised four companies that were each made up of four platoons tucker wood murphy 2005 p 357 battalion would form 10 waves with between each while each company formed two waves of two platoons first six waves were fighting elements from three of battalions companies seventh contained battalion headquarters remaining company formed eighth and ninth waves which were expected to carry equipment forward tenth wave contained stretcher bearers and medics formation was expected to move forward at a rate of every two minutes even though each man carried his rifle bayonet gas mask ammunition two hand grenades wire cutters a spade two empty sandbags and flares carrying platoons in addition to above also carried extra ammunition barbed wire and construction materials to effect repairs to captured lines and fortifications by 1918 experience had led to a change in tactics infantry no longer advanced in rigid lines but formed a series of flexible waves bull 2002 p 49 they would move covertly under cover of darkness and occupy shell holes or other cover near german line skirmishers formed first wave and followed creeping barrage into german front line to hunt out points of resistance second or main wave followed in platoons or sections in single file third was formed from small groups of reinforcements fourth wave was expected to defend captured territory all waves were expected to take advantage of ground during advance see below for when operating with tanks each platoon now had a lewis gun section and a section that specialised in throwing hand grenades then known as bombs each section was compelled to provide two scouts to carry out reconnaissance duties each platoon was expected to provide mutual fire support in attack they were to advance without halting but leap frogging was accepted with lead platoon taking an objective and following platoons passing through them and onto next objective while lewis gunners provided fire support grenades were used for clearing trenches and dugouts each battalion carried forward two trench mortars to provide fire support bull 2002 pp 50 51 tank tactics tank was designed to break deadlock of trench warfare in their first use on somme they were placed under command of infantry and ordered to attack their given targets in groups or pairs they were also assigned small groups of troops who served as an escort while providing close defence against enemy attacks only nine tanks reached german lines to engage machine gun emplacements and troop concentrations on way 14 broke down or were ditched another 10 were damaged by enemy fire in 1917 during battle of cambrai tank corps adopted new tactics three tanks working together would advance in a triangle formation with two rear tanks providing cover for an infantry platoon bull 2004 p 53 tanks were to create gaps in barbed wire for accompanying infantry to pass through then use their armament to suppress german strong points tucker roberts 2005 p 251 effectiveness of tank infantry co operation was demonstrated during battle when major general george montague harper of 51st highland division refused to co operate with tanks a decision that compelled them to move forward without any infantry support result was destruction of more than 12 tanks by german artillery sighted behind bunkers tucker roberts 2005 p 252 situation had changed again by 1918 when tank attacks would have one tank every 100 or with a tank company of 12 16 tanks per objective one section of each company would be out in front with remainder of company following behind and each tank providing protection for an infantry platoon who were instructed to advance making use of available cover and supported by machine gun fire bull 2002 p 56 when tanks came across an enemy strong point they would engage defenders forcing them into shelter and leaving them to devices of following infantry artillery tactics left thumb howitzers of 39th siege battery royal garrison artillery conducting a shoot in

increased from 32 heavy and six siege batteries to 117 heavy and 401 siege batteries clark delf 2004 p 7 with this increase in number of batteries of heavier guns armies needed to find a more efficient method of moving heavier guns around it was proving difficult to find number of draught horses required war office ordered over 1 000 holts caterpillar tractors which transformed mobility of siege artillery clark delf 2004 p 8 army also mounted a variety of surplus naval guns on various railway platforms to provide mobile long range heavy artillery on western front until 1914 artillery generally fired over open sights at visible targets largest unit accustomed to firing at a single target was artillery regiment or brigade one innovation brought about by adoption of trench warfare was barrage a term first used in battle of neuve chapelle in 1915 hogg 1971 p 13 trench warfare had created need for indirect fire with use of observers more sophisticated artillery fire plans and an increasingly scientific approach to gunnery where artillerymen had to use increasingly complicated calculations to lay guns individual guns were aimed so that their fall of shot was coordinated with others to form a pattern in case of a barrage pattern was a line creeping barrage was a barrage that lifted in small increments perhaps so that it moved forward slowly keeping pace with infantry hogg 1971 pp 25 26 who were trained to follow close behind moving wall of their own fire often as close as infantry commanders were encouraged to keep their troops as close to barrage as possible even at risk of casualties from friendly fire tucker 2001 p 1971 p 21 a creeping barrage could maintain element of surprise with guns opening fire only shortly before assault troops moved off it was useful when enemy positions had not been thoroughly reconnoitred as it did not depend on identifying individual targets in advance idea behind creeping barrage was that infantry should reach enemy positions before defenders had time to recover emerge from shelters and man their positions on first day of battle of somme barrage outpaced infantry allowing defenders to recover and emerge from their dugouts with disastrous results for attackers hogg 1971 p 26 creeping barrage demonstrated its effectiveness a year later in 1917 during battle of arras nicholls 2005 pp 53 54 a weakness of creeping barrage was that infantry was subordinated to artillery schedule while infantry commanders had less control over tactical situation and were therefore in danger of forgetting how to manoeuvre their troops around battlefield importance of barrage was such that traditional infantry tactics including a reliance on infantry s own firepower to support its movement forward was sometimes forgotten griffith 1996 p 67 once infantry had reached german trenches artillery shifted from creeping barrage to standing barrage a static barrage that would protect infantry from counter attack while they consolidated position a variant was box barrage in which three or four barrages formed a box or more often three sides of a box around a position to isolate and prevent reinforcements being brought up into front line this was normally used to protect trench raids connelly 2006 p 85 although it could also be used offensively against a german unit another type of barrage was sos barrage fired in response to a german counterattack an sos barrage could be brought down by firing a flare signal of a pre arranged colour as a german barrage tended to cut telephone lines a pre registered barrage would then descend on no man s land griffith 1996 pp 41 44 with introduction of tank artillery was no longer required to aid infantry by destroying obstacles and machine gun positions instead artillery assisted by neutralising german artillery with counter battery fire bailey 1989 p 142 british army researchers under lieutenant william lawrence bragg developed sound ranging a method of determining location of hostile artillery from sound of its guns firing bragg 1971 pp 31 40 a counter battery staff officer cbso was appointed at each corps to co ordinate counter battery effort collating reports from sound ranging and royal flying corps observers griffith 1996 pp 152 153 by end of war it was realised that important effect of barrage was to demoralise and suppress enemy rather than physical destruction a short intense bombardment immediately followed by an infantry assault was more effective than weeks of grinding bombardment used in 1916 communications royal engineers signal service formed in 1912 was given responsibility for communications that included signal dispatch telegraph telephone and later wireless communications from army headquarters to brigade and down to battery level for artillery for most of war army s primary methods of communication were signal dispatch employing runners messengers on horseback dogs and carrier pigeons visual signalling telegraph and telephone at start of war army had a small number of wireless sets which in addition to being heavy and unreliable operated on longwave in 1915 trench wireless sets were introduced but transmissions were easily intercepted by listening germans civilian telephones were used at outset of war but they were found to be unreliable in damp muddy conditions that prevailed consequently field telephone was designed a device that operated with its own switchboard apart from voice communication it featured a buzzer unit with a morse code key so that it could be used to send and receive coded messages this facility proved useful when in midst of bombardment exploding shells drowned out voice communication telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire and movement of troops lines were generally buried with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages primary types of visual signalling were semaphore flags lamps and flags lamps and lights and heliograph in open warfare visual signalling employing signal flags and heliograph was norm a competent signaller could transmit 12 words a minute with signal flags during daylight and signal lights at night signal lights which were secured in a wooden case employed a battery operated morse code key these signalling techniques had certain disadvantages however in trench warfare operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire while messages sent to rear by signal lights could not be seen by enemy forces replies to such messages were readily spotted and operators were once again exposed to enemy fire during war army also trained animals for use in trenches dogs carried messages horses mules and dogs were used to lay telephone and telegraph cables carrier pigeons who transported messages back from front line were also carried in tanks so that they could deliver messages during an attack over 20 000 pigeons and 370 handlers were used during war and at times they were sole means of communication royal flying corps thumb royal flying corps world war i recruiting poster at start of war royal flying corps rfc in field commanded by sir david henderson consisted of five squadrons one observation balloon squadron rfc no 1 squadron and four aeroplane squadrons nos 2 3 4 and 5 these units were first used for aerial spotting on 13 september 1914 but only became efficient when they perfected use of wireless communication at aubers ridge on 9 may 1915 aerial photography was attempted during 1914 but again it only became effective following year in august 1915 general hugh trenchard replaced henderson british use of air power evolved during war from a reconnaissance force to a fighting force that attempted to gain command of air above trenches and carry out bombing raids on targets behind line millett murray 1988 p 54 early aircraft of rfc were inferior to their german rivals in april 1917 known as bloody april rfc lost over 300 aircrew and 245 aircraft franks van 2007 p 36 not until late 1917 with introduction of sopwith camel and s e 5 were they able to compete successfully for control of air on 17 august 1917 general jan smuts presented a report to war council concerning future of air power given its potential for devastation of enemy lands and destruction of industrial targets and centres of population on a vast scale he recommended a new air service be formed that would be on a level with army and royal navy formation of new service however would make use of under utilised men and machines of royal naval air service rnas as well as ending inter service rivalries that at times had adversely affected aircraft procurement on 1 april 1918 rfc and rnas were amalgamated to form a new service royal air force raf raf was under control of equally new air ministry by 1918 photographic images could be taken from and interpreted by over 3 000 personnel planes did not carry parachutes until 1918 though they had been available since before war beckett simpson 1985 p 254 after starting with some 2 073 personnel in 1914 raf had 4 000 combat aircraft and 114 000 personnel by beginning of 1919 corps of royal engineers on 1 august 1914 royal engineers consisted of 25 000 officers and men in regular army and reserves by same date in 1917 it had grown to a total of 250 000 in 1914 when bef arrived in france there were two engineer field companies attached to each infantry division which was increased to three companies by september 1914 each division also had a signals company which was responsible for communications between corps division and brigade headquarters royal engineer tunnelling companies were formed in response to german blowing of 10 small mines in december 1914 at givenchy first british mine was detonated at hill 60 on 17 february 1915 mining was used increasingly during battle of aubers ridge in may 1915 and battle of loos in september 1915 in july 1916 on first day of battle of somme what became known as crater was created by a mine at la boisselle twenty one companies were eventually formed and were employed digging subways cable trenches sapping dugouts as well as offensive or defensive mining at end of war engineers were directly responsible for maintaining buildings and designing infantry front line fortifications and artillery positions telephones wireless and other signalling equipment railways roads water supply bridges and transport they also operated railways and inland waterways machine gun corps in september 1915 machine gun corps mgc was formed to provide heavy machine gun teams after a proposal was made to war office for formation of a single specialist machine gun company for each infantry brigade a goal to be achieved by withdrawing guns and gun teams from battalions created in october 1915 mgc consisted of infantry machine gun companies cavalry machine gun squadrons and motor machine gun batteries in trenches corps guns were deployed with an interlocking field of fire and proved to be a devastating defensive weapon against attacking infantry they were also used in an indirect fire support role in which they fired over heads and from 2006 p 66 of advancing infantry and behind german trenches to stop reinforcements and supplies from getting to front tank corps tank corps was formed as heavy section machine gun corps in 1916 hofmann 2006 p 53 tanks were used for first time in action in battle of somme on 15 september 1916 intention being that they would crush barbed wire for infantry then cross trenches and exploit any breakthrough behind german lines hoffmann 2006 pp 53 54 in november 1916 they were renamed heavy branch mgc and in june 1917 tank corps swinton 1972 p 178 originally formed in companies of heavy branch mgc designated a b c and d each company of four sections had six tanks three male and three female versions artillery or machine guns with one tank held as a company reserve in november 1916 each company was reformed as a battalion of three companies with plans to increase corps to 20 battalions each tank battalion had a complement of 32 officers and 374 men tanks were primarily used on western front first offensive of war in which tanks were used en masse was battle of cambrai in 1917 476 tanks started attack and german front collapsed at midday british had advanced five miles behind german line tucker roberts 2005 p 407 battle of amiens in 1918 saw value of tank being appreciated 10 heavy and two light battalions of 414 tanks were included in assault 342 mark vs and 72 whippets were backed up by a further 120 tanks designed to carry forward supplies for armour and infantry by end of first day of attack they had penetrated german line by 16 000 prisoners were taken griffiths griess 2003 p 155 in september 1918 british army was most mechanised army in world some 22 000 men had served in tank corps by end of war bond 2009 p 5 a detachment of

2005 p 471 life in trenches thumb right trench construction diagram from a 1914 british infantry manual by end of 1914 war on western front had reached stalemate and trench lines extended from belgian coast to swiss frontier by september 1915 length of british front line stretched some soldiers were in front or reserve line trenches for about eight days at a time before being relieved there were three trenches in a typical front line sector fire trench support trench and reserve trench all joined by communication trenches trenches varied in depth but they were usually about four or five feet deep or in areas with a high water table a wall of sandbags would be built to allow defenders to stand upright fire trenches were provided with a fire step so occupants could return fire during an attack see diagram ideally bottom of trench was lined with duckboards to prevent men from sinking into mud and dugouts were cut into walls these gave shelter from elements and shrapnel although in british army dugouts were usually reserved for officers and senior ncos men were then expected to sleep wherever they could and in wet weather they lived under or in tents at bottom of trench on duckboards at front soldiers were in constant danger from artillery shells mortar bombs and bullets and as war progressed they also faced aerial attack some sectors of front saw little activity throughout war making life comparatively easy other sectors were in a perpetual state of violent activity however quiet sectors still amassed daily casualties through snipers artillery fire and disease harsh conditions where trenches were often wet and muddy and constant company of lice and rats which fed on unburied bodies often carried disease many troops suffered from trench foot trench fever and trench nephritis they could also contract frostbite in winter months and heat exhaustion in summer men were frequently wet and extremely muddy or dry and exceedingly dusty food could not usually be cooked in front line trenches as any smoke would draw enemy fire hot food had to be carried along communication trenches in clumsy sometimes arriving late or not at all daily routine thumb left a sentry of cheshire regiment in 1916 note four men sleeping in trench daily routine of life in trenches began with morning stand to an hour before dawn everyone was roused and ordered to man their positions to guard against a dawn raid by germans with stand to over it was time for men to have breakfast and perform ablutions once complete ncos would assign daily chores before men attended to cleaning of rifles and equipment filling sandbags repairing trenches or digging latrines once daily tasks had been completed men who were off duty would find a place to sleep due to constant bombardments and sheer effort of trying to stay alive sleep deprivation was common soldiers also had to take it in turns to be on sentry duty watching for enemy movements each side s front line was constantly under observation by snipers and lookouts during daylight movement was therefore restricted until after dusk stand to and night had fallen under cover of darkness troops attended to vital maintenance and resupply with rations and water being brought to front line fresh units swapped places with troops moving to rear for rest and recuperation trench raiding was also carried out and construction parties formed to repair trenches and fortifications while wiring parties were sent out to repair or renew barbed wire in no man s land an hour before dawn everyone would stand to once more moving into front line a set procedure was used by a division that was moving into front line once they had been informed that they were moving forward brigadiers and battalion commanders would be taken to forward areas to reconnoitre sections of front that were to be occupied by their troops meanwhile battalion transport officers would be taken to headquarters of division that they were relieving to observe methods used for drawing rations and ammunition and manner in which they were supplied to troops at front detachments from divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to artillery batteries of division they were relieving five days later infantry battalions that were destined for front line sent forward their specialists from lewis gun teams and grenade officer machine gun officer four company commanders and some of signallers to take over trench stores and settle into trench routine before battalions moved in overnight battalions would move into line and artillery would take over guns that were already in position leaving theirs behind to be taken over by batteries that had been relieved discipline legal authority army was ultimately under political authority since glorious revolution of 1688 crown has not been permitted a standing army in united kingdom it derives its existence from army act passed by parliament each year every five years since late 1950s house of commons took these responsibilities seriously a letter from haig clarifying position on shell shock had to be read out in house of commons on 14 march 1918 bond cave 2009 p 2002 p 216 most disciplinary regulations in first world war derived from 1881 army act although some offences were more severely dealt with on active service e g in principle looting or wilful disobedience carried death penalty corrigan 2002 p 219 lesser offences lesser offences were dealt with by commanding officers corrigan 2002 p 222 for petty offences a company commander could have men fined or confined to barracks for fatigue 2004 p 557 a battalion commanding officer could give detention order up to 28 days field punishment or demote corporals to ranks officers and senior ncos were dealt with by court martial other than for very trivial offences holmes 2004 p 558 enlisted men could also lose leave or seniority corrigan 2002 p 217 9 field punishment fp had replaced flogging abolished at home in 1868 and on active service in 1881 although still used in military prisons until 1907 fp no 1 in which man was shackled to fixed object e g a large wheel was awarded to 60 210 cases equivalent to one man in 50 although in practice there were many repeat offenders fp no 1 could be very unpleasant depending on weather was abhorred by some as barbaric and in some units was ritualised e g by locking a man in a shed and throwing handcuffs in with him there were also cases of australian troops releasing british troops whom they found tied up although in other units it was regarded as a necessary sanction for serious offences holmes 2004 p 560 fp no 2 meant that a man was shackled but not fixed in place corrigan 2002 p 225 striking an inferior was an offence but it was not uncommon in some units for officers to turn a blind eye to ncos keeping discipline by violence or even to do so themselves holmes 2004 p 555 courts martial men who committed serious offences were tried by field general court martial sometimes resulting in execution despite assertions that these were kangaroo courts e g in book shot at dawn which says that men did not receive even rudiments of a just hearing release of records in 1990 4 showed this to be untrue bond cave 2009 p 217 they in fact had strict rules of procedure and a duty to uncover facts holmes 2004 p 563 unlike a general court martial in peacetime there was no legally qualified judge advocate to advise court but from start of 1916 a court martial officer usually an officer with legal experience in civilian life was often present to do so holmes 2004 p 561 accused was entitled to object to composition of panel e g if one of officers was connected with case or enjoyed a poor relationship with accused and to present his case defended by an officer a prisoner s friend if he chose although prisoners friends became more common as war went on bond cave 2009 p 201 officer who convened a court martial could not sit on it and most junior officer voted first to lessen chance of his deferring to a superior s opinion holmes 2004 p 561 however courts were explicitly intended to be speedy and were sometimes encouraged by higher authority to make an example of certain offences and in practice leniency of court and ability of accused to defend himself varied widely some pleaded guilty or chose not to present a defence or call witnesses and in most cases offence was so blatant that little defence could be put forward bond cave 2009 p 203 216 eighty nine per cent of courts martial returned a guilty verdict corrigan 2002 p 225 vast majority of cases being for offences such as absence without leave most common offence drunkenness and insubordination terms of imprisonment were often suspended to discourage soldiers from committing an offence to escape front lines but also to give a convicted man a chance to earn a reprieve for good conduct holmes 2004 p 565 of 252 officers tried 76 per cent were found guilty most common offence 52 per cent of cases being drunkenness although three officers were executed an officer was most likely to receive a severe reprimand 60 per cent of cases a severe blow to his career or be cashiered 30 per cent of cases stripped of his commission which brought total social disgrace and barred him from any employment under crown even working for local council but a cashiered officer could still be conscripted as a private to a different unit corrigan 2002 p 226 executions a death sentence had to be passed unanimously and confirmed in writing by various officers as verdict passed up chain of command a man s battalion and brigade commander tended to comment on his own record but senior generals tended to be more concerned with type of offence and state of discipline in that unit bond cave 2009 p 202 judge advocate general at ghq also checked records for irregularities before final confirmation or otherwise by commander in chief of relevant theatre corrigan 2002 p 232 of 3 080 men sentenced to death corrigan 2002 p 229 346 men were actually executed vast majority of these 266 for desertion next largest reasons for execution being murder 37 these men would probably have been hanged under civilian law at time and cowardice 18 corrigan 2002 p 230 convictions for mutiny were rare only one man was shot for etaples disturbances in 1917 of men shot 91 were already under a previous suspended sentence and nine under two sentences of 91 40 were already under a suspended death sentence 38 of them for desertion and one man had already been sentenced to death twice for desertion bond cave 2009 p 199 it was felt at time that precisely because most soldiers in combat were afraid an example needed to be made of men who deserted corrigan 2002 p 236 front line soldiers also sometimes felt that those who left their mates in lurch by deserting deserved to be shot holmes 2004 p 559 one historian writes that there is virtually no evidence that soldiers thought death penalty unjust bond cave 2009 p 216 although another writes that some soldiers deplored death penalty while most thought it justified desertion normally meant an absence of 21 days or other evidence to indicate intent of not returning e g wearing civilian clothes or failing to report for a key deployment those executed were normally not boys average age was in mid twenties and 40 percent had been in serious trouble before thirty percent were regulars or reservists 40 percent were kitchener volunteers 19 percent were irish canadian or new zealand volunteers but only nine percent were conscripts suggesting indulgence to conscripts many of them under 21 who made up bulk of army by late in war only executed men s records survive so it is hard to comment on reasons why men were reprieved bond cave 2009 p 196 but it has been suggested that policy of commuting 90 percent of death sentences may well have been deliberate mercy in application of military law designed for a small regular army recruited from rougher elements of society bond cave 2009 p 200 204 only 7 361 of 38 630 desertions were in field most were away from front line 14 of executed deserters were arrested in united kingdom and many deserters had never served in front line at all bond cave 2009 p cave 2009 p 199 201 p206 in latter part of war executed men s families were usually told white lies by authorities their families received pensions and men were buried in same graves as other dead soldiers bond cave 2009 p 214 death for desertion was abolished in 1930 over objections in house of lords from lords allenby and plumer two of most distinguished british commanders of world war one calls for its restoration in world war two were vetoed on political grounds bond cave 2009 p 212 by contrast of 393 men sentenced to death for falling asleep on sentry duty in all theatres in world war i only two were executed sentries were usually posted in pairs to keep one another awake these two who served in mesopotamia were made an example of because they were found sitting asleep together suggesting that they had colluded australians made up seven percent of british expeditionary force but 25 percent of deserters while an australian was nine times more likely to be imprisoned than a british soldier haig asked for permission to shoot australians but their government refused bond cave 2009 p 210 british discipline of first world war was not especially severe compared to most other armies of time e g russians and italians french admitted to only 133 executions and germans 48 but these figures may not be reliable as both armies had problems with discipline bond cave 2009 p 209 10 shell shock and pardons at time posttraumatic stress disorder known as shell shock because it was initially wrongly thought to be caused by concussion damage to membranes of brain was beginning to be recognised and was in principle admissible in defence it was classified as a war injury although there were concerns that soldiers accused of offences tried falsely to claim shell shock as a defence corrigan 2002 p 233 5 one historian writes that in no case was a soldier whom medical staff certified as suffering from shell shock actually executed that there appear to have been very few cases where men who alleged shell shock but whose claim was denied were actually executed and that suggestions of modern campaigners that most of executed men suffered from shell shock are palpably untrue corrigan 2002 p 235 however another historian has pointed out that there was a great deal of chance in whether a soldier s claim of shell shock would be taken seriously and gives examples of soldiers being given cursory medical examinations or none specific references to shell shock are uncommon and records usually refer to dizziness queer turns bad nerves etc such trauma was still poorly understood at that time there were enquiries in 1919 1922 1925 and 1938 which examined documents now lost and witnesses now dead bond cave 2009 p 218 books for sake of example 1983 by babington and shot at dawn 1989 by sykes were openly intended to start a campaign for pardons this campaign was rejected in february 1993 because there was no evidence of procedural error i e they had been correctly convicted according to law at time and it was felt not right to impose modern values on to past bond cave 2009 p 2004 p 569 case was rejected again in 1998 after a detailed two year review which found no white cases very many black cases and a handful of grey cases in which medical evidence was ignored or not called bond cave 2009 p 198 204 decisions were reversed by government in 2006 and all men given pardons and recognised as victims of world war i however their sentences were not overturned as it was impossible after this length of time to re examine evidence in every case other discipline it has been pointed out that we have only anecdotal accounts but no figures for men who were shot on spot by officers and ncos for cowardice in face of enemy holmes 2004 p 570 there were over 13 000 royal military police redcaps they were unpopular at a time when police were often unpopular with young men from big cities besides policing a large part of their job was maintaining discipline on march and keeping roads running smoothly and collecting stragglers from a battle during march 1918 retreat 25 000 stragglers were rounded up and sent back to fighting units royal military police also fought on occasion if headquarters areas were threatened by an enemy advance although soldiers sometimes told lurid tales of men who refused to fight being shot by military police no reliable first hand accounts exist of this happening holmes 2004 p 570 1 there were occasional examples of men making unwanted homosexual advances homosexuality being then criminal under both military and civil law to escape front lines but prosecutions for this crime were rare and there is also evidence of men turning a blind eye to homosexual relationships holmes 2004 p 599 positive motivation men were also motivated by positive means new medals were instituted military cross was created in december 1914 for warrant officers and officers up to captain military medal for enlisted men in march 1916 although to regret of some men it did not carry a cash bounty like distinguished conduct medal order of british empire of which mbe is one grade was instituted in 1917 by 1918 medals for bravery were often awarded within a week to ensure that man lived long enough to receive it holmes 2004 p 583 4 race meetings concert parties including drag acts good drag queens were in great demand trips to seaside and football matches were organised to keep men entertained holmes 2004 p
