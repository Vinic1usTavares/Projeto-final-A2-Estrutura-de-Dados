mount edziza volcanic complex is a large and potentially active north south trending complex volcano in stikine country northwestern british columbia canada located southeast of small community of telegraph creek it occupies southeastern portion of tahltan highland an upland area of plateau and lower mountain ranges lying east of boundary ranges and south of river which is east fork of taku river as a volcanic complex it consists of many types of volcanoes including shield volcanoes calderas lava domes stratovolcanoes and cinder cones most of mount edziza volcanic complex is encompassed within a large provincial park called mount edziza provincial park named after mount edziza this park was established in 1972 to preserve volcanic and cultural treasures unique to northern british columbia area mount edziza volcanic complex is remote and without roads accessible only along trails easiest access is from highway 37 and a spur road from dease lake to telegraph creek from lake on highway 37 a poorly maintained trail extends west for into heart of complex from telegraph creek another trail extends east for to north slope of mount edziza geology origins thumb right northern cordilleran volcanic province rift mount edziza volcanic complex began forming about 7 5 million years ago and has grown steadily since then like other volcanoes in northwestern british columbia mount edziza volcanic complex has its origins in continental rifting a long divergent plate boundary where lithosphere is being pulled apart here continental crust of north american plate is being stretched at a rate of about per year this incipient rifting has formed as a result of pacific plate sliding northward along queen charlotte fault on its way to aleutian trench which extends along southern coastline of alaska and adjacent waters of northeastern siberia off coast of kamchatka peninsula as continental crust stretches near surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to rift known as faults hot basaltic magma rises along these fractures to create passive lava eruptions known as effusive eruptions rift zone has existed for at least 20 million years and has created a line of volcanoes called northern cordilleran volcanic province also called stikine volcanic belt stretching from alaska yukon border to near prince rupert british columbia several presently dormant volcanoes in province are potentially active three of them having erupted in last few hundred years two witnessed by first nations and placer miners during 18th and 19th centuries tseax cone which last erupted in 18th century is southernmost historically active volcano in province while prindle volcano in easternmost central alaska which erupted during pleistocene period is generally considered northernmost structure thumb right satellite image of mount edziza mount edziza volcanic complex is canada s second largest volcano of young volcanic activity with an area of exceeded only by level mountain north of edziza which has an area of four central volcanoes known as armadillo peak spectrum range ice peak and mount edziza lie along northerly trending axis of an oval composite shield volcano composite shield volcano consists of overlapping shields two of which are clearly noticeable on maps composite shield volcano forms a broad lava plateau long and wide mainly made of basaltic lava flows it is dotted with cinder cones and surrounded by steep ridges called escarpments which expose layers of black columnar basaltic lava flows with distal rock fragments and pyroclastic deposits more light coloured magmas of mainly trachyte and comendite with very little aluminum are mainly confined to four central volcanoes and associated lava dome lava plateau is flanked by river to north mess creek and larger stikine river to west and iskut river to east elevations of lava plateau are with volcanic mountains rising above sea level three sections of lava plateau have official names these are arctic lake big raven and plateaus history of mount edziza volcanic complex includes at least two periods of regional glaciation when deep ice sheets covered land and several lesser advances of mountain glaciers stratovolcano composition steep sided symmetrical stratovolcanoes in region were built by repeated eruptions of thick slow moving lava that have commonly flowed only a few kilometres from vent explosive eruptions are often associated with these volcanoes depositing alternating layers of volcanic ash cinders blocks and globes of molten rock called volcanic bombs or lava bombs which are added to its slopes to create stratovolcano edziza s stratovolcanoes contain a fine grained silica rich volcanic rock called trachyte they have not erupted for thousands of years allowing erosion to destroy original cone creating craggy ridges and rock outcrops of more resistant materials caldera composition circular calderas in mount edziza volcanic complex were formed as a result of emptying magma chamber beneath a volcano if enough magma is erupted emptied chamber will not be able to support weight of volcanic edifice above it a roughly circular fracture a ring fault develops around edge of chamber these ring fractures serve as feeders for fault intrusions that are also known as ring dikes secondary volcanic vents form above ring fracture as magma chamber empties centre of volcano within ring fracture begins to collapse collapse may occur as result of a single cataclysmic eruption or it may occur in stages as result of a series of eruptions these caldera collapses are relatively small compared to most other caldera collapses largest caldera at mount edziza volcanic complex is about in diameter while most calderas are at least in diameter volcanic eruptions accompanying these collapses produced trachyte and a white rhyolite called comendite thumb left map of mount edziza volcanic complex lava dome composition edziza s rounded steep sided lava domes were built by eruptions of very thick light coloured magma including trachyte such magmas are typically too thick to move far from vent it extrudes from causing it to solidify quickly and build on previous volcanic creating a characteristic dome like shape thickness of magma is attributed to high levels of silica a naturally occurring silicon dioxide found in various crystalline and amorphous forms edziza s domes reach heights of several hundred metres and grew slowly and steadily for months to years sides of these structures are composed of unstable rock debris due to possibility of building of gas pressure dome can experience more explosive eruptions over time when part of a lava dome collapses while it still contains molten rock and gases it can produce a pyroclastic flow a super heated mix of gas ash and pumice characteristics of lava dome eruptions include shallow long period and hybrid seismic activity which is attributed to excess fluid pressures in contributing vent chamber other characteristics of lava domes include their spherical dome shape cycles of dome growth over long periods and sudden onsets of violent explosive activity average rate of dome growth may be used as a rough indicator of magma supply but it shows no systematic relationship to timing or characteristic of lava dome explosions cinder cone composition steep conical cinder cones of edziza were formed by lava fountain eruptions emitting particles and blobs of congealed lava from a single vent as gas charged lava is blown violently into air it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinder around vent to form a circular or oval cone edziza s cinder cones have bowl shaped craters at their summits and rise more than a hundred metres above their surroundings cinder cones are widespread in british columbia as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of world eve cone a black cinder cone of mount edziza volcanic complex is one of most famous symmetrical and best preserved cinder cones in canada reaching a height of and a topographic prominence of shield volcano composition edziza s shield volcanoes are built almost entirely of fluid lava flows they formed as a result of lava flowing out in all directions from central summit vents and from groups of vents building a broad gently sloping cone of flat shape they are built up slowly by accretion of thousands of lava flows of highly fluid basaltic lava which spread widely over great distances and then cool as thin gently dipping sheets in some shield volcano eruptions basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents flooding surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava flow forming edziza s broad lava plateau lava plateaus similar to edziza s can be found elsewhere in north america including snake river plain in idaho and columbia river basalt group in southeastern washington and eastern oregon united states they can also be found in iceland subglacial mound composition subglacial mounds of mount edziza volcanic complex are an unusual type of subglacial volcano formed when subglacial eruptions began melting overlying glacial ice at a time when this region was covered by glacial ice during pleistocene and early holocene periods these subglacial eruptions were not hot enough to melt a vertical pipe right through overlying glacial ice instead forming mounds of hydrated volcanic rock made up of volcanic fragments called hyaloclastite and lava that solidified into pillow shaped masses called pillow lava deep beneath glacial ice field once glaciers had retreated subglacial volcanoes would be revealed with a unique shape as a result of their confinement within glacial ice eruptive history thumb right armadillo peak caldera lava domes calderas stratovolcanoes subglacial mounds and cinder cones forming volcanic complex were constructed in five phases each of which began with effusion of dark olivine basalt which formed flat lying shield volcanoes and concluded with eruption of light coloured magma this cyclical behavior is attributed to episodic rise of basic mantle derived alkali basalt both to surface and partly into crustal reservoirs where light coloured magmas with very little aluminum were created by prolonged crystal fractionation silica rich trachyte and comendite lavas are similar to those associated with most violent eruptions on earth armadillo peak eruptive period first phase of activity resulted in creation of armadillo peak seven million years ago today represented by an eroded remnant of a small caldera flanked by steep sided light coloured secondary lava domes including peak peak igc centre and volcano and a thick pile of interlayered light coloured lava flows pyroclastic flows air fall pumice and deposits it is most central of four central volcanoes and its summit is capped by of fine grained silica rich trachyte lava flows which were ponded inside caldera to produce a lava lake six million years ago during its final stage of activity spectrum range eruptive period thumb left spectrum range ice and red volcanic rock from heavy mineralization second phase of activity began three million years ago emplacing rhyolitic magma thick and long during a single event of activity a broad circular lava dome was eventually created called spectrum range this is southernmost of four central volcanoes and is over wide and up to thick on southwestern flank of armadillo peak and north of arctic lake plateau named for its extensive colourful alteration it overlies a basal shield volcano and contains deeply carved circular valleys displaying portions of massive silica rich comendite and trachyte lava flows which comprise lava dome deeply carved circular valleys also display bounding faults of a buried caldera approximately across more than of rhyolite and trachyte was erupted during spectrum range dome eruptive period with its activity ending 2 500 000 years ago ice peak eruptive period thumb right glaciers and eastern flank of ice peak ice peak high which overlaps northern flank of armadillo peak began to form during edziza s third phase of activity starting 1 600 000 years ago when regional cordilleran ice sheet began retreating it is a stratovolcano that was constructed when large areas of edziza lava plateau were free from glacial ice and now enclosed by glacial deposits however additional parts of mount edziza volcanic complex were likely still covered by glacial ice volcanic activity from ice peak during this period produced both basic and intermediate to light coloured lava flows and pyroclastic rocks which mixed with meltwater to produce debris flows as ice peak began to form basic lava spread to flanks of cone where it formed meltwater lakes and combines with and forms part of adjacent shield volcano as lava continued to flow into these meltwater lakes pillow lava and solidified rubble was created many of lava flows with compositions of trachyte and basalt were however erupted just below surface of soil continuous volcanic activity eventually made ice peak reach an elevation of when three viscous intermediate and light coloured lava flows built up around secondary lava domes parallel with its western side during its final stage of activity 1 500 000 years ago and develops nearly all of steep higher flanks of volcano these viscous light coloured lava flows are displayed at two cliffs with broad faces known as ornostay bluff and koosick bluff and contain basic rock made of solidified rubble overlain by large fractured lava with massive poorly established pillars two cinder cones on ice peak s southern flank called camp hill and cache hill and possibly first erupted when glacial ice was still existing on edziza lava plateau as lava flowed into glacial ice above a vent pools of meltwater were created continuous lava eruptions that flowed into meltwater pools were cooled and fractured this fragmental material was interrupted by explosions of steam water ash rock and volcanic bombs called phreatic eruptions camp hill was eventually developed and over time it grew above water level inside meltwater lake later eruptions produced a pyroclastic cone on top of original fragmental cone cache hill erupted when nearly all glacial ice had retreated first lava flows from cache hill flowed through and dammed a river valley which eventually ponded to produce a small lake subsequent lava flows traveled into lake to produce pillow lava and solidified rubble during long period of ice peak activity high altitude glaciers developed and melted cutting valleys into volcano current high summit of ice peak is a remnant of western rim of a small summit caldera which has been nearly destroyed by erosion from high altitude glaciation near end of ice peak activity 1 500 000 years ago this high altitude glacial ice combined with regional ice forming part of cordilleran ice sheet it is likely that only tallest mountains might have been visible over cordilleran ice sheet which was at least thick a small volume of intermediate lava was erupted from ice peak compared to other central volcanoes mount edziza eruptive period thumb left northwestern flank of mount edziza proper fourth phase of activity began one million years ago when cordilleran ice sheet retreated from upper flanks of adjacent lava plateau creating mount edziza proper which is most northerly of four central volcanoes it is a steep sided stratovolcano and largest and highest of peaks that form volcanic complex with an elevation of overlapping northern flank of ice peak stratovolcano is made up of a fine grained volcanic rock called trachyte and is associated with several lava domes which were formed by trachyte lava flows and explosive eruptions its smooth northern and western flanks only slightly channeled by erosion curve up to a circular summit ridge which surrounds a central ice filled caldera in diameter many glaciers cover mount edziza proper including tencho glacier on its southern flank active cirques on eastern flank have breached caldera rim exposing remnants of numerous lava lakes which ponded in caldera 900 000 years ago and rest on hydrothermally altered breccia of main conduit piles of pillow lava and hyaloclastite formed by subglacial eruptions are found on flanks of mount edziza and nearby ice peak as well as on surface of surrounding shield volcano pillow ridge on edziza s northwest flank was formed when basaltic lava erupted beneath regional cordilleran ice sheet when it was close to its greatest thickness central volcano flank eruptive period thumb right a large edziza lava flow and eve and sidas cones fifth and final phase of eruptive activity occurred from secondary volcanic vents along flanks of four central volcanoes starting 10 000 years ago this phase of activity began at a time when remnants of glacial ice were still present and continued after glacial period initial flank eruptions quenched by glacial meltwater formed hyaloclastite tuff rings whereas later activity created 30 small cinder cones primarily of basaltic composition including mess lake cone kana cone cinder cliff icefall cone ridge cone williams cone walkout creek cone moraine cone sidas cone sleet cone storm cone triplex cone twin cone cache hill camp hill cocoa crater coffee crater nahta cone tennena cone saucer and well preserved eve cone these cinder cones were formed no earlier than year 700 based on age of burnt plant stems still rooted in former soil under of loose basaltic fragments these cinder cones were built on basaltic fragments and blocky lava fields surrounding cones snowshoe lava field on southern end of big raven plateau is one of areas of young lava flows in region while desolation lava field on northern end of big raven plateau is largest area of young lava flows covering an area of 150 km2 longest lava flow is this volcanic activity was followed by at least two younger but still undated eruptions including an undated air fall pumice deposit undated air fall pumice deposit exists across southwestern part of big raven plateau called sheep track pumice or sheep track member pumice is a light volcanic rock full of air spaces and commonly pale in colour ranging from white cream blue or grey but can be green or black sheep track pumice is mysterious because vent of its origin is unknown even though it is estimated from its state of preservation to be younger than 500 years this pumice deposit emphasizes one of significant volcanic hazards linked to mount edziza volcanic complex likelihood of a violent explosive eruption volcano that produced pumice might be covered by glacial ice collaborators at university of british columbia have started work on samples collected from deposits of sheep track pumice current activity thumb left lava flows coming out of mount edziza mount edziza volcanic complex is one of eleven canadian volcanoes associated with recent seismic activity others are castle rock mount garibaldi mount cayley hoodoo mountain volcano crow lagoon silverthrone caldera mount meager massif wells gray clearwater volcanic field and cone seismic data suggests that these volcanoes still contain live magma plumbing systems indicating possible future eruptive activity although available data does not allow a clear conclusion these observations are further indications that some of canada s volcanoes are potentially active and that their associated hazards may be significant seismic activity correlates both with some of canada s most youthful volcanoes and with long lived volcanic centres with a history of significant explosive behavior such as mount edziza volcanic complex most recent volcanic activity at mount edziza volcanic complex have been hot springs several of which are found on volcano s western flank including elwyn springs or springs 46 degc or 115 degf and inactive springs near mess lake springs are near youngest lava fields of mount edziza volcanic complex and are most likely associated with most recent eruptive activity these hot springs were highly important to adjacent tahltan people hot springs are closely associated with fumaroles which are vents in an active volcanic area releasing steam and hot gases such as sulfur dioxide in general water is rotating groundwater that comes into contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to surface formation of springs depends both on rocks water has passed through and profusion of volcanic discharges mixed with groundwater iron oxide iron sulfides and other substances usually colour pools of boiling mud brilliant yellow red brown or green hot springs comprising significantly softened silica may deposit it to form siliceous sinter whereas those comprising softened calcium carbonate deposit spongy looking calcareous rock called tufa overflow of springs can build masses spires or stepped terraces of calcareous sinter or tufa human history indigenous people as early as 10 000 years ago tahltan first nations people who now live in dease lake telegraph creek and iskut used obsidian from mount edziza volcanic complex to make tools and weapons for trading material most of obsidian occurs at relatively high elevations at about this is main source of obsidian found in northwestern british columbia which was traded as far away as alaska and northern alberta obsidian is a type of naturally occurring glass that is highly valued for its cutting qualities and is produced by rapid cooling of lava like all glass and some other types of naturally occurring rocks obsidian breaks with a characteristic fracture creating razor sharp edges a knife made of edziza obsidian possibly 2 000 years old has been recovered in stikine river area two exposed columnar basalt formations exist within volcanic complex tahltan eagle at meeting of tahltan and stikine rivers and pipe organ mountain tahltan eagle has significant spiritual and cultural importance to tahltan people while correct name and cultural significance of pipe organ mountain to tahltan people is unknown geologic studies thumb right lava fields of mount edziza volcanic complex this area of long lived volcanic activity has been studied and mapped in detail for many years by first detail studying and mapping of mount edziza volcanic complex was accomplished in early 1970s by a geological survey of canada society led by canadian scientist jack souther edziza was a significant study area by souther while mapping souther looked at a mineral tenure map of stikine country and was surprised to see that many of small cinder cones in area had been maintained by mineral tenures upon investigation staking had been completed for british columbia railway then under construction to dease lake staking was designed to provide a ready source of weight for railway bed geological survey of canada agreed to support a series of canada wide lectures by jack souther to establish mount edziza provincial park to protect mount edziza volcanic complex coincidentally jack souther had an opportunity to examine red dog spectrum property gold veins and he accomplished several section studies of specimens it was not souther s intention to include in park any of mineralization within near surface older rocks however british columbia ministry of parks established mount edziza recreation area covering on july 27 1972 as park proclamation providing a wide buffer zone around park area on march 21 1989 all but of recreation area covering spectrum gold property on its margin was surreptitiously merged with mount edziza provincial park almost doubling its size to thumb left cinder cones and sheep track pumice souther s studies in 1992 highlighted importance and size of region and proposed that numerous subglacial eruptions emplaced lava in a sub ice or ice contact environment more recent studies have worked on souther s contributions with more detailed studies which are funded by colleges and universities since colleges and universities started studying mount edziza volcanic complex it has been an extremely important volcano for subglacial volcanism because its ice contact lavas record evidence of ice existence and thickness in an area for which there is very little data on ice conditions before illinoian stage of glaciation which preceded last glacial or wisconsin period several areas of possible basaltic and trachytic ice contact products were studied in detail on western flank of mount edziza volcanic complex in order to approve their ice contact nature and to eventually better constrain former ice existence and thickness its lava plateau has also been an important cultural resource in 2006 jeff hungerford a student of university of pittsburgh in carlisle pennsylvania united states focused on fieldwork on region surrounding edziza s tennena cone located immediately west of ice peak which formed during early holocene period when this area had remnants of glacial ice from last ice age hungerford s studies in 2006 focused on subglacial volcanism sampling pillow lavas to be used for degassing studies aimed at determining ice thicknesses during a subglacial eruption and describing coeval glaciogenic sediments immediately underlying pillow lavas at distal end of lava flows hungerford also worked on describing glaciogenic sediments immediately underlying lava flows from ice peak adjacent to tennena cone which may preserve a record of a one million year old ice sheet thumb right satellite image of mount edziza volcanic complex kristen lamoreaux another student of university of pittsburgh focused on emplacement of trachyte lava flows and domes in 2006 lamoreaux analyzed jointing patterns at ornostay bluff a viscous series of trachyte lava flows on western lava plateau of mount edziza volcanic complex lamoreaux also examined trachytic lava flows from koosick bluff and triangle dome a trachytic lava dome which last erupted during pleistocene period other studies by lamoreaux determined criteria for understanding how lava flow thickness may or may not be an indication that progress of a lava flow was impeded by an ice barrier resulting in an unusually thick lava flow endress a student of dickinson college in carlisle pennsylvania united states focused on a section of glaciogenic sediments immediately beneath same ice peak trachyte lava flow sampled and described by jeff hungerford during his 2006 studies endress attempted to determine if sediments were deposited immediately before lava flow was emplaced or if they are likely to be much older endress has quantified mineralogy of clasts and sand sized particles from samples in sediment and has determined that mineralogy of several of trachytic clasts is very similar to that in overlying lava flow including minerals clinopyroxene magnetite alkali feldspar and endress has also found small lenses of pristine basaltic glass which could have derived from pillow ridge subglacial mound near mount edziza alexander s lloyd a student of dickinson college focused on cooling rates of pillow lavas lloyd studied in detail variation in crystal sizes from edge pristine pillow lava which could have derived from nearby pillow ridge which last erupted during pleistocene period courtney haynes another student of dickinson college focused on mathematics of pillow lavas in 2007 monitoring currently mount edziza volcanic complex is not monitored closely enough by geological survey of canada to ascertain how active volcano s magma system is existing network of seismographs has been established to monitor tectonic earthquakes and is too far away to provide a good indication of what is happening beneath volcanic complex network may sense an increase in activity if volcano becomes very restless but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption it might detect activity only once volcano has started erupting a possible way to detect an eruption is studying edziza s geological history since every volcano has its own pattern of behavior in terms of its eruption style magnitude and frequency so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions while there is a likelihood of canada being critically affected by local or close by volcanic eruptions argues that some kind of improvement program is required benefit cost thoughts are critical to dealing with natural hazards however a benefit cost examination needs correct data about hazard types magnitudes and occurrences these do not exist for volcanoes in british columbia or elsewhere in canada in detail required thumb left mount edziza coffee crater and tencho glacier other volcanic techniques such as hazard mapping displays a volcano s eruptive history in detail and speculates an understanding of hazardous activity that could possibly be expected in future a large volcanic hazard program has never existed within geological survey of canada information has been collected in a lengthy separate way from support of several employees such as volcanologists and other geologic scientists current knowledge is best established at mount meager massif in garibaldi volcanic belt of southwestern british columbia and is likely to rise considerably with a temporary mapping and monitoring project knowledge at mount edziza volcanic complex and other volcanoes in northern cordilleran volcanic province is not as established but certain contributions are being done at least mount cayley another volcano in garibaldi volcanic belt an intensive program classifying infrastructural exposure near all young canadian volcanoes and quick hazard assessments at each individual volcanic edifice associated with recent seismic activity would be in advance and would produce a quick and productive determination of priority areas for further efforts thumb right south side of cocoa crater existing network of seismographs to monitor tectonic earthquakes has existed since 1975 although it remained small in population until 1985 apart from a few short term seismic monitoring experiments by geological survey of canada no volcano monitoring has been accomplished at mount edziza volcanic complex or at other volcanoes in canada at a level approaching that in other established countries with historically active volcanoes active or restless volcanoes are usually monitored using at least three seismographs all within approximately and frequently within for better sensitivity of detection and reduced location errors particularly for earthquake depth such monitoring detects risk of an eruption offering a forecasting capability which is important to mitigating volcanic risk currently mount edziza volcanic complex does not have a seismograph closer than with increasing distance and declining numbers of seismographs used to indicate seismic activity prediction capability is reduced because earthquake location accuracy and depth decreases and network becomes less accurate at carefully monitored volcanoes both located and noticed events are recorded and surveyed immediately to improve understanding of a future eruption in countries like canada it is possible that small precursor earthquake swarms might go undetected particularly if no events were observed more significant events in larger swarms would be detected but only a minor subdivision of swarm events would be complex to clarify them with confidence as volcanic in nature
