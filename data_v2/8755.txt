sea mink neovison macrodon is a recently extinct species of mink that lived on eastern coast of north america in family mustelidae largest family in order carnivora it was most closely related to american mink neovison vison with debate about whether or not sea mink should be considered a subspecies of american mink making it neovison vison macrodon or a species of its own main justification for a separate species designation is size difference between two minks but other distinctions have been made such as its redder fur only known remains are fragments unearthed in native american shell middens its actual size is speculative based largely on tooth remains sea mink was first described in 1903 after its extinction information regarding its external appearance and habits stem from speculation and from accounts made by fur traders and native americans it may have exhibited behavior similar to american mink in that it probably maintained home ranges was polygynandrous and had a similar diet though more seaward oriented it was probably found on new england coast and maritime provinces though its range may have stretched further south during last glacial period conversely its range may have been restricted solely to new england coast specifically gulf of maine or just to nearby islands largest of minks sea mink was more desirable to fur traders and became extinct in late 19th or early 20th century taxonomy and etymology thumb left closely related american mink neovison vison alt a wet american mink with pale brown fur dark brown eyes long fingers and a skinny tail its head is turned to right and it is standing on a rock next to water sea mink was first described as lutreola macrodon distinct from american mink by daniel webster prentiss a medical doctor and ornithologist in 1903 after it became extinct prentiss based his description on skull fragments recovered from native american shell middens in new england most sea mink remains nearly all of them skull fragments have come from shell middens but a complete specimen has never been found debate has occurred regarding whether sea mink was its own species or a subspecies of american mink those who argue that sea mink was a subspecies often refer to it as neovison vison macrodon a study in 1911 by frederic brewster loomis an american paleontologist concluded that differences between american mink and sea mink were too minute to justify latter s classification as a separate species and he named it lutreola vison antiquus a study conducted in 2000 by mead et al refuted loomis by claiming that size range for largest sea mink specimen was beyond that of american mink thereby making it a separate species but a 2001 study by graham concluded that this size difference was insufficient evidence to classify sea mink as its own species and that it should be considered a subspecies graham supposed that size difference was caused by environmental factors furthermore graham reported that mead assumed smaller mink specimens to be american mink and larger mink specimens outside range of american mink to be sea minks this may have been a case of sexual dimorphism wherein all specimens were sea minks larger being males and smaller being females a 2007 study compared dental makeup of sea mink to american mink and concluded that they were distinct enough to be considered separate species taxonomy of minks was revised in 2000 resulting in formation of a new genus neovison which includes only sea mink and american mink formerly both minks were classified in genus mustela species name macrodon translates to large teeth according to richard manville a naturalist who maintains that sea mink is not its own species its closest relative is common mink n v mink which also inhabits new england area fur traders who hunted it gave sea mink various names including water marten red otter and fisher cat possibly first description of this species was made by sir humphrey gilbert in late 1500s as a fish like a greyhound which was a reference to its affinity for sea and its body shape and gait which were apparently similar to that of a greyhound it is possible that fisher pekania pennanti got its name from being mistakenly identified as sea mink which was also known as fisher by fur traders indians referred to it as which means wet thing it was named sea mink because it was always found near coast by fur traders and subsequently american mink was often referred to as wood mink range sea mink was a marine mammal that lived around rocky coasts of new england and southernmost maritime provinces until hunted to extinction in late 19th century most sea mink remains are unearthed on coast of maine though it is speculated that they at one point inhabited connecticut and rhode island they were commonly trapped along coast of bay of fundy in gulf of maine and it is said that they formerly existed on southwestern coast of nova scotia there were reports of unusually large mink furs being collected from nova scotia regularly bones of a specimen unearthed in middleboro massachusetts were dated to be around 4 300 300 years old from salt water sea mink may have reached that area by traveling up rivers or may have been brought there by native americans latter is most likely as no other mink remains have been discovered between casco bay in maine and southeastern massachusetts sea mink bones have been unearthed in canada although these may have been carried there by native americans from gulf of maine rugged shorelines of down east region of maine may have represented a northernmost barrier in their range mead concluded that only american minks inhabited mainland and that sea minks were restricted to islands off coast if this is case then all remains found on mainland were carried there graham challenged that hypothesis stating that it is unlikely that all sea mink specimens originate from one population during last glacial period ending 12 000 years ago sea mink s range may have extended south of gulf of maine it may have even evolved there as maine at that time would have been covered in glaciers although oldest known specimen only dates back to around 5 000 years this could be due to rising sea levels older sea mink remains may be submerged underwater alternately sea mink may have evolved after last glacial period and filled a new ecological niche description thumb dentition from upper jaw of sea mink left and american mink right alt a pen and ink drawing of upper teeth of a sea mink on left and that of an american mink on right teeth of sea mink are slightly but noticeably larger than that of american mink since sea mink has only been described by fragmentary remains its appearance and behaviors are not well documented its relatives as well as descriptions by fur traders and native americans give a general idea of this animal s appearance and its ecological roles accounts from native americans in new england atlantic canadian regions reported that sea mink had a fatter body than american mink sea mink produced a distinctive fishy odor and had fur that was said to be coarser and redder than that of american mink it is thought that naturalist joseph banks encountered this animal in 1776 in strait of belle isle and he described it as being slightly larger than a fox having long legs and a tail that was long and tapered towards end similar to a greyhound sea mink was largest of minks as only fragmentary skeletal remains of sea mink exist most of its external measurements are speculative and rely only on dental measurements in 1929 ernest thompson seton a wildlife artist concluded that probable dimensions for this animal are from head to tail with tail being long a possible mounted sea mink specimen collected in 1894 in connecticut measured from head to tail and tail was in length a 1996 study found this to be either a large american mink or possibly a hybrid specimen was described as having coarse fur that was reddish tan in color though much of it was likely faded from age it was darkest at tail and hind limbs with a white patch between forearms there were also white spots on left forearm and groin region thumb left palatal aspect of skull from type specimen alt a pen and ink drawing of upper portion of mouth inside view of a sea mink left side of drawing i e right side of mouth has teeth drawn in whereas right side of drawing i e left side of its mouth has teeth sockets drawn in front teeth in between canines are all drawn in type specimen was collected by prentiss and frederick true a biologist in 1897 in brooklin maine remains of which consist of a maxilla parts of nasal bone and palate teeth are all present on right side of palate and left side consists of incisors and one premolar other than a chipped canine all teeth are in good condition specimen is apparently larger than alaskan mink as average distance between last incisor to first molar is in alaskan mink whereas that distance is in type specimen nasal bone has an ascension and carnassial teeth make a more acute angle with gums than those of common mink these minks were large and heavily built with a low sagittal crest and short wide postorbital processes projections on frontal bone behind eye sockets in fact most notable characteristic of skull was its size in that it was clearly larger than that of other mink species having a wide rostrum large nostril openings large antorbital fenestrae openings in skull in front of eye socket and large teeth their large size was probably in response to their coastal environment as largest extant subspecies of american mink alaskan mink n v inhabits alexander archipelago in alaska an area with a habitat similar to gulf of maine mead concluding that mink was restricted to nearshore islands suggested that large size was due to insular gigantism since almost all members of subfamily mustelinae exhibit sexual dimorphism male sea minks were probably larger than female sea minks sea mink s wider carnassial teeth and blunter carnassial blades suggest that they crushed hard shells more often than did teeth of american mink behavior thumb sea mink was an intertidal predator of gulf of maine alt a sandy beach at dusk sand on bottom half and water and horizon on top half there s a group of people walking across shoreline and on right side of picture there s a rock formation jutting upwards from sand with evergreen trees on it as marine mammal species often play a large part in their ecosystems it is possible that sea mink was an important intertidal predator it may have been similar in diet to american mink and may have consumed seabirds seabird eggs and hard bodied marine invertebrates though in greater proportions fur traders reported that sea mink dens had two entrances and were made in rocks piled up by waves remains of toad sculpins and ocean pout were most common around their dens and garden banded snails were also reported to have been part of their diet their seafood oriented diet may have increased their size according to fur traders sea mink was nocturnal and resided in caves and rock crevices during day due to overlap of american mink and sea mink ranges it is possible that they hybridized with each other although not a truly marine species being confined to coastal waters sea mink was unusually aquatic compared to other members of being next to otters most aquatic member of taxon like other minks individual sea minks may have maintained home ranges and since males were larger and required more food males would have had larger territorial claims likewise their larger size may have allowed males to target larger prey than females and they may have had to defend females during mating seasons like other weasels sea mink was probably polygynandrous with both sexes mating with multiple individuals exploitation and extinction thumb left a shell midden in maine alt a gully surrounded by low lying leafy plants and trees bottom of gully is filled with shells and it leads to a lake sea mink was pursued by fur traders due to its large size this made it more desirable than other mink species further inland unregulated trade eventually led to its extinction which is thought to have occurred between 1860 and 1920 sea mink was seldom sighted after 1860 last two recorded kills of a sea mink were made in maine in 1880 near maine and campobello island new brunswick in 1894 although 1894 kill is speculated to be of large american minks fur traders made traps to catch sea minks and also pursued them with dogs although they were rarely trapped if a sea mink escaped into a small hole on rocky ledges it was dug out by hunters using shovels and if it was out of reach of hunters it was shot and then retrieved using an iron rod with a screw on far end if it was hiding it was smoked out and suffocated minks nocturnal behavior may have been caused from pressure by fur traders who hunted them in daylight since remains of brain cases found in shell middens are broken and many of bones found exhibit cut marks it is assumed that sea mink was hunted by native americans for food and possibly for exchange and ceremonial purposes one study looking at remains in shell middens in penobscot bay reported that sea mink were intact more so than that of other animals found implying that they were specifically placed there males were more often collected than females references external links arkive org category mammals described in 1903 category extinct
