djedkare isesi known in greek as tancheres was a pharaoh eighth and penultimate ruler of fifth dynasty of egypt in late 25th century to mid 24th century bc during old kingdom djedkare succeeded menkauhor kaiu and was in turn succeeded by unas his relations to both of these pharaohs remain uncertain although it is often conjectured that unas was djedkare s son owing to smooth transition between two djedkare likely enjoyed a reign of more than 40 years which heralded a new period in history of old kingdom breaking with a tradition followed by his predecessors since time of userkaf djedkare did not build a temple to sun god ra possibly reflecting rise of osiris in egyptian pantheon more significantly djedkare effected comprehensive reforms of egyptian state administration first undertaken since inception of system of ranking titles he also reorganised funerary cults of his forebears buried in necropolis of abusir and reformed corresponding priesthood djedkare commissioned expeditions to sinai to procure copper and turquoise to nubia for its gold and diorite and to fabled land of punt for its incense one such expedition had what could be earliest recorded instance of oracular divination undertaken to ensure an expedition s success word nub meaning gold to designate nubia is first recorded during djedkare s reign under his rule egypt also entertained continuing trade relations with levantine coast and made punitive raids in canaan in particular one of earliest depictions of a battle or siege scene was found in tomb of one of djedkare s subjects djedkare was buried in a pyramid in saqqara named nefer djedkare djedkare is perfect which is now ruined owing to theft of stone from its outer casing during antiquity burial chamber still held djedkare s mummy when it was excavated in 1940s examinations of mummy revealed that he died in his fifties following his death djedkare was object of a cult that lasted at least until end of old kingdom he seemed to have been held in particularly high esteem during mid sixth dynasty whose pharaohs lavished rich offerings on his cult archaeological evidence suggests continuing existence of this funerary cult throughout much later new kingdom c 1550 1077 bc djedkare was also remembered by ancient egyptians as pharaoh of vizier ptahhotep purported author of maxims of ptahhotep one of earliest pieces of philosophic wisdom literature reforms implemented by djedkare are generally assessed negatively in modern egyptology as his policy of decentralization created a virtual feudal system that transferred much power to high and provincial administrations some egyptologists such as naguib kanawati argue that this contributed heavily to collapse of egyptian state during first intermediate period c 200 years later these conclusions are rejected by nigel strudwick who says that in spite of djedkare s reforms ancient egyptian officials never amassed enough power to rival that of king attestations contemporaneous sources djedkare is well attested in sources contemporaneous with his reign tombs of many of his courtiers and family members have been discovered in giza saqqara and abusir they give insights into administrative reforms that djedkare conducted during his reign and in a few cases even record letters that king sent to his officials these letters inscribed on walls of tombs typically present royal praises for tomb owner another important source of information about egypt during reign of djedkare is abusir papyri these are administrative documents covering a period of 24 years during djedkare s reign they were discovered in mortuary temples of pharaohs neferirkare kakai neferefre and queen khentkaus ii in addition to these texts earliest letters on papyrus preserved to present day also date to djedkare s reign dealing with administrative or private matters historical sources djedkare is attested in four ancient egyptian king lists all dating to new kingdom earliest of these is karnak king list dating to reign of thutmose iii 1479 1425 bc where djedkare is mentioned on fifth entry djedkare s prenomen occupies 32nd entry of abydos king list which was written during reign of seti i 1290 1279 bc djedkare is also present on saqqara tablet 31st entry where he is listed under name probably because of a scribal error djedkare s prenomen is given as djed on turin canon third column 24th row probably because of a lacuna affecting original document from which canon was copied during reign of ramses ii 1279 1213 bc turin canon credits djedkare with 28 years of reign in addition to these sources djedkare is mentioned on papyrus dating to 12th dynasty c 1990 1800 bc papyrus records maxims of ptahhotep and gives djedkare s nomen isesi to name pharaoh whom purported authors of maxims vizier ptahhotep served djedkare was also probably mentioned in aegyptiaca a history of egypt written in 3rd century bc during reign of ptolemy ii 283 246 bc by egyptian priest manetho no copies of aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is known to us only through later writings by sextus julius africanus and eusebius africanus relates that a pharaoh tancheres ancient greek reigned for 44 years as eighth and penultimate king of fifth dynasty given its position within dynasty tancheres is believed to be his hellenized name family parents thumb upright isesi ankh as depicted on his false door stela djedkare s parentage is unknown in particular his relation with his predecessors menkauhor kaiu and nyuserre ini cannot be ascertained djedkare is generally thought to have been son of menkauhor kaiu but two might instead have been brothers and sons of nyuserre ini another hypothesis suggests that djedkare and menkauhor could have been cousins being sons of nyuserre and neferefre respectively identity of djedkare s mother is similarly unknown queens name of djedkare s principal wife was this important queen consort whose name was lost but found in 2019 was owner of a large pyramid complex located to northeast of djedkare s pyramid in saqqara discovery of a unique tomb and name of an ancient egyptian queen in south saqqara titles of queen on fig 14 this could indicate that she was mother of djedkare s successor unas or that djedkare owed throne to her very high status of this queen is suggested by some features of her funerary complex that are otherwise reserved to kings her pyramid has its own satellite pyramid has a causeway leading from a valley temple up to a mortuary temple devoted to cult of queen and had an entrance hall pr an open courtyard and a square antechamber furthermore some reliefs showing queen had been reworked with royal insignia and vultures added above her head since construction of queen s pyramid was apparently undertaken after planning of djedkare s pyramid and her relief had been reworked egyptologist klaus baer suggests that this queen may have ruled after death of djedkare playing an important role in his succession this is rejected by other egyptologists such as michel baud owing to lack of evidence for a regency or interregnum between djedkare and unas egyptologist wilfried seipel has proposed that this pyramid was initially intended for queen meresankh iv whom he and verner see as a wife of djedkare seipel contends that meresankh was finally buried in a smaller mastaba in saqqara north after she fell into disgrace alternatively aidan dodson and dyan hilton have proposed that she was a wife of preceding king menkauhor kaiu sons thumb upright wooden statues of kekheretnebti and in background of neserkauhor now in museum only one son of djedkare has been identified for certain neserkauhor who bore title of eldest beloved king s son of his body neserkauhor also bore title of iry pat showing that he was an important member of royal court as well as a priestly title greatest of five in temple of suggesting that he may have been a vizier or had similar occupations as well as neserkauhor there is indirect evidence that princes raemka and kaemtjenent are sons of djedkare based on dating and general location of their tombs in saqqara for example tomb of kaemtjenent mentions vizier who served during reign of djedkare raemka also bore title of king s son of his body almost exclusively reserved to true princes of royal blood locations of raemka s and kaemtjenent s tombs have led some egyptologists to believe that both princes are sons of queen meresankh iv buried nearby who would thus be one of djedkare s wives these conclusions are debated in particular in case of kaemtjenent whose title of king s son may have been purely honorific a high official named isesi ankh could have been yet another son of djedkare as suggested by his name meaning isesi lives yet similarities in titles and locations of tombs of isesi ankh and kaemtjenent have led egyptologists to propose that they could instead be brothers and sons of meresankh iv or that former is a son of latter even though isesi ankh bore title of king s son egyptologists michel baud and bettina schmitz argue that this filiation was fictitious being only an honorary title finally successor of djedkare unas is thought to have been his son in spite of complete lack of evidence bearing on question main argument in favor of this filiation is that succession from djedkare to unas seems to have been smooth as suggested indirectly for example by abusir papyri indirect evidence also comes from reliefs of unas causeway which show many officials bearing names incorporating isesi suggesting at very least that unas did not perceive djedkare as an antagonist daughters several daughters of djedkare have been identified by title of king s daughter of his body and general date of their tomb these include kekheretnebti whose filiation is clearly indicated by her other title of beloved of isesi isesi hedjetnebu and less certain is filiation of iii wife of vizier senedjemib mehi who bore title of king s daughter of his body it is debated whether this title indicates a true filiation or if it is only honorary chronology thumb upright alabaster vase bearing an inscription celebrating djedkare s first sed festival musee du louvre relative chronological position of djedkare as eighth and penultimate ruler of fifth dynasty succeeding menkauhor kaiu and preceding unas on throne is well established by historical sources and confirmed by archaeological evidence duration of djedkare s reign is much less certain djedkare s time on throne is well documented by abusir papyri numerous royal seals and contemporary inscriptions taken together they indicate a fairly long rule for this king while turin canon credits him with 28 years of reign there is direct evidence for an even longer reign several artefacts and inscriptions have been uncovered relating to djedkare s rejuvenation or sed festival normally celebrated only after 30 years of reign for example tomb of one of djedkare s viziers senedjemib inti relates construction works undertaken during year of 16th cattle count in preparation for festival ceremonies an alabaster vase now on display at louvre museum bears an inscription celebrating djedkare s first sed festival indicating in all likelihood that he reigned beyond his 30th year on throne one of abusir papyri was found to be dated to year of 22nd count iv akhet day 12 constituting djedkare s latest known date this date might correspond to any time from 32nd year of djedkare s reign up to his 44th year on throne depending on whether cattle count was once every two years or once every year and a half higher estimate is close to manetho s 44 year figure credited to tancheres hellenized name of djedkare although this may just be coincidental modern estimates thus put djedkare s reign length as certainly more than 33 years and if cattle count was regularly biennial at least 42 to 44 years this makes djedkare longest reigning king of fifth dynasty reign thumb right statue of djedkare from temple of osiris in abydos reign of djedkare heralded a new period in history of old kingdom first he did not build a sun temple as his predecessors had done since time of userkaf some 80 years earlier this may be a result of increased prominence of osiris compared with sun god ra during late fifth dynasty rise of osiris corresponds to changes in role of king with respect to wider egyptian society in particular king loses his role as sole guarantor of afterlife which now becomes available beyond immediate royal circle these changes king s position and as egyptologist hans writes make him fully human yet still socially dominant importance of cult of osiris becomes manifest when pyramid texts of pyramid of unas are inscribed a few decades later in this context it is perhaps noteworthy that only known statue of djedkare was discovered in ruins of temple of osiris in abydos another manifestation of winds of change during djedkare s time on throne is confirmation of relocation of royal necropolis from abusir where it had been since reign of sahure to saqqara where menkauhor kaiu djedkare and his successor unas built their pyramids abusir may have become overcrowded by time of menkauhor s accession and capital may have been shifted south to saqqara along with royal necropolis around same time abandonment of abusir as a royal necropolis and termination of sun temple building are possibly related given close association between two since reign of userkaf domestic reforms thumb right two statues of ptahhotep a vizier during djedkare s reign during his reign djedkare effected significant reforms of state administration and priesthood in particular that pertaining to funerary cults in necropolis of abusir these evolutions are witnessed by changes in priestly titles and more broadly in system of ranking titles of high officials which was modified for first time in its existence for example priesthood of royal pyramids was reorganized with djedkare possibly changing titles and functions of priests from priest of king to priest of pyramid although this change may have happened earlier under nyuserre ini princes of royal blood could once more hold administrative titles a prerogative they had lost during early fifth dynasty at same time viziers could now hold prestigious titles of iry pat and a and as overseer of royal scribes became head of scribal administration at least one vizier seshemnefer iii even bore title of king s son of his body one of most distinguished titles at time and normally reserved to princes of royal blood yet neither seshemnefer iii s father nor his mother seems to have belonged to royal family for period spanning reign of djedkare until that of teti viziers were furthermore responsible for weaponry of state both for military and other purposes following reforms undertaken by djedkare three viziers would be in office at same time two in memphite region and a southern one governor of upper egypt with a seat at abydos in total six viziers were appointed during djedkare s reign lower ranking officials lost power during late fifth dynasty and were frequently limited to holding only one high title a departure from preceding period such functions as overseer of granary and overseer of treasury disappear from record some time between djedkare s reign and that of teti while men of lower status became head of legal administration consequently viziers concentrated more power than before while lower echelons of state administration were reduced at same time size of provincial administration was increased and it also became more autonomous from central government in particular nomarchs were responsible in their provinces for performing works hitherto conducted by memphite officials building activities main building activity undertaken during reign of djedkare was construction of his pyramid complex in saqqara djedkare also either completed or undertook restoration works in funerary complex of nyuserre ini in abusir as indicated by a now damaged inscription which must have detailed djedkare s activities on site further building works took place in abusir during second half of djedkare s reign following curious decision by members of royal family to be buried there rather than next to djedkare s pyramid in saqqara a group of mastabas was thus constructed for princess kekheretnebti and her daughter princess hedjetnebu courtiers and idu who was buried with his wife and prince neserkauhor djedkare also undertook building activities in relation with his sed festival as indicated by a decree that he sent to his vizier senedjemib inti on year of 16th cattle count praising him for his work decree mentions construction of a broad rectangular court or artificial lake for jubilee of king some 1000 cubits long and 400 cubits wide amounting to c court was located within precincts of a palace built for ceremonies of sed festival which was probably located in vicinity of his pyramid another decree addressed to senedjemib inti and later inscribed on walls of his mastaba records decoration of a chapel of hathor in palace of king this chapel was most likely built during his reign djedkare may have left some of his monuments unfinished at his death as suggested by several relief bearing blocks inscribed with his name and which were found reused in pyramid of king unas their original setting remains unknown a reused granite block with king s name was also found at pyramid of amenemhat i at activities outside egypt thumb right upright drawing by karl richard lepsius of a relief of djedkare wadi maghara expeditions to mines and quarries three or four rock inscriptions dating to djedkare s reign have been found in wadi maghareh in sinai where mines of copper and semi precious stones were exploited throughout old kingdom from fourth until sixth dynasty these inscriptions record three expeditions sent to look for turquoise earliest one dated to third or fourth cattle count possibly corresponding to sixth or eighth year of s reign explicitly recalls arrival of mining party to hills of turquoise after being given divine authority for finding of semi precious stones in writing of god himself as was enacted in broad court of temple nekhenre this sentence could indicate earliest known record of an oracular divination undertaken in order to ensure success of expedition prior to its departure nekhenre being sun temple of userkaf another inscription dating to year of ninth cattle count possibly djedkare s 18th year on throne shows king subduing all foreign lands smiting chief of foreign land expedition that left this inscription comprised over 1400 men and administration officials some egyptologists have proposed that these men were also sent to mine copper these expeditions departed egypt from port of ain on western shore of gulf of suez as revealed by papyri and seals bearing djedkare s name found on site port comprised large galleries carved into sandstone serving as living quarters and storage places wall of one such gallery was inscribed with a text mentioning yet another expedition to hills of turquoise in year of seventh cattle count possibly djedkare s 14th year on throne in early 2018 more than 220 clay seals bearing serekh of djedkare were uncovered in tell edfu in south of upper egypt these seals have been found in close association with copper ore nubian remains of two large buildings and a settlement edfu called by ancient egyptians was likely place of departure for mining expeditions sent to eastern desert and red sea during djedkare s reign these expeditions were undertaken by a special group of prospectors called who were under orders of an administration official sent by king from memphis to edfu thumb upright gold cylinder seal bearing names of djedkare and menkauhor kaiu purportedly from anatolia south of egypt djedkare dispatched at least one expedition to diorite quarries located north west of abu simbel djedkare was not first king to do so as these quarries were already exploited during fourth dynasty and continued to be so during sixth dynasty and later in middle kingdom period c 2055 be c 1650 bc djedkare probably also exploited gold mines in eastern desert and in nubia indeed earliest mention of land of gold an ancient egyptian term for nubia is found in an inscription from mortuary temple of djedkare trade relations egypt entertained continuing trade relations with levant during djedkare s reign possibly as far north as anatolia a gold cylinder seal bearing serekh of djedkare together with cartouche of menkauhor kaiu is now on display at museum of fine arts boston seal whose gold may originate from pactolus river valley in western anatolia could attest to wide ranging trade contacts during later fifth dynasty but its provenance remains unverifiable trade contacts with byblos on coast of modern day lebanon are suggested by a fragmentary stone vessel unearthed in city and bearing inscription king of upper and lower egypt djedkare living forever a biographical inscription discovered in tomb of iny a sixth dynasty official provides further evidence for an egyptian expedition to byblos during djedkare s reign iny s inscription relates his travels to procure lapis lazuli and lead or tin for pharaoh merenre but starts by recounting what must have been similar events taking place under djedkare to south of egypt djedkare also sent an expedition to fabled land of punt to procure myrrh used as incense in egyptian temples expedition to punt is referred to in letter from pepi ii neferkare to harkuf some 100 years later harkuf had reported that he would bring back a dwarf of god s dancers from land of horizon dwellers pepi mentions that god s sealbearer werdjededkhnum had returned from punt with a dwarf during reign of djedkare and had been richly rewarded decree mentions that my majesty will do for you something greater than what was done for god s sealbearer werdjededkhnum in reign of isesi reflecting my majesty s yearning to see this dwarf thumb relief from tomb of inti showing a scene of battle or siege djedkare s expedition to punt is also mentioned in a contemporaneous graffito found in a locality of lower nubia some south of aswan where isesi s cartouche was discovered warfare not all relations between egypt and its neighbors were peaceful during djedkare s reign in particular one of earliest known depictions of a battle or a city being besieged is found in tomb of inti an official from 21st nome of upper egypt who lived during late fifth dynasty scene shows egyptian soldiers scaling walls of a near eastern fortress on ladders more generally ancient egyptians seem to have regularly organised punitive raids in canaan during later old kingdom period but did not attempt to establish a permanent dominion there pyramid thumb right pyramid of djedkare in saqqara djedkare built his pyramid in south saqqara it was called nefer isesi or nefer djedkare in ancient egyptian variously translated as isesi djedkare is beautiful or isesi djedkare is perfect it is known today as haram el because it stands on edge of nile valley pyramid originally comprised six or seven steps made of irregular and roughly hewn limestone blocks and mortar of which only three survive this core was overlaid by casing stones of white tura limestone which were stolen in antiquity at time of its construction pyramid stood high with a base length of and an inclination angle of 52deg in interior of pyramid a descending passage led behind three granite portcullises to an antechamber three magazine rooms and burial chamber in burial chamber pieces of alabaster and a faience bead on a gold thread were discovered as well as many fragments of what was originally a large sarcophagus of dark grey basalt sarcophagus was sunk into floor of burial chamber and there was a niche for chest of king to its north east an almost complete mummy was discovered in remnants of sarcophagus an examination by ahmed of these skeletal remains excavated in mid 1940s under direction of abdel salam hussein suggests that djedkare died at age of 50 to 60 years to east of pyramid djedkare s mortuary temple was laid out its eastern facade was flanked by two massive stone structures which resemble later pylons mortuary temple is connected via a yet unexcavated causeway to a valley temple legacy impact of reforms thumb right large mastaba of senedjemib inti vizier under djedkare for nigel strudwick reforms of djedkare were undertaken as a reaction to rapid growth of central administration in first part of fifth dynasty which baer adds had amassed too much political or economic power in eyes of king joyce tyldesley sees reign of djedkare as very beginning of a decline in importance of king in conjunction with gradual rise of power wielded by high and provincial administration concurrent with this trend is a process of decentralization with local loyalties slowly superseding allegiance to central state since offices and vizierate in particular could be inherited reforms of djedkare created a virtual feudal system as nicolas grimal writes with much power in hands of a few puissant officials this is best witnessed by large magnificent mastaba tombs that djedkare s viziers built in this context djedkare s reforms of ranking system might have been an attempt at maintaining a sprawling administration under control yet ultimately failed for some egyptologists such as naguib kanawati this failure contributed in no small part to fall of old kingdom but others including strudwick believe reasons of collapse must be sought elsewhere as power of an administration official never approached that of king reforms of djedkare played an important role in flourishing of arts during later old kingdom as artisans and craftsmen could now find many wealthy patrons beyond king this created a surge in number of commissions leading to a general improvement of artistic works this also provided artisans with a new wealth which they used to build their own large funerary complexes funerary cult old kingdom upright 0 5 thumb personified agricultural estate of djedkare called ra desires that isesi lives djedkare was object of a funerary cult established at his death and which lasted until end of old kingdom nearly 200 years later provisions for this cult were produced in several agricultural estates set up during djedkare s reign names of some of these estates have been found inscribed on walls of tombs of his courtiers ra desires that isesi lives desires that izezi live perfect of emulation is isesi vessel of djedkare perfect of favors is isesi seshat makes isesi live ka of isesi is foremost dominion belongs to izezi work of command of izezi bastet wishes that izezi lives horus perpetuates izezi offerings of izezi and izezi is one who loves life djedkare seems to have been held in high esteem during sixth dynasty for example merenre i chose to place his pyramid complex close to that of djedkare in addition south saqqara stone a royal annal dating to reign of merenre or of his successor pepi ii records rich offerings being made to djedkare on behalf of king an estimated 92 of text inscribed on stone was lost when it was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid possibly in late first intermediate c 2160 2055 bc to early middle kingdom period c 2055 1650 bc more generally an historical or literary tradition concerning events in time of djedkare seems to have flourished toward end of old kingdom as can be inferred from tombs of harkuf and iny these two officials were in charge of expeditions to foreign lands punt and byblos under merenre i and pepi ii and both relate similar expeditions that took place during time of djedkare new kingdom funerary cult of djedkare enjoyed a revival during new kingdom c 1550 1077 bc for early part of this period this is best attested by karnak king list a list of kings commissioned by pharaoh thutmose iii list was not meant to be exhaustive rather it gave names of thutmose s forefathers whom he wanted to honor by dedicating offerings for later new kingdom a relief from saqqara tomb of priest mehu dating to 19th or 20th dynasty shows three gods faced by several deceased pharaohs these are djoser and sekhemket of third dynasty and userkaf founder of fifth dynasty he is followed by a fourth king whose name is damaged but which is often read djedkare or much less likely shepseskare relief is an expression of personal piety on mehu s behalf who prayed to ancient kings for them to recommend him to gods see also northeast africa notes references bibliography category 25th century
