thumb right president of united states john f kennedy left and prime minister of united kingdom harold macmillan right in bermuda on 21 december 1961 nassau agreement concluded on 21 december 1962 was an agreement negotiated between president of united states john f kennedy and harold macmillan prime minister of united kingdom as a result of a series of meetings by two leaders over three days in bahamas following kennedy s announcement of his intended cancellation of skybolt agreement ended skybolt crisis and enabled uk polaris programme under an earlier agreement us had agreed to supply skybolt an american air launched ballistic missile in return for uk allowing americans to establish a ballistic missile submarine base in holy loch near glasgow british government had then cancelled development of its medium range ballistic missile known as blue streak leaving skybolt as basis of uk s nuclear deterrent in 1960s without skybolt v bombers of royal air force raf would likely become obsolete through being unable to penetrate improved air defences that soviet union was expected to deploy by 1970s at nassau macmillan rejected kennedy s other offers and pressed him to supply nuclear capable polaris submarine launched ballistic missiles these represented more advanced technology than skybolt and us was not inclined to provide them except as part of a multilateral force within north atlantic treaty organisation nato under nassau agreement us agreed to provide uk with polaris agreement stipulated that uk s polaris missiles would be assigned to nato as part of a multilateral force and could be used independently only when supreme national interests intervened nassau agreement became basis of polaris sales agreement a treaty which was signed on 6 april 1963 under this agreement british nuclear warheads were fitted to polaris missiles as a result responsibility for britain s nuclear deterrent passed from raf to royal navy president of france charles de gaulle cited nassau agreement as one of main reasons for his veto of britain s application for admission to european economic community eec on 14 january 1963 background british nuclear deterrent during early part of second world war britain had a nuclear weapons project codenamed tube alloys at quebec conference in august 1943 prime minister winston churchill and president of united states franklin roosevelt signed quebec agreement which merged tube alloys with american manhattan project to create a combined british american and canadian project british government trusted that united states would continue to share nuclear technology which it regarded as a joint discovery after war but united states atomic energy act of 1946 mcmahon act ended technical cooperation fearing a resurgence of united states isolationism and britain losing its great power status british government restarted its own development effort now codenamed high explosive research first british atomic bomb was tested in operation hurricane on 3 october 1952 subsequent british development of hydrogen bomb and a favourable international relations climate created by sputnik crisis led to mcmahon act being amended in 1958 resulting in restoration of nuclear special relationship in form of 1958 us uk mutual defence agreement which allowed britain to acquire nuclear weapons systems from united states thumb left avro vulcan bomber britain s nuclear weapons armament was initially based on free fall bombs delivered by v bombers of royal air force raf but possibility of manned bomber becoming obsolete by late 1960s due to improvements in anti aircraft defences was foreseen in 1953 assistant chief of air staff operational requirements air vice marshal geoffrey tuttle requested a specification for a ballistic missile with range and work commenced at royal aircraft establishment in farnborough later that year at a north atlantic treaty organization nato meeting in paris in december 1953 united states secretary of defense charles e wilson raised possibility of a joint medium range ballistic missile mrbm development programme talks were held in june 1954 resulting in signing of an agreement on 12 august 1954 united kingdom with united states support would develop an mrbm of range this was called blue streak it was initially estimated to cost ps70 million with united states paying 15 per cent by 1958 project was in trouble its deployment was still years away but united states was supplying american built thor intermediate range ballistic missiles under project emily and there were concerns about liquid fuelled blue streak s vulnerability to a pre emptive nuclear strike to extend effectiveness and operational life of v bombers an operational requirement or 1132 was issued on 3 september 1954 for an air launched rocket propelled standoff missile with a range of that could be launched from a v bomber this became blue steel ministry of supply placed a development contract with avro in march 1956 and it entered service in december 1962 by this time it was anticipated that even with blue steel air defences of soviet union would soon improve to extent that v bombers might find it difficult to attack their targets and there were calls for development of blue steel mark ii with a range of at least despite name this was a whole new missile and not a development of mark i minister of aviation duncan sandys insisted that priority be accorded to getting mark i into service and mark ii was cancelled at end of 1959 skybolt thumb right a skybolt missile at raf museum cosford showing raf roundel and manufacturer douglas aircraft logo confronted with same problem united states air force usaf also attempted to extend operational life of its strategic bombers by developing a stand off missile agm 28 hound dog first production model was delivered to strategic air command sac in december 1959 it carried a w28 warhead and had a range of at high level and at low level its circular error probable cep of over at full range was considered acceptable for a warhead of this size a boeing b 52 stratofortress could carry two but underslung pratt whitney engine precluded its carriage by bombers with less underwing clearance like convair b 58 hustler and north american xb 70 valkyrie it entered service in large numbers with 593 in service by 1963 numbers declined thereafter to 308 in 1976 but it remained in service until 1977 when it was replaced by agm 69 sram despite its being superior in performance to blue steel british showed little interest in hound dog it could not be carried by handley page victor and there were doubts as to whether even avro vulcan had sufficient ground clearance even as hound dog was entering service usaf was contemplating a successor an advanced air to surface missile that could carry a warhead with a range of and a cep of such a missile would make manned bombers competitive with intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms however it would also require significant technological advances missile became agm 48 skybolt as costs rose and support diminished usaf decreased its specifications to carrying a warhead and a cep of this was estimated to cost 893 6 million a may 1960 report to george kistiakowsky chairman of president s science advisory committee psac by psac missile advisory panel was unconvinced of skybolt s merits as new lgm 30 minuteman icbm would be able to perform same missions at much lower cost psac therefore recommended in december 1960 that skybolt be cancelled forthwith united states secretary of defense thomas s gates jr elected not to request further funding for it but avoided cancellation by reprogramming 70 million from previous year s allocation thumb upright left a ugm 27 polaris missile on launch pad at cape canaveral a crucial reason for skybolt s survival was support it garnered from britain blue streak was cancelled on 24 february 1960 subject to an adequate replacement being procured from us an initial solution appeared to be skybolt which combined range of blue streak with mobile basing of blue steel and was small enough that two could be carried on vulcan bomber armed with a british red snow warhead this would improve capability of uk s v bomber force and extend its useful life into late 1960s and early 1970s like usaf raf was concerned that ballistic missiles could eventually replace manned bombers an institutional challenge came from united states navy which was developing a submarine launched ballistic missile slbm ugm 27 polaris us chief of naval operations admiral arleigh burke kept first sea lord lord mountbatten apprised of its development by moving deterrent out to sea polaris offered prospect of a deterrent that was invulnerable to a first strike and reduced risk of a nuclear strike on british isles british nuclear deterrent study group produced a study that argued that slbm technology was as yet unproven that polaris would be expensive and that given time it would take to build boats it could not be deployed before early 1970s cabinet defence committee approved acquisition of skybolt in february 1960 prime minister harold macmillan met with president dwight eisenhower at camp david near washington in march 1960 and secured permission to buy skybolt without strings attached in return americans were given permission to base us navy s polaris equipped ballistic missile submarines at holy loch in scotland financial arrangement was particularly favourable to britain as us was charging only unit cost of skybolt absorbing all research and development costs mountbatten was disappointed as was burke who now had to face possible survival of skybolt at pentagon exactly what was agreed with regard to polaris was not clear americans wanted any later offer of polaris to be as part of a scheme for deployment of nato known as multilateral force with skybolt agreement in hand minister of defence harold watkinson announced cancellation of blue streak to house of commons on 13 april 1960 american concerns skybolt proponents in usaf hoped that incoming kennedy administration which took office in january 1961 would be supportive of skybolt given its election campaigning on basis of an alleged missile gap between soviet and us capabilities initially it was robert mcnamara new secretary of defense defended skybolt before senate armed services committee he requested 347 million to purchase 92 skybolt missiles in 1963 with intention of deploying 1 150 missiles by 1967 however on 21 october 1961 usaf raised its estimate of research and development costs to 492 6 million an increase of over 100 million and production costs were now reckoned at 1 27 billion an increase of 591 million thumb right upright us secretary of defense robert mcnamara in 1967 kennedy administration adopted a policy of opposition to independent british nuclear forces in april 1961 in a speech at ann arbor michigan on 16 june 1962 mcnamara stated limited nuclear capabilities operating independently are dangerous expensive prone to obsolescence and lacking in credibility as a deterrent and that relatively weak national nuclear forces with enemy cities as their targets are not likely to perform even function of deterrence dean acheson was even more blunt in a speech at west point he stated britain s attempt to play a separate power role that is a role apart from europe a role based on a special relationship with united states a role based on being head of a commonwealth which has no political structure or unity or strength and enjoys a fragile and precarious economic relationship this role is about played out kennedy administration was concerned that a situation like suez crisis might repeat itself one that would once again incite a response from soviets americans developed a plan to force uk into multilateral force concept a dual key arrangement that would only allow launch if both parties agreed if those weapons were part of a single larger force attacking them would require attacks on other hosting countries as well making prospect far less interesting us also feared that other countries would want to follow uk lead and develop their own deterrent forces leading to a proliferation problem even among their own allies if a deterrent was being provided by a larger international force need for individual forces would be reduced between 1955 and 1960 british economy had lagged behind that of rest of europe growing at an average of 2 5 per cent per annum compared with france s growth of 4 8 per cent germany s of 6 4 per cent and european economic community eec average of 5 3 per cent it was clear that britain s economic future lay in europe and becoming a member of eec and macmillan devoted much of 1960 to laying ground for britain s entry into eec us was concerned that providing polaris to britain would jeopardise britain s prospects of joining eec long term us policy was to persuade uk to build up its conventional military forces and to secure admission to eec mcnamara introduced cost effectiveness analysis to defence procurement skybolt suffered from rising costs and first five test launches were failures this was not unusual polaris and minuteman had similar problems what doomed skybolt was an inability to demonstrate capability beyond that achievable by hound dog minuteman or polaris this meant that there were few advantages for united states in continuing skybolt but at same time its cancellation would be a powerful political tool for bringing uk into their multilateral force british on other hand had cancelled all other projects to concentrate fully on skybolt when warned not to put all their eggs in one basket british replied that there was no other egg and no other basket on 7 november 1962 mcnamara met with kennedy and recommended that skybolt be cancelled he then briefed british ambassador to united states david ormsby gore kennedy agreed to cancel skybolt on 23 november 1962 negotiations mcnamara met with solly zuckerman chief scientific adviser to ministry of defence on 9 december and flew to london to meet with minister of defence peter thorneycroft on 11 december on arrival he told media that skybolt was an expensive and complex program that had suffered five test failures kennedy told a television interviewer that we don t think that we are going to get 2 5 billion worth of national security us national security advisor mcgeorge bundy gave an interview on television in which he stated that us had no obligation to supply skybolt to uk thorneycroft had expected mcnamara to offer polaris instead but found him unwilling to countenance such an offer except as part of a multinational force mcnamara was willing to supply hound dog or to allow british to continue development of skybolt thumb left president kennedy meets with prime minister harold macmillan in government house in hamilton bermuda in 1961 left to right us secretary of state dean rusk president kennedy prime minister macmillan british secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs lord home thumb left sound recording of president kennedy s remarks to harold macmillan upon arrival at windsor field in nassau bahamas these discussions were reported to house of commons by thorneycroft leading to a storm of protest air commodore sir arthur vere harvey pointed out that while skybolt had suffered five test failures polaris had thirteen failures in its development he went on to state that some of us on this side who want to see britain retain a nuclear deterrent are highly suspicious of some of american motives and say that british people are tired of being pushed around liberal party leader jo grimond asked does not this mark absolute failure of policy of independent deterrent is it not case that everybody else in world knew this except conservative party in this country is it not case that americans gave up production of b52 which was to carry skybolt nine months ago as skybolt crisis came to boil in uk an emergency meeting between macmillan and kennedy was arranged to take place in nassau bahamas accompanying macmillan were british secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs lord home thorneycroft sandys and zuckerman naval expertise was supplied by vice admiral michael le fanu ormsby gore flew to nassau with kennedy en route he brokered a deal whereby britain and united states would continue development of skybolt with each paying half cost american half being a kind of termination fee in london over one hundred conservative members of parliament nearly one third of parliamentary party signed a motion urging macmillan to ensure that britain remained an independent nuclear power talks opened with macmillan detailing history of anglo american special relationship going back to second world war he rejected deal that kennedy and ormsby gore had reached it would cost britain about 100 million and was not politically viable in wake of recent public comments about skybolt kennedy then offered hound dog macmillan turned this down on technical grounds although it had not been subjected to a detailed assessment and probably would have worked for raf into 1970s as it did for usaf it therefore came down to polaris which us did not wish to supply except as part of a multinational force macmillan was emphatic that he would commit submarines to nato only if they could be withdrawn in case of a national emergency when pressed by kennedy as to what sort of emergencies he had in mind macmillan mentioned soviet threats at time of suez crisis iraqi aggression against kuwait or a threat to singapore british nuclear deterrent was not just for deterring attacks on uk but to underwrite britain s role as a great power in end kennedy did not wish to see macmillan s government collapse which would imperil britain s entry into eec so a face saving compromise was found which was released as a joint statement on 21 december 1962 on 22 december after nassau conference had ended usaf conducted sixth and final test flight of skybolt having received explicit permission to do so from roswell united states deputy secretary of defense in mcnamara s absence test was a success kennedy was furious but macmillan remained confident that americans had determined to kill skybolt on good general grounds not merely to annoy us or drive great britain out of nuclear business successful test raised possibility that usaf might get skybolt project re instated and americans would on nassau agreement this did not occur skybolt was officially cancelled on 31 december 1962 outcome macmillan placed nassau agreement before cabinet on 3 january 1963 he made case for britain retaining nuclear weapons he asserted that it would not be in best interest of western alliance for all knowledge of technology to reside with united states that possession of an independent nuclear capability gave britain ability to respond to threats from soviet union even when united states was not inclined to support britain and that possession of nuclear weapons gave britain a voice in nuclear disarmament talks however concerns were expressed that dependence on united states would necessarily diminish britain s influence on world affairs thorneycroft addressed view that britain should provide a nuclear deterrent from its own resources he pointed out that polaris represented 800 million in research and development costs that united kingdom would save nonetheless chancellor of exchequer selwyn lloyd was still concerned at cost thumb right upright a polaris missile lifts off after being fired from submerged british nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine in 1986 in wake of nassau agreement two governments negotiated polaris sales agreement a treaty under terms of which us supplied polaris missiles which was signed on 6 april 1963 missiles were equipped with british warheads uk retained its deterrent force although its control passed from raf to royal navy polaris was a better weapon system for uk s needs and has been referred to as almost bargain of century and an amazing offer v bombers were immediately reassigned to nato under terms of nassau agreement carrying tactical nuclear weapons as were polaris submarines when they entered service in 1968 polaris sales agreement was amended in 1980 to provide for purchase of trident british politicians did not like to talk about dependence on united states preferring to describe special relationship as one of interdependence as had been feared president of france charles de gaulle vetoed britain s application for admission to eec on 14 january 1963 citing nassau agreement as one of main reasons he argued that britain s dependence on united states through purchase of polaris rendered it unfit to be a member of eec us policy of attempting to force britain into their multilateral force proved to be a failure in light of this decision and there was a lack of enthusiasm for it from nato allies particularly britain by 1965 multilateral force began fading away nato nuclear planning group gave nato members a voice in planning process without full access to nuclear weapons standing naval force atlantic was established as a joint naval task force to which various nations contributing ships rather than ships having mixed crews macmillan s government lost a series of by elections in 1962 and was shaken by profumo affair in 1963 in october 1963 on eve of annual conservative party conference macmillan fell ill with what was initially feared to be inoperable prostate cancer his doctors assured him that it was benign and that he would make a full recovery but he took opportunity to resign on grounds of ill health he was succeeded by lord home who renounced his peerage and as alec douglas home campaigned on britain s nuclear deterrent in 1964 election while issue was of low importance in minds of electorate it was an issue on which douglas home felt passionately and on which majority of voters supported his position labour party election manifesto called for nassau agreement to be renegotiated and on 5 october 1964 leader of labour party harold wilson criticised independent british deterrent as neither independent nor british nor a deterrent douglas home narrowly lost election to wilson in office labour retained polaris and assigned polaris boats to nato in accord with nassau agreement kennedy stung by entire issue commissioned a detailed report by richard neustadt on events and what lessons could be learned from them jacqueline kennedy onassis recalled him reading initial report and commenting that if you want to know what my life is like
