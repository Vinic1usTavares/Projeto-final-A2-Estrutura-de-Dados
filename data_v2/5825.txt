himself to protecting gotham city from its criminal underworld as a highly trained masked vigilante equipped with various tools and weapons affleck noted on how film gave him an opportunity to reinvent batman and portray a more classic take on character he described that in film audiences will see batman as more heroic and more of a leader batman is by nature while not necessarily anti social pretty private pretty a loner affleck says and then in this movie he s thrust into role of having to not only work with people but bring them together and convince them to come in and try to somehow with wonder woman hold all that community effort together that was a really interesting thing to play for me and it also does take us to a more traditional role for batman in justice league

production during filming it was reported that rewrites by geoff johns caused issues with chris terrio and warner bros executives warner bros was unsatisfied with how film was shaping up under snyder because of negative feedback that theatrical version of batman v superman received it was reported that warner bros held a footage summit for writers that include joss whedon wonder woman writer allan heinberg seth grahame smith and andrea this caused numerous rewrites as justice league was filming whedon was eventually hired by warner bros after snyder stepped down for directorial duties during post production filming wrapped in october 2016 post production thumb upright joss whedon took over post production of justice league after snyder stepped down in may 2017 snyder stepped down from directorial duties during post production of film to properly deal with death of his daughter autumn snyder joss whedon whom snyder had previously brought on to rewrite some additional scenes took

into them more than typical 6 10 million additional filming costs which brought budget of film up to 300 million reshoots coincided with cavill s schedule for mission impossible fallout for which he had grown a mustache which he was contracted to keep while filming while fallout director christopher mcquarrie initially gave producers of justice league permission to have cavill shave mustache in exchange for 3 million it would cost to shut down production on fallout and then digitally fill mustache in executives from paramount pictures rejected idea justice leagues vfx team was then forced to used special effects to digitally remove mustache in post production in an interview producer charles roven said let s just say 80 85 percent of movie is what was originally shot there s only so much you can do with other 15 20 percent of movie whedon received a screenwriting credit on film alongside chris terrio while snyder received sole director s credit warner bros ceo kevin mandated film to be under two hours company also did not opt to delay film s release despite fact that there had been numerous problems in post production so that executives will receive their cash bonuses before company s merger with at t in february 2018 it was reported that snyder was fired from directorial duties from justice league after his cut was deemed unwatchable according to collider s matt goldberg i d heard similar things from separate sources over last year as well i also heard that snyder s rough cut of movie was unwatchable a word that jumped out at me because it s rare you hear two separate sources use exactly same adjective of course even if that s true there s obviously more to story since rough cuts can be fixed up with reshoots rewrites etc goldberg wrote according to dc comics publisher comic book artist jim lee snyder was not fired speaking at calgary comic and entertainment expo lee stated that he snyder was not fired at all and that he stepped down from production due to a family matter as far as he knew music in march 2016 hans zimmer who co composed score for man of steel and batman v superman dawn of justice stated that he had officially retired from superhero

united states film opened to 4 051 theaters in its widest release justice league was shown in cinemas for 119 days 17 weeks marketing superman was intentionally left out on all early justice league marketing materials including trailers clips and posters which actor cavill commented as ridiculous despite his character being hidden from promotional materials cavill still joined rest of cast on film s press tour clark kent was revealed in a final trailer before release of film but edited in a way that writers felt lois lane was dreaming about clark sponsorship and marketing partners of film included at t gillette mercedes benz and tcl later after film s release superman was finally included in a new alternate version of theatrical poster home media justice league was released on digital download on february 13 2018 and was released on blu ray disc blu ray 3d 4k ultra hd blu ray and dvd on march 13 2018 in various international markets blu ray features two deleted scenes titled return

58 3 million in domestic video sales according to numbers forbes reported that justice league went on to gross more than 100 million in blu ray dvd digital hd sales and rentals reception box office justice league grossed 229 million in united states and canada and 428 9 million in other territories for a worldwide total of 657 9 million against a production budget of 300 million it had a worldwide opening of 278 8 million 24th biggest of all time up against an estimated break even point of as much as 750 million deadline hollywood reported that film lost studio around 60 million due to film losing studio money movie was deemed a box office bomb or flop in united states and canada industry tracking initially forecast film debuting to 110 120 million from 4 051 theaters including 400 imax screens it made 13 million from thursday night previews up from 11 million made by wonder woman previous june however after making 38 8 million on its first day including thursday previews weekend projections were lowered to 95 million it ended up debuting to 93 8 million down 45 from batman v opening of 166 million and being first film of dceu to open under 100 million deadline attributed low figure to lukewarm audience reaction to film and most of its predecessors as well as poor critical reception and film review aggregation website rotten tomatoes not posting their aggregated score until day before release causing speculation and doubt from filmgoers in its second weekend film dropped 56 to 41 1 million finishing second at box office behind newcomer coco it was second best second weekend hold of dceu behind wonder womans 43 but lowest overall gross in its third week it again finished second behind coco grossing 16 7 million it made 9 7 million in its fourth week and 4 3 million in its fifth finishing a respective second and fifth at box office in 2018 forbes compared drastic uncohesive shift from snyder s darker films man of steel and batman v superman to lighter justice league co written by whedon to similarly drastic and uncohesive change in tone experienced from older 1989 and 1992 tim burton s batman films to direct light hearted sequels directed by schumacher although noting former shift in tone was better received than one in justice league affecting box office due to going against expectations of snyder fans in its attempt to reach a higher demographic while alienating its own established core audience internationally film was projected to debut to 215 235 million for a worldwide opening of 325 355 million it made 8 5 million on its first day from nine countries including south korea france and brazil it ended up having a 185 million international debut from 65 countries including 57 1 million from china 9 8 million from united kingdom 9 6 million from mexico and 8 8 million from south korea film broke a record in philippines with a debut of 1 12m php 57 3m making it biggest industry opening day for a film in 2017 and eventually becoming 7th most successful film of all time in brazil film opened to 14 2 million biggest opening in country s history outside north america films largest markets were china 106 million brazil 41 million mexico 24 8 million and united kingdom 24 million critical response justice league received mixed reviews it was praised for its action sequences and acting primarily by gadot and miller but criticized for screenplay pacing and cgi as well as its thin plot and underdeveloped villain on review aggregator website rotten tomatoes film has an approval rating of 40 based on 382 reviews with an average rating of 5 25 10 website s critical consensus reads justice league leaps over a number of dc movies but its single bound isn t enough to shed murky aesthetic thin characters and chaotic action that continue to dog franchise metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned film a score of 45 out of 100 based on 52 critics indicating mixed or average reviews audiences polled by cinemascore gave film an average grade of b on an a to f scale while posttrak reported filmgoers gave it an 85 overall positive score average 4 out of 5 stars and a 69 definite recommend richard roeper of chicago sun times gave film 3 5 out of 4 stars praising cast especially gadot and saying it s a putting band together origins movie executed with great fun and energy owen gleiberman of variety gave film a positive review and wrote justice league has been conceived in each and every frame to correct sins of batman v superman it s not just a sequel it s an act of franchise penance movie is never messy or bombastic it s light and clean and simple at times almost too simple with repartee and combat duels that make a point of not going on for too long bilge ebiri of village voice similarly gave it a positive review action scenes start and stop and then start again then go in different directions and it was a few moments into big climactic face off before i realized we d arrived at big climactic face off but these off kilter rhythms actually lend film a pleasant unpredictability as does humor which often sits uneasily next to moodiness but is somehow fast and witty enough to work writing for rolling stone peter travers gave film 2 5 out of 4 stars praising cast but criticizing action sequences and writing saying scenes of league members together bickering and bonding spike film with humor and genuine feeling creating a rooting interest in audience without it film would crumble conversely todd mccarthy of hollywood reporter while praising gadot and miller called film visually ugly and boring saying fatigue repetition and a laborious approach to exposition are of this affair which is also notable for how ben affleck donning bat suit for second time looks like he d rather be almost anywhere else but here sara stewart of new york post gave film 1 5 out of 4 stars justice league is a pointless flail of expensive yet somehow cheap looking cgi that no amount of tacked on quips or even gadot s luminescent star power can rescue like cyborg ray fisher one of its ostensible heroes justice league is patched together from disparate elements original director zack snyder left partway through due to a death in family leaving joss whedon to finish up result all plodding gray generic action of a snyder film with stabs of humor that almost never feel organic there s no sense of purpose here not even a sense of place writing for washington post alyssa rosenberg also returned with a negative review if justice league is a symbol of just how entrenched superhero movies have become in hollywood ecosystem it s also a potent illustration that success hasn t necessarily artistically elevated genre it s not just that beat by beat justice league feels nearly identical to so many of superhero movies that have come before or that it features some of ugliest most pointless special effects i ve seen at movies in a long time it s that darn thing feels depressingly haphazard and thoughtless and that it s guaranteed to make a ton of money anyway superhero fans are a ridiculously powerful market they deserve better than this james berardinelli gave it 2 out of 4 stars when marvel mapped out trajectory for their cinematic universe they were sometimes criticized for overthinking and nearly every major hero iron man hulk captain america thor had his own movie many of secondary characters including villain boasted significant screen time in one or more of first five films only once all these things had been accomplished were characters brought together for avengers formula worked avengers was popcorn bliss a superhero nirvana dc however came late to party riding critical and popular success of christopher nolan s batman trilogy and smarting from disappointing performance of bryan singer s superman returns they dithered and dallied and didn t begin planning out post dark knight campaign until mcu movie count was past half dozen mark and rising late start resulted in a rushed and approach justice league arrives with three major characters who haven t previously been introduced as a result this film has a lot of heavy background lifting to do too much in fact for it to be able to tell a worthwhile story 70 of movie is set up for future tales rest is an overlong smack down between our heroes and possibly worst villain ever to appear in a comic book picture writing for film ireland magazine ellen murray found characters interesting but their setting unworthy there is something undeniably thrilling in seeing these iconic characters work together on big screen it s just a shame that their current incarnation moulded in zack snyder s vision lacks a strong framework to allow them to better shine characters save film from being a complete and utter disaster but they alone can t save it from being a mild disaster while undoubtedly snyder is genuinely passionate about these characters he seems to suffer from a fundamental misunderstanding of what they represent and most importantly what cinema goers expect from a story involving them justice league understands that a character like superman means something to people it just can t show us convincingly why accolades justice league was short listed as a potential candidate for 90th academy award for best visual effects along with another dceu film wonder woman however neither film made it to final list of nominations justice league won 2 out of its 13 nominations list of awards and nominations year award category recipient s result 2017

actress amy adams gal gadot community reaction and snyder cut divisive reaction towards final highlighted cut of film with zack snyder leaving directorial duties and final cut of film in hands of joss whedon has led to an argument comparing situation to one experienced by film superman ii both justice league and superman ii feature a director that was replaced for different reasons before completion of a film which led to a second director coming in and making substantial changes to tone of each film although reasoning behind each director s departure differs richard donner was able to complete his superman ii cut in 2005 in belief that snyder had shot enough material for a finished film a campaign for a snyder cut was started to allow snyder to receive a similar treatment to donner arguments are made that snyder s vision would be more cohesive to previous films than actual theatrical cut which snyder has refused to see warner bros has officially remained silent regarding any intention of making a snyder cut in march 2019 snyder confirmed his original cut does exist and stated that it is up to warner bros to release it in november however an insider claimed that warner bros is unlikely to release snyder s version of justice league in theaters or on hbo max calling it a pipe dream in december however snyder posted a photo in his vero account which showed boxes with tapes labeled z s j l director s cut and with caption is it real does it exist of course it does future a sequel was scheduled to be released in june 2019 but has since been delayed to accommodate release for batman by march 2017 producer charles roven announced that zack snyder would return as director in october 2017 j k simmons stated that studio is working on script of sequel alongside batman shortly after release of justice league henry cavill stated that he is under contract with warner bros to play superman for one more film in december 2017 it was reported that there were no immediate plans for zack snyder to direct a justice league sequel or any other dc films with snyder instead being relegated to an executive producer position this comes after a reshuffling of film production staff at warner bros due to film s mixed critical reception and disappointing financial performance by 2019 warner bros had prioritized standalone films over project although wonder woman
