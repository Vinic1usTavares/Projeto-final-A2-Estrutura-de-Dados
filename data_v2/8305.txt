prinz eugen was an heavy cruiser third of a class of five vessels she served with nazi germany s kriegsmarine during world war ii ship was laid down in april 1936 launched in august 1938 and entered service after outbreak of war in august 1940 she was named after prince eugene of savoy an 18th century austrian general she was armed with a main battery of eight guns and although nominally under limit set by anglo german naval agreement actually displaced over prinz eugen saw action during operation rheinubung an attempted breakout into atlantic ocean with battleship in may 1941 two ships destroyed british battlecruiser and moderately damaged battleship in battle of denmark strait prinz eugen was detached from bismarck during operation to raid allied merchant shipping but this was cut short due to engine troubles after putting into occupied france and undergoing repairs ship participated in operation cerberus a daring daylight dash through english channel back to germany in february 1942 prinz eugen was deployed to norway although her time stationed there was curtailed when she was torpedoed by british submarine days after arriving in norwegian waters torpedo severely damaged ship s stern which necessitated repairs in germany upon returning to active service ship spent several months training officer cadets in baltic before serving as artillery support for retreating german army on eastern front after german collapse in may 1945 she was surrendered to british royal navy before being transferred to us navy as a war prize after examining ship in united states us navy assigned cruiser to operation crossroads nuclear tests at bikini atoll having survived atomic blasts prinz eugen was towed to kwajalein atoll where she ultimately capsized and sank in december 1946 wreck remains partially visible above water approximately two miles northwest of bucholz army airfield on edge of one of her screw propellers was salvaged and is on display at laboe naval memorial in germany design thumb left recognition drawing of an admiral hipper class cruiser of heavy cruisers was ordered in context of german naval rearmament after nazi party came to power in 1933 and repudiated disarmament clauses of treaty of versailles in 1935 germany signed anglo german naval agreement with great britain which provided a legal basis for german naval rearmament treaty specified that germany would be able to build five treaty cruisers admiral hippers were nominally within 10 000 ton limit though they significantly exceeded figure prinz eugen was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of after launching her straight bow was replaced with a clipper bow increasing length overall to new bow kept her foredeck much drier in heavy weather ship had a design displacement of and a full load displacement of prinz eugen was powered by three sets of geared steam turbines which were supplied with steam by twelve ultra high pressure oil fired boilers ship s top speed was at as designed her standard complement consisted of 42 officers and 1 340 enlisted men ship s primary armament was eight sk l 60 guns mounted in four twin turrets placed in superfiring pairs forward and aft her anti aircraft battery consisted of twelve l 65 guns twelve guns and eight guns ship also carried a pair of triple torpedo launchers abreast of rear superstructure for aerial reconnaissance she was equipped with three arado ar 196 seaplanes and one catapult prinz eugens armored belt was thick her upper deck was thick and her main armored deck was thick main battery turrets had thick faces and 70 mm thick sides service history thumb prinz eugens launch prinz eugen was ordered by kriegsmarine from germaniawerft shipyard in kiel her keel was laid on 23 april 1936 under construction number 564 and cover name kreuzer j she was originally to be named after wilhelm von tegetthoff austrian victor of battle of lissa though considerations over possible insult to italy defeated by tegetthoff at lissa led kriegsmarine to adopt prinz eugen as ship s namesake she was launched on 22 august 1938 in a ceremony attended by governor reichsstatthalter of ostmark arthur seyss inquart who made christening speech also present at launch were adolf hitler regent of hungary admiral miklos horthy who had commanded battleship from 24 november 1917 to 1 march 1918 and his wife magdolna purgly who performed christening as built ship had a straight stem though after her launch this was replaced with a clipper bow a raked funnel cap was also installed commissioning was delayed slightly due to light damage sustained during a royal air force attack on kiel on night of 1 july 1940 prinz eugen suffered two relatively light hits in attack but she was not seriously damaged and was commissioned into service on 1 august cruiser spent remainder of 1940 conducting sea trials in baltic sea in early 1941 ship s artillery crews conducted gunnery training a short period in dry dock for final modifications and improvements followed in april ship joined newly commissioned battleship for maneuvers in baltic two ships had been selected for operation rheinubung a breakout into atlantic to raid allied commerce on 23 april while passing through fehmarn belt en route to kiel prinz eugen detonated a magnetic mine dropped by british aircraft mine damaged fuel tank propeller shaft couplings and fire control equipment planned sortie with bismarck was delayed while repairs were carried out admirals erich raeder and gunther lutjens discussed possibility of delaying operation further in hopes that repairs to battleship would be completed or bismarcks sistership would complete trials in time for ships to join prinz eugen and bismarck raeder and lutjens decided that it would be most beneficial to resume surface actions in atlantic as soon as possible however and that two ships should sortie without reinforcement operation rheinubung by 11 may 1941 repairs to prinz eugen had been completed under command of kapitan zur see kzs captain at sea helmuth brinkmann ship steamed to gotenhafen where crew readied her for her atlantic sortie on 18 may prinz eugen rendezvoused with bismarck off cape two ships were escorted by three destroyers and and a flotilla of minesweepers luftwaffe provided air cover during voyage out of german waters at around 13 00 on 20 may german flotilla encountered swedish cruiser cruiser shadowed germans for two hours in kattegat gotland transmitted a report to naval headquarters stating two large ships three destroyers five escort vessels and 10 12 aircraft passed course 205deg 20 oberkommando der marine okm naval high command was not concerned about security risk posed by gotland though lutjens believed operational security had been lost report eventually made its way to captain henry denham british naval attache to sweden who transmitted information to admiralty code breakers at bletchley park confirmed that an atlantic raid was imminent as they had decrypted reports that bismarck and prinz eugen had taken on prize crews and requested additional navigational charts from headquarters a pair of supermarine spitfires were ordered to search norwegian coast for german flotilla on evening of 20 may prinz eugen and rest of flotilla reached norwegian coast minesweepers were detached and two raiders and their destroyer escorts continued north following morning radio intercept officers on board prinz eugen picked up a signal ordering british reconnaissance aircraft to search for two battleships and three destroyers northbound off norwegian coast at 7 00 on 21st germans spotted four unidentified aircraft that quickly departed shortly after 12 00 flotilla reached bergen and anchored at grimstadfjord while there ships crews painted over baltic camouflage with standard outboard gray worn by german warships operating in atlantic while in bergen prinz eugen took on of fuel bismarck inexplicably failed to similarly refuel at 19 30 on 21 may prinz eugen bismarck and three escorting destroyers left port by midnight force was in open sea and headed toward arctic ocean at this time admiral raeder finally informed hitler of operation who reluctantly allowed it to continue as planned three escorting destroyers were detached at 04 14 on 22 may while force steamed off trondheim at around 12 00 lutjens ordered his two ships to turn toward denmark strait to attempt breakout into open waters of atlantic thumb map showing course of prinz eugen and bismarck and ships that pursued them by 04 00 on 23 may lutjens ordered prinz eugen and bismarck to increase speed to to make dash through denmark strait upon entering strait both ships activated their fumo radar detection equipment sets bismarck led prinz eugen by about mist reduced visibility to germans encountered some ice at around 10 00 which necessitated a reduction in speed to two hours later pair had reached a point north of iceland ships were forced to zigzag to avoid ice floes at 19 22 hydrophone and radar operators aboard german warships detected cruiser at a range of approximately prinz eugens radio intercept team decrypted radio signals being sent by suffolk and learned that their location had indeed been reported admiral lutjens gave permission for prinz eugen to engage suffolk though captain of german cruiser could not clearly make out his target and so held fire suffolk quickly retreated to a safe distance and shadowed german ships at 20 30 heavy cruiser joined suffolk but approached german raiders too closely lutjens ordered his ships to engage british cruiser bismarck fired five salvoes three of which straddled norfolk and rained shell splinters on her decks cruiser laid a smoke screen and fled into a fog bank ending brief engagement concussion from 38 cm guns disabled bismarcks fumo 23 radar set this prompted lutjens to order prinz eugen to take station ahead so she could use her functioning radar to scout for formation british cruisers tracked prinz eugen and bismarck through night continually relaying location and bearing of german ships harsh weather broke on morning of 24 may revealing a clear sky at 05 07 that morning hydrophone operators aboard prinz eugen detected a pair of unidentified vessels approaching german formation at a range of reporting noise of two fast moving turbine ships at relative bearing at 05 45 lookouts on german ships spotted smoke on horizon these turned out to be from and under command of vice admiral lancelot holland lutjens ordered his ships crews to battle stations by 05 52 range had fallen to and hood opened fire followed by prince of wales a minute later hood engaged prinz eugen which british thought to be bismarck while prince of wales fired on bismarck british ships approached germans head on which permitted them to use only their forward guns while bismarck and prinz eugen could fire full broadsides several minutes after opening fire holland ordered a 20deg turn to port which would allow his ships to engage with their rear gun turrets both german ships concentrated their fire on hood about a minute after opening fire prinz eugen scored a hit with a high explosive shell detonating unrotated projectile ammunition and starting a large fire on hood which was quickly extinguished holland then ordered a second 20deg turn to port to bring his ships on a parallel course with bismarck and prinz eugen by this time bismarck had found range to hood so lutjens ordered prinz eugen to shift fire and target prince of wales to keep both of his opponents under fire within a few minutes prinz eugen scored a pair of hits on battleship and reported that a small fire had been started lutjens then ordered prinz eugen to drop behind bismarck so she could continue to monitor location of norfolk and suffolk which were still some to east at 06 00 hood was completing her second turn to port when bismarcks fifth salvo hit two of shells landed short striking water close to ship but at least one of 38 cm armor piercing shells struck hood and penetrated her thin upper belt armor shell reached hoods rear ammunition magazine and detonated of cordite propellant massive explosion broke back of ship between main mast and rear funnel forward section continued to move forward briefly before in rushing water caused bow to rise into air at a steep angle stern similarly rose upward as water rushed into ripped open compartments after only eight minutes of firing hood had disappeared taking all but three of her crew of 1 419 men with her after a few more minutes during which prince of wales scored three hits on bismarck damaged british battleship withdrew germans ceased fire as range widened though captain ernst lindemann bismarcks commander strongly advocated chasing prince of wales and destroying her lutjens firmly rejected request and instead ordered bismarck and prinz eugen to head for open waters of north atlantic after end of engagement lutjens reported that a battlecruiser probably hood sunk another battleship king george v or renown turned away damaged two heavy cruisers maintain contact at 08 01 he transmitted a damage report and his intentions to okm which were to detach prinz eugen for commerce raiding and to make for st nazaire for repairs shortly after 10 00 lutjens ordered prinz eugen to fall behind bismarck to discern severity of oil leakage from bow hit after confirming broad streams of oil on both sides of bismarcks wake prinz eugen returned to forward position with weather worsening lutjens attempted to detach prinz eugen at 16 40 squall was not heavy enough to cover her withdrawal from wake walker s cruisers which continued to maintain radar contact prinz eugen was therefore recalled temporarily cruiser was successfully detached at 18 14 bismarck turned around to face wake walker s formation forcing suffolk to turn away at high speed prince of wales fired twelve salvos at bismarck which responded with nine salvos none of which hit action diverted british attention and permitted prinz eugen to slip away on 26 may prinz eugen rendezvoused with supply ship to refill her nearly empty fuel tanks she had by then only 160 tons fuel left enough for a day afterwards ship continued further south on a mission against shipping lines before any merchant ship was found defects in her engines showed and on 27 may day bismarck was sunk she was ordered to give up her mission and make for a port in occupied france on 28 may prinz eugen refuelled from tanker esso hamburg same day more engine problems showed up including trouble with port engine turbine cooling of middle engine and problems with starboard screw reducing her maximum speed to 28 knots screw problems could only be checked and repaired in a dock and thus brest with its large docks and repair facilities was chosen as destination despite many british warships and several convoys in area at least 104 units were identified on 29th by ship s radio crew prinz eugen reached bay of biscay undiscovered and on 1 june ship was joined by german destroyers and aircraft off coast of france south of brest and escorted to brest which she reached late on 1 june where she immediately entered dock operation cerberus and norwegian operations thumb route of prinz eugen scharnhorst and gneisenau during operation cerberus brest is not far from bases in southern england and during their stay in brest prinz eugen and battleships scharnhorst and were repeatedly attacked by allied bombers royal air force jokingly referred to three ships as brest bomb target flotilla and between 1 august and 31 december 1941 it dropped some 1200 tons of bombs on port on night of 1 july 1941 prinz eugen was struck by an armor piercing bomb that destroyed control center deep down under bridge attack killed 60 men and wounded more than 40 others loss of control center also made main guns useless and repairs lasted until end of 1941 continuous air attacks led german command to decide prinz eugen scharnhorst and gneisenau would have to move to safer bases as soon as they were repaired and ready meanwhile bismarck operation had demonstrated risks of operating in atlantic without air cover in addition hitler saw norwegian theater as zone of destiny so he ordered three ships return to germany in early 1942 so they could be deployed there intention was to use ships to interdict allied convoys to soviet union as well as to strengthen defenses of norway hitler insisted they would make voyage via english channel despite raeder s protests that it was too risky vice admiral otto ciliax was given command of operation in early february minesweepers swept a route through channel though british failed to detect activity at 23 00 on 11 february scharnhorst gneisenau and prinz eugen left brest they entered channel an hour later three ships sped at hugging french coast along voyage by 06 30 they had passed cherbourg at which point they were joined by a flotilla of torpedo boats torpedo boats were led by kapitan zur see erich bey aboard destroyer general der jagdflieger general of fighter force adolf galland directed luftwaffe fighter and bomber forces operation donnerkeil during cerberus fighters flew at masthead height to avoid detection by british radar network liaison officers were present on all three ships german aircraft arrived later to jam british radar with chaff by 13 00 ships had cleared strait of dover but half an hour later a flight of six fairey swordfish torpedo bombers with spitfire escort attacked germans british failed to penetrate luftwaffe fighter shield and all six swordfish were destroyed off dover prinz eugen came under fire from british coastal artillery batteries though they scored no hits several motor torpedo boats then attacked ship but prinz eugens destroyer escorts drove vessels off before they could launch their torpedoes at 16 43 prinz eugen encountered five british destroyers and she fired her main battery at them and scored several hits on worcester but she was forced to maneuver erratically to avoid their torpedoes nevertheless prinz eugen arrived in brunsbuttel on morning of 13 february completely undamaged but suffering only casualty in all three big ships killed by aircraft gunfire thumb prinz eugen center under repair in next to her on her starboard side is repair ship huascaran admiral scheer is also moored behind anti torpedo nets on 21 february 1942 prinz eugen heavy cruiser and destroyers and steamed to norway after stopping briefly in grimstadfjord ships proceeded on to trondheim two days later while patrolling off trondheimsfjord british submarine torpedoed prinz eugen torpedo struck ship in stern killing fifty men causing serious damage and rendering ship unmaneuverable however on her own power she managed to reach trondheim and from there was towed to where over next few months emergency repairs were effected her entire stern was cut away and plated over and two jury rigged rudders operated manually by capstans were installed on 16 may prinz eugen made return voyage to germany under her own power while en route to kiel ship was attacked by a british force of 19 bristol blenheim bombers and 27 bristol beaufort torpedo bombers commanded by wing commander mervyn williams though aircraft failed to hit ship prinz eugen was out of service for repairs until october she conducted sea trials beginning on 27 october hans erich voss who later became hitler s naval liaison officer was given command of ship when she returned to service in reference to her originally planned name ship s bell from austrian battleship was presented on 22 november by italian rear admiral de angeles over course of november and december ship was occupied with lengthy trials in baltic in early january 1943 kriegsmarine ordered ship to return to norway to reinforce warships stationed there twice in january prinz eugen attempted to steam to norway with scharnhorst but both attempts were broken off after british surveillance aircraft spotted two ships after it became apparent that it would be impossible to move ship to norway prinz eugen was assigned to fleet training squadron for nine months she cruised baltic training cadets service in baltic as soviet army pushed wehrmacht back on eastern front it became necessary to reactivate prinz eugen as a gunnery support vessel on 1 october 1943 ship was reassigned to combat duty in june 1944 prinz eugen heavy cruiser lutzow and 6th destroyer flotilla formed second task force later renamed task force thiele after its commander vizeadmiral august thiele prinz eugen was at this time under command of kzs hans jurgen reinicke throughout june she steamed in eastern baltic northwest of island of uto as a show of force during german withdrawal from finland on 19 20 august ship steamed into gulf of riga and bombarded tukums four destroyers and two torpedo boats supported action along with prinz eugens ar 196 floatplanes cruiser fired a total of 265 shells from her main battery prinz eugens bombardment was instrumental in successful repulse of soviet attack thumb left prinz eugen underway in early september prinz eugen supported a failed attempt to seize fortress island of ship then returned to gotenhafen before escorting a convoy of ships evacuating german soldiers from finland convoy consisting of six freighters sailed on 15 september from gulf of bothnia with entire second task force escorting it swedish aircraft and destroyers shadowed convoy but did not intervene following month prinz eugen returned to gunfire support duties on 11 and 12 october she fired in support of german troops in memel over first two days ship fired some 700 rounds of ammunition from her main battery she returned on 14th and 15th after having restocked her main battery ammunition to fire another 370 rounds while on return voyage to gotenhafen on 15 october prinz eugen inadvertently rammed light cruiser amidships north of hela cause of collision was heavy fog light cruiser was nearly cut in half and two ships remained wedged together for fourteen hours prinz eugen was taken to gotenhafen where repairs were effected within a month sea trials commenced on 14 november on 20 21 november ship supported german troops on sworbe peninsula by firing around 500 rounds of main battery ammunition four torpedo boats t13 t16 and t21 joined operation prinz eugen then returned to gotenhafen to resupply and have her worn out gun barrels re bored thumb prinz eugen under escort from copenhagen to wilhelmshaven after surrendering cruiser was ready for action by mid january 1945 when she was sent to bombard soviet forces in samland ship fired 871 rounds of ammunition at soviets advancing on german bridgehead at held by xxviii corps which was protecting konigsberg she was supported in this operation by destroyer z25 and torpedo boat at that point prinz eugen had expended her main battery ammunition and critical munition shortages forced ship to remain in port until 10 march when she bombarded soviet forces around gotenhafen danzig and hela during these operations she fired a total of 2 025 shells from her 20 3 cm guns and another 2 446 rounds from her 10 5 cm guns old battleship also provided gunfire support as did lutzow after 25 march ships were commanded by vizeadmiral bernhard rogge following month on 8 april prinz eugen and lutzow steamed to swinemunde on 13 april 34 lancaster bombers attacked two ships while in port thick cloud cover forced british to abort mission and return two days later on second attack they succeeded in sinking lutzow with a single tallboy bomb hit prinz eugen then departed swinemunde for copenhagen arriving on 20 april once there she was decommissioned on 7 may and turned over to royal navy control following day for his leadership of prinz eugen in final year of war reinicke was awarded knight s cross of iron cross on 21 april 1945 during her operational career with kriegsmarine prinz eugen lost 115 crew members 79 men were killed in action 33 were killed in accidents and three died of other causes of these 115 crew members four were officers seven were cadets or ensigns two were petty officers 22 were junior petty officers 78 were sailors and two were civilians service with us navy thumb left uss prinz eugen passing through panama canal in 1946 guns on a turret are missing on 27 may 1945 prinz eugen and light cruiser only major german naval vessels to survive war in serviceable condition were escorted by british cruisers and to wilhelmshaven on 13 december prinz eugen was awarded as a war prize to united states which sent ship to wesermunde united states did not particularly want cruiser but it did want to prevent soviet union from acquiring it her us commander captain arthur h graubart recounted later how british soviet and us representatives in control commission all claimed ship and how in end various large prizes were divided in three lots prinz eugen being one of them three lots were then drawn lottery style from his hat with british and soviet representatives drawing lots for other ships and graubart being left with lot for prinz eugen cruiser was commissioned into us navy as unclassified miscellaneous vessel uss prinz eugen with hull number ix 300 a composite american german crew consisting of 574 german officers and sailors supervised by eight american officers and eighty five enlisted men under command of graubart then took ship to boston departing on 13 january 1946 and arriving on 22 january after arriving in boston ship was extensively examined by us navy her very large ghg passive sonar array was removed and installed on submarine for testing american interest in magnetic amplifier technology increased again after findings in investigations of fire control system of prinz eugen guns from turret anton were removed while in philadelphia in february on 1 may german crewmen left ship and returned to germany thereafter american crew had significant difficulties in keeping ship s propulsion system operational eleven of her twelve boilers failed after germans departed ship was then allocated to fleet of target ships for operation crossroads in bikini atoll operation crossroads was a major test of effects of nuclear weapons on warships of various types trouble with prinz eugens propulsion system may have influenced decision to dispose of her in nuclear tests thumb an aerial photo of wreck of prinz eugen in 2018 she was towed to pacific via philadelphia and panama canal departing on 3 march ship survived two atomic bomb blasts test able an air burst on 1 july 1946 and test baker a submerged detonation on 25 july prinz eugen was moored about from epicenter of both blasts and was only lightly damaged by them able blast only bent her foremast and broke top of her main mast she suffered no significant structural damage from explosions but was thoroughly contaminated with radioactive fallout ship was towed to kwajalein atoll in central pacific where a small leak went unrepaired due to radiation danger on 29 august 1946 us navy decommissioned prinz eugen by late december 1946 ship was in very bad condition on 21 december she began to list severely a salvage team could not be brought to kwajalein in time so us navy attempted to beach ship to prevent her from sinking but on 22 december prinz eugen capsized and sank her main battery gun turrets fell out of their barbettes when ship rolled over ship s stern including her propeller assemblies remains visible above surface of water us government denied salvage rights on grounds that it did not want contaminated steel entering market in august 1979 one of ship s screw propellers was retrieved and placed in laboe naval memorial in germany ship s bell is currently held at national museum of united states navy while bell from tegetthoff is held in graz austria beginning in 1974 us government began to warn about danger of an oil leak from ship s full fuel bunkers government was concerned about risk of a severe typhoon damaging wreck and causing a leak starting in february 2018 us navy including navy s mobile diving and salvage unit one us army and federated states of micronesia conducted a joint oil removal effort with salvage ship which had cut holes into ship s fuel tanks to pump oil from wreck directly into oil tanker humber us navy announced that work had been completed by 15 october 2018 project had extracted approximately of fuel oil which amounted to 97 percent of fuel remaining aboard wreck lieutenant commander tim officer responsible for salvage operation stated that there are no longer active leaks remaining oil is enclosed in a few internal tanks without leakage and encased by layered protection notes notes citations references further reading category admiral hipper class
