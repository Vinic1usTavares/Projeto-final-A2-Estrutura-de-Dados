pop and disco record it draws influences from various dance based genres including electropop hi nrg club and rave music upon its release aphrodite was met with generally positive reviews from music critics many of whom complimented it as a return to form for minogue however critics were divided on its production many felt price s production helped make album cohesive while some felt it made

embarked on successful aphrodite les folies tour in 2011 background and production following her recovery from breast cancer minogue released her tenth studio album x in 2007 slated to be released as minogue s comeback album x went platinum in her native country australia after it debuted at number one on australian albums chart in united kingdom album entered and peaked at number four on uk albums chart and was eventually certified platinum critical reception towards x was generally favourable although many critics felt that it lacked introspection from minogue s side due to its lack of consistency and high amount of filler tracks in retrospect critics argued that album did not serve as a worthy comeback for minogue soon minogue began working on her eleventh studio album aphrodite initial recording sessions began in april 2009 when minogue met with british singer songwriter nerina pallot with whom she readied track better than today its live instrumentation along with fact that x had been burdened by contributions from too many producers prompted minogue s record label parlophone to decide on a more natural and less convoluted production style for aphrodite later sessions with pallot proved to be less successful as her suggested songs were rapidly supplemented with tracks from a wide range of contributors minogue felt her sessions with pallot did not yield any dance pop tracks fearing that she was going down same road doing rounds of all pop dynamos but lacking any cohesive quality she approached her close friend jake shears male lead singer of american pop group scissor sisters for advice shears encouraged her to work with stuart price a grammy award winning british electronic music producer who had collaborated with scissor sisters on their third studio album night work 2010 miles leonard chairman of parlophone enlisted price as executive producer of album he had previously served as executive producer of american recording artist madonna s tenth studio album confessions on a dance floor 2005 and international news agency reuters regarded him as one of most in demand pop producers in an interview with a writer for popjustice price revealed that he got involved in production of aphrodite after he met minogue for a writing session in october 2009 as executive producer price was responsible for shaping album s sound deciding its track listing and mixing songs in order to ensure that they feel like they re part of same album popjustice commented that every song on album has gone through a bit of a stuart price filter so that it doesn t sound like some dickhead sic a r has just aimlessly scooped a load of tracks off a shelf aphrodite marked first time minogue enlisted an executive producer discussing process she said it was just best experience and funnily enough i think it s most cohesive album i ve had since beginning of my career back in pwl days whereby its very nature made it cohesive there s a lot to be said for working with different producers and trying different stuff which has worked really well for me in past but i definitely wanted someone to tie this together as stuart has done so beautifully so that it existed as a real body of work minogue and price subjected songs on aphrodite to a parton test as they knew a song would work if it made sense when sung in style of dolly parton shears also contributed to album while two of pallot s collaborations with minogue were kept additional collaborators on album include scottish disc jockey calvin harris swedish disc jockey sebastian ingrosso and belgian musician pascal gabriel composition billed by her record label parlophone as her comeback album aphrodite is a celebration of minogue s dance floor roots and is primarily a dance pop and disco album its title alludes to greek goddess of love beauty pleasure and procreation all lovers one of last tracks to be recorded for album is a squiggly electropop influenced disco song written by jim eliot and mima stilwell who had previously collaborated with minogue on 2 hearts lead single from x it is similar to minogue s 2004 single i believe in you but has a more danceable edge and features a gauzy heartbeat rhythm and 1980s stylised synthesiser riffs song was met with critical acclaim from music critics and was frequently commended for its production and chorus second track get outta my way combines electronic music and bubblegum pop with disco elements song focuses on a frustrated and furious minogue delivering wispy vocals in a form of a warning to her uncaring partner indicating that she may leave him and start grinding away with another chap its lyrical content is suggestive in nature song received generally favourable reviews from music critics and was complimented for its musical composition and subject matter put your hands up if you feel love is a hi nrg influenced club song receiving mixed critical reviews its lyrics were criticised for being cliched although one critic named it a concert hit waiting to happen closer takes a darker and more atmospheric approach featuring sighing background vocals and spiralling harpsichord esque synths critics felt that it was one of more interesting and experimental songs of album although price said that no ballads were included in album critics opined that downtempo pop song everything is beautiful was penned like one aphrodite title track of album is a nineties influenced dance pop song which features a foot stomping beat and military drummed instrumentation similar to that of a marching band stuart price likened song to janet jackson for its rhythm nation esque qualities song one of minogue s two collaborations with pallot that were kept on track list is penned like a dance anthem through which minogue brags about her sexual prowess it was met with critical acclaim by most music critics and was declared to be one of strongest tracks on album minogue wrote melancholic seventh track illusion with price better than today first track to be recorded for album and second collaboration with pallot is a breezy summertime pop song with influences of electropop and country music it was complimented as likeable and a stand out but criticised for its monotony rave music acts as a significant influence on too much a disco and synth pop track written by minogue jake shears and calvin harris critics were divided on track with its energy being praised but harris production being disapproved of dance rock song cupid boy finds inspiration from english alternative rock band new order and features minogue delivering lusty vocals over a retro bass line its intro new order influenced bass line and rock guitar instrumentation positively surprised critics looking for an angel one of first songs minogue and price wrote together is composed of celestial synth strings and contains an extended breakdown price s production of song received mixed opinions from critic set closes with electropop
