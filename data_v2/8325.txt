new urban freeways that were currently in regional transportation plan at time this included unbuilt or partially unbuilt sky harbor expressway i 10 route 51 route 143 loop 101 and loop 202 most of these were completed by 2005 with loop 202 being in final stage of construction in 1994 voters in maricopa county voted against proposition 400 which would have extended half cent sales tax extension from 2006 through 2016 had it been passed half of this additional funding would have been used for improvements in mass transit as well as new freeways but because of defeat there was no funding beyond fiscal year 2006 regardless of if regional transportation plan was completed or not in 1996 maricopa association of governments regional council passed a series of bills provided funding for a long range plan between fiscal years 2007 and 2015 red mountain freeway santan freeway and sky harbor expressway segments all of which were previously unfunded became prioritized with construction commencing almost immediately in 1999 even more funding was given to accelerate construction of regional transportation plan by state legislature which passed a bill called 2007 acceleration plan this bill forced state infrastructure bank to assist in funds which assisted in pushing completion of regional transportation plan forward to end of 2007 with transportation tax set to expire in 2006 a revived proposition 400 was put before voters of maricopa county in 2004 ten years after original vote ended in failure proposing an identical half cent extension of sales tax new proposition would extend tax a full twenty years as opposed to original ten unlike its predecessor proposition passed by a wide 58 42 margin and established funding for several future projects including highways and mass transit a similar but much more wide reaching proposal to enact a full one cent sales tax increase over a thirty year period on a statewide level much of which would have gone to funding phoenix area projects failed to qualify for 2008 general election ballot due to issues with petition however 1985 plan was not fully completed by 2007 due to lingering unfinished segment of loop 202 between

signs along inbound freeway routes during morning peak hours and outbound routes in evening initially these signs were only activated on weekdays during peak travel hours 6am to 9am and 3pm to 7pm and did not appear if there is a more urgent message to display such as an amber alert or other emergency in late july 2015 hours when travel times were displayed were extended travel times are now
