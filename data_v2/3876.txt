industrial dispute in united kingdom involving royal mail and members of communication workers union cwu which began in summer of 2009 it was country s first industrial action involving postal workers since 2007 and came about after communication workers union accused royal mail of refusing to enter into dialogue regarding how implementation of modernisation plans would affect job security of postal workers strike action began on a local level after postal workers at royal mail offices in london and edinburgh accused their bosses of cutting jobs and services which they claimed broke 2007 pay and modernisation agreement agreement that was struck to end 2007 strikes and accused royal mail of threatening modernisation of service after a series of localised walkouts over summer months and after failing to reach an agreement cwu opened a national ballot for industrial action in september 2009 on 8 october it was announced that postal workers had voted three to one in favour of taking strike action over job security and working conditions it was later announced that a national strike would be held on thursday 22 october and friday 23 october after further talks failed more strikes were announced to take place on thursday 29 october friday 30 october and saturday 31 october discussions continued throughout second wave of strikes with proposals being put to both sides but these were overshadowed by announcement of a third walkout on friday 6 november and monday 9 november however on 5 november it was announced that strikes had been called off until new year to allow time for fresh talks to take place a resolution to dispute was finally reached following lengthy discussions on 8 march 2010 and on 27 april it was reported that postal workers voted to accept deal background central to 2009 dispute was agreement that ended 2007 round of strikes 2007 pay and modernisation agreement saw parties involved agree to a four phase plan which would be implemented with dialogue between both sides at each stage of process however communication workers union said that although royal mail had carried out three of phases in this way it had refused to discuss final phase which concerned government s plans for modernisation and how these would affect job security of royal mail employees one of key aspects of royal mail s modernisation drive involved introduction of walk sequencing machine that organises mail into order postman will deliver them on his round union feared that a national introduction of this equipment would lead to thousands of full time workers being made redundant and a significant increase in number of part time staff communication workers union argued that although it had signed up to this part of agreement in 2007 and that plans would make it necessary for some jobs to be lost it had not understood exact nature of royal mail s plan furthermore union said that when royal mail stopped talking to staff about long term effects of job security there had been no choice other than to threaten a strike to restart discussions royal mail on other hand said that it had not stopped talking to union and continued to involve it in its modernisation strategy localised strike action localised strike action began in june 2009 when workers at royal mail offices in london and edinburgh staged a 24 hour strike on 19 june over concerns about impact that modernisation would have on postal workers this was followed next day by a similar walkout in parts of scotland speaking about situation at time dave ward cwu s deputy general secretary said we are now seeing cuts but not modernisation in postal industry and there s only so long before this is going have a major impact on services cwu does not and has not blocked change once again we are seeing royal mail working against union and failing to engage workforce ward also said that his union would offer royal mail and government a three month no strike deal if royal mail fulfilled its part of 2007 agreement however talks between communication workers union and royal mail failed to broker a deal cwu criticised royal mail s business policy as chaos management and in august and september localised strike intensified by september it was estimated that there was a backlog of 20 million undelivered letters on 10 september cwu announced plans to hold a national ballot on strike action results of which were expected to be announced on 30 september during labour party conference royal mail responded to announcement by saying that decision to go ahead with ballot was wholly irresponsible as talks were still ongoing strike ballot and national action ballot papers proposing a national strike were sent out to union members on 17 september on 8 october it was announced that postal workers had voted three to one in favour of taking strike action over job security and working conditions first round of strikes were later scheduled for thursday 22 october and friday 23 october these would consist of two 24 hour stoppages with mail centre staff and drivers striking on 22 october and delivery and collection staff doing likewise following day talks between royal mail and cwu continued but relations were strained by emergence of a leaked document suggesting that royal mail would achieve its reforms with or without union engagement cwu general secretary billy hayes called document s contents an organised attempt to sideline union and expressed his concern that business secretary peter mandelson appeared to be familiar with it furthermore following first round of strikes it emerged that both sides had been tantalisingly close to brokering a deal on evening of 20 october but that royal mail had backed away from this following morning consequently strikes went ahead as planned new talks were announced on 24 october which would be brokered by tuc and chaired by its general secretary brendan barber peter mandelson welcomed talks describing them as an opportunity to break deadlock further strikes were also announced for last three days of october which would involve mail centre staff on 29 and 30 october and delivery staff on 31 october three days of negotiations aimed at ending dispute began on 26 october but although they were described by barber as having been useful they ended without agreement and second wave of strikes went ahead royal mail later blamed a hard core element of london postal union leaders for refusing to endorse a proposal that both sides had agreed to discussions were held during second wave of strikes when brendan barber announced on afternoon of friday 30 october that proposals had been put to both royal mail and cwu for them to consider over weekend talks resumed on monday however this news was overshadowed by announcement that a further two days of strikes would be held on friday 6 november and monday 9 november it was also announced that these would be all out strikes with everybody walking out at same time rather than rolling strike action that had been adopted previously thus leading to a complete stoppage throughout course of action these were later called off in order for further talks to take place effects strike action led to a backlog of tens of millions of items of undelivered mail with an estimated 30 million letters and parcels affected after first wave of walkouts and rising to in excess of 50 million following second businesses in london were forced to lay off staff or defer paying them generally because they were unable to dispatch goods or couldn t receive payment for them however strikes had less of an impact outside capital on tuesday 3 november a yougov poll conducted for daily telegraph appeared to show that public support for industrial action had dropped in comparison to a similar poll conducted two weeks earlier however richard o hagan of daily mail argued that there was little support for strikes due to economic climate of britain at time it was also reported that cwu had started a fighting fund to help support postal workers who were experiencing financial difficulties as a result of strike postmen lose a day s pay for each day they strike and although most workers had lost just two days pay so far many in london area who had taken part in previous industrial action earlier in year had lost as much as 18 days of wages there was also speculation that cwu lacked funds for a lengthy dispute and donations to union s fighting fund were pledged by other unions including unison and unite suspension of strike action on 5 november eve of first planned all out strike it was announced that strike action had been called off until at least new year to allow for what brendan barber described as a period of calm in which both royal mail and cwu could reach a long term agreement but he added that although postal service would be free from disruption over christmas period a long term deal was still some distance away cwu also announced on same day that it would not press ahead with a legal challenge to royal mail s employment of temporary workers to clear backlog which had been due to begin at high court following day resolution following lengthy discussions between royal mail managers and union representatives a deal to settle dispute was finally agreed to on 8 march 2010 this would see royal mail workers receiving a 6 9 pay rise over three years worth 2 in 2010 1 4 in 2011 and 3 5 in 2012 while extra payments worth up to ps1 400 would be made to full time workers once all agreed changes have been made these will take form of a ps400 payment following agreement of union members and a further ps1 000 to be paid once planned changes have been implemented in addition royal mail agreed to keep 75 of workforce as full time rather than part time staff and to reduce working hours from 40 to 39 hours a week in exchange cwu agreed to royal mail s modernisation strategy which include plans to introduce automated walk sequencing machinery welcoming deal deputy general secretary of communication workers union dave ward said it s been a long time coming but this deal delivers on major issues that postal workers have fought for there s a balance of pay and operational changes that will help to offset job losses and ensure our members are fairly rewarded for change royal mail s outgoing chief executive adam crozier said that resolution was a good deal for our customers as it ensures stability over next three years and allowed royal mail to proceed with modernisation on 27 april communication workers union announced that its members had voted two to one in favour of deal thus ending dispute see also 1971 united kingdom postal workers strike 1988 united kingdom postal workers strike 2007 royal mail
