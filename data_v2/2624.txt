2 congress shall have power to enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation has received public attention for several years jackson feels that his amendment is a natural response to san antonio independent school district v rodriguez which determined that an education is not a constitutionally protected fundamental right an important theme of book is north south relationship as it influences extent of federalism in united states book describes how from before civil war to well after civil rights movement balance of power between protectors of state s rights and defenders of federal government have battled over resources and power along north south alliances jackson is a detractor of state s rights and feels that extensive power given to states has slowed our broad distribution of social goods by perpetuating inequality and thus unrest dyson also notes that jackson attempts to bring class to forefront of discourse in an effort to offer a political vision toward social equity and equality he says jackson views race as lens to optimally view american history and views economic issues as hearing aid through which politics of today can best be heard reviews in a review for chicago sun times michael eric dyson described book as intellectually accomplished and remarkably insightful he views jackson s eight new amendments as political backbone and intellectual infrastructure for expression of a new politics of race and class that strengthen status of all suffering americans he encourages understanding book because it provides a fresh social perspective to addresses current fundamental american political and racial problems writing for chicago tribune playboy editor john thomas described amendments as sensible but pointed out that some view them as an attempt to legislate policy decisions thomas perceived benefit of plan to be fact that force of constitution would uphold amendments and that this would compel actions to support both political promises and constitutional tenets at one stop on book tour associated with publication and release of book at david a clarke school of law of university of district of columbia jackson s message was perceived as saying that american history can be studied as an analysis of race but that economics and tension between states rights and federal rights are true basis of a domestic history revolving around pursuit of economic development political power and personal freedom he then advanced theory that these pursuits would most be most readily attained by adopting a set of new constitutional amendments guaranteeing rights primarily grounded in universal declaration of human rights which u s has ratified each is discussed in a separate chapter rights to quality health care housing education a clean environment fair taxes full employment equality for women and right to vote related issues during promotion of book there was a controversy when a book signing party in illinois morphed into a fundraiser without jackson s knowledge when jackson realized what happened he wrote to federal election commission and house ethics committee to explain what happened and seek their advice jackson decided to return entire 1300 that was raised an outgrowth of jackson s trip was realization that national park service does not represent underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations instead of presenting battles as political and moral issues jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way as a result in 2000 he united states department of interior s appropriation to include a directive to have united states secretary of interior bruce babbitt use his influence over superintendents of national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in civil war presentations see also second bill of rights notes references jackson jesse l jr with frank e watkins a more
