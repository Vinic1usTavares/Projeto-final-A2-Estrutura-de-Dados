action of 6 november 1794 known in french as combat du 16 brumaire an iii was a naval engagement during french revolutionary wars two british ships of line hms alexander and hms canada were intercepted while returning to britain through celtic sea by a large french squadron french squadron had sailed from brest in search of an inward bound british convoy in october but instead encountered two british ships returning from escorting an outward bound convoy there had been no warning of french approach as british force assigned to watch brest was absent at plymouth due to policy of operating a distant blockade british ships separated and attempted to escape but french commander contre amiral joseph marie nielly simply split his forces in response and although canada was eventually able to outrun pursuit alexander was slower and was caught by several french ships in succession first two opponents were driven off but third succeeded in coming alongside and in a fierce and close fought duel compelled captain richard rodney bligh to surrender his ship in face of overwhelming odds battle was a rare french victory lying between significant british victories at glorious first of june and battle of groix in royal navy campaign against french fleet at brest background in february 1793 following years of rising tension french republic that had emerged from french revolution declared war on kingdom of great britain woodman p 2 for royal navy one of most immediate concerns was to contain french atlantic fleet based in massively fortified harbour at brest in brittany this port was ideally positioned to disrupt merchant shipping convoys that passed through celtic sea and bay of biscay en route to britain from all over world and it was therefore imperative that french fleet was not permitted to put to sea without being challenged for french brest was a vital port for receipt of grain supplies from americas and so french fleets regularly sailed on missions to escort these convoys into harbour and to disrupt british convoys entering english channel woodman p p 27 in may 1794 a large french fleet put to sea to ensure safety of an american grain convoy and was intercepted far out in atlantic at glorious first of june by british channel fleet most powerful of royal navy s fleets and force assigned to restrict french movements from brest french suffered a serious defeat losing seven ships but managed to retire in good order and saved grain convoy gardiner p 39 later in june 1794 british fleet again put to sea but was caught in a storm and many ships were badly damaged its commander lord howe retired with his fleet to anchorage in torbay and thus there was no british fleet at sea in late october when a powerful french squadron sailed from brest with intention of attacking a large merchant convoy sailing from lisbon to britain force under command of contre amiral joseph marie nielly consisted of 74 gun ships of line marat tigre droits de l homme pelletier and jean bart with frigates charente fraternite and corvette papillon james p 183 in addition to lisbon convoy a number of other vulnerable british targets were in region including a second convoy from mediterranean sea under rear admiral philip cosby en route to britain and first rate hms victory which was sailing independently with lord hood on board tracy p 114 nielly had information concerning these movements and was cruising in a pattern that was intended to cover western approaches to english channel french force cruised in celtic sea for several days until on 6 november at 02 30 two unidentified ships were spotted on northeastern horizon these vessels were british 74 gun ships of line hms alexander under captain richard rodney bligh and hms canada under captain charles powell hamilton returning northeastwards to rejoin channel fleet after escorting a lisbon and mediterranean bound convoy to a safe latitude clowes p 241 chase on sighting french force british captains first sought to establish identity of strange ships shortening sail and tacking to port so that they could close with squadron at 04 00 they were about away ordering their crews to set more sail ready to attempt to escape should squadron be revealed to be french at 05 00 lookouts on british ships discovered that squadron which had favourable wind was approaching fast and this convinced bligh and hamilton that unidentified ships were hostile bligh ordered hamilton to separate in hope that he could escape without slower alexander hamilton adjusting his course to a more northerly direction nielly had deliberately sought to disguise his squadron s nationality in an effort to lure british close enough that he could catch and overwhelm them trap springing successfully as three ships of line pursued alexander while two ships of line including nielly s flagship and two frigates followed canada to continue deception nielly ordered his ships to raise union flag at 07 30 to which british ships replied at 08 15 by raising their own having shifted their direction of flight to eastwards to make better use of available wind raising of british flags on alexander and canada was a clear indicator to nielly that british were aware of his identity and he instead ordered his squadron to hoist french tricolour finally abandoning ruse that his ships were british during preceding three hours division of french squadron in pursuit of alexander had steadily closed gap between ships alexander responding by firing stern chasers at pursuers french ships responded by firing their bow chasers at british vessel at 09 00 canada too came in range nielly ordering his flagship marat to fire on hamilton s ship shot flying over vessel and harmlessly into sea hamilton responded with fire from his own stern chasers and bligh issued signals for alexander and canada to form a line canada in lead so that british vessels might mutually support one another james p 184 nielly recognised bligh s intentions as soon as canada began to move however and interposed his division so that they blocked hamilton s manoeuvre both ships of division now firing on hamilton s ship bligh was thus isolated alexander falling further behind canada at 11 00 french ship jean bart was able to draw close enough to alexander to discharge its main broadside at british vessel two ships engaging in a fierce duel for 30 minutes both suffering damage at 11 30 jean bart sheered away from engagement assisted by a french frigate and its place was taken by next french ship in line tigre tigre could not pull directly alongside bligh s ship but was still able to attack british ship with heavy fire receiving a battering in turn that shot away french ship s main and topmasts and inflicted severe damage to its rigging tigre too turned away at about 12 00 and was again replaced by third ship in french line marat which pulled alongside and battered already damaged alexander for an hour taking damage in its turn at 13 00 with his rigging and sails tattered his masts shot through hull shattered and several fires raging on board bligh surrendered alexander in face of overwhelming french odds as nielly s division pulled within range and began to fire on his ship hamilton in canada had been able to pull ahead of nielly and escape most of french shot flying over british ship so ineffectual had been attack on canada that hamilton reported no damage or casualties at all aftermath consolidating his battered prize nielly ordered his squadron to return to brest without waiting for british convoys that had been his intended targets unknown to french both lisbon and mediterranean convoys were less than away from action alexander was in a sinking condition and it was only with difficulty that ship was brought back to port afloat captured crew were distributed among french squadron and as a result bligh was unable to make a full casualty list he later estimated losses of approximately 40 men killed or wounded aboard alexander although french accounts give 28 killed and 30 wounded british histories reported french casualties in engagement as enormous figure of 450 men killed and wounded although as french historian charles rouvier noted in 1868 this is an absurdly inflated total rouvier gave french losses as 10 wounded all on marat rouvier p 187 bligh was returned to brest in custody of captain jean francois renaudin who had commanded ship vengeur du peuple at glorious first of june until his ship was sunk bligh who had unknown to him been promoted to rear admiral whilst at sea later commended renaudin for his conduct while bligh was a prisoner and wrote to admiralty that he had been treated with great kindness and humanity however historian edward pelham brenton reported in 1825 that at brest bligh was exchanged shortly after action and returned to britain on 27 may 1795 he sat before a court martial standard practice when a royal navy ship was lost in action and was honourably acquitted of blame in loss of alexander clowes p 242 in france national convention commended nielly on his victory and captured ship was repaired and taken into french navy joining atlantic fleet it was however a poor sailor and in june 1795 was with french fleet that participated in cornwallis s retreat and battle of groix at latter action alexandre was overrun by british fleet and recaptured rejoining royal navy gardiner p 49 historical assessment of capture of alexander has been summed up by historian robert gardiner who wrote in 1996 that capture of a british 74 was a rare event during these wars only five were lost however one sided nature of conflict was not apparent in 1794 and what has been called royal navy s habit of victory was not yet established gardiner p 44 references bibliography category naval battles involving france category naval battles involving great britain category conflicts in 1794 category naval
