broe helmet also known as helmet is a decorated iron helmet from around vendel period discovered around 1904 in a cremation grave in broe a farm on swedish island gotland it was located alongside other items including fragments of shields weapons bridles and game pieces due to its extremely fragmented condition only an incomplete reconstruction of helmet is possible but it appears to have been an example of crested helmets that flourished in england and scandinavia from sixth through eleventh centuries a full speculative reconstruction was attempted in 1969 suggesting a cap made in segments with brow and nose to nape bands pieces of metal attached to brow band likely provided neck cheek and face protection nose to nape band was decorated with ornamental bronze sheeting and an eyebrow piece which survives in full and also featured animal head terminals was inlaid with strips of a material such as silver this appearance is generally consistent with contemporaneous vendel xiv helmet which broe example may have looked somewhat similar to helmet is hard to date by itself but style and type of grave goods suggests a date in second half of 7th century ad this is consistent with vendel xiv grave which is variously dated between 520 and 625 ad and shares similarities with broe grave even beyond helmets in particular decorated iron fragments from graves share an identical design description thumb alt colour photograph of vendel xiv helmet broe helmet shares similarities with vendel xiv helmet broe helmet survives in a fragmentary state with a speculative artistic reconstruction when whole it included an iron cap likely constructed in sections with both a brow band and a nose to nape band latter band to which may belong a fragment with traces of ornamental bronze sheeting terminated above eyebrows with an animal head its eyes formed with inlaid garnets a fragment of nose to nape band retains an animal head impression that does not match surviving head suggesting that a second animal head terminal adorned rear of helmet strips of iron hanging from brow band provided neck and cheek protection one surviving cheek piece is fragmentary but appears to have extended deeply further strips extended from nose to nape band to cover nose and encircled eyes to protect face over eyes ran an ornamental eyebrow piece made of iron inlaid with thin strips of another material possibly silver and terminating in an animal head on either side helmet may once have appeared similar in some respects to vendel xiv helmet both had deep hinged plates protecting cheeks and neck a flat crest terminating in animal heads and ornamented eyebrows broe example is too fragmentary however for its exact design to be determined discovery thumb left alt colour photograph of shield fittings from broe grave shield fittings from broe grave helmet was discovered around 1904 in a grave in broe a farm in community of located within halla in central region of swedish island gotland grave was uncovered while digging a garden excavation measured approximately a foot in depth and half a about 154 square metres in area all but one object a round bronze clasp with three animal heads was damaged by fire in addition to clasp with three animal heads bronze objects from grave included an inlaid round clasp two ring shaped items with animal head decoration parts of handle to a ring sword seven large hemispherical rivet heads four smaller rivets and around 35 types of fragmentary strap fittings several with animal ornamentation two of these were iron with bronze ornamentation and five were hat shaped several of fittings and perhaps ring shaped items belonged to shield handles iron objects included three two edged swords two wide and four slim one edged swords eight spearheads four shield bosses several shield handles four bridles a knife a pair of scissors and several fittings including some for edges of shields in addition to helmet non metal objects from grave included pieces of a green glass cup mostly melted away seven fragments of bone game pieces and some burnt pieces of bone possibly from a horse items were acquired by statens historiska museum in 1904 where they were collectively given inventory number 12 291 in 1907 finds were published along with sketched illustrations of some of items in a monthly publication of royal swedish academy of letters history and antiquities illustrations of a number of finds including a speculative reconstruction of helmet were published in volume ii of birger s book on vendel period finds from gotland die followed six years later by volume i textual companion typology difficult to date by itself broe helmet and finds from same site appear characteristic of early migration period style certain features of broe helmet particularly its eyebrow piece are similar to helmets and fragments found in gotland such as helmet fragment and on mainland in uppland in particular broe helmet s similarities to vendel xiv helmet which has been variously dated from 520 to 625 ad may suggest a comparable date ornamented iron fragments in each burial unrelated to helmets even bear same stamped design other objects from broe grave likewise suggest a date in second half of 6th century ad broe helmet fits into corpus of crested helmets known in northern europe from 6th through 11th centuries ad such helmets were characterized by a rounded cap and usually a prominent nose to nape crest other than a viking age fragment found in kiev they uniformly originate from england or scandinavia more than half of known examples are from sweden up to twenty are from gotland alone although these were typically found in cremation burials and comprise only a fragment or two gallery notes references
