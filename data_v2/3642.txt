schwartz lilith s cave p 15 in common with vampires this version of lilith was held to be able to transform herself into an animal usually a cat and charm her victims into believing that she is benevolent or irresistible however she and her daughters usually strangle rather than drain victims and in kabbalah she retains many attributes found in vampires a late 17th or early 18th century kabbalah document was found in one of ritman library s copies of jean de pauly s translation of zohar text contains two amulets one for male other for female invocations on amulets mention adam eve

newburgh recorded accounts of revenants though records in english legends of vampiric beings after this date are scant jones vampire p 121 these tales are similar to later folklore widely reported from southeastern europe and transylvania in 18th century which were basis of vampire legend that later entered germany and england where they were subsequently embellished and popularised during this time in 18th century there was a frenzy of vampire sightings in southeastern europe and transylvania with frequent and grave diggings taking place to identify and kill potential revenants even government officials were compelled into hunting and staking of vampires despite being called age of enlightenment during which most folkloric legends were quelled belief in vampires increased dramatically resulting in what could only be called a mass hysteria throughout most of europe panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in east prussia in 1721 and in habsburg monarchy from 1725 to 1734 which spread to other localities two famous vampire cases which were first to be officially recorded involved corpses of petar blagojevich and arnold paole from serbia blagojevich was reported to have died at age of 62 but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food when son refused he was found dead following day blagojevich soon supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood barber vampires burial and death pp 5 9 in second case arnold paole an ex soldier turned farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before died while haying after his death people began to die in surrounding area and it was widely believed that paole had returned to prey on neighbours two incidents were well documented government officials examined bodies wrote case reports and published books throughout europe barber vampires burial and death pp 15 21 hysteria which is commonly referred to as 18th century vampire controversy raged for a generation problem was exacerbated by rural epidemics of so claimed vampire attacks undoubtedly caused by higher amount of superstition that was present in village communities with locals digging up bodies and in some cases staking them although many scholars reported during this period that vampires did not exist and attributed reports to premature burial or rabies superstitious belief continued to increase dom augustine calmet a well respected french theologian and scholar put together a comprehensive treatise in 1746 which was ambiguous concerning existence of vampires calmet amassed reports of vampire incidents numerous readers including both a critical voltaire and supportive interpreted treatise as claiming that vampires existed in his philosophical dictionary voltaire wrote controversy only ceased when empress maria theresa of austria sent her personal physician gerhard van to investigate claims of vampiric entities he concluded that vampires did not exist and empress passed laws prohibiting opening of graves and desecration of bodies sounding end of vampire epidemics despite this condemnation vampire lived on in artistic works and in local superstition albania there are some vampire creatures in albanian mythology they include shtriga and dhampir shtriga is a vampiric witch in traditional albanian folklore that sucks blood of infants at night while they sleep and then turns into a flying insect traditionally a moth fly or bee only shtriga herself could cure those she had drained shtriga is often pictured as a woman with a hateful stare sometimes wearing a cape and a horribly disfigured face male noun for shtriga is or edith durham recorded several methods traditionally considered effective for defending oneself from shtriga a cross made of pig bone could be placed at entrance of a church on easter sunday rendering any shtriga inside unable to leave they could then be captured and killed at threshold as they vainly attempted to pass she further recorded story that after draining blood from a victim shtriga would generally go off into woods and regurgitate it if a silver coin were to be soaked in that blood and wrapped in cloth it would become an amulet offering permanent protection from any shtriga durham edith high albania london phoenix press 2000 pp 87 88 greece bearing little resemblance to its ancient greek precursors modern greek vrykolakas from a slavic word meaning werewolf has much in common with european vampire belief in vampires commonly called vrykolakas though also referred to as katakhanades katakhanades on crete persisted throughout greek history and became so widespread in 18th and 19th centuries that many practices were enforced to both prevent and combat vampirism deceased were often exhumed from their graves after three years of death and remains placed in a box by relatives wine was poured over them while a priest would read from scriptures however if body had not sufficiently decayed corpse would be labeled a vrykolakas and dealt with appropriately summers modern greece in vampire in europe in greek folklore vampirism could occur through various means being excommunicated desecrating a religious day committing a great crime or dying alone other causes included having a cat jump across one s grave eating meat from a sheep killed by a wolf and being cursed vrykolakas were usually thought to be indistinguishable from living people giving rise to many folk tales with this theme crosses and blessed bread from church were used as wards in different places to prevent vampires from rising from dead their hearts were pierced with iron nails while resting in their graves or their bodies burned and ashes scattered because church opposed burning people who had received myron of chrismation in baptism ritual cremation was considered a last resort hungary in hungary belief in vampires has existed since middle ages and bloodthirsty creatures are mentioned all over inquisition s
