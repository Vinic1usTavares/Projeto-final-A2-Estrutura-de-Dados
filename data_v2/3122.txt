gliese 581c or gl 581c is a planet orbiting within gliese 581 system it is second planet discovered in system and third in order from star with a mass at least 5 5 times that of earth it is classified as a super earth a category of planets with masses greater than earth s up to 10 earth masses gliese 581c gained interest from astronomers because it was reported to be first potentially earth like planet in habitable zone of its star with a temperature right for liquid water on its surface and by extension potentially capable of supporting extremophile forms of earth like life however further research casts doubt upon planet s habitability it is tidally locked always presents same face to its primary so if life had a chance to emerge best hope of survival would be in terminator zone in astronomical terms gliese 581 system is relatively close to earth at 20 37 light years 192 trillion km or 119 trillion miles in direction of constellation of libra this distance along with declination and right ascension coordinates give its exact location in our galaxy discovery team released a paper of their findings dated 27 april 2007 published in july 2007 journal astronomy and astrophysics at time of discovery it was reported to be first potentially earth like planet in habitable zone of its star and smallest known extrasolar planet around a main sequence star but on 21 april 2009 another planet orbiting gliese 581 gliese with an approximate mass of 1 9 earth masses was announced in paper they also announced discovery of another planet in system gliese with a minimum mass of 7 7 earth masses and a semi major axis of 0 25 astronomical units physical characteristics mass existence of gliese 581c and its mass have been measured by radial velocity method of detecting extrasolar planets mass of a planet is calculated by small periodic movements around a common centre of mass between host star gliese 581 and its planets when all six planets are fitted with a keplerian solution minimum mass of planet is determined to be 5 5 earth masses radial velocity method cannot by itself determine true mass but it cannot be very much larger than this or system would be dynamically unstable dynamical simulations of gliese 581 system which assume orbits of planets are coplanar indicate that planets cannot exceed approximately 1 6 to 2 times their minimum masses or planetary system would be unstable this is primarily due to interaction between planets e and b for gliese 581c upper bound is 10 4 earth masses radius since gliese 581c has not been detected in transit there are no measurements of its radius furthermore radial velocity method used to detect it only puts a lower limit on planet s mass which means theoretical models of planetary radius and structure can only be of limited use however assuming a random orientation of planet s orbit true mass is likely to be close to measured minimum mass assuming that true mass is minimum mass radius may be calculated using various models for example if gliese 581c is a rocky planet with a large iron core it should have a radius approximately 50 larger than that of earth according to udry s team gravity on such a planet s surface would be approximately 2 24 times as strong as on earth however if gliese 581c is an icy and or watery planet its radius would be less than 2 times that of earth even with a very large outer hydrosphere according to density models compiled by diana valencia and her team for gliese 876 d gravity on surface of such an icy and or watery planet would be at least 1 25 times as strong as on earth they claim real value of radius may be anything between two extremes calculated by density models outlined above other scientists views differ sara seager at mit has speculated that gliese 581c and other five earth mass planets could be rock giants mostly of silicate cannonball planets of solid iron gas dwarfs mostly of helium and hydrogen carbon rich diamond worlds purely hot ice vii worlds purely carbon monoxide worlds if planet transits star as seen from our direction radius should be measurable albeit with some uncertainty unfortunately measurements made with canadian built most space telescope indicate that transits do not occur new research suggests that rocky centres of super earths are unlikely to evolve into terrestrial rocky planets like inner planets of our solar system because they appear to hold on to their large atmospheres rather than evolving to a planet composed mainly of rock with a thin atmosphere small rocky core remains engulfed by its large hydrogen rich envelope orbit thumb 250px orbits of gliese 581 system as per 2009 analysis excluding planets g and f in picture gliese 581c is third planet from star gliese 581c has an orbital period year of 13 earth days and its orbital radius is only about 7 that of earth about 11 million km while earth is 150 million kilometres from sun since host star is smaller and colder than sun and thus less luminous this distance places planet on warm edge of habitable zone around star according to udry s team note that in astrophysics habitable zone is defined as range of distances from star at which a planet could support liquid water on its surface it should not be taken to mean that planet s environment would be suitable for humans a situation which requires a more restrictive range of parameters a typical radius for an m0 star of gliese 581 s age and metallicity is 0 au against sun s 0 au this proximity means that primary star should appear 3 75 times wider and 14 times larger in area for an observer on planet s surface looking at sky than sun appears to be from earth s surface tidal lock because of its small separation from gliese 581 planet has been generally considered to always have one hemisphere facing star only day and other always facing away only night or in other words being tidally locked selsis 2 4 1 becomes tidally locked in less than 1 gyr most recent orbital fit to system taking stellar activity into account indicates a circular orbit but older fits use an eccentricity between 0 10 and 0 22 if orbit of planet were eccentric it would undergo violent tidal flexing because tidal forces are stronger when planet is close to star eccentric planets are expected to have a rotation period which is shorter than its orbital period also called pseudo synchronization an example of this effect is seen in mercury which is tidally locked in a 3 2 resonance completing three rotations every two orbits in any case even in case of 1 1 tidal lock planet would undergo libration and terminator would be alternatively lit and darkened during libration models of evolution of planet s orbit over time suggest that heating resulting from this tidal locking may play a major role in planet s geology models proposed by scientists predict that tidal heating could yield a surface heat flux about three times greater than that of jupiter s moon io which could result in major geological activity such as volcanoes and plate tectonics habitability and climate study of gliese 581c by von et al team has been quoted as concluding super earth gl 581c is clearly outside habitable zone since it is too close to star study by selsis et al claims even a planet in habitable zone is not necessarily habitable itself and this planet is outside what can be considered conservative habitable zone of parent star and further that if there was any water there then it was lost when red dwarf was a strong x ray and euv emitter it could have surface temperatures ranging from 700 k to 1000 k 430 to 730 degc like venus today temperature speculations by other scientists were based on temperature of and heat from parent star gliese 581 and have been calculated without factoring in margin of error 96 degc k for star s temperature of 3432 k to 3528 k which leads to a large irradiance range for planet even before eccentricity is considered effective temperatures using measured stellar luminosity of gliese 581 is of 0 013 times that of our sun it is possible to calculate gliese 581c s effective temperature a k a black body temperature note this probably differs from its surface temperature according to udry s team effective temperature for gliese 581c assuming an albedo reflectivity such as venus 0 64 would be and assuming an earth like albedo 0 296 then it would be a range of temperatures which overlaps with range that water would be liquid at a pressure of 1 atmosphere however effective temperature and actual surface temperature can be very different due to greenhouse properties of planetary atmosphere for example venus has an effective temperature of but a surface temperature of mainly due to a 96 5 carbon dioxide atmosphere a difference of about studies of habitability i e liquid water for extremophile forms of life selsis 5 gl 581c is very unlikely to be habitable conclude that gliese 581c is likely to suffer from a runaway greenhouse effect similar to that found on venus as such is highly unlikely to be habitable nevertheless this runaway greenhouse effect could be prevented by presence of sufficient reflective cloud cover on planet s day side selsis 3 1 would be habitable only if clouds with highest reflectivity covered most of daytime hemisphere alternatively if surface were covered in ice it would have a high albedo reflectivity and thus could reflect enough of incident sunlight back into space to render planet too cold for habitability although this situation is expected to be very unstable except for very high albedos greater than about 0 95 i e ice release of carbon dioxide by volcanic activity or of water vapor due to heating at substellar point would trigger a runaway greenhouse effect selsis 3 1 2 liquid water gliese 581c is likely to lie outside habitable zone selsis abstract 3 figure 4 no direct evidence has been found for water to be present and it is probably not present in liquid state techniques like one used to measure extrasolar planet hd 209458 b may in future be used to determine presence of water in form of vapor in planet s atmosphere but only in rare case of a planet with an orbit aligned so as to transit its star which gliese 581c is not known to do tidally locked models theoretical models predict that volatile compounds such as water and carbon dioxide if present might evaporate in scorching heat of side migrate to cooler night side and condense to form ice caps over time entire atmosphere might freeze into ice caps on night side of planet however it remains unknown if water and or carbon dioxide are even present on surface of gliese 581c alternatively an atmosphere large enough to be stable would circulate heat more evenly allowing for a wider habitable area on surface for example although venus has a small axial inclination very little sunlight reaches surface at poles a slow rotation rate approximately 117 times slower than earth s produces prolonged days and nights despite uneven distribution of sunlight cast on venus at any given time polar areas and night side of venus are kept almost as hot as on day side by globally circulating winds a message from earth a
