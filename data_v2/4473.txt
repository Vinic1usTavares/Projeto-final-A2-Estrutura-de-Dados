architectural historian edward hubbard douglas s life seems to have been one of thorough devotion to architecture which may well have been intensified by death of his wife and other domestic worries his obituary in chester chronicle stated that he lived heart and soul in his profession douglas was a dedicated christian who regularly attended his local church st paul s church boughton a church he rebuilt his house walmoor hill included an oratory he also had a strong sense of national loyalty incorporating statues of queen victoria in niches at walmoor hill and in his buildings in st werburgh

buildings on eaton hall estate alone he also designed buildings on duke s halkyn estate in flintshire including another church other wealthy landowners who commissioned work from douglas included

and steeple of a gothic style church with a clock face gravestones in foreground and a leafless tree to left although firm where douglas received his training was in a provincial city in north of england it was at forefront of gothic revival in country gothic revival was a reaction against neoclassical style which had been popular in 18th and early 19th centuries and it incorporated features of gothic style of middle ages both edmund sharpe and e g paley had been influenced by cambridge camden society and more specifically by a w n pugin who believed that gothic was only correct and christian way to build sharpe had also been influenced by thomas rickman and he had written papers on medieval scholarship himself paley had been influenced by his brother frederick apthorp paley who was enthusiastic about gothic architecture and who had also been influenced by rickman during time douglas was working in lancaster firm was responsible for building and restoring churches in gothic revival style one of which was st wilfrid s church in cheshire village of some from sandiway douglas s first church that of st john evangelist at over winsford was entirely english gothic in style more specifically early decorated douglas s influences were not from england alone although he never travelled abroad he incorporated gothic styles from continental countries especially germany and france this combination of gothic styles contributed to what has come to be known as high victorian style its features include a sense of steep roofs which are frequently hipped round turrets with conical roofs pinnacles heavy corbel tables and use of many of douglas s works especially his earlier ones are high victorian in style or incorporate high victorian features one characteristic feature of douglas s work is inclusion of dormer windows rising through eaves and surmounted by hipped roofs thumb left grosvenor park lodge alt a two storey house lower storey being in sandstone and upper timber framed and gabled to right of house are entry gates to park and in front of it are formal flower beds another major influence in his work was rise of interest in vernacular architecture by time douglas moved to chester black and white revival using half timbering was well under way and douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in chester and elsewhere black and white revival did not start in chester but it did become chester s speciality first chester architect involved in revival had been thomas mainwaring penson whose first work in this genre was restoration of a shop in eastgate street in early 1850s other early chester architects involved in revival were t a richardson and james harrison and it came to be developed mainly by t m lockwood and by douglas part of douglas s earliest work for grosvenor family entrance lodge to grosvenor park used half timbering in its upper storey this is first known use by douglas of black and white other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of english architecture in particular tudor style these include tile hanging and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks in this style douglas was influenced by architects nesfield and shaw douglas also used vernacular elements from continent especially late medieval brickwork of germany and low countries a characteristic of douglas s work is his attention to both external and internal detailing such detailing was not derived from any particular style and douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project his detailing applied particularly to his joinery perhaps inspired by his experience in his father s workshop and was applied both to wooden fittings and to furniture he designed a further continental influence was his use of a dutch gable most important and consistently used element in douglas s vernacular buildings was his use of half timbering which was usually used for parts of building however in cases of rowden abbey and st michael and all angels church altcar entire buildings were timber framed significant works early works 1860 70 thumb oakmere hall alt an imposing yellow stone house in two storeys

while st john s church at over 1860 63 was of gothic revival in early decorated style congregational chapel also at over 1865 was again different being built in brick in high victorian style meanwhile douglas had designed a shop at 19 21 sankey street warrington 1864 with gothic arcades and detailed stone carving which hubbard considers to be his first building of real and outstanding quality in its way one of best things he ever did shortly after this came first commissions for grosvenor family consisting of a lodge and other structures in grosvenor park chester 1865 67 and st john baptist s church aldford 1865 66 his first commission for a large house was oakmere hall 1867 for john thomas johnson industrialists of runcorn it is in high victorian style and includes a main block and a service wing a large tower on south face a small tower with turrets a porte cochere steep roofs and dormer windows another early church was st ann s at warrington 1868 69 again high victorian in style

exhibited at royal academy and appeared in academy architecture douglas s obituary in british architect referred to him as having achieved a reputation which has long placed him in front rank of living architects in series buildings of england nikolaus pevsner described him without reservation as best cheshire architect in companion series buildings of wales clwyd hubbard expressed opinion that he was most important and active local architect of period critical praise was not confined to britain douglas s works were acclaimed by french architect paul and muthesius wrote of his consummate mastery of form despite this only official recognition he received in his lifetime was a medal for abbeystead house which was shown at an exhibition in paris many of architects training and working in douglas s office were influenced by him perhaps best known of these were edmund kirby and edward ould kirby is best remembered for his roman catholic churches ould went on to design a

exist many of them being listed buildings in a wide variety of types and styles douglas is not remembered for any one building type his churches and houses are considered to be of equal importance he was not a pioneer of any particular new development but instead followed national stylistic trends while still retaining his individuality his buildings are anything but copyist and they bear a highly individual and nearly always recognisable stamp major characteristics of his buildings are sure proportions imaginative massing and grouping immaculate detailing and a superb sense of craftsmanship and feeling for materials his work is architecture which can be enjoyed as well as admired see also list of new churches by john douglas list of church restorations amendments and furniture by john
