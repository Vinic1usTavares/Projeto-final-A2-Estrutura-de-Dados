to auschwitz concentration camp in german occupied poland in april 1944 brand was approached by adolf eichmann german ss officer who had arrived in budapest to organize deportations eichmann proposed that brand broker a deal between ss and united states or britain in which nazis would exchange one million jews for 10 000 trucks for eastern front and large quantities of tea and other goods it was most ambitious of a series of such deals between ss and jewish leaders eichmann called it blut gegen waren blood for goods nothing came of proposal which times of london called one of most loathsome stories of war historians have suggested that ss including its commander heinrich himmler intended negotiations as cover for peace talks with western allies that would exclude soviet union and perhaps even adolf hitler whatever its purpose proposal was thwarted by british government they arrested brand in aleppo then under british control where he had gone to propose eichmann s offer to jewish agency and put an end to it by leaking details to media failure of proposal and wider issue of why allies were unable to save 435 000 hungarian jews deported to auschwitz between may and july 1944

nazis counted as jews according to yehuda bauer most were liberal jews and fully assimilated nearly 30 percent were orthodox and a small minority were zionists restrictions on jews had been in place

later still by brands and their two children committee wanted to establish contact with germans and offered a go between 20 000 to arrange a meeting with ss hauptsturmfuhrer dieter wisliceny one of eichmann s assistants david crowe writes that ss had become an economic force in its own right by 1944 thanks to its plundering of jewish businesses and ownership of factories that used slave labour from concentration camps jewish rescue workers had made several attempts to exploit ss corruption in bratislava slovakia gisi fleischmann and orthodox rabbi michael dov weissmandl leaders of working group slovakian equivalent of aid and rescue committee had paid dieter wisliceny c 50 000 in 1942 to suspend deportation to poland of jews from slovakia according to bauer only two transports left for poland after wisliceny was paid and working group believed their bribe had succeeded in fact deportations had been halted for other reasons slovakian officials had been bribed many jews were protected by government documents showing they were for example essential workers and there had been an intervention from vatican in june 1942 also see and encouraged by their apparent success fleischmann and weissmandl devised a more ambitious proposal in november 1942 known as europa plan or aim was to bribe ss with money from jews overseas primarily united states to stop deportation of all jews to poland nothing came of proposal reportedly because heinrich himmler intervened to stop it in august 1943 aid and rescue committee decided to ask wisliceny whether ss were as kasztner wrote in a later report prepared to negotiate with illegal jewish rescue committee on an economic basis about moderation of anti jewish measures brand and kasztner met wisliceny on 5 april 1944 they told him they were in a position to continue fleischmann s negotiations and could offer 2 million with a down payment of 200 000 they asked that there be no deportations mass executions or pogroms in hungary no ghettos or camps and that jews who held immigration certificates for palestine issued by british mandatory government be allowed to leave wisliceny accepted 200 000 but indicated that 2 million might not be enough he said there would be no deportations and no harm to jewish community while negotiations continued and arranged for aid and rescue committee exemptions from anti jewish laws to allow its members to travel and use cars and telephones also see first meeting with eichmann thumb upright alt photograph adolf eichmann c 1942 eichmann resplendent in his ss uniform stood in front of his desk

emissary of reichsfuhrer ss heinrich himmler was also at meeting brand wrote that eichmann wore a well cut uniform and had eyes he would never forget steely blue hard and sharp they seemed to bore through you it was only later that i noticed his small face with its thin lips and sharp nose in a tone that brand compared to clatter of a machine gun eichmann offered to sell him one million jews not for money but for goods from overseas i have already made investigations about you and your people and i have verified your ability to make a deal now then i am prepared to sell you one million jews goods for blood blood for goods you can take them from any country you like wherever you can find them hungary poland ostmark from theresienstadt from auschwitz wherever you like also see eichmann said he would discuss proposal with berlin and that in meantime brand should decide what kinds of goods he was in a position to offer brand asked how committee was supposed to obtain these goods eichmann said he should open negotiations with allies overseas and that eichmann would arrange a travel permit brand suggested istanbul where another committee member had a jewish agency contact he testified years later that on leaving hotel he felt like a stark madman for stark madman see further meetings eichmann sent for brand again a few days later eichmann was accompanied this time by gerhard clages also known as otto klages chief of himmler s sicherheitsdienst security service in budapest clages presence meant that three of himmler s senior officers eichmann becher and clages had involved themselves with brand proposal clages handed brand 50 000 and 270 000 swiss francs that germans had intercepted sent to aid and rescue committee by rescue workers in switzerland via swedish embassy in budapest eichmann told brand that he wanted 10 000 new trucks for waffen ss to use on eastern front one truck for every 100 jews as well as 200 tons of tea 200 tons of cocoa 800 tons of coffee and 2 000 000 cases of soap if brand returned from istanbul with confirmation that allies had accepted proposal eichmann said he would release 10 percent of one million deal would proceed with 100 000 jews released for every 1 000 trucks it remains unclear whether eichmann told brand to return to budapest by a particular date according to bauer brand said at various points that he was advised he could take his time or given one two or three weeks hansi brand testified during eichmann s trial that in meantime she and her children had to remain in budapest effectively as hostages

auschwitz on 147 trains a rate of around 12 000 a day most were gassed may october 1944 brand leaves for istanbul brand secured a letter of recommendation for jewish agency from hungarian jewish council he was told he would be travelling with bandi grosz real name andor gross a hungarian who had worked for hungarian and german military intelligence grosz would travel to istanbul as director

budapest to vienna on 17 may where they stayed night in a hotel reserved for ss grosz later testified that brand s mission had been a cover for his own he said he had been told by clages to arrange a meeting in a neutral country between senior german and american officers or british if necessary to broker peace between german sicherheitsdienst and western allies breitman and aronson 1992 p 177 meeting with jewish agency in vienna brand was given a german passport in name of eugen band he cabled jewish agency in istanbul to say he was on his way and arrived by german diplomatic plane on 19 may paul rose writes that brand had no idea at this point that deportations to auschwitz had already begun rose 1991 p 910 brand had been told by jewish agency by return cable that chaim would meet him in istanbul convinced of importance of his mission he believed this was chaim weizmann president of world zionist organization later first president of israel in fact man who had arranged to meet him was chaim barlas head of istanbul group of zionist emissaries not only was barlas not there but there was no entry visa waiting for brand and he was threatened with arrest and deportation brand saw this as first betrayal by jewish agency bauer argues that brand then and later failed to grasp that jewish agency was powerless that his passport was in name of eugen band would have been enough to cause confusion visa situation was sorted out by bandi grosz and men were taken to a hotel where they met jewish agency delegates brand was furious that no one sufficiently senior was available to negotiate a deal jewish agency agreed to arrange for moshe sharett previously head of its political department and later second prime minister of israel to travel to istanbul to meet him brand passed them a plan of auschwitz probably from vrba wetzler report and demanded that gas chambers crematoria and railways lines be bombed discussions left him discouraged and depressed he wrote that delegates lacked any sense of urgency and were focused more on internal politics and jewish emigration to palestine rather than slaughter in europe they were undoubtedly worthy men but they lacked any awareness of how critical was period of history in which they were living they had not looked death in face day after day as we had in budapest interim agreement ladislaus lob writes that proposals and counter proposals flew between istanbul london and washington jewish agency and brand wanted allies to string germans along in hope of slowing deportations agency gave brand a document dated 29 may 1944 that offered 400 000 for every 1 000 jewish emigrants to palestine one million swiss francs per 10 000 jewish emigrants to neutral countries such as spain and 10 000 swiss francs a month if deportations were to stop if ss would allow allies to supply food clothes and medicine to jews in concentration camps nazis would be supplied with same rose writes that agreement was intended only to give brand something to take back to budapest rose 1991 p 911 brand cabled his wife on 29 and 31 may to tell her and thereby eichmann about agreement but there was no response rezso kasztner and hansi brand had been held in budapest between 27 may and 1 june by hungarian arrow cross they received telegrams when they were released but eichmann refused to halt deportations rose 1991 pp 912 913 arrested by british thumb left upright alt photograph moshe sharett in istanbul brand was told that moshe sharett was unable to obtain a visa for turkey jewish agency asked brand to meet him instead in aleppo on syrian turkish border he was reluctant area was under british control and he was afraid they would want to question him but agency told him it would be safe and he left by train with two of its delegates testimony of joel brand trial of adolf eichmann session 57 part 1 6 2 6 while on train brand was approached by two representatives of zeev s revisionist zionist party and world israel orthodox religious party they told him british were going to arrest him in aleppo die englander sind in dieser frage nicht unsere british are not our allies in this matter for german as soon as he arrived at aleppo train station on 7 june he was stopped by a british man in plain clothes and pushed into a jeep that was waiting with its engine running british drove him to a villa where for four days they tried to stop moshe sharett from meeting him sharett fought a battle of telephones and cables bauer writes and on 11 june he and jewish agency intelligence group were finally introduced to brand discussion lasted several hours sharett wrote in a report of 27 june i must have looked a little incredulous for he said please believe me they have killed six million jews there are only two million left alive at end of meeting sharett broke news that british were insisting brand not return to budapest brand became hysterical proposal rejected thumb upright alt photograph prime minister winston churchill brand was taken to cairo where he was questioned by british for weeks on 22 june he was interviewed by ira hirschmann of american war refugee board hirschmann wrote a positive report about brand but his influence was limited brand went on hunger strike for 17 days in protest at his detention british americans and soviets discussed proposal british foreign secretary later prime minister anthony eden wrote a memo on 26 june outlining options british were convinced they were dealing with a himmler trick perhaps an attempt to broker a peace deal without soviet union if deal had gone ahead and large numbers of jews had been released in central europe allied airborne and possibly land based military operations might have had to stop bauer believes british feared this was himmler s motive to turn jews into human shields because it would have allowed germans to devote their forces to fighting red army americans were more open to negotiating a rift developed between them and british who bauer writes were worried about large scale jewish immigration to palestine then under british control there was also concern about effect of jewish immigration to uk or us eden did suggest a counter proposal on 1 july but it was reduced bauer writes to a ridiculous minimum he told american government that british would allow brand to return to budapest with a message for eichmann suggesting that 1 500 jewish children be given safe passage to switzerland 5 000 from bulgaria and romania be allowed to leave for palestine and that germany guarantee safe conduct for ships carrying jewish refugees he did not say what he would offer in return on 11 july prime minister winston churchill put an end to idea when he told eden that murder of jews was probably greatest and most horrible crime ever committed and that there should be no negotiations of any kind on this subject of brand s mission he wrote project which has been put forward through a very doubtful channel seems itself also to be of most nondescript character i would not take it seriously fo 371 115 cited in wasserstein 1979 p 259 also cited in part in churchill 1953 p 597 and cohen 2003 p 291 leak to media british leaked details of eichmann s proposal to media on 19 july 1944 day before 20 july plot attempted assassination of adolf hitler new york herald tribune dateline london 18 july reported that two hungarian government emissaries in turkey had proposed that hungarian jews be given safe passage in exchange for british and american pharmaceuticals and transport for germans times called it one of most loathsome stories of war an attempt to blackmail deceive and split allies and a new level of fantasy and self deception mass deportation of hungarian jews had already stopped by time of leak following publication in mid june of parts of vrba wetzler report describing use of gas chambers inside auschwitz jewish agency in geneva had cabled london asking that hungarian ministers be held personally responsible for killings cable was intercepted and passed to hungarian regent miklos horthy who on 7 july 1944 ordered an end to deportations british released brand on 5 october brand said they would not allow him to return to hungary and forced him to travel to palestine bauer disputes this in his view brand was simply afraid of returning to budapest convinced germans would murder him himmler s involvement left thumb upright alt photograph heinrich himmler germany s foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop had apparently known nothing about proposal he cabled brigadefuhrer edmund veesenmayer of ss on 20 july 1944 to ask about it and was told on 22 july that brand and grosz had been sent to turkey on orders of heinrich himmler head of ss eichmann himself said during interrogation after war that order had come from himmler as did ss officer kurt becher himmler said to me take whatever you can from jews promise them whatever you want what we will keep is another matter according to bauer clumsiness of approach has been a wonderment to all observers bauer argues that eichmann wanted to murder jews not sell them but was forced instead to act as himmler s reluctant messenger on day brand left germany for istanbul in may 1944 eichmann was in auschwitz checking that it was ready for trainloads of jews about to arrive from hungary camp s commander obersturmbannfuhrer rudolf hoss said it would be difficult to process such large numbers whereupon eichmann ordered that new arrivals be gassed immediately rather than going through selection this does not suggest that he was going to halt killing until brand returned from istanbul in bauer s view presence at one of meetings of gerhard clages of ss signals that himmler was focusing on secret peace talks brand and grosz arrived in istanbul just two months before attempted assassination of adolf hitler on 20 july 1944 himmler knew that attempts might be made on hitler s life although not where and when he may have wanted to broker for peace in case hitler did not survive using low level agents for plausible deniability in event that hitler did survive bauer argues himmler would be able to offer him a peace deal with west that excluded soviet union brand himself came to believe that proposal had been designed to drive a wedge between allies two months before his death in 1964 at trial in germany of eichmann s deputies and he said he had made a terrible mistake in passing this on to british it is now clear to me that himmler sought to sow suspicion among allies as a preparation for his much desired nazi western coalition against moscow allied rift called aim of 44 nazi ransom plan new york times 21 may 1964 kasztner train brand s failure to return to budapest was a disaster for aid and rescue committee on 27 may hansi brand who at some point during this period had become kasztner s lover was arrested and beaten by hungarian arrow cross kasztner wrote that on 9

being in a windmill it turned and moved transcript shoah interview with hansi brand steven spielberg film and video archive p 22 bauer argues that aid and rescue committee made mistake of almost adopting antisemitic belief in unlimited jewish power that jewish leaders could move around freely and persuade allies to act and that american jews had easy access to money and goods committee had similar trust in allies but latter were preparing for invasion of normandy which began on 6 june 1944 at that crucial moment writes bauer to antagonize soviets because of some hare brained gestapo plan to ransom jews was totally out of question despite setbacks kasztner hansi brand and rest of committee secured release of around 1 684 jews including 273 children who were allowed to leave budapest for switzerland by train on 30 june 1944 committee paid ss officer kurt becher 1000 per person in foreign currency shares jewellery and gold raised from wealthier passengers to cover cost of rest after an unexplained detour to bergen belsen concentration camp passengers arrived in switzerland in two batches in august and december that year joel brand s mother sister and niece were on train as were 10 members of kasztner s family and 388 people from kolozsvar ghetto in his home town kastner s relationship with these passengers led to criticism that his negotiations with becher had focused on saving people he knew an allegation that led to his assassination in 1957 porter 2007 p 233ff later life move to israel bauer concludes that brand was a courageous man who had passionately wanted to help jewish people but his life was plagued after mission by suspicion including from other members of aid and rescue committee because of his failure to return to budapest after british

hungarian holocaust survivor who had moved to israel after war in a self published pamphlet in 1952 he accused kasztner by then an israeli civil servant of having collaborated with nazis by dealing with eichmann brand testified for kasztner but instead of defending him took opportunity to accuse jewish agency whose officials became first israeli government of having helped british scupper blood for goods proposal after a trial that lasted 18 months judge concluded that by negotiating with eichmann failing to warn many to save few on kasztner train and writing an affidavit after war for kurt becher kasztner had sold his soul to devil it was because of kasztner s support for becher that americans decided not to prosecute becher at nuremberg kasztner also wrote affidavits for ss officers hans dieter wisliceny and hermann krumey thumb alt photograph eichmann in his prison yard in israel he was hanged on 31 may 1962 judge said that kasztner s failure to do more to warn community that
