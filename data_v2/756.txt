cloudinids an early metazoan family containing genera cloudina and conotubus lived in late ediacaran period and became extinct at base of cambrian they formed millimetre scale conical fossils consisting of calcareous cones nested within one another appearance of organism itself remains unknown name cloudina honors 20th century geologist and paleontologist preston cloud cloudinids comprise two genera cloudina itself is mineralized whereas conotubus is at best weakly mineralized whilst sharing same funnel in funnel construction cloudinids had a wide geographic range reflected in present distribution of localities in which their fossils are found and are an abundant component of some deposits they never appear in same layers as soft bodied ediacaran biota but fact that some sequences contain cloudinids and ediacaran biota in alternating layers suggests that these groups had different environmental preferences it has been suggested that cloudinids lived embedded in microbial mats growing new cones to avoid being buried by silt however no specimens have been found embedded in mats and their mode of life is still an unresolved question classification of cloudinids has proved difficult they were initially regarded as polychaete worms and then as coral like cnidarians on basis of what look like buds on some specimens current scientific opinion is divided between classifying them as polychaetes and regarding it as unsafe to classify them as members of any broader grouping cloudinids are important in history of animal evolution for two reasons they are among earliest and most abundant of small shelly fossils with mineralized skeletons and therefore feature in debate about why such skeletons first appeared in late ediacaran most widely supported answer is that their shells are a defense against predators as some cloudina specimens from china bear marks of multiple attacks which suggests they survived at least a few of them holes made by predators are approximately proportional to size of cloudina specimens and sinotubulites fossils which are often found in same beds have so far shown no such holes these two points suggest that predators attacked in a selective manner and evolutionary arms race which this indicates is commonly cited as a cause of cambrian explosion of animal diversity and complexity morphology thumb left 100px cutaway diagram

appearance overall tube is curved or sinuous and occasionally branches tube walls are 8 to 50 micrometers thick usually lying in range 10 to 25 mm although it used to be thought that tubes had test tube like bases detailed three dimensional reconstruction has shown that tubes had an open base there is evidence that tube was flexible classification cloudina was originally classified in 1972 as a member of a class known from early cambrian glaessner 1976 accepted this classification and also proposed that cloudina was similar to annelid worms particularly serpulid polychaetes however hahn 1985 and conway morris et al 1990 doubted both germs and glaessner s suggested relationships and were unwilling to classify it to anything more than its own family some specimens of cloudina display budding which implies asexual reproduction on this basis grant 1990 classified cloudina as a coral like cnidarian since tubes had an open base creating a single living space rather than a series of separate chambers cloudina is more likely to be a stem group polychaete worm in other words an evolutionary aunt or cousin of more recent polychaetes this interpretation is reinforced by even distribution of bore holes made by predators however as with so many ediacaran life forms there is great debate surrounding its position in tree of life and classification between kingdom and family level may be unwise ecology cloudina is usually found in association with microbial stromatolites which are limited to shallow water their isotopic mg ratios suggests that water temperatures were relatively cool they have also been found in normal sea floor sediments suggesting that they were not only restricted to dwelling on microbial mounds on other hand cloudina has never been found in same layers as soft bodied ediacara biota but cloudina and ediacara biota have been found in alternating layers this suggests that two groups of organisms had different environmental preferences in many cloudina specimens ridges formed by cones are of varying width which suggests organisms grew at a variable rate adolf seilacher suggests that they adhered to microbial mats and that growth phases represented organism keeping pace with sedimentation growing through new material deposited on it that would otherwise bury it kinks in developing tube are easily explained by mat falling slightly from horizontal because of its small size cloudina would be expected to be found in situ in microbial mat especially if as seilacher suggests sedimentation built up around it during its lifetime but all many specimens discovered to date have only been found having been washed out of their places of growth a further argument against seilacher s hypothesis is that predatory borings found in many specimens are not concentrated at what would be top end as one would expect if animal was mainly buried an alternative is that organism dwelt on seaweeds but until a specimen unquestionably in situ is discovered its mode of life remains open to debate tubes often appear to form colonies although they are sometimes found in more isolated situations frequent appearance of large and sometimes single species colonies has been attributed to lack of significant predation on other hand in some locations up to 20 of cloudina fossils contain predatory borings ranging from 15 to 400 mm in diameter boreholes are rather evenly distributed along tube length and some tubes had been bored multiple times hence organism could survive attacks since predators do not attack empty shells this may indicate that animal could vary its position in tube in response to predation or that it occupied full length but not full width of tube even distribution is perhaps difficult to reconcile with an lifestyle mainly buried in a microbial mat and adds weight to miller s suggestion that animal lived on seaweeds or in a reef environment if modern day molluscs are a suitable analogy size distribution of borings suggests that predator was similar in size to cloudina fossil findings in nama group namibia suggest that cloudina was one of first reef building animals but machine learning facilitated 3d tomography indicates that reef forming fossils are in fact simply aggregations of solitary individuals fossil locations cloudina occurred in calcium carbonate rich areas of stromatolite reefs it is found in association with namacalathus which like cloudina was weakly skeletal and solitary and namapoikia which was robustly skeletal and formed sheets on open surfaces neoproterozoic microbial

fossils found in association with late precambrian early cambrian anabaritids ssf and tubular agglutinated skeletal fossils and in siberia paleontological importance although not first small shelly fossil to be found cloudina is one of earliest and most abundant evolution of external shells in late ediacaran is thought to be a defence against predators marking start of an evolutionary arms race while predatory borings are common in cloudina specimens no such borings have been found in sinotubulites a similar shelly fossil sometimes found in same beds in addition diameters of borings in cloudina are proportional to sizes of specimens which suggests that predators were selective about size of their prey these two indications that predators attacked selectively suggest possibility of speciation in response to predation which is often postulated as a potential cause of rapid diversification of animals in early cambrian see also sinotubulites list of ediacaran genera references and
