siege of sparta took place in 272 bc and was a battle fought between epirus led by king pyrrhus 297 272 bc and an alliance consisting of sparta under command of king areus i 309 265 bc and his heir acrotatus and macedon battle was fought at sparta and ended in a spartan macedonian victory following his defeat in italy by roman republic pyrrhus was forced to retreat back to epirus on his return to epirus he declared war against antigonus gonatas 283 239 bc managing to take control of macedon in 272 bc he was approached by a spartan prince cleonymus a claimant to spartan throne who had been overlooked pyrrhus saw this invitation as an opportunity to extend his wars of conquest to peloponnese and invaded sparta despite majority of spartan army campaigning in crete remaining spartans were able to mount a defence led by spartan crown prince acrotatus spartans were able to withstand epiriote assaults until arrival of main spartan army led by king areus i and macedonian reinforcements prompting pyrrhus to abandon siege after this failure pyrrhus ravaged spartan hinterland whilst fending off counter attacks by victorious spartans on invitation of an argive ally pyrrhus attempted to seize argos assault culminated in a fiasco with pyrrhus being attacked by his argive opponents pursuing spartan army of areus and a macedonian army commanded by antigonus gonatas pyrrhus was killed in ensuing battle in streets of argos ending epiriote hopes of establishing a hegemony in greece background 275px right thumb alt map depicting south adriatic littoral sicily and parts of central and

went with an army of 25 500 men and 20 elephants to italy to help fight romans romans had succeeded in conquering most of italy and were now moving in to take greek cities in magna graecia after arriving in italy in 280 bc pyrrhus defeated a roman army at battle of heraclea near tarentum pyrrhus repeated his success against romans by defeating another army at battle of these victories proved to be very costly to pyrrhus and he diverted his attention to sicily where greek states on island were appealing for his help against carthage despite defeating carthaginians and occupying most of island pyrrhus behaviour alienated him from his greek allies and he was forced to abandon sicily and return to italian mainland pyrrhus attacked rebuilt roman army and after inconclusive battle of beneventum pyrrhus returned to epirus after leaving a garrison at tarentum war in italy had drained pyrrhus financial and military resources to increase his resources and bolster his standing he declared war on king antigonus ii gonatas of macedon he ravaged part of country before managing to defeat antigonus at battle of aous this defeat compelled antigonus to flee to thessaloniki where he was protected by his strong navy following antigonus flight pyrrhus was able to gain control of most of macedon and thessaly declaring himself king of macedon prelude upright thumb alt a bust of a man donned in a wreathed helmet a bust of pyrrhus king of epirus at national archaeological museum of naples upon his seizure of macedonian throne pyrrhus was approached by a spartan prince cleonymus who was serving as an officer in his army spartan persuaded pyrrhus to assist him in his plot to capture sparta cleonymus motives in wanting to attack sparta were twofold firstly he bore a grudge because his countrymen had overlooked him in favour of his nephew areus i when determining successor of throne plutarch greek historian attributed cleonymus non selection as king to his violent disposition and arbitrariness moreover cleonymus had been slighted because his new wife chilonis had been seduced by areus son arcotatus these perceived insults spurred cleonymus to leave sparta and scheme to usurp throne pyrrhus was receptive to cleonymus appeals to install him on spartan throne and agreed to assist him to achieve this epiriote king assembled an army numbering of 27 000 men it consisted 25 000 infantry 2 000 cavalry and was supplemented by 24 war elephants size of pyrrhus expedition indicates that he viewed aiding cleonymus as an opportunity to extend his hegemony into peloponnese and securing sparta as an ally an alternate theory is that pyrrhus undertook his invasion of peloponnese as a means of cutting off any support that antigonus was still receiving from southern greek poleis after mustering his force pyrrhus marched south through central greece and through to peloponnese n g l hammond speculates that pyrrhus army marched down to on aetolian side of gulf of corinth and crossed from there into peloponnese this suggests that invasion was facilitated by aetolian league a power confederate in central greece which was hostile to antigonus upon his arrival in peloponnese pyrrhus was welcomed in before continuing his march to megalopolis there he was met by spartan ambassadors as well as those from messene athens and achaean league pyrrhus appears to have received support for his invasion from some of sparta s neighbours namely elis megalopolis and some cities which would profit from reduced spartan power in response to spartan emissaries inquiries as to his intentions epiriote king managed to deceive them pyrrhus asserted that his aim in invading peloponnese was to liberate cities still held by antigonus and to send his sons to sparta to be educated in agoge after withdrawal of ambassadors epiriote army advanced into laconia followed river south and started to ravaging territory of spartan perioeci pyrrhus deceit prompted outrage in sparta and ambassadors were again dispatched to epiriote to him for his perfidy battle first day right 250px right thumb alt a map of southern and central peloponnese southernmost area of greece most

only lightly defended majority of spartan army had accompanied areus on campaign in crete where lacedaimonians were supporting polis of as such sparta must have seemed like an easy target to pyrrhus arriving outside sparta in evening cleonymus advised pyrrhus to attack immediately to take advantage of dearth of defenders pyrrhus decided against launching an immediate offensive as he feared destruction that would be wrought by his gallic soldiers if they were to enter city at night anticipating no resistance pyrrhus ordered his army to make camp and prepared to enter sparta in morning appearance of epirote army before their city caught spartans unprepared despite lacedaimonian being in favour of sending women to crete for their protection this was opposed by former queen and grandmother of eurypontid king ii who ensured that spartan women would remain to assist with protection of city after arrangements for women were reached spartans began bolstering settlement s defences defenders were aware that epiriotes had brought elephants and to counteract them older men and women dug a trench parallel to pyrrhus camp with wagons sunken into ground at flanks to hinder enemy s advance trench was a formidable obstacle spanning 800 feet in length with a depth of six feet and a width of nine feet pausanias recounts that meagre spartan garrison were assisted during siege by allies who had arrived from argos and messene additionally spartans sent messengers to both areus summoning him back to sparta and to antigonus seeking assistance from him despite fact that sparta and macedon had historically been enemies when daybreak approached and epiriote army was preparing its attack spartans assumed defensive positions behind their trench they were encouraged by women who had remained and by sight of chilonis who had placed a halter around her neck declared that she would commit suicide rather than return to cleonymus if pyrrhus captured city besiegers led by pyrrhus in person attempted to storm spartan defences but were repulsed as they were unable to secure firm footing in face of spartan attacks rendering trench impassable seeking to circumvent this obstacle pyrrhus sent a force of 2 000 gauls and some picked chaonians under commander of his son ptolemy to go around trench these troops found their path blocked by wagons which lacedaimonians had sunken into soil wagons were planted so deeply that they hindered not only epiriote assault but also spartan efforts to repel foray eventually gauls managed to remove some of wagons giving them opportunity to burst into city acrotatus seeing danger exploited a series of depressions in terrain to lead a force of 300 men undetected against epiriote rear this manoeuvre evoked panic amongst gauls who were compelled to abandon their attempt to enter city and had to turn around to confront attack to their rear after a hard fought battle epiriote flanking group was pushed back into trench with heavy casualties inflicted upon them spartans elated by arcotatus leadership told him to withdraw from battle and return to chilonis so as to beget more children like him for sparta second day upright thumb depiction of war elephants in midst of battle a depiction of pyrrhus and his war elephants he brought 24 elephants with him to besiege sparta pyrrhus failed to breach lacedaimonian defences and when night fell he withdrew back to his camp according to plutarch pyrrhus received an omen during night as he slept he dreamt of sparta being smitten and set alight by thunderbolts coming from his own hand while pyrrhus and most of his counsellors interpreted dream as indicating that they would seize sparta by storm his friend lysimachus warned him that places struck by thunderbolts were usually avoided and that pyrrhus was destined not to enter sparta pyrrhus dismissed this interpretation and buoyed by what he deemed to be a portentous sign he prepared his men for a further assault in face of renewed epiriote offensive spartans held their defences with vigour due to lack of manpower spartan women were active in offering missiles to defenders as well as taking away wounded and providing food and drink to those who required it to nullify advantage of spartans position epiriotes began filling up trench with materials which they were bringing to front line as well as bodies of their slain comrades efforts of besiegers were hindered by spartans who were aware of importance of maintaining their defensive obstacles in response to spartan counter attack against epiriotes filling trench pyrrhus decided to personally lead a charge against spartan lines mounted on his horse epiriote king was able to force his away through trench over wagons and into city with a group of his companions sudden onslaught of pyrrhus sparked panic amongst defenders of this section at this point pyrrhus horse was wounded by a javelin which pierced its belly causing it to throw king to ground fall of king threw his companions into a state of confusion and enabled spartans to rally spartans launched a barrage of missiles at king s comrades felling many of them despite deaths of many of his guards pyrrhus was successfully taken to safety of main epiriote lines fighting retreat thumb left alt a coin depicting head of a man a coin depicting king areus of sparta 309 265 bc whose arrival with reinforcements was critical in saving sparta following this unsuccessful foray pyrrhus ordered his army to fall back he hoped that spartans would now be willing to come to terms due to heavy casualties they had suffered pyrrhus hopes of a spartan capitulation were thwarted by arrival of reinforcements upon hearing of pyrrhus intention to conquer sparta antigonus gonatas had dispatched his general phocian from corinth with a group of mercenaries to relieve lacedaimonians shortly after this defenders numbers were further augmented by arrival of areus with 2 000 men from crete arrival of these reinforcements greatly reduced strain on spartans with women and those who were not of military age being able to withdraw from front line bolstered by fresh troops spartans and their macedonian allies prepared themselves for pyrrhus next assault against trench presence of more adversaries intensified pyrrhus determination to capture city and he ordered another attack on trenches he was unable to accomplish anything and suffered further losses failure of this attack convinced pyrrhus about futility of persevering with siege and he decided to lift it and withdraw pyrrhus intended to spend winter in laconia possibly with purpose of launching a fresh attack on sparta and sent his army to begin ravaging surrounding countryside at this point pyrrhus received an emissary from aristeas a prominent citizen of major peloponnesian polis of argos seeking his assistance to overthrow regime of aristippus which was supportive of antigonus and macedonians pyrrhus hastened to seize opportunity to capture argos and began to withdraw from laconia heading north to argolis his retreating army were continuously harried by spartans under command of areus by setting ambushes and occupying important positions along epiriote line of retreat spartans were able to inflicted significant casualties on pyrrhus rearguard of gauls and molossians in an attempt to counter panic and crumbling morale of his rear which was engaging spartans pyrrhus sent his son ptolemy to take command by doing this pyrrhus hope was that his son s presence would rally rearguard and give him enough time to extricate rest of his army from narrow pass through which they were marching battle intensified around ptolemy s position and he was set upon by a picked spartan band led by evaclus in fight that ensued ptolemy was slain and his remaining troops being overwhelmed by triumphant spartans upon hearing of his son s death and disintegration of his rearguard pyrrhus charged spartans with his cavalry killing evaclus with his own hand before destroying remainder of his picked spartan troops with defeat of evaclus force pyrrhus was able to withdraw rest of his army from laconia aftermath after their evacuation of laconia pyrrhus directed his army towards argos and upon learning that antigonus was in vicinity pitched his camp at nauplia after a series of negotiations between argives macedonians and epiriotes pyrrhus agreed to withdraw from argos during night he entered argos accompanied by his army with aristeas aid in ensuing melee epiriotes were set upon by argives as well as macedonians and a body of spartans led by areus who had been brought into city by aristippus faction while attempting to retreat pyrrhus was struck on head by a tile and while lying stunned was decapitated by antigonus troops pyrrhus defeat in peloponnese led to diminution of epirus power and loss of its macedonian and thessalian conquests antigonus capitalised on his peloponnesian victory to wrest back control of macedonia and become preeminent power in greece establishment of macedonian dominance led to a breakdown of spartan macedonian alliance in a bid to further his own royal ambitions areus had sparta join a coalition of greek poleis and fought macedon in chremonidean war war ended in a crushing spartan defeat with antigonus defeating and killing his former ally areus in a battle on isthmus of corinth in 265 bc defeat was so disastrous for sparta that they would not rise to be a regional power until reign of cleomenes iii thirty years later in
