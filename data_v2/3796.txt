forage war was a partisan campaign consisting of numerous small skirmishes that took place in new jersey during american revolutionary war between january and march 1777 following battles of trenton and princeton after both british and continental army troops entered their winter quarters in early january continental army regulars and militia companies from new jersey and pennsylvania engaged in numerous scouting and harassing operations against british and german troops quartered in new jersey british troops wanted to have fresh provisions to consume and also required fresh forage for their draft animals and horses general george washington ordered systematic removal of such supplies from areas easily accessible to british and companies of american militia and troops harassed british and german forays to acquire such provisions while many of these operations were small in some cases they became quite elaborate involving more than 1 000 troops american operations were so successful that british casualties in new jersey including those of battles at trenton and princeton exceeded those of entire campaign for new york background in august 1776 british army began a campaign to gain control over new york city which was defended by george washington s continental army over next two months general william howe quickly gained control of new york pushing washington into new jersey ketchum pp 101 159 he then chased washington south toward philadelphia washington retreated across delaware river into pennsylvania taking with him all boats for miles in each direction ketchum pp 160 241 howe then ordered his army into winter quarters establishing a chain of outposts across new jersey from hudson river through new brunswick to trenton and bordentown on delaware river occupation of new jersey by british and german troops caused friction with local communities and led to a rise in patriot militia enlistments as early as mid december these militia companies were harassing british patrols leading to incidents like geary s ambush in which a dragoon leader was killed and increasing level of tension in british and german quarters fischer pp 184 199 on night of december 25 26 1776 washington crossed delaware and surprised trenton outpost following morning over next two weeks he went on to win two further battles at assunpink creek and battle of princeton leading british to retreat to northern new jersey ketchum pp 293 379 disposition of armies thumb right upright 1 2 detail from an 1806 map showing area where many of skirmishes took place general washington established his headquarters at morristown separated from coast by watchung mountains a series of low ridges he established forward outposts to east and south of these ridges that served not only as a defensive bulwark against potential british incursions across hills but also as launch points for raids fischer p 354 over course of january and february washington s continental army shrank to about 2 500 regulars after washington s incentives for many men to overstay their enlistment periods ran out a large number of militia from new jersey new york and pennsylvania bolstered these forces and played a significant role that winter fischer pp 348 349 british army was initially deployed from posts as far north as hackensack to new brunswick garrison numbering about 10 000 was concentrated between new brunswick and amboy with a sizable contingent farther north from elizabethtown to paulus hook militia pressure in january led general cornwallis to withdraw most of northern troops to shores of hudson resulting concentration of troops overflowed available housing which had been entirely abandoned by its residents with some of troops even living aboard ships anchored nearby fischer pp 349 350 cramped quarters led to an increase in camp related illnesses throughout winter and morale was low fischer p 351 area had been heavily plundered during american retreat in fall so there was little in way of local provisions fischer p 350 men subsisted largely on rations such as salt pork but their draft animals required fresh fodder for which they sent out raiding expeditions fischer p 352 tactics early in winter washington sent out detachments of troops to systematically remove any remaining provisions and livestock from convenient access by british lundin p 223 general cornwallis sent out small foraging and raiding parties in january these were met by larger formations numbering 300 and up of american militia companies sometimes with continental army support that led on occasion to significant casualties in one early example brigadier general philemon dickinson mustered 450 militia and drove off a british foraging expedition in battle of millstone on january 20 fischer p 355 washington gave his commanders wide latitude in how to act issuing commands that they were to be constantly harassing enemy and that they should be aggressive in their tactics fischer p 353 these early successes depended in part on successful intelligence one british commander reported being met with force notwithstanding orders were given but a few hours before troops moved lundin p 224 even supply convoys bringing provisions from outside state to large garrison at new brunswick were not immune to american attacks where raritan river and roads from perth amboy offered opportunities for sniping and raiding lundin p 225 their difficulties led british commanders to change tactics attempting to lure these militia units into traps involving larger numbers of british regulars fischer p 356 but even this was not entirely successful as wily militia and continental commanders including continental army general william maxwell used superior knowledge of geography to set even more elaborate traps in one encounter in late february british colonel charles mawhood thinking he had flanked a party of new jersey militia suddenly found his advance force flanked by another larger force as they were driven back toward amboy more and more americans appeared ultimately inflicting about 100 casualties elite grenadiers of 42nd foot part of mawhood s vanguard were badly mauled in encounter fischer pp 356 357 a british force of 2 000 was repulsed by maxwell in another well organized attack a few weeks later fischer p 357 ongoing tensions took their toll on beleaguered british johann ewald captain of a company of german jagers essentially light infantry who were often on front lines observed that men have to stay dressed day and night horses constantly saddled and that army would have been gradually destroyed through this foraging fischer p 358 some forage was provided from new york but it was never sufficient for army s needs as a consequence british were forced to provide many supplies from europe at great cost and risk to royal navy mitnick p 52 selected actions 181px thumb right hessian captain johann ewald depicted later in life wearing a danish general s uniform was often near front of british lines elizabethtown a regiment of waldeck infantry a few companies of 71st foot and a troop of british light dragoons were stationed at elizabethtown new jersey in winter of 1776 1777 on 5 january 1777 a british cavalry patrol was ambushed by militia near town one trooper was killed and a second was wounded next day about 50 waldeck infantry emerged from town with a small escort of light dragoons with instructions to clear country led by captain georg von haacke strong patrol was attacked near springfield by new jersey militia in elizabethtown soldiers heard distant gunfire hours later bedraggled british horsemen came back without foot soldiers eight or 10 of were shot down and entire party captured by militia ordered to pull back to amboy garrison hurriedly left on 7 january as troops evacuated elizabethtown militia attacked rear guard in confused retreat americans captured 100 soldiers baggage trains of two regiments and food supplies fischer 2004 p 347 pp 415 416 fischer s dates in his narrative and his appendix differ by one day dates in appendix were used for two clashes chatham connecticut farms and bonhamtown on 10 january 1777 colonel charles scott s virginia continentals captured 70 highlanders together with their wagons at chatham new jersey fischer 2004 p 352 p 416 scott s brigade was composed of 4th 5th and 6th virginia regiments fischer 2004 p 409 at connecticut farms on 15 january 300 new jersey militia commanded by colonel oliver spencer attacked 100 german foragers americans killed one enemy soldier and captured 70 more following day 350 americans set upon a large body of british foragers at bonhamtown new jersey killing 21 enemy soldiers and wounding 30 or 40 more american casualties are not given in any of these actions millstone and woodbridge at battle of millstone brigadier general philemon dickinson of new jersey militia scored a brilliant success on 20 january 1777 near van nest s mill 400 militia and 50 pennsylvania riflemen crossed an icy stream and fought a pitched battle with 500 british regulars and three cannons british lost 25 casualties 12 prisoners 43 wagons 104 horses 115 cattle and about 60 sheep americans admitted losses of four or five men afterward british refused to believe that they had been beaten by militia on 23 january two british regiments were waylaid by brigadier general william maxwell near woodbridge 200 new jersey continentals inflicted losses of seven killed and 12 wounded while only suffering two men wounded fischer 2004 p 355 p 416 drake s farm on 1 february 1777 brigadier general sir william erskine 1st baronet set up a clever trap he sent a party of foragers to drake s farm near metuchen when scott s 5th virginia tried to gobble up small party erskine rushed his large force into action battalions of grenadiers light infantry 42nd foot and hessians appeared supported by eight artillery pieces instead of fleeing virginians launched a vicious attack which momentarily broke a grenadier battalion under intense cannon fire american attack was stopped but soldiers fought tenaciously until british fell back toward brunswick americans admitted 30 to 40 casualties while claiming to have killed 36 british and wounding 100 more fischer 2004 p 356 p 416 action was marred by an ugly incident when lieutenant william kelly and six other wounded americans were abandoned during a tactical withdrawal frustrated british fell upon seven helpless men with bayonets and musket butts and slaughtered them all when americans recovered mangled bodies they were infuriated brigadier general adam stephen exchanged a series of irate letters with erskine who denied all responsibility for incident fischer 2004 pp 377 378 quibbletown thumb upright 1 2 plan of quibbletown by johann von ewald on february 8 1777 general cornwallis with six british generals commanding a force of twelve battalions about 2 000 troops planned to attack american militia led by colonel charles scott and 5th virginia regiment and continentals led by brigadier general nathaniel warner at quibbletown new jersey now new market however americans refused to directly engage this foraging party but attacked flanks and rear as british retreated to new brunswick historian fischer writes british commanders were outgeneraled in field hessian captain johann von ewald described events in his diary and notes that since army would have been gradually destroyed through this foraging from here on forage was procured from new york other skirmishes occurred in this area on february 20 march 8 and april 4 spanktown on 23 february 1777 lieutenant colonel charles mawhood was sent with a reinforced brigade to destroy any rebel forces he could catch he set out with a battalion each of light infantry and grenadiers plus 3rd brigade fischer 2004 p 356 latter formation consisted of 10th foot 37th foot 38th foot and 52nd foot fischer 2004 p 395 assumption is that 3rd brigade organization had not changed since 25 december 1776 recently transferred from rhode island garrison fischer 2004 p 350 near spanktown now rahway new jersey mawhood found a group of militia herding some livestock covered by a larger body of americans waiting on a nearby hill british officer sent grenadier company of 42nd foot on a wide flanking maneuver just as grenadiers prepared to launch their assault they were fired on from ambush and routed with loss of 26 men at this moment maxwell sent his superior force forward to envelop mawhood s force american force included 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th new jersey regiments 1st and 8th pennsylvania regiments and german battalion mawhood s surprised men were hounded all way back to amboy which they reached at 8 00 pm americans lost 5 killed and 9 wounded and claimed to have inflicted 100 casualties mawhood admitted losing 69 killed and wounded and 6 missing fischer 2004 pp 356 357 p 417 author includes stricker s maryland regiment since its commander nicholas deserted and george stricker was second in command this unit must be german battalion of marylanders and pennsylvanians casualty estimates historian david hackett fischer compiled a list that he describes as incomplete consisting of 58 actions that occurred between january 4 and march 21 1777 fischer pp 415 418 documented british and german casualties numbered more than 900 a number of events do not include any casualty reports combined with their losses at trenton and princeton british lost more men in new jersey than they did during campaign for new york city fischer does not estimate american casualties and other historians e g ketchum and mitnick have not compiled any casualty estimates fischer p 359 fischer notes that relatively few official reports of american either militia or continental army unit strengths for this time period have survived fischer p 382 ending 1777 military campaigns began to take shape in april general charles cornwallis punctuated winter skirmishes with an attack on continental army outpost at bound brook on april 13 in battle of bound brook he very nearly captured its commander benjamin lincoln lundin p 255 outnumbering americans 2 000 to 500 british scattered militia but met stubborn resistance from 8th pennsylvania regiment british captured three 3 pound guns and 20 or 30 men and killed six americans but bulk of lincoln s force got away boatner 1994 p 100 101 general washington moved his army from its winter quarters at morristown to a more forward position at middlebrook in late may to better react to british moves lundin p 313 as general howe prepared his philadelphia campaign he first moved a large portion of his army to somerset court house in mid june apparently in an attempt to draw washington from middlebrook position lundin p 317 when this failed howe withdrew his army back to perth amboy and embarked it on ships bound for chesapeake bay lundin pp 325 326 northern and coastal
