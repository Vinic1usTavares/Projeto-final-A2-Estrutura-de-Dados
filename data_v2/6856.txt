malcolm iii c 26 march 1031 13 november 1093 was king of scots from 1058 to 1093 he was later nicknamed canmore ceann mor gaelic for great chief ceann denotes leader head of state and mor denotes pre eminent great and big magnusson p vol 1 p 350 states malcolm son of duncan is known as malcolm iii but still better perhaps by his characteristic name of canmore said to come from celtic cenn mor meaning great head it has also been argued recently that real malcolm canmore was this malcolm s great grandson malcolm iv of scotland who is given this name in contemporary notice of his death duncan pp 51 2 74 5 oram p 17 note 1 malcolm s long reign of 35 years preceded beginning of scoto norman age henry i of england and eustace iii of boulogne were his sons in law making him maternal grandfather of empress matilda william adelin and matilda of boulogne all three of them were prominent in english politics during 12th century malcolm s kingdom did not extend over full territory of modern scotland north and west of scotland remained under scandinavian rule following norse invasions malcolm iii fought a series of wars against kingdom of england which may have had as its objective conquest of english earldom of northumbria these wars did not result in any significant advances southward malcolm s primary achievement was to continue a lineage that ruled scotland for many years question of name of his family is open house of dunkeld is all but unknown canmore kings and canmore dynasty are not universally accepted nor are richard oram s recent meic mail coluim or michael lynch s for discussions and examples duncan pp 53 4 mcdonald outlaws p 3 barrow kingship and unity appendix c reid broun discusses question of identity at length although his role as founder of a dynasty has more to do with propaganda of his youngest son david i and his descendants than with history hammond p 21 first genealogy known which traces descent from malcolm rather than from kenneth macalpin cinaed mac ailpin or fergus mor is dated to reign of alexander ii see broun pp 195 200 malcolm s second wife st margaret of scotland is scotland s only royal saint malcolm himself had no reputation for piety with notable exception of dunfermline abbey in fife he is not definitely associated with major religious establishments or ecclesiastical reforms background malcolm s father duncan i became king in late 1034 on death of malcolm ii duncan s maternal grandfather and malcolm s great grandfather according to john of fordun whose account is original source of part of william shakespeare s macbeth malcolm s mother was a niece of siward earl of northumbria fordun iv xliv young also gives her as a niece of siward young p 30 but an earlier king list gives her gaelic name suthen duncan p 37 m o anderson p 284 other sources claim that either a daughter or niece would have been too young to fit timeline thus likely relative would have been siward s own sister sybil which may have translated into gaelic as suthen duncan s reign was not successful and he was killed in battle with men of moray led by macbeth on 15 august 1040 duncan was young at time of his death notice of duncan s death in annals of tigernach s a 1040 says he was slain at an immature age duncan p 33 and malcolm and his brother donalbane were children duncan p 33 oram david i p 18 there may have been a third brother if mael of atholl was a son of duncan oram david i p 97 note 26 rejects this identification malcolm s family attempted to overthrow macbeth in 1045 but malcolm s grandfather crinan of dunkeld was killed in attempt duncan p 41 annals of ulster s a 1045 annals of tigernach s a 1045 soon after death of duncan his two young sons were sent away for greater safety exactly where is subject of debate according to one version malcolm then aged about nine was sent to england and his younger brother donalbane was sent to isles ritchie p p 30 based on fordun s account it was assumed that malcolm passed most of macbeth s seventeen year reign in kingdom of england at court of edward confessor barrell p 13 barrow kingship and unity p 25 ritchie p 3 states that it was fourteen years of exile partly spent at edward s court today s british royal family can trace their family history back to malcolm iii via his daughter matilda as well as his son david i an ancestor of robert bruce and thus also stewart stuart kings according to an alternative version malcolm s mother took both sons into exile at court of thorfinn sigurdsson earl of orkney an enemy of macbeth s family and perhaps duncan s kinsman by marriage duncan p 42 oram david i pp 18 20 malcolm had ties to orkney in later life earl thorfinn may have been a grandson of malcolm ii and thus malcolm s cousin an english invasion in 1054 with siward earl of northumbria in command had as its goal installation of one mael coluim son of king of cumbrians this mael coluim has traditionally been identified with later malcolm iii see for instance ritchie normans p 5 or stenton anglo saxon england p 570 ritchie p 5 states that duncan placed his son future malcolm iii of scotland in possession of cumbria as its prince and states that siward invaded scotland in 1054 to restore him to scottish throne hector boece also says this vol xii p 249 as does young p 30 this interpretation derives from chronicle attributed to 14th century chronicler of scotland john of fordun as well as from earlier sources such as william of malmesbury broun identity of kingdom pp 133 34 duncan kingship p 40 latter reported that macbeth was killed in battle by siward but it is known that macbeth outlived siward by two years oram david i p 29 a a m duncan argued in 2002 that using anglo saxon chronicle entry as their source later writers innocently misidentified mael coluim with later scottish king of same name duncan kingship pp 37 41 duncan s argument has been supported by several subsequent historians specialising in era such as richard oram dauvit broun and alex woolf broun identity of kingdom p 134 oram david i pp 18 20 woolf pictland to alba p 262 it has also been suggested that mael coluim may have been a son of owain foel british king of kingship of scots p 41 perhaps by a daughter of malcolm ii king of scotland woolf pictland to alba p 262 in 1057 various chroniclers report death of macbeth at malcolm s hand on 15 august 1057 at lumphanan in aberdeenshire ritchie p essh pp 600 602 prophecy of berchan has macbeth wounded in battle and places his death at scone macbeth was succeeded by his stepson lulach who was crowned at scone probably on 8 september 1057 lulach was killed by malcolm by treachery according to annals of tigernach annals of ulster say lulach was killed in battle against malcolm see anderson essh pp 603 604 near huntly on 23 april 1058 after this malcolm became king perhaps being inaugurated on 25 april 1058 although only john of fordun reports this duncan pp 50 51 discusses dating of these events malcolm and ingibiorg if orderic vitalis is to be relied upon one of malcolm s earliest actions as king was to travel to court of edward confessor in 1059 to arrange a marriage with edward s kinswoman margaret who had arrived in england two years before from hungary duncan p 43 ritchie pp 7 8 if a marriage agreement was made in 1059 it was not kept and this may explain scots invasion of northumbria in 1061 when lindisfarne was plundered duncan p 43 oram david i p 21 equally malcolm s raids in northumbria may have been related to disputed kingdom of cumbrians reestablished by earl siward in 1054 which was under malcolm s control by 1070 oram david i p 21 orkneyinga saga reports that malcolm married widow of thorfinn sigurdsson ingibiorg a daughter of finn arnesson orkneyinga saga c 33 duncan pp 42 43 although ingibiorg is generally assumed to have died shortly before 1070 it is possible that she died much earlier around 1058 see duncan pp 42 43 dating ingibiorg s death to 1058 oram david i pp 22 23 dates marriage of malcolm and ingibiorg to c 1065 orkneyinga saga records that malcolm and ingibiorg had a son duncan ii donnchad mac mail coluim who was later king orkneyinga saga c 33 some medieval commentators following william of malmesbury claimed that duncan was illegitimate but this claim is propaganda reflecting need of malcolm s descendants by margaret to undermine claims of duncan s descendants meic uilleim duncan pp 54 55 broun p 196 anderson saec pp 117 119 malcolm s son domnall whose death is reported in 1085 is not mentioned by author of orkneyinga saga he is assumed to have been born to ingibiorg duncan p 55 oram david i p 23 domnall s death is reported in annals of ulster s a 1085 domnall son of mael coluim king of alba ended his life unhappily however it is not certain that domnall s father was this mael coluim m o anderson essh corrigenda p xxi presumes domnall to have been a son of mael coluim mac mail brigti king or mormaer of moray who is called king of scotland in his obituary in 1029 malcolm s marriage to ingibiorg secured him peace in north and west heimskringla tells that her father finn had been an adviser to harald hardraade and after falling out with harald was then made an earl by sweyn estridsson king of denmark which may have been another recommendation for match saga of harald cc 45ff saga of magnus erlingsson c 30 see also oram david i pp 22 23 malcolm enjoyed a peaceful relationship with earldom of orkney ruled jointly by his stepsons paul and erlend thorfinnsson orkneyinga saga reports strife with norway but this is probably misplaced as it associates this with magnus barefoot who became king of norway only in 1093 year of malcolm s death orkneyinga saga cc 39 41 mcdonald kingdom of isles pp 34 37 malcolm and margaret although he had given sanctuary to tostig godwinson when northumbrians drove him out malcolm was not directly involved in ill fated invasion of england by harald hardraade and tostig in 1066 which ended in defeat and death at battle of stamford bridge adam of bremen says that he fought at stamford bridge but he is alone in claiming this anderson saec p 87 n 3 in 1068 he granted asylum to a group of english exiles fleeing from william of normandy among them agatha widow of edward confessor s nephew edward exile and her children edgar aetheling and his sisters margaret and cristina they were accompanied by gospatric earl of northumbria exiles were disappointed however if they had expected immediate assistance from scots oram david i p 23 anderson saec pp 87 90 orderic vitalis states that english asked for malcolm s assistance in 1069 exiles returned to england to join a spreading revolt in north even though gospatric and siward s son waltheof submitted by end of year arrival of a danish army under sweyn estridsson seemed to ensure that william s position remained weak malcolm decided on war and took his army south into cumbria and across pennines wasting and cleveland then marching north loaded with loot to wearmouth there malcolm met edgar and his family who were invited to return with him but did not as sweyn had by now been bought off with a large malcolm took his army home in reprisal william sent gospatric to raid scotland through cumbria in return scots fleet raided northumbrian coast where gospatric s possessions were concentrated duncan pp 44 45 oram david i pp 23 24 late in year perhaps shipwrecked on their way to a european exile edgar and his family again arrived in scotland this time to remain by end of 1070 malcolm had married edgar s sister margaret later known as saint margaret oram david i p 24 clancy st margaret dates marriage to 1072 naming of their children represented a break with traditional scots regal names such as malcolm cinaed and aed point of naming margaret s sons edward after her father edward exile edmund for her grandfather edmund ironside ethelred for her great grandfather ethelred unready and edgar for her great great grandfather edgar and her brother briefly elected king edgar aetheling was unlikely to be missed in england where william of normandy s grasp on power was far from secure malcolm s sons by were probably expected to succeed to kingdom of scots oram david i p 26 whether adoption of classical alexander for future alexander i of scotland either for pope alexander ii or for alexander great and biblical david for future david i of scotland represented a recognition that william of normandy would not be easily removed or was due to repetition of anglo saxon royal name another edmund had preceded edgar is not known oram p 26 margaret also gave malcolm two daughters edith who married henry i of england and mary who married eustace iii of boulogne in 1072 with harrying of north completed and his position again secure william of normandy came north with an army and a fleet malcolm met william at abernethy and in words of anglo saxon chronicle became his man and handed over his eldest son duncan as a hostage and arranged peace between william and edgar oram pp 30 31 anderson saec p 95 accepting overlordship of king of english was no novelty as previous kings had done so without result same was true of malcolm his agreement with english king was followed by further raids into northumbria which led to further trouble in earldom and killing of bishop william walcher at gateshead in 1080 william sent his son robert curthose north with an army while his brother odo punished northumbrians malcolm again made peace and this time kept it for over a decade oram david i p 33 malcolm faced little recorded internal opposition with exception of lulach s son mael snechtai in an unusual entry for anglo saxon chronicle contains little on scotland it says that in 1078 whatever provoked this strife mael snechtai survived until 1085 his death is reported by annals of ulster amongst clerics and described as happy usually a sign that deceased had entered religion malcolm and william rufus thumb left william rufus red king of english 1087 1100 when william rufus became king of england after his father s death malcolm did not intervene in rebellions by supporters of robert curthose which followed in 1091 william rufus confiscated edgar aetheling s lands in england and edgar fled north to scotland in may malcolm marched south not to raid and take slaves and plunder but to besiege newcastle built by robert curthose in 1080 this appears to have been an attempt to advance frontier south from river tweed to river tees threat was enough to bring english king back from normandy where he had been fighting robert curthose in september learning of william rufus s approaching army malcolm withdrew north and english followed unlike in 1072 malcolm was prepared to fight but a peace was arranged by edgar aetheling and robert curthose whereby malcolm again acknowledged overlordship of english king oram david i pp 34 35 anderson saec pp 104 108 in 1092 peace began to break down based on idea that scots controlled much of modern cumbria it had been supposed that william rufus s new castle at carlisle and his settlement of english peasants in surrounds was cause it is unlikely that malcolm controlled cumbria and dispute instead concerned estates granted to malcolm by william rufus s father in 1072 for his maintenance when visiting england malcolm sent messengers to discuss question and william rufus agreed to a meeting malcolm travelled south to gloucester stopping at wilton abbey to visit his daughter edith and sister in law cristina malcolm arrived there on 24 august 1093 to find that william rufus refused to negotiate insisting that dispute be judged by english barons this malcolm refused to accept and returned immediately to scotland duncan pp 47 48 oram david i pp 35 36 anderson saec pp 109 110 it does not appear that william rufus intended to provoke a war oram david i pp 36 37 but as anglo saxon chronicle reports war came malcolm was accompanied by edward his eldest son by margaret and probable heir designate or and by edgar duncan p 54 oram david i p 42 even by standards of time ravaging of northumbria by scots was seen as harsh anderson saec pp 97 113 contains a number of english chronicles condemning malcolm s several invasions of northumbria death thumb memorial cross said to mark spot where king malcolm iii of scotland was killed while besieging alnwick castle in 1093 while marching north again malcolm was ambushed by robert de mowbray earl of northumbria whose lands he had devastated near alnwick on 13 november 1093 there he was killed by morel steward of bamburgh castle conflict became known as battle of alnwick annals of innisfallen say he was slain with his son in an unguarded moment in battle edward was mortally wounded in same fight margaret it is said died soon after receiving news of their deaths from edgar oram pp 37 38 anderson saec pp 114 115 annals of ulster say malcolm s body was taken to tynemouth priory for burial king s body was sent north for reburial in reign of his son alexander at dunfermline abbey or possibly iona anderson saec pp 111 113 m o anderson reprints three regnal lists lists f i and k which give a place of burial for malcolm these say iona dunfermline and tynemouth respectively on 19 june 1250 following canonisation of malcolm s wife margaret by pope innocent iv margaret s remains were disinterred and placed in a reliquary tradition has it that as reliquary was carried to high altar of dunfermline abbey past malcolm s grave it became too heavy to move as a result malcolm s remains were also disinterred and buried next to margaret beside altar dunlop p 93 issue malcolm
