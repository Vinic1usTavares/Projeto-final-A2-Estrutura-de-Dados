masahito ikemoto first became aware of web novel in april 2013 when it began to appear on his twitter feed he was immediately impressed by series use of return by death and how it was a depressing yet surprising twist on fantasy genre and began working with nagatsuki to adapt series into a light novel most light novels are around 250 pages in length but nagatsuki submitted a manuscript of more than 1 000 pages for first novel forcing ikemoto to edit it heavily while nagatsuki wanted to engage in worldbuilding early on ikemoto felt that it was more necessary to make readers feel engaged with characters he ended up rearranging story so that parts focusing on world and its lore were pushed back to third arc of series thumb left alt a drawing of subaru and emilia side by side with close ups of their faces positioned above them japanese text on either side of image early concept art for characters subaru and emilia prior to his involvement in re zero illustrator shinichirou otsuka worked on video games which led him to draw backgrounds first when illustrating series after reading web novel he submitted a number of character designs for major characters to ikemoto subaru s initial design made him look like a delinquent with otsuka later describing it as not face of a boy in his teens leading ikemoto to request that character be more friendly and less fierce so that audience could empathize with him during emotional scenes originally emilia s character design appeared extremely plain so a number of features were added to make her more interesting ikemoto specified that she must fit archetypal heroine mold rem and ram also underwent significant changes from first draft their original designs lacked characteristic hair parts and their maid uniforms were longer and more traditional anime development and production possibility of an anime adaptation came up early in development of series sho tanaka a producer at kadokawa asked ikemoto about properties which might lend themselves to being animated and ikemoto recommended that tanaka read nagatsuki s web novels despite an initial miscommunication which led to ikemoto believing that tanaka wasn t interested talks of adapting series began soon after web novels began transition to print as part of talks for potential anime adaptation ikemoto and tanaka spoke to yoshikawa an animation producer at studio white fox about possibility of his studio animating series hoping to adapt series into an anime similar to steins gate which white fox also produced and having a positive impression of studio as one that did faithful adaptations tanaka then formally approached them about producing show white fox s president contacted yoshikawa for his opinion and yoshikawa recommended they accept as long as series doesn t violate any broadcasting regulations production on anime began sometime after release of fifth novel in october 2014 masaharu watanabe was chosen by yoshikawa to direct series because he had previously worked for studio doing key animation while kyuta sakai was picked to be series character designer and animation director because yoshikawa felt that she would be able to do justice to novel s art and also maintain series animation quality over 25 episodes masahiro yokotani was brought on board to compose anime his first time working on a reborn in another world type story yoshikawa warned him about violence in series but he was still surprised by violent and disturbing scenes in novels three and beyond having only read first novel when he agreed to work on project he delegated writing of those episodes in second cour to other two scriptwriters yoshiko nakamura joined project sometime after masahiro had completed script for episode 3 when it proved unfeasible for yokotani and nakamura to write scripts alone decision was made to bring another scriptwriter on board gaku iwasa president of white fox asked them to hire someone younger leading yokotani to suggest eiji umehara nagatsuki had recently been playing chaos child which umehara had written for and he approved choice suggesting that they let umehara write painful parts umehara was invited to join project around time that scripts for episodes 8 and 9 were being written re zero was first light novel adaptation that either of screenwriters had worked on original author tappei nagatsuki was very active in production of anime attending script meetings and recording sessions when staff would encounter a problem with a scene he would occasionally write lines for them to use as reference while writing script series was not initially intended to have 25 episodes but was extended to give more time to battle with white whale which was expanded from two to three episodes and to content of episode 18 episodes 16 to 18 were originally supposed to be covered in two episodes watanabe s main directive to staff was to capture mood of novel as much as possible scriptwriters had discussions about how to compress dense source material without losing central elements of story and nakamura recalls working with composition notes that went on for pages while planning and scripting anime choosing a proper conclusion was one of most difficult parts for staff and a significant amount of time was devoted to choosing what to cover in final episode which included material not yet covered in light novel after joining project both nakamura and umehara had to adjust their views of main character and were forced to rewrite scenes where they had made subaru appear cool at watanabe s direction nakamura was made to rewrite subaru s telling of red ogre who cried in episode 6 multiple times staff also had difficulty deciding on a song to use for subaru s ringtone that plays during closing scene of episode 19 considering songs like beard song and m by princess princess before settling on yoake no michi from dog of flanders soundtrack while choosing a composer to produce series music director watanabe wanted to choose someone who had hit a nerve with him a fan of drama series watanabe was struck by a piece of music in medical drama death s organ and found that series composer kenichiro suehiro had also worked on a number of his favorite anime and drama series after suehiro was attached to production watanabe gave him three major guidelines use human voices during return by death sequences compose music like he would for a drama or a movie to capture emotional scenes and pull all stops for suspenseful scenes additionally for first cour watanabe asked for music with a suspenseful vibe while requesting music with a romantic feel for second cour both watanabe and suehiro are fans of italian composer ennio morricone and suehiro tried to take inspiration from his works while composing soundtrack watanabe also requested that there be songs that mimicked hans zimmer s score from dark knight while suehiro used music that wasn t very anime ish during most of series he was asked to use more traditional anime music during slice of life scenes a number of times during series such as in episodes 7 and 15 watanabe made it a point to use an entire song something which is unusual in most anime series makes limited use of its opening and ending themes and watanabe has said that he wished he could use them more frequently media web novel re zero web novel was initially
