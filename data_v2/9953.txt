ustredna zidov uz english jewish center was judenrat in bratislava that was imposed on jewish community of axis aligned state of slovakia to implement nazi orders during holocaust it was formed on advice of ss schutzstaffel official dieter wisliceny first leader heinrich schwartz was removed after refusing to cooperate with nazi demands and replaced by ineffectual arpad sebestyen collaborationist department of special affairs run by karol hochberg aided authorities in confiscating jewish property and collecting information that was used to arrest and deport jews nevertheless most of uz members focused on providing opportunities for emigration and improving social welfare of jews remaining in slovakia although they were hampered by dwindling resources of community in addition uz attempted to resist deportation by bribing slovak officials retraining jews who had been expelled from their previous profession and improving and expanding labor camps for jews in slovakia underground resistance organization that ran under its auspices working group took over uz leadership in december 1943 since its formation in early 1942 working group had used uz as cover for its illegal rescue activities after german invasion of slovakia in august 1944 uz was disbanded and many of its members were arrested and deported to concentration camps background on 14 march 1939 slovak state proclaimed its independence from czechoslovakia under german protection jozef tiso a catholic priest was appointed president according to encyclopedia of camps and ghettos persecution of jews was central to domestic policy of slovak state slovak jews were blamed for 1938 first vienna award hungary s annexation of 40 percent of slovakia s arable land and 270 000 people who had declared czechoslovak ethnicity in state sponsored media propagandists claimed that jews were disloyal and a radical solution of jewish issue was necessary for progress of slovak nation in a process overseen by central economic office led by slovak official 12 300 jewish owned businesses were confiscated or liquidated this deprived most slovak jews of their livelihood although jews were initially defined based on religion september 1941 jewish code based on laws defined them by ancestry among code s 270 anti jewish regulations were requirement to wear yellow armbands a ban on intermarriage and conscription of able bodied jews for forced labor according to 1940 census about 89 000 jews slightly more than three percent of population lived in slovak state about two thirds of jews in slovakia were orthodox of whom many were strongly anti zionist other jews belonged to neolog judaism or were zionists influenced by german jewish culture zionists and neologs often formed an alliance against orthodox interests establishment in response to anti jewish measures zionist and neolog leaders set up an umbrella organization called zuu ustredna pre slovenska in late 1939 zuu attempted to negotiate with slovak government to ease anti jewish measures as well as help jews to emigrate and provide education and welfare they tried to convince orthodox jews to join organization to no avail lack of cooperation caused zuu to collapse in september 1940 dieter wisliceny representing adolf eichmann director of jewish section of reich main security office arrived in bratislava as for slovakia his aim was to jewish community so that it became a burden on gentile slovaks who would then agree to deport them on basis of slovak government decree 234 passed 26 september all jewish community organizations were closed down and jews forced to form ustredna zidov jewish center uz first judenrat outside reich and german occupied poland uz was only secular jewish organization allowed to exist in slovakia it inherited property of disbanded jewish organizations it operated under direct control of central economic office and all jews were required to be members its offices were located at multiple addresses in central bratislava leaders of jewish community were divided on how to react to this development some refused to associate with uz in belief that it would be used to implement anti jewish measures but more saw participating in uz as a way to help their fellow jews by delaying implementation of such measures as a result uz was initially dominated by jews who refused to collaborate and focused on charitable projects such as soup kitchens to help those impoverished by anti jewish measures first leader of uz was heinrich schwartz longtime secretary of orthodox jewish community who had been chosen for his fluency in slovak schwartz a respected figure in orthodox community was opposed by zionists and neologs who nevertheless joined uz as a minority initially zionists and neologs worked to undermine schwartz s authority in order to gain influence for themselves they were also worried that schwartz and orthodox faction would collaborate with authorities these fears proved groundless thwarted anti jewish orders to best of his ability by delaying their implementation in particular he sabotaged a census of jews in eastern slovakia with an aim to remove them to west of country wisliceny had him arrested in april 1941 his replacement was arpad sebestyen who took a position of complete cooperation with wisliceny at about this time jewish businesses were being causing massive unemployment many jews who had lost their jobs sought positions in uz with support of central economic office causing introduction of undesirable elements who were willing to collaborate departments emigration uz s emigration department was headed by gisi fleischmann a prewar zionist leader known for her connections to international jewish organizations through embassies and consulates of neutral countries in bratislava and budapest department attempted to help jews immigrate to other countries obstacles to immigration were rarely surmounted but a few jews did manage to immigrate last group of 82 jews left for mandatory palestine in april 1941 welfare uz s main challenge was to provide social welfare to jews who had been deprived of their livelihoods using dwindling resources of jewish community by april 1941 24 767 jews had lost their jobs 76 of those employed in 1939 by august uz was providing welfare to 23 877 jews with 1 500 welfare applications to be considered this consisted of about 3 slovak koruna ks daily per adult and 2 ks per child in addition uz established soup kitchens that fed more than 35 000 people organization also funded a hospital orphanages and homes for elderly it funded healthcare for jews establishing free clinics where jewish doctors practiced this money came from resources inherited from jewish organizations that had been dissolved as well as international organizations especially joint distribution committee uz also levied fees on its own members but due to impoverishment of jews only collected 15 million ks of 50 million ks due to it through july 1941 an attempt to take out a loan on immovable property owned by jews which had not yet been confiscated failed due to central economic office s opposition to giving up its claim to property over time uz s financial situation worsened while demands on it increased due to progressive exclusion of jews from economic life despite its poor financial straits uz provided aid to jews in neighboring countries who were even worse off sending packages to germany protectorate of bohemia and moravia and general government with slovak red cross it also provided food to austrian jews being deported to theresienstadt concentration camp or locations in east in late 1941 uz s budget was cut by one third while it was struggling to provide aid to tens of thousands of jews who had been forcibly relocated from their homes later in 1943 and 1944 uz received significant food supplies and other support from jewish and non jewish organizations in neutral countries while a changed leadership of central economic office more sympathetic to jews released some funds organization was finally able to solve housing crisis and attempted to find work for its unemployed members who absorbed uz s funds and were most vulnerable to deportations in event of a resumption education and culture education and culture department succeeded at keeping most children in school due to an arrangement with jozef sivak minister of education sivak was sympathetic to jews at end of 1940 1941 school year 61 jewish schools instructed 7 941 children however 596 jewish children did not attend school because a jewish school did not exist in their area jews were barred from attending non jewish schools department also published a few books including theodor herzl s jewish state which was first publication to promote zionism however central economic office prevented uz from organizing a cultural academy or summer camps for youth which it characterized as undesirable activities most of jewish schools were later taken over for housing jews displaced by large scale internal relocation of jews in late 1941 educational activities had to cease department also published only jewish newspaper allowed which was called vestnik zidov gazette of jewish center distributed to every jewish household in this gazette uz called for calm and discipline for all jews in fear that a lack of cooperation would cause reprisals for entire jewish community and held out promise of immigration to palestine an increasingly unrealistic proposition kamenec notes that this absolute cooperation and suppression of resistance was exactly what slovak state sought to impose on jews non israelites department for jews who had converted to christianity was largely unsuccessful in exempting converts from anti jewish measures it argued that being forced to wear star of david would have severe consequences from psychological educational family and religious points of view special affairs wisliceny set up a department for special affairs or special tasks on 11 june 1941 to ensure prompt implementation of nazi decrees appointing an ambitious unprincipled viennese jew named karol hochberg as its director main task of department was collecting statistical data to be used in future forced relocations on 4 october 1941 slovak government ordered 11 466 jews from bratislava those not employed or intermarried to relocate to fourteen smaller towns zvolen presov humenne liptovsky mikulas nove mesto nad nitra zilina topolcany trnava and nova ves uz was forced to pay for their relocation which hochberg s office supervised to be more efficient he reorganized department into six subdivisions for registering jews tracking down those who did not report for deportation keeping track of stolen property and so forth more than 160 000 ks in property was confiscated despite fact that affected jews were poorer than average hochberg personally embezzled some of confiscated furniture to bribe wisliceny according to official statistics 5 679 people had been relocated by beginning of december and a total of 6 720 had been moved to towns by end of march this did not include some who had been imprisoned in labor camps due to sebestyen s hochberg s department came to dominate operations of uz during 1942 deportations hochberg s department worked on categorizing jews these records were used by various slovak agencies such as central economic office and hlinka guard for preparing lists of jews to be deported andrej steiner an employee of uz who was involved in working group tipped off slovak police to hochberg s acceptance of bribes from working group on behalf of wisliceny hochberg was arrested in november 1942 and jailed for corruption although hochberg s collaborationism was strongly opposed by much of uz leadership it tarnished uz s reputation in jewish community which persisted even years after hochberg had lost power retraining and labor camps thumb barracks at sered labor camp as an outgrowth of work of welfare department a retraining department led by oskar neumann ran retraining courses for jews put out of work supposedly in preparation for emigration to palestine however neumann was able to use his position in order to extend aid to zionist youth movements which had been banned by february 1941 13 612 people had applied for these courses but only a few could be accommodated in june 63 courses were retraining 1 300 jews for agricultural work craft retraining programs were more difficult to organize because jewish businesses were rapidly liquidated nevertheless by july there were 605 participants in such courses many graduates later worked in labor camps in slovakia uz paid for courses which included instruction in hebrew language and life in future jewish state in a further step to reduce unemployment uz established labor camps and centers an activity approved by an april 1941 decree although this effort was connected to discriminatory conscription of all jewish men aged 18 60 for labor it had a beneficial effect for unemployed jews first center was established at in spring 1941 by september about 5 500 jews were working at 80 sites companies employing jews enjoyed cheap labor but uz had to subsidize their wages to meet legal minimum by end of year most of these centers were dissolved officially due to harsh weather conditions according to slovak historian ivan kamenec real reason was that slovak state was planning to deport jewish workers instead three larger camps were established at sered novaky and vyhne uz financed construction of these camps in fall of 1941 however government began to discourage construction because it planned to deport jews instead in fall of 1941 during deportations welfare department provided aid to jews forced into concentration centers for deportation providing blankets and other supplies to indigent jews to take with them however its efforts were inadequate to alleviate poor housing food and sanitary conditions during deportations desperate slovak jewish leadership tried to use camps as a way to save jews imprisoned there alois director of camps and others were bribed to prevent deportation of jews working in camps but many local commanders ignored their instructions to this effect sered and novaky were used as concentration centers and their workers targeted for deportation on last trains of autumn 1942 jews deported from slovakia had to sign a declaration surrendering their remaining property to uz 2 500 jews out of 18 945 legally present were living in these three camps at end of 1942 in march 1943 central office for jewish labor camps ustredna kancelaria pre zidov was established in order to increase production in labor camps central office also improved conditions in camps by constructing new buildings and staging cultural activities for prisoners bribery of labor camp guards continued in order to ease life for inmates appeals during 1942 deportations a department of appeals led by tibor kovac was formed in order to ensure that exemptions from deportation would be honored department also helped jews apply for exemptions workers in this department went to great lengths to save jews some were arrested and deported while attempting to obtain release of jews from detention centers there is little information on how much success it had illegal resistance in summer 1941 several uz members dissatisfied with department of special affairs gathered around gisi fleischmann who began holding meetings for nascent resistance group in her office in 1942 this group was eventually formalized into an underground organization known as working group it was an alliance of ideological factions in uz led by fleischmann and anti zionist orthodox rabbi michael dov weissmandl other members included oskar neumann tibor kovac neolog rabbi armin frieder and apolitical architect andrej steiner israeli historian livia rothkirchen emphasizes that members of working group operated in dual capacities as resistance members and official representatives coordinating legal and illegal activities which makes it difficult to draw a distinction between two groups activities she also notes that successes of working group were due in large part to official standing of uz censorship of correspondence and this newsletter intensified in early 1942 during deportations in order to prevent uz from warning jewish population after news of forthcoming deportations was leaked on 3 march 1942 many jews came to uz offices in bratislava to confirm rumors several uz officials signed a petition detailing economic arguments for retaining jews in slovakia and mailed it illegally to tiso chairman of uz arpad sebestyen also wrote a petition arguing that jews could serve as a source of cheap labor in slovakia to profit of slovak companies and sent it illegally to slovak parliament these efforts failed to halt or delay deportations despite censorship uz managed to insert covert warnings into official circulars later working group attempted to prevent deportation of jews by bribing german and slovak officials sebestyen was aware of activities of working group and made no effort to stop them neither did he report them to authorities in december 1943 a reorganization of slovak government caused sebestyen to be let go jewish community was allowed to choose his successor and working group voted unanimously for oskar neumann one of its members effectively taking over uz neumann focused on restoring reputation of uz in jewish community working group activists even distributed information about rescue operations in official uz messages dissolution thumb alt a large number of people with their belongings getting off a train jews from carpathian ruthenia arrive at auschwitz may 1944 because of germany s imminent military defeat much of slovak populace and leadership of army switched its allegiance to allies increasing partisan activity in mountains caused a dilemma for jews and leadership in particular slovak government ordered removal of jews from eastern slovakia uz leadership was able to avoid their resettlement in camps on 29 august 1944 germany invaded slovakia in response to increase in partisan sabotage same day slovak national uprising was launched but it was crushed by end of october jews who fought with partisans in substantial numbers were blamed for uprising providing germans with an excuse to implement final solution eichmann sent ss hauptsturmfuhrer alois brunner to bratislava to oversee deportation and murder of some 25 000 surviving jews in slovakia immediately after german invasion neumann disbanded uz and told its members to go into hiding or flee uz employees suffered same fate as remaining slovak jews most were deported to concentration camps among prominent uz members hochberg was executed as a collaborator by jewish partisans during uprising fleischmann was killed in auschwitz concentration camp and neumann survived in theresienstadt frieder steiner and kovac were able to avoid deportation frieder died in 1946 of a heart condition steiner emigrated to united states and kovac killed himself in 1952 after suffering harassment from secret police references notes citations bibliography further reading category
