thumb upright 1 35 therapeutic yoga workshop jakarta 2016 yoga as therapy is use of yoga as exercise consisting mainly of postures called asanas as a gentle form of exercise and relaxation applied specifically with intention of improving health this form of yoga is widely practised in classes and may involve meditation imagery breath work pranayama and music at least three types of health claim have been made for yoga magical claims for medieval hatha yoga including power of healing unsupported claims of benefits to organ systems from practice of asanas and more or less well supported claims of specific medical and psychological benefits from studies of differing sizes using a wide variety of methodologies systematic reviews have found beneficial effects of yoga on low back pain and depression but despite much investigation little or no evidence for benefit for specific medical conditions study of trauma sensitive yoga has been hampered by weak methodology context thumb upright 1 7 different schools teach yoga with emphasis on aerobic exercise such as bikram yoga precision in asanas like iyengar yoga or spirituality like sivananda yoga unbranded hatha yoga not to be confused with medieval hatha yoga may teach any combination of these yoga classes used as therapy usually consist of asanas postures used for stretching pranayama breathing exercises and relaxation in lying down physical asanas of modern yoga are related to medieval hatha yoga tradition but they were not widely practiced in india before early 20th century number of schools and styles of yoga in western world has grown rapidly from late 20th century by 2012 there were at least 19 widespread styles from ashtanga vinyasa yoga to viniyoga these emphasise different aspects including aerobic exercise precision in asanas and spirituality in hatha yoga tradition these aspects can be illustrated by schools with distinctive styles thus bikram yoga has an aerobic exercise style with rooms heated to and a fixed sequence of 2 breathing exercises and 26 asanas performed in every session iyengar yoga emphasises correct alignment in postures working slowly if necessary with props and ending with relaxation sivananda yoga focuses more on spiritual practice with 12 basic poses chanting in sanskrit pranayama breathing exercises meditation and relaxation in each class and importance is placed on vegetarian diet types of claim at least three different types of claim of therapeutic benefit have been made for yoga from medieval times onwards not counting more general claims of good health made throughout this period magical powers biomedical claims for marketing purposes and specific medical claims neither of first two are supported by reliable evidence medical claims are supported by evidence of varying quality from case studies to controlled trials and ultimately systematic review of multiple trials magical powers medieval authors asserted that hatha yoga brought physical as well as spiritual benefits and provided magical powers including of healing hatha yoga pradipika hyp states that asanas in general described as first auxiliary of hatha yoga give steadiness good health and lightness of limb hyp 1 17 specific asanas it claims bring additional benefits for example matsyendrasana awakens kundalini and helps to prevent semen from being shed involuntarily hyp 1 27 paschimottanasana stokes up digestive fire slims belly and gives good health hyp 1 29 shavasana takes away fatigue and relaxes mind hyp 1 32 while padmasana destroys all diseases hyp 1 47 these claims lie within a tradition across all forms of yoga that practitioners can gain supernatural powers hemachandra s yogashastra 1 8 9 lists magical powers which include healing and destruction of poisons biomedical claims for marketing purposes thumb styles of yoga differ in their approach to asanas iyengar yoga emphasises correctness seen here as a practitioner uses a yoga brick to attain correct alignment in utthitha trikonasana twentieth century advocates of some schools of yoga such as b k s iyengar have for various reasons made claims for effects of yoga on specific organs without any evidence yoga scholar suzanne newcombe argues that this was one of several visions of yoga as in some sense therapeutic ranging from medical to a more popular offer of health and well being yoga scholar andrea jain describes these claims of iyengar s in terms of elaborating and fortifying his yoga brand and mass marketing calling iyengar s 1966 book light on yoga arguably most significant event in process of elaborating brand yoga teacher bernie gourley notes that book neither describes contraindications systematically nor provides evidence for claimed benefits jain suggests that its biomedical dialect was attractive to many for example in book iyengar claims that asanas of eka pada sirsasana cycle history of such claims was reviewed by william j broad in his 2012 book science of yoga broad argues that while health claims for yoga began as hindu nationalist posturing it turns out that there is ironically a wealth of real benefits remedial yoga newcombe notes that iyengar was sickly as a child and that yoga with his brother in law krishnamacharya had improved his health it had also helped his daughter geeta so his response to his students health issues was an intense and personal one in effect newcombe argues iyengar was treating remedial yoga as analogous to henrik ling s medical gymnastics as early as 1940 iyengar was using yoga as a therapy for common conditions such as sinus problems backache and fatigue iyengar was willing to push people through pain to show them new possibilities in 1960s he trained a few people such as diana clifton and silva mehta to deliver this remedial yoga particular asanas were used for different conditions and non remedial iyengar yoga teachers were taught to tell students that ordinary classes were not suitable for serious health issues mehta taught a remedial yoga class in iyengar yoga institute in maida vale from its opening in 1984 she contributed remedial programs for conditions such as arthritis backache knee cartilage problems pregnancy sciatica scoliosis and varicose veins in 1990 book yoga iyengar way however iyengar was deferential to western medicine and its assessments so in newcombe s view iyengar yoga is positioned as complementary to standard medical treatment rather than as an alternative newcombe argues that in britain yoga largely avoided overt conflict with medical profession by simultaneously professionalising with educational qualifications and deferring to medical expertise after richard s yoga for health series on itv from 1971 to 1974 series producer howard kent founded a charity yoga for health foundation to research into therapeutic benefits to be obtained by practice of yoga residential courses began in 1978 at bury in bedfordshire foundation stated that yoga was not a therapy or cure but had therapeutic benefits whether physical mental or emotional and it worked especially with physically handicapped newcombe notes that a third organisation yoga biomedical trust was founded in cambridge in 1983 by a biologist robin monro to research complementary therapies he found it hard to obtain research funding and in 1990s moved to london focusing on training yoga teachers in yoga as therapy and providing yoga as individualised therapy using pranayama relaxation and asanas sports medicine from point of view of sports medicine asanas function as active stretches helping to protect muscles from injury these need to be performed equally on both sides stronger side first if used for physical rehabilitation evidence based medical claims researchers have studied medical and psychological effects of yoga as exercise in a wide range of trials and observational studies sometimes with careful controls providing evidence of differing quality about yoga s possible benefits physician and yoga therapist timothy mccall has assembled an extensive list of studies grouped by condition providing evidence of varying quality for 117 health conditions helped by yoga he notes irony that in yoga therapy we don t treat medical conditions per se we treat individuals various types of claim and evidence for them are discussed below research methodology much of research on therapeutic use of yoga has been in form of preliminary studies or clinical trials of low methodological quality including small sample sizes inadequate control and blinding lack of randomization and high risk of bias further research is needed to quantify benefits and to clarify mechanisms involved for example a 2010 literature review on use of yoga for depression stated although results from these trials are encouraging they should be viewed as very preliminary because trials as a group suffered from substantial methodological limitations a 2015 systematic review on effect of yoga on mood and brain recommended that future clinical trials should apply more methodological rigour mechanisms thumb a yoga class relaxing in supta there is evidence that yoga relieves stress by multiple mechanisms practice of asanas has been claimed to improve flexibility strength and balance to alleviate stress and anxiety and to reduce symptoms of lower back pain without necessarily demonstrating precise mechanisms involved a review of five studies noted that three psychological positive affect mindfulness self compassion and four biological mechanisms posterior hypothalamus interleukin 6 c reactive protein and cortisol that might act on stress had been examined empirically whereas many other potential mechanisms remained to be studied four of mechanisms positive affect self compassion inhibition of posterior hypothalamus and salivary cortisol were found to mediate yoga s effect on stress low back pain back pain is one reason people take up yoga and since at least 1960s some practitioners have claimed that it relieved their symptoms a 2013 systematic review on use of yoga for low back pain found strong evidence for short and long term effects on pain and moderate evidence for long term benefit in back specific disability with no serious adverse events ten randomised controlled trials were analysed of which eight had a low risk of bias outcomes measured included improvements in pain back specific disability generic disability health related quality of life and global improvement review stated that yoga can be recommended as an additional therapy to chronic low back pain patients mental disorders thumb upright trauma sensitive yoga has been developed in usa in hope of benefiting individuals suffering from psychological trauma trauma sensitive yoga has been developed by david emerson and others of trauma center at justice resource institute in brookline massachusetts center uses yoga alongside other treatments to support recovery from traumatic episodes and to enable healing from ptsd workers including bessel van der and richard miller have studied how clients can regain comfort in their bodies counteract rumination and improve self regulation through yoga a 2018 systematic review of 12 studies that had individually found positive effects compared to their control groups was unable to find strong evidence of benefit from yoga for post traumatic stress disorder depression or anxiety following traumatic experiences and called for more rigorous study design a 2013 systematic review on use of yoga for depression found moderate evidence of short term benefit over usual care and limited evidence compared to relaxation and aerobic exercise only 3 of 12 randomised controlled trials had a low risk of bias diversity of studies precluded analysis of long term effects a 2015 systematic review on effect of yoga on mood and brain concluded that yoga is associated with better regulation of sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal system as well as a decrease in depressive and anxious symptoms in a range of populations a systematic review in 2017 found some evidence of benefit in major depressive disorder examining outcomes primarily of improvements in remission rates and severity of depression and secondarily of anxiety and adverse events but considered that better randomised controlled trials were required cardiovascular health a 2012 survey of yoga in australia notes that there is good evidence for example survey by penman and stevens cites that yoga and its associated healthy lifestyle often vegetarian usually non smoking preferring organic food drinking less or no alcohol are beneficial for cardiovascular health but that there was little apparent uptake of yoga to address existing cardiovascular conditions and risk factors yoga was cited by respondents as a cause of these lifestyle changes survey notes that relative importance of various factors had not been assessed other conditions there is little reliable evidence that yoga is beneficial for specific medical conditions and an increasing amount of evidence that it is not as follows a systematic review in 2013 found weak evidence for use of yoga for rheumatic diseases examining outcomes of pain and disability with no evidence of its safety a 2015 systematic review found no evidence of benefit in treatment of epilepsy or menopause related symptoms according to american cancer society practice of yoga can improve strength and balance in cancer patients is unlikely to cause harm and does not interfere with cancer treatment society notes that yoga cannot cure cancer but that yoga may help to improve quality of life in cancer survivors as shown in a randomised controlled trial of women who had had breast cancer measured outcomes included fatigue depression and sleep quality a systematic review in 2015 found promising evidence that exercise helps people with dementia perform activities of daily living adls but no evidence that cognition neuropsychiatric symptoms or depression were benefited yoga was not distinguished from other forms of exercise a 2010 systematic review showed no effect of yoga on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder measured by teacher rating on adhd overall scale a systematic review in 2019 concluded that there was not enough evidence to be able to assess effectiveness of yoga for treating women with urinary incontinence safety although relatively safe yoga is not a risk free form of exercise sensible precautions can usefully be taken for example avoidance of advanced moves by beginners not combining practice with psychoactive drug use and avoiding competitiveness a small percentage of yoga practitioners each year suffer physical injuries
