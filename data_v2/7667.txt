profetica originally began as a cover band performing popular reggae songs in small bars and clubs before beginning to perform original music in spanish shortly after transitioning to perform original music group adopted name cultura profetica which was inspired by view that music is a voice of culture and is prophetic because reggae music that we love and that influenced us is from 70s with themes of what s happening now that can affect our future according to guitarist bassist omar silva many of original members of group attended escuela elemental and escuela of university of puerto rico an institution noted for its progressive and experimental teaching approaches vocalist bassist willy rodriguez commented it is a school in which you are allowed to decide a few things on your own you have free time between classes when you can do your own things and there is a lot of musical culture in school it tends to allow you to explore your artistic interests there was always an air of liberation of thinking on your own i think that influenced a lot in what we do today musically and ideologically group members boris bilbraut willy rodriguez eliut gonzalez juan costa and ivan began
