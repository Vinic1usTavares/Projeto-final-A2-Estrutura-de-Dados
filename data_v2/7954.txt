contre amiral pierre martin led a squadron of ships out to contest british operations off corsica there was initial success when frigate boudeuse attacked and captured sardinian frigate alceste off frejus on 8 june but three days later martin was forced to retreat from main strength of british fleet under lord hood french anchored in gourjean bay and although hood planned a number of attacks on french position ultimately it was decided that martin was too well protected and a blockade was put in place instead martin was able to escape blockade in november and return to toulon without further incident captured alceste formerly a french ship captured in 1793 was taken to nice and returned to service with french navy frigate went on to play a crucial role at action of 8 march 1795 and came under heavy fire at battle of hyeres islands trying to save a damaged french ship of line alceste was eventually captured once more by british in 1799 background a few months after entry of great britain into french revolutionary wars in february 1793 a large royal navy fleet was sent to operate in mediterranean james p 65 their principal mission was a blockade of toulon main base for french

fleet hood turned his attention to french held island of corsica then in open rebellion ireland p 195 in ensuing invasion of corsica hood s forces allied with corsican irregulars to attack first san fiorenzo and then bastia besieging french garrisons of corsican towns and forcing them to surrender clowes p 244 martin s cruise in toulon command of french fleet had been granted to contre amiral pierre martin who was assembling a 15 ship convoy to supply corsica and raise siege of bastia a squadron of his less damaged ships comprising seven ships of line and several frigates was to escort convoy after bastia fell to british on 19 may original plans for french relief convoy were abandoned but martin decided to offer a challenge to british hegemony in ligurian sea and sailed with his squadron for a cruise in region on 6 june troude p 367 it is reported that shortly after departure french squadron sighted a 10 ship british squadron to south and formed a line of battle but british refused engagement sailed by at a distance of turned and disappeared next day troude p 368 there is no mention of this encounter in british histories james p 192 news of martin s activity soon reached hood then at anchor with 13 ships of line off bastia and he ordered alceste operating as part of his fleet under a captain ross to sail from bastia to french coast to warn british ships operating off toulon catching alceste on 8 june 1794 as french squadron passed eastwards along coast lookouts spotted an unidentified sail between squadron and shore this ship was alceste martin s squadron then approached ship flying false british ensigns which fooled ross alceste approached squadron with confidence and his crew only realised their mistake when it was too late to escape martin sent 32 gun frigate boudeuse in chase and frigate successfully overhauled alceste some to windward of french squadron boudeuse and alceste fought for two hours smaller french ship taking serious damage to its rigging and mainmast from gunfire of alceste ross was unable however to escape his opponent and this allowed 80 gun ship of line tonnant to pull within range recognising that further resistance was hopeless ross allowed tonnant to fire three shots before he struck his colours boudeuse was so damaged that martin sent ship back to toulon for repairs although alceste was mostly intact and was sent to nice under a prize crew with captured 14 gun merchant brig expedition taken same day by frigate serieuse while sailing from bastia to livorno retreat to gourjean bay within hours of victory over alceste martin was being hunted by hood and main british mediterranean fleet on 10 june hood discovered french squadron and gave chase martin retreated before larger british fleet leading hood by about at 14 00 on 11 june martin reached sheltered anchorage at gourjean bay his rearmost ships exchanging fire with hms dido under captain george henry towry as they entered bay which was protected by forts overlooking anchorage clowes p 246 as it entered bay french squadron was becalmed and had to be taken in tow by their launches before they could anchor in suitable positions hood intended to lead his fleet into bay and bring martin to battle issuing detailed plans of attack to his captains but calm forestalled this effort and gave martin time to remove cannon from his ships and erect batteries on shore significantly strengthening his position hood ordered fireships to be readied but these weapons were driven back on approaching bay by french forts and batteries hood then withdrew with part of his fleet to ongoing siege of calvi leaving a force under vice admiral william hotham to blockade french hotham trapped martin s division in bay for five months and it was not until 2 november that it returned to toulon troude p 369 after a storm drove off hotham s squadron james p 193 aftermath with martin unable to influence operations on corsica calvi fell to british in august and corsica became a self governing part of british empire james p 192 martin continued with repairs to fleet so that by march 1795 he was able to deploy 17 ships on a renewed operation in ligurian sea james p 255 with this fleet was alceste which fought at action of 8 march 1795 when british ship of line badly damaged in a storm was chased down and captured by a division of martin s fleet troude p 426 alceste led attack and although badly damaged frigate was able to kill british captain and delay berwick until heavier support could arrive james p 255 later in year alceste was with
