olympic athletics champion marjorie jackson nelson as key inspirational moments in her career morgan learned to swim at bankstown at age of 7 she was initially slow to learn and her coach used a long

australia was favourite for relay having swept medals in individual 100 metre event fraser crapp and leech finished first second and third howell p 131 favouritism was even more marked because fraser
