lockheed xf 104 starfighter was a single engine high performance supersonic interceptor prototype for a united states air force usaf series of lightweight and simple fighters only two aircraft were built one aircraft was used primarily for aerodynamic research and other served as an armament testbed both aircraft being destroyed in accidents during testing bowman 2000 p 33 xf 104s were forerunners of over 2 500 production lockheed f 104 starfighters during korean war usaf fighter pilots were outclassed by mig equipped soviet pilots lockheed engineers led by kelly johnson designed and submitted a novel design to air force notable for its particularly its thin wings and missile shaped fuselage as well as a novel pilot ejection system flight testing of xf 104s began with first flight in march 1954 encountering several problems some of which were resolved however performance of xf 104 proved better than estimates and despite both prototypes being lost through accidents usaf ordered 17 service test pre production yf production starfighters proved popular both with usaf and internationally serving with a number of countries including jordan turkey and japan development clarence l kelly johnson chief engineer at lockheed s skunk works visited korea in december 1951 and talked to fighter pilots about what sort of aircraft they wanted at time u s air force pilots were confronting mig 15 fagot in their north american f 86 sabres and many of pilots felt that migs were superior to larger and more complex american design pilots requested a small and simple aircraft with excellent performance bowman 2000 p 26 one pilot in particular colonel gabby gabreski was quoted as saying i d rather sight with a piece of chewing gum stuck on windscreen and told johnson that radar was a waste of time bowman 2000 p 26 thumb left an original johnson sketch alt four sketch drawings of an aircraft on his return to u s johnson immediately started design of just such an aircraft realising that an official requirement would soon be published in march 1952 his team was assembled and they sketched several different aircraft proposals ranging from small designs at 8 000 lb 3 6 t to fairly large ones at 50 000 lb 23 t l 246 as design became known remained essentially identical to model l 083 starfighter as eventually delivered bowman 2000 p 32 design was presented to air force in november 1952 who were interested enough to create a new proposal inviting several companies to participate three additional designs were received republic ap 55 an improved version of its prototype xf 91 north american na 212 which would eventually evolve into f 107 and northrop n 102 fang a new general electric j79 powered design although all were interesting lockheed had an insurmountable lead and was granted a development contract in march 1953 bowman 2000 p 32 test data from earlier lockheed x 7 unmanned ramjet rocket program proved invaluable for aerodynamic research since xf 104 would share general design of x 7 s wing and tail reed 1981 p 10 upton 2003 p 13 experience gained from douglas x 3 stiletto was also used in design phase of xf 104 bowman 2000 p 27 over 400 surplus instrumented artillery rockets were launched to test various airfoils and tail designs from which camera film and telemetry were recovered by parachute upton 2003 p 14 wooden mock up was ready for inspection at end of april and work started on two prototypes late in may j79 engine was not yet ready so both prototypes were instead designed to use wright j65 a licensed built version of armstrong siddeley sapphire construction of first prototype xf 104 us serial number 53 7786 buzz number fg 786 began in summer 1953 at lockheed s burbank california factory this aircraft was powered by a non afterburning buick built wright j65 b 3 turbojet first prototype was completed by early 1954 and started flying in march total time from award of contract to first flight was only one year a very short time even then and unheard of today when 10 15 years is more typical upton 2003 p 13 construction of second prototype s n 53 7787 proceeded at a slower pace f 104 production official approval of xf 104 design led to a contract for 17 yf 104a service test aircraft and a production run of over 2 500 aircraft built both in united states and under license worldwide visible changes from xf 104 to production versions of starfighter include a longer fuselage to accommodate j79 engine and extra internal fuel and a forward retracting nose landing gear except two seat versions to increase clearance for downward ejecting seat a ventral fin for increased stability was added during yf 104a test program inlet shock cones and a fuselage spine fairing between canopy and fin that housed fuel piping were further added features bowman 2000 p 32 upton 2003 p 38 gunston w l ed f 104 holder of absolute records for speed and altitude flight international 30 may 1958 p 743 retrieved 29 june 2011 production aircraft would also feature a redesigned fin structure using stainless steel spars to eliminate flutter problem upton 2003 p 45 since internal fuel capacity was low limiting useful range of aircraft extra capacity was provided on later versions by lengthening forward fuselage design in order to achieve desired performance lockheed chose a minimalist approach a design that would achieve high performance by wrapping lightest most aerodynamically efficient airframe possible around a single powerful engine emphasis was on minimizing drag and mass bowman 2000 p 29 xf 104 had a radical wing design most supersonic jets use a swept or delta wing this allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance lift and internal space for fuel and equipment however most efficient shape for high speed supersonic flight had been found to be a small straight mid mounted trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading wing was extremely thin with a thickness to chord ratio of only 3 4 leading edges of wing were so thin 0 016 in 0 41 mm and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations thinness of wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in fuselage hydraulic actuators driving ailerons were only one inch 25 mm thick to fit into available space and were known as piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed xf 104 did not feature boundary layer control system of production aircraft bowman 2000 p 28 thumb wooden mock up alt black and white photograph of male personnel working on a wooden mock up of jet aircraft after extensive wind tunnel testing was mounted at top of fin for optimum stability and control about pitch axis bowman 2000 p 28 because vertical tail fin was only slightly shorter than length of each wing and nearly as aerodynamically effective it could act as a wing on rudder application a phenomenon known as dutch roll to offset this effect wings were angled downward to give 10deg anhedral rudder was manually operated and supplemented by a small yaw damper surface mounted at bottom of fin bowman 2000 p 28 fuselage of xf 104 had a high fineness ratio i e tapering sharply towards nose and a small frontal area of upton 2003 p 17 fuselage was tightly packed containing cockpit avionics cannon all internal fuel landing gear and engine bowman 2000 p 29 air intakes designed by ben rich were of fixed geometry without inlet cones since j65 powered aircraft was incapable of mach 2 performance they were similar to those of f 94 starfire being mounted slightly away from fuselage with an inner splitter plate for boundary layer bleed air combination of these features provided extremely low drag except at high angle of attack at which point induced drag became very high xf 104 featured an unusual downward ejecting stanley b seat it was feared that contemporary ejection seat designs would not have enough explosive power to clear high t tail assembly in event of seat not firing it was possible to manually release lower fuselage hatch and then exit aircraft via gravity f 104 series aircraft would later convert to upward ejecting seats but fuselage hatch was retained as a useful maintenance

28 february 1954 xf 104 made a planned hop of about five feet off ground during a high speed taxi but its first official flight took place on 4 march pace 1992 p 17 during that flight landing gear did not retract and levier landed after a low speed flight of about 20 minutes jenkins and landis 2008 p 168 adjustments and further flights discovered that problem was low pressure in hydraulic system

powered by non afterburning j65 but mach 1 could be easily exceeded during a slight descent in july 1954 j65 b 3 was replaced by afterburning j65 w 7 turbojet with this engine installed performance of
