revolution is a song by english rock band beatles written by john lennon and credited to lennon mccartney three versions of song were recorded in 1968 all during sessions for beatles self titled double album also known as white album a slow bluesy arrangement titled revolution 1 that would make final cut for lp an abstract sound collage titled revolution 9 that originated as latter part of revolution 1 and appears on same album and faster hard rock version similar to revolution 1 released as b side of hey jude single although single version was issued first it was recorded several weeks after revolution 1 as a remake specifically intended for release as a single inspired by political protests in early 1968 lennon s lyrics expressed sympathy with need for change but doubt in regard to some of tactics when single version was released in august political left viewed it as betraying their cause release of revolution 1 in november indicated lennon s uncertainty about destructive change with phrase count me out recorded instead as count me out in although lennon subsequently espoused need for maoist political revolution particularly with his 1971 single power to people in one of final interviews he gave before his death in 1980 he reaffirmed pacifist sentiments expressed in revolution in 1987 song became first beatles recording to be licensed for a television commercial which prompted a lawsuit from surviving members of group background and composition in early 1968 media coverage in aftermath of tet offensive spurred increased protests in opposition to vietnam war especially among university students protests were most prevalent in united states but on 17 march 25 000 demonstrators marched to american embassy in london s grosvenor square and violently clashed with police major protests concerning other political issues made international news such as march 1968 protests in poland against their communist government and campus uprisings of may 1968 in france upheaval reflected increased politicisation of 1960s youth movement and rise of new left ideology in a contrast with hippie ideology behind 1967 summer of love for these students and activists maoist philosophy of cultural revolution purging society of its non progressive elements provided a model for social change by and large beatles had avoided publicly expressing their political views in their music with taxman being their only overtly political track thus far viewed as leaders of counterculture band particularly john lennon were under pressure from leninist trotskyist and maoist groups to actively support revolutionary cause lennon decided to write a song about recent wave of social upheaval while beatles were in rishikesh india studying transcendental meditation he recalled i thought it was about time we spoke about it same as i thought it was about time we stopped not answering about vietnamese war in 1966 i had been thinking about it up in hills in india lennon began writing song there and completed it in england in may inspired especially by events in france thumb left upright 0 8 chairman mao zedong is referenced in song despite lennon s antiwar feelings he had yet to become anti establishment and expressed in revolution that he wanted to see plan from those advocating toppling system in author mark hertsgaard s description lyrics advocate social change but emphasise that political actions should be judged on moral rather than ideological grounds repeated phrase it s gonna be alright came directly from lennon s transcendental meditation experiences in india conveying idea that god would take care of human race no matter what happened politically another influence on lennon was his burgeoning relationship with avant garde artist yoko ono and her espousal of sex politics as an alternative to maoist doctrine and other hardline philosophies adopted by political left lennon credited ono with awakening him from his passive mindset of previous year around fourth week of may 1968 beatles met at kinfauns george harrison s home in esher to demonstrate their compositions to each other in preparation for recording their next studio album a recording from that informal session released in white album s super deluxe version shows that revolution had two of its three verses intact lines referencing mao zedong but if you go carrying pictures of chairman mao you ain t gone make it with anyone anyhow were added in studio while filming a promotional clip later that year lennon told director that it was most important lyric in song recording revolution 1 beatles began recording sessions for their new album on 30 may starting with revolution 1 simply titled revolution for first few sessions at this first session they concentrated on recording basic rhythm track take 18 lasted 10 17 much longer than earlier takes and it was this take that was chosen for additional overdubs recorded over next two sessions full take 18 was officially released in 2018 as part of super deluxe edition of beatles coinciding with album s fiftieth anniversary during overdubs which brought recording to take 20 lennon took unusual step of performing his lead vocal while lying on floor he also altered one line into ambiguous you can count me out in he later explained that he included both because he was undecided in his sentiments revolution 1 has a blues style performed at a relaxed tempo electric guitar heard in intro shows a blues influence and shoo bee do wop backing vocals are a reference to doo wop music basic time signature is or in a shuffle style but song has several extra half length bars during verses there are also two extra beats at end of last chorus result of an accidental bad edit during mixing process that was left uncorrected at lennon s request take 20 low quality monitor mixes of full length version of revolution appeared on various bootlegs such as from kinfauns to chaos throughout 1990s in 2009 a high quality version labelled revolution take 20 appeared on bootleg cd revolution take your knickers off release triggered considerable interest among media and fans of group this version rm1 remix in mono 1 of take 20 runs to 10 minutes 46 seconds at correct speed and was created at end of 4 june session with a copy taken away by lennon it was an attempt by lennon to augment full length version of revolution in a way that satisfied him before he chose to split piece between edited revolution 1 and musique concrete revolution 9 bootlegged recording starts with engineer geoff emerick announcing remix as rm1 of take and then momentarily forgetting take number which lennon jokingly finishes with take your knickers off and let s go hence name of bootleg cd first half of recording is almost identical to released track revolution 1 it lacks electric guitar and horn overdubs of final version but features two tape loops in key of a same as song that are faded in and out at various points after final chorus song launches into an extended coda similar to that in hey jude album version only features about 40 seconds of this coda beyond point where album version fades out basic instrumental backing keeps repeating while vocals and overdubs become increasingly chaotic harrison and paul mccartney repeatedly sing dada mama in a childlike register lennon s histrionic vocals are randomly distorted in speed a little of this can be heard in fade of revolution 1 and radio tuning noises a la i am walrus appear several elements of this coda appear in officially released revolution 9 throughout body of that song lennon s histrionic vocal track periodically appears albeit minus speed distortion as do tape loops after band track ends song moves into avant garde territory with yoko ono reciting some prose over a portion of song hamsa by farid al atrash possibly captured live from radio ono s piece begins with words maybe it s not that with her voice trailing off at end mccartney jokingly replies it is that as piece continues lennon quietly mumbles gonna be alright a few times then follows a brief piano riff some comments from lennon and ono on how well track has preceded and final appearances of tape loops most of this coda was lifted for end of revolution 9 with a little more piano at beginning which monitor mixes reveal was present in earlier mixes of revolution and minus lennon s or harrison s joking reply splitting of revolution 1 and revolution 9 lennon soon decided to divide existing ten minute recording into two parts a more conventional beatles track and an avant garde sound collage within days after take 20 work began on revolution 9 using last six minutes of take as a starting point numerous sound effects tape loops and overdubs were recorded and compiled over several sessions almost exclusively by lennon and ono although harrison provided assistance for spoken overdubs with more than 40 sources used for revolution 9 only small portions of take 20 coda are heard in final mix most prominent from take 20 are lennon s multiple screams of right and alright and around a minute near end featuring ono s lines up to you become naked on 21 june first part of take 20 received several overdubs and became officially titled revolution 1 overdubs included a lead guitar line by harrison and a brass section of two trumpets and four trombones final stereo mixing was completed on 25 june final mix that would ultimately be included on white album included hurried announcement of take two by geoff emerick at beginning of song single version lennon wanted revolution 1 to be next beatles single but mccartney was reluctant to invite controversy and argued along with harrison that track was too slow for a single lennon persisted and rehearsals for a faster and louder remake began on 9 july recording started following day writing in 2014 music journalist ian fortnam paired revolution with white album track helter skelter as beatles two proto metal experiment s of 1968 song begins with a startling machine gun fuzz guitar riff according to music critic richie unterberger with lennon and harrison s guitars prominent throughout track distorted sound was achieved by direct injection of guitar signal into mixing console emerick later explained that he routed signal through two microphone preamplifiers in series while keeping amount of overload just below point of overheating console this was such a severe abuse of studio equipment that emerick thought if i was studio manager and saw this going on i d fire myself lennon overdubbed opening scream and double tracked some of words so roughly that its careless spontaneity becomes a point in itself according to author ian macdonald revolution was performed in a higher key b major compared to a major of revolution 1 shoo bee do wop backing vocals were omitted in remake and an instrumental break was added revolution was given a climactic ending as opposed to fade out of revolution 1 for this version lennon unequivocally sang count me out an electric piano overdub by nicky hopkins was added on 11 july with final overdubs taking place on 13 july and mono mixing on 15 july despite lennon s efforts mccartney s hey jude was selected as a side of band s next single having sought to reassert his leadership of beatles over mccartney lennon reluctantly agreed to have revolution demoted to b side release hey jude revolution single was issued on 26 august 1968 in us with uk release taking place on 30 august two days after record s us release violent scenes occurred at 1968 democratic national convention in chicago as police and national guardsmen were filmed clubbing vietnam war protestors this event came two months after assassination of bobby kennedy democratic presidential nominee who had pledged to end america s involvement in vietnam and coincided with further militant action in europe according to author jonathan gould this combination ensured that contrary to lennon s doubts about song s relevance revolution had been rendered all too relevant by onrushing tide of events single was band s first release on apple records their emi distributed record label as part of their apple corps business enterprise label was run on counterculture principles and intended to be a form of what mccartney termed western communism single was one of four records that were sent in gift wrapped boxes marked our first four to queen elizabeth ii and other members of royal family and to harold wilson british prime minister according to music journalist jim irvin heavily distorted sound of revolution led some record buyers to return their copies in belief that there was bad surface noise on disc irvin recalled of his own experience exasperated shop assistant explained for umpteenth time that saturday it s supposed to sound like that we ve checked with emi hey jude topped sales charts around world while revolution was a highly popular b side in us where each side of a single continued to be listed individually it peaked at number 12 on billboard hot 100 number 11 on cash box top 100 and number 2 on record worlds chart latter peak was achieved while hey jude was at number 1 single was listed as a double sided number 1 in australia while revolution topped new zealand s singles chart for one week following hey jude s five week run at number 1 there revolution 1 was released on beatles on 22 november 1968 it was opening track on side four of lp four spots ahead of companion piece revolution 9 in an interview following album s release harrison said that revolution 1 has less attack and not as much revolution as single b side and described it as glen miller version lyric sheet included with original lp carried words count me out without appended in promotional film filming for promotional clips of hey jude and revolution took place on 4 september 1968 under direction of michael lindsay hogg two finished clips of revolution were produced with only lighting differences and other minor variations beatles sang vocals live over pre recorded instrumental track from single version their vocals included elements from revolution 1 mccartney and harrison sang shoo bee doo wap backing vocals and lennon sang count me out in authors bruce spizer and john winn each describe performance as exciting according to spizer it combines best elements of album and single versions while hertsgaard writes that two years after band had retired from public performances clip proved that beatles could rock with best of them thumb upright 1 1 right beatles performing in revolution film clip lindsay hogg recalled of beatles approach to their promotion films society was changing and music was in vanguard appearance of musicians their clothes hair their way of talking was stirring pot of social revolution for lennon his absorption in a romantic and creative partnership with ono was reflected in a change of appearance and image in fortnam s description a lean mean demeanour had replaced lennon s moptop era puppy fat while hertsgaard says clip presented him as a serious longhair his center parted locks falling down to his shoulders and both his vocals and his subject matter further underlined how far he had traveled since moptop days lindsay hogg recalled that before filming revolution lennon looked worse for wear yet he turned down a suggestion that he apply some stage makeup to make him appear healthier lennon reasoned because i m john lennon a point lindsay hogg cites as demonstrating that they had a very different attitude to most stars they were authentic they weren t characters in a fiction in clip lennon plays his epiphone casino guitar which he had recently stripped back from its sunburst pattern to a plain white finish macdonald says this gesture was partly indicative of lennon s desire for frankness and that song inaugurates lennon s adoption of stripped casino as a key part of his image while hey jude clip debuted on david frost s show frost on sunday on itv network revolution clip was first broadcast on bbc1 programme top of pops on 19 september 1968 first us screening of revolution was on 6 october broadcast of smothers brothers comedy hour latter show was frequently subjected to censorship by its network cbs for its anti establishment views political satire and commentary on vietnam war in choosing smothers brothers comedy hour over more mainstream shows such as ed sullivan show beatles ensured that their single reached an audience aligned with countercultural ideology critical reception in his contemporary review of single for melody maker chris welch praised a side saying it was a track that took several listens before its full appeal became evident but he dismissed revolution as a fuzzy mess and best forgotten more impressed derek johnson of nme described revolution as unashamed rock n roll but a cut above average rock disc particularly in thoughtful and highly topical lyric and a track that literally shimmers with excitement and awareness johnson concluded by stating that two sides prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that beatles are still streets ahead of their rivals cash boxs reviewer described revolution as straight out rock with lyrical flavor of a pre revolver feel and fifties rock instrumentation adding more commercial at first few hearings but hardly able to stand up against hey jude time magazine devoted an article to discussing revolution first time in magazine s history that it had done so for a pop song writers said song was exhilarating hard rock directed at radical activists world over and that its message would surprise some disappoint others and move many cool it dave marsh featured revolution in his 1989 book covering 1001 greatest singles describing it as a gem with a ferocious fuzztone rock and roll attack and a snarling lennon vocal writing for rough guides chris ingham includes revolution in his list of essential beatles songs and calls it a remarkably cogent statement he says that whereas revolution 1 resembles a stoned bluesy jam vibrant quality of single version has effect of making lennon s flower pacifism a dynamic option rather than a waved white flag in his song review for allmusic richie unterberger calls revolution one of beatles greatest most furious rockers with challenging fiery lyrics where listener s heart immediately starts pounding before lennon goes into first verse in 2006 mojo placed revolution at number 16 on its list of 101 greatest beatles songs in his commentary for magazine pete shelley of punk band buzzcocks recalled that he had never heard such distorted guitar sounds before and hearing song was his eureka moment when he decided he wanted to be in a band track was ranked at number 13 in a similar list compiled by rolling stone in 2010 cultural responses thumb left thumbtime 2 9 right 280px film of police officers dragging a protester along ground outside 1968 democratic national convention in chicago until events of summer 1968 political activists and far left publications in us distanced themselves from rock music and had no expectations of its relevance to their cause according to historian jon wiener revolution inspired first serious debate about connection between politics and 1960s rock music counterculture s reaction was especially informed by news footage of violent scenes outside democratic national convention on 28 august and of soviet tanks invading czechoslovakia which marked return of communist oppression there and end of prague spring song prompted immediate responses from new left and counterculture press most of whom expressed disappointment in beatles radicals were shocked by lennon s use of sarcasm his contention that things would be all right and his failure to engage with their plight they also objected to his requirement for a plan for revolution when their aim was to liberate minds and ensure that all individuals entered decision making process as a means of personal expression ramparts branded song a betrayal of cause and berkeley barb likened it to hawk plank adopted this week in chicago convention of democratic death party in britain new left review derided song as a lamentable petty bourgeois cry of fear while black dwarf said it showed beatles to be consciousness of enemies of revolution far left contrasted revolution with rolling stones concurrent single street fighting man which mick jagger had been inspired to write after attending violent rally at grosvenor square in march despite ambiguity in jagger s lyrics street fighting man was perceived to be supportive of a radical agenda thumb upright 1 1 soviet tanks in czechoslovakia 1968 approval from time magazine a mainstream publication widely viewed as reflecting establishment views added to song s lack of credibility among far left other commentators on left applauded beatles for rejecting radicalism governed by hatred and violence and for advocating pacifist idealism among these new left students for a democratic society s newspaper at cornell university stated that you can argue about effectiveness of non violence as a tactic but it would be absurd to claim that it is a conservative notion beatles want to change world and they are doing what they can with release of revolution 1 three months after single some student radicals unaware of chronology of recordings welcomed count me out in lyric as a sign that lennon had partly retracted his objection to maoist revolution according to author mark although student activists returned to their colleges after long summer break motivated to continue struggle for many other people a feeling of weariness supplanted their interest and by end of 1968 many people agreed with beatles among political right william f buckley jr an arch conservative wrote approvingly of song only to then be rebuked by far right john birch society s magazine magazine s editors warned that rather than denouncing revolution revolution was urging maoists not to blow it all through their impatience and was espousing a lenin inspired moscow line in reaction to song and to lennon and ono s performance art activities british authorities withdrew protection they had long afforded beatles as mbes on 18 october lennon and ono were arrested on charges of drug possession lennon maintained he had been warned of raid and that drugs were planted by arresting officers from london drug squad rock critics also entered political debate over revolution whereas politics had rarely been a subject of interest in their field before 1968 greil marcus commented that political detractors of revolution had overlooked message of music which is more powerful than anyone s words he added there is freedom and movement in music even as there is sterility and repression in lyrics music doesn t say cool it or don t fight cops music dodges message and comes out in front ellen willis of new yorker wrote that rolling stones understood ambiguous relation of rock to rebellion but it takes a lot of chutzpah for a multimillionaire to assure rest of us you know it s gonna be all right deep within john lennon there s a old tory struggling to get out rolling stone editor jann wenner wholeheartedly supported beatles saying that any accusations of revolutionary heresy were absurd since band were being absolutely true to their identity as it has evolved through last six years in his review of white album wenner added rock and roll has indeed become a style and a vehicle for changing system but one of parts of system to be changed is politics and this includes new left politics beatles was attacked by french film maker jean luc godard who had recently made film one plus one in london with rolling stones in an interview for international times in september 1968 godard said beatles were an example of people in britain who had been corrupted by money soon afterwards lennon told jonathan cott of rolling stone that this criticism was sour grapes on director s part since godard had been unable to get band to appear in one plus one and so had approached stones on her arrival in london in december american singer nina simone was quoted as saying she wanted to know what message is in revolution so that she could perform song effectively in concert instead she wrote and recorded an answer song also titled revolution partly based on lennon s composition in her lyrics she challenged lennon s statements about destruction and constitution and urged him to clean his brain lennon s reaction challenged on his political stance lennon exchanged open letters with john hoyland a student radical from keele university in pages of black dwarf hoyland wrote first letter in late october 1968 expecting that lennon s drugs bust and intolerance shown towards ono as a japanese woman in britain would make him more sympathetic to a radical agenda hoyland said that revolution was no more revolutionary than radio soap opera mrs dale s diary and criticised lennon for continuing to espouse an ideology beatles had expressed in all you need is love when in context of 1968 in order to change world we ve got to understand what s wrong with world and then destroy it ruthlessly before writing a reply lennon met with two other students from keele university at his home in surrey on 3 december referring to hoyland s letter he said that a destructive approach to societal change merely makes way for a destructive ruling power citing russian and french revolutions he also said that far left s complaints demonstrated their than thou snobbery and their inability to form a united movement adding that if radicals of that calibre did lead a revolution he and rolling stones would probably be first ones they ll shoot and it s him it s guy that wrote letter that ll do it you know in his letter published in black dwarf on 10 january 1969 lennon countered that hoyland was on a destruction kick and challenged him to name a single revolution that had achieved its aims lennon closed letter with a postscript saying you smash it and i ll build around it exchange which included a second letter from hoyland was syndicated internationally in underground press oz editor richard neville later described it as a classic new left psychedelic left dialogue lennon was stung by criticism he received from new left having campaigned for world peace with ono throughout 1969 he began to embrace radical politics after undergoing primal therapy in 1970 in a conversation with british activist tariq ali in january 1971 he said of revolution i made a mistake you know mistake was that it was anti revolution lennon then wrote power to people to atone for perceived apathy of revolution and instead sung you say you want a revolution we better get it on right away after moving to new york in 1971 he and ono fully embraced radical politics with chicago seven defendants jerry rubin and abbie hoffman lennon abandoned cause following richard nixon s victory in 1972 presidential election and he subsequently denounced revolutionaries and radical politics as useless in final interview he gave before his murder in december 1980 lennon reaffirmed pacifist message of revolution saying he still wished to see plan for any proposed revolution with reference to lennon s comments in this interview macdonald wrote in 1994 tiananmen square ignominious collapse of soviet communism and fact that most of his radical persecutors of 1968 70 now work in advertising have belatedly served to confirm his original instincts subsequent releases and use in nike advertisement revolution made its lp debut on 1970 us compilation album hey jude which was also first time that track was available in stereo stereo mix was carried out on 5 december 1969 supervised by martin song was subsequently issued on beatles compilations 1967 1970 and past masters volume two lennon disliked stereo mix used on 1967 1970 saying in a 1974 interview that revolution was a heavy record in mono but then they made it into a piece of ice cream in 1987 revolution became first beatles recording to be licensed for use in a television commercial nike paid 500 000 for right to use song for one year split between recording owner capitol emi and song publisher atv music publishing owned by michael jackson commercials using song started airing in march 1987 three surviving beatles through apple corps filed a lawsuit in july objecting to nike s use of song suit was aimed at nike its advertising agency wieden kennedy and capitol emi records capitol emi said lawsuit was groundless because they had licensed use of revolution with active support and encouragement of yoko ono lennon a shareholder and director of apple ono had expressed approval when ad was released saying it was making john s music accessible to a new generation fans were outraged at nike s appropriation of song and incensed at jackson and ono for allowing beatles work to be commercially exploited in this way ono said that mccartney had agreed to deal a claim that mccartney denied in november harrison explained his position if it s allowed to happen every beatles song ever recorded is going to be advertising women s underwear and sausages we ve got to put a stop to it in order to set a precedent otherwise it s going to be a free for all it s one thing when you re dead but we re still around they don t have any respect for fact that we wrote and recorded those songs and it was our lives revolution lawsuit
