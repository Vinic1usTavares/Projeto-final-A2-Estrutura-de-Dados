stadium status of foothills stadium formerly known as burns stadium was a consistent story throughout cannons history ballpark s owner city of calgary risked scuttling move of gulls to calgary by choosing to reassess feasibility of aaa baseball in calgary in 1984 council ultimately voted to support parker agreeing to a seven year lease and 1 5 million to renovate foothills one of pcl s conditions on approving relocation in cannons early years foothills was regarded as a park with good atmosphere mel of edmonton trappers described park in 1988 they provide a good atmosphere at park seating s good and so is field lighting concessions parking everything s good renovations to foothills again became a major issue in 1993 when national association of professional baseball leagues demanded that cannons upgrade foothills to aaa standards cannons and city fought a protracted battle to see who would pay majority of 2 million renovation costs debate also included alberta government parker argued that if council did not choose to pay majority of renovation costs that he would sell or relocate team groups representing portland oregon fresno and sacramento california all expressed interest in team unable to reach an agreement with city cannons then turned to federal government in march 1994 making a pitch for a federal infrastructure grant to help pay for renovations renovations to foothills stadium finally began following 1994 season as other teams built new ballparks throughout 1990s foothills lack of luxury boxes small clubhouses and open concourse became a growing concern for parker by 1998 he was arguing need for a new stadium or a major renovation of foothills at a cost of 20 million despite numerous efforts to convince city council to help renovate foothills parker was unable to secure support for project when cannons were sold and relocated in 2002 foothills stadium was regarded as one of major reasons why team moved south to albuquerque see
