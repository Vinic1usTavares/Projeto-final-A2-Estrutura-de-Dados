familiar hard rock not thrash tropes that it never really connects giving album a 2 5 5 star rating gromen showed more sympathy towards album and commented that although it is more of a rock record than recent albums such as united abominations or endgame he felt that one song built for war had a rust in peace feel gromen did criticize burn for having mundane lyrics another generally positive
