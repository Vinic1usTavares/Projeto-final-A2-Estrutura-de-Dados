1951 atlantic hurricane season was first hurricane season in which tropical cyclones were officially named by united states weather bureau season officially started on june 15 when united states weather bureau began its daily monitoring for tropical cyclone activity season officially ended on november 15 it was first year since 1937 in which no hurricanes made landfall on united states as hurricane how was only tropical storm to hit nation season had least tropical cyclone damage in united states since 1939 season as in 1950 season names from joint army navy phonetic alphabet were used to name storms this season first hurricane of season able formed prior to official start of season before reanalysis in 2015 it was once listed as earliest major hurricane on record in atlantic basin it formed on may 16 and executed a counterclockwise loop over bahamas later it brushed north carolina coastline hurricane charlie was a powerful category 4 hurricane that struck jamaica as a major hurricane killing hundreds and becoming worst disaster in over 50 years hurricane later struck mexico twice as a major hurricane producing deadly flooding outside of tampico tamaulipas strongest hurricane easy spent its duration over open atlantic ocean briefly threatening bermuda and was formerly listed as one of a relatively few category 5 hurricanes on record over atlantic ocean it briefly neared category 5 status and interacted with hurricane fox marking first known instance of a hurricane affecting another s path systems tropical storm one as calendar entered new year cyclogenesis occurred with an extratropical frontal wave over western north atlantic ocean due to a closed low forming in a mid level trough which eventually produced a low pressure center at surface by january 2 ships recorded moderate gales up to in connection with new surface low which formed several hundred miles east southeast of bermuda while initially lacking tropical attributes cyclone headed southeast for two days before curving southwestward as it did so temperature of system warmed in its lower levels causing cyclone to evolve into a more barotropic system late on january 4 system shrank in size and began developing an inner core reanalysis determined that system became a tropical storm at this time though it would have likely been considered subtropical beginning in early 1970s hurricane able origins of first hurricane of season were from a trough that exited east coast of united states on may 12 a low pressure area developed on may 14 and two days later it developed into a tropical cyclone about 300 miles 480 km south of bermuda it formed beneath an upper level low and initially was not fully tropical depression followed low initially toward northwest and later southwest moving over gulf stream depression intensified into tropical storm able on may 16 storm turned to south and hurricane hunters reported that able strengthened to hurricane status on may 17 off coast of florida outer rainbands of able produced light rainfall and high seas along florida coastline it later moved through northern bahamas early on may 18 where it produced hurricane force winds of hurricane later turned to north gradually strengthening through may 21 shortly thereafter able passed about 70 miles 110 km east of cape hatteras before turning east and reaching its peak of 90 mph 150 km h early on may 22 along coast hurricane produced high tides but little damage able maintained hurricane intensity for two more days before weakening to a tropical storm early on may 24 able rapidly dissipated that same day though originally it was assessed as having evolved into an extratropical cyclone on may 23 until 2015 able was listed as having peak winds of and was analyzed to have been earliest major hurricane on record such a storm would be a category 3 or greater on saffir simpson hurricane scale a system developed and introduced in 1970s able was also strongest hurricane outside of current hurricane season june 1 through november 30 however reanalysis by scientists in 2015 determined that able was in fact far weaker than originally listed in hurdat official database containing information on storm tracks and intensities in atlantic and eastern north pacific regions it also lost its distinction as strongest preseason cyclone on record record being held by a category 2 hurricane in march 1908 hurricane was one of four north atlantic hurricanes on record to exist during month of may others occurring in 1889 1908 and 1970 tropical storm baker on august 2 an easterly wave spawned a tropical depression about 680 miles 1095 km northeast of barbuda in lesser antilles it moved northwestward quickly strengthening into tropical storm baker early on august 3 storm attained peak winds of 60 mph 95 km h and next day passed about 275 mi 445 km east of bermuda at its peak intensity gale force winds extended 100 miles 160 km to north of center after attaining its peak baker quickly weakened on august 4 and turned to northeast early next day it regained some of its former strength before losing its identity baker never affected land hurricane charlie third tropical cyclone of season developed on august 12 from a tropical wave 930 miles 1 495 km east southeast of barbados after a few days without further development system intensified into tropical storm charlie on august 14 and subsequently crossed through lesser antilles a day later with winds of shortly after entering caribbean sea storm intensified to hurricane status early on august 16 passing south of puerto rico and hispaniola charlie then underwent rapid deepening beginning late that day its winds increasing in 24 hours as it neared island of jamaica early on august 18 charlie became a major hurricane and shortly afterward struck just south of kingston with winds of equivalent to a strong category 3 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale making charlie along with hurricane gilbert in 1988 strongest ever to hit island on island hurricane dropped heavy rainfall up to combination of strong winds and rains left around 50 million 1951 usd 380 million 2005 usd in crop and property damage across country there were 152 deaths 2 000 injuries and 25 000 people left homeless as a result it was considered worst disaster in country in 20th century until hurricane gilbert produced even costlier damage though with fewer reported fatalities pan american health organization emergency preparedness and disaster relief coordination program 1999 02 20 hurricane and its effects hurricane gilbert jamaica centro regional de informacion sobre desastres america latina y el caribe retrieved 2012 03 04 after making landfall charlie weakened in its passage over mountainous center of jamaica and by time it left island its winds had diminished to charlie later passed south of cayman islands with grand cayman reporting peak wind gusts of as it did so storm began to undergo yet another period of rapid intensification beginning on august 19 it regained major hurricane status late that day and early on august 20 charlie peaked at 130 mph 215 km h equivalent to low end category 4 status maintaining its strength hurricane then made landfall on southern tip of cozumel and hit mexican mainland near on yucatan peninsula strong winds destroyed 70 of crops along its path although no deaths were reported in yucatan peninsula several homes were wrecked in region as it moved inland charlie weakened rapidly over land reaching bay of campeche as a minimal hurricane early on august 21 once over water it failed to re intensify for a full day but began doing so early on august 22 as it did so it rapidly re intensified for a third and final time reaching peak winds of before striking near city of miramar just north of tampico it dissipated on august 23 hurricane dropped heavy rainfall in region flooding rivers and causing dams to burst hundreds of people were killed in mexican mainland and across charlie s entire path damage was estimated at over 75 million 1951 usd usd outer fringes of storm increased surf along texas coast hurricane dog a tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on august 27 southwest of cape verde it moved westward eventually intensifying into a tropical storm early on august 31 next day storm was first observed by hurricane hunters several hundred miles east of barbados and it was named dog by that time its winds were around and storm continued intensifying as it approached lesser antilles on september 2 dog attained hurricane status reaching its peak of 90 mph 150 km h as it passed between islands of saint lucia and martinique storm then quite small in diameter produced strong wind gusts of up to at airport in fort de france on martinique however this peak was short lived for upon entering eastern caribbean sea dog began a slow but steady weakening trend on september 4 dog weakened to tropical storm status to south of hispaniola and next day dissipated in western caribbean in northern saint lucia combination of flooding and high winds destroyed 70 of banana crop two sailing vessels were destroyed and another one damaged across island hurricane dog killed two people from drownings damage was heavier on martinique located on north side of storm hurricane s winds destroyed 1 000 homes and roofs of several others downed trees blocked roads and disrupted power lines winds also destroyed 90 of banana crop and 30 of sugar cane throughout martinique dog left 3 million in damage 1951 usd usd and killed five people from drownings it was considered most violent storm in martinique in 20 years initially hurricane was expected to strike jamaica prompting hurricane warnings for country as well as along southern coast of hispaniola jamaica was struck by hurricane charlie a few weeks prior and threat from dog prompted coastal evacuations and closure of an airport ultimately dog dissipated and produced only light rainfall on island hurricane easy hurricane easy strongest tropical cyclone of season was a powerful and long lived cape verde type hurricane that originated as a tropical depression on september 1 between lesser antilles and cape verde moving generally west northwestward depression deepened into a tropical storm late that day and further to hurricane status by september 3 on september 5 cyclone reached its first peak of but failed to continue strengthening its winds fluctuated through early morning on september 6 but then resumed strengthening reaching major hurricane status by that evening during this period hurricane hunters flew into hurricane to monitor its progress recording a minimum pressure of on september 6 to north of lesser antilles next day an aircraft was unable to penetrate center estimating winds of south of eye on this basis easy was once classified as a category 5 hurricane on saffir simpson scale a reanalysis in 2015 lowered peak winds to 150 mph 240 km h on september 8 this was based on hurricane hunters reporting a pressure of on previous day and a ship reporting winds of 140 mph 220 km h by time easy attained peak intensity it had turned to north and northeast while beginning a steady weakening trend it interacted with small hurricane fox to east this was first observed instance of a hurricane affecting another s path easy then turned to northeast passing a short distance southeast of bermuda on september 9 with winds of easy evolved into an extratropical cyclone late on september 11 while still maintaining hurricane force winds remnants lost their hurricane force winds on september 12 only to briefly regain them two days later on september 14 easy lost its identity over northern atlantic ocean after it was absorbed by another extratropical storm to north weather bureau advised bermuda to take precautionary measures in advance of storm tourists and residents worked feverishly to complete preparations and united states air force issued a formal warning at noon numerous hotels and homes were shuttered heavy traffic snarled evacuations and 100 tourists were stranded on island without roundtrip reservations air force aircraft returned to united states and personnel secured various facilities at island s base on bermuda hurricane produced winds of only which downed a few banana trees in addition to affecting bermuda strong winds of hurricane damaged a few ships along its path hurricane fox around same time as easy was forming a new tropical depression developed in far eastern atlantic ocean moving generally westward it passed south of cape verde islands quickly strengthening into tropical storm fox early on september 3 by that time its motion turned to west northwest on september 5 fox attained hurricane status around same time as it was first observed by ships two days later hurricane hunters reported peak winds of making it a major hurricane albeit one of very small extent around that time fox interacted with hurricane easy to its northwest after maintaining peak winds for 12 hours fox began a steady weakening trend accelerating to north and northeast ahead of easy and passing to east of bermuda on september 10 fox while still of hurricane force became extratropical between azores and greenland in far north atlantic it turned towards north and dissipated on september 11 off southwest coast of iceland although a few ships were affected by hurricane s winds there were no reports of any damage tropical storm george tropical storm george developed in bay of campeche on september 19 moving west northwestward it quickly attained peak winds of 60 mph 95 km h late on next day as reported by hurricane hunters george later made landfall on september 21 in mexico about 55 mi 90 km south of tampico as a moderate tropical storm before it moved ashore storm spread rainfall along coast and increased waves causing one drowning death george quickly dissipated upon making landfall and there were no reports of damage hurricane how an easterly wave spawned a tropical depression in western caribbean sea on september 29 it moved north northwestward for a few days before turning eastward in central gulf of mexico based on hurricane hunter reports depression intensified into tropical storm how late on september 30 and it continued to strengthen as it approached southwest florida on october 2 how attained its first peak of just before making landfall near boca grande and within day it crossed southern florida at time storm was not well organized and its strongest winds were confined to squalls in florida keys and southeast coast wind damage was minor although heavy rainfall was reported peaking at 15 7 inches 40 cm near where it moved ashore precipitation caused significant street flooding while about of tomato and bean fields were deluged storm emerged into atlantic ocean between fort pierce and vero beach quickly intensifying to hurricane strength by october 3 turning northeastward how reached its second and strongest peak of on october 4 as it passed near outer banks of north carolina along coast hurricane produced high tides and minor damage subsequently hurricane briefly weakened only to recover its peak of 100 mph 155 km h on october 5 it passed southeast of cape cod before turning more to east northeast causing road closures due to high tides offshore hurricane sank a ship killing 17 people while still of hurricane force how became an extratropical storm on october 6 and a few days later it curved to northeast extratropical cyclone later struck iceland with hurricane force winds on october 9 a couple of days later remnants of how dissipated in far northern atlantic overall hurricane how caused about 2 million 1951 usd usd in damage tropical storm item a tropical depression formed southwest of jamaica on october 12 a small system it moved northwestward and intensified into tropical storm item on october 13 it turned toward north and next day attained peak winds of after moving through cayman islands based on observations from hurricane hunters item was upgraded to hurricane status in real time although a reanalysis in 2015 lowered peak winds to 65 mph 100 km h item lost tropical storm status on october 16 as it drifted to northwest continuing a slow weakening trend it passed just east of isla de la juventud before striking western cuba as a tropical depression on october 17 later that day it dissipated in southeastern gulf of mexico threat of hurricane prompted precautions to be made in parts of cuba additionally storm warnings were posted in florida keys southern mainland florida as well as bahamas however no damage was reported hurricane jig one of last tropical cyclones of season formed on october 15 just northeast of bahamas although listed as a tropical storm it would have likely been classified as a subtropical cyclone beginning in 1970s but was unable to be classified as such given lack of satellite imagery to prove its status given name jig it moved northeastward quickly attaining hurricane status with winds of 75 mph 120 km h which it maintained for a full day on october 16 jig began a slow weakening trend weakening below hurricane force and turning sharply northeastward during this time storm made its closest approach to southeastern united states while passing well southeast of cape hatteras while offshore storm increased surf along north carolina and virginia coastlines prompting storm warnings early october 18 jig became extratropical with winds of and began a counterclockwise loop over western atlantic next day it turned to southeast before dissipating about south of bermuda on october 20 hurricane twelve in early december a cold front passed north of bermuda a disturbance along front began rotating on december 2 developing into a small but powerful extratropical storm on next day by late on december 3 storm attained hurricane force winds and it increasingly became dominant system within broad frontal region a ridge to east turned this storm to southwest winds diminished below hurricane intensity on december 5 and concurrently inner structure became more tropical as frontal features dissipated during this time ships in region reported strong winds mostly to north increasing water temperatures fueled atmospheric instability likely causing an increase in convection and system was potentially a subtropical cyclone on december 6 while located about 1 015 mi 1 635 km east northeast of bermuda a nearby ship recorded a minimum pressure of around that time after storm turned to southeast a ship in region reported winds of 75 mph 120 km h near center and a pressure of while a weather station indicated that system had a warm core data suggested that system became a fully tropical hurricane by 12 00 utc on december 7 and that it likely had evolved into a tropical storm six hours earlier by 18 00 utc that night hurricane attained peak winds of 80 mph 130 km h on december 8 hurricane turned to east and weakened into a tropical storm steered by an approaching trough over next day storm accelerated to east northeast toward azores late on december 10 storm moved through azores as a tropical storm although it was reverting to an extratropical storm at time by 06 00 utc on december 11 system was extratropical again after it rejoined with a nearby cold front it likely merged with another storm to its east on december 12 although it is possible former hurricane remained a distinct system a building ridge near spain forced extratropical system to southeast eventually dissipating after coming ashore in morocco on december 15 storm names these names were used to name storms during 1951 atlantic hurricane season as this season had same names and was less active than 1950 none of these names was used for first time names that were not assigned are marked in able baker charlie dog easy fox george how
