considerable suburban development in 1950s northgate and lake city were annexed into city of seattle in 1954 and city run seattle transit system expanded bus service into area new service included a shuttle that ran at a significant loss for several years before being cancelled in late 1950s a second attempt at serving north end with bus service was launched in 1963 with existing routes extended north towards northgate and lake city later that year increasing congestion on interstate 5 and declining bus ridership led city officials to propose a rapid transit service using freeway s reversible express lanes in 1966 federal government approved planning of an express bus service named blue streak by seattle transit that would use express lanes between northeast 110th street and cherry street in downtown seattle department of housing and urban development hud awarded 1 03 million equivalent to in dollars in january 1968 to seattle transit to develop blue streak project but launch was delayed by a shortage in suitable buses in may hud awarded a further 2 39 million equivalent to in dollars to purchase 70 diesel buses which were delivered in november continued financial problems with seattle transit put blue streak program in jeopardy leading to calls to suspend program before it launched service was originally slated to begin in 1968 and delays led to federal government establishing a deadline in early 1969 for a city decision on whether to move forward a park and ride lot in northgate was secured in august 1969 settling demands of federal government united states department of transportation approved 2 million equivalent to in dollars in operating funds for blue streak in january 1970 providing two thirds of system s operating budget for first two years of

use of existing transportation facilities and equipment blue streak experiment attracted interest from mass transit advocates and officials from across nation blue streak system was expanded to other routes in 1970s and served as model for modern park and ride express service in seattle metropolitan area and across united states in its first year of service blue streak routes increased ridership

analyze ridership after first week of service seattle transit began surveying riders to determine whether motorists had been lured by new service study determined that 75 percent of surveyed patrons had switched from their personal automobiles and that blue streak was responsible for a decrease of 400 vehicles on interstate 5 at rush hour by late october demand at northgate park and ride prompted state highway department to offer funding for an auxiliary lot seattle transit cancelled saturday service on blue streak routes in march 1971 citing low patronage and near empty parking lot at
