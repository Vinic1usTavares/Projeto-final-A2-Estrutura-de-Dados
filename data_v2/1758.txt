biographies of tirthankaras notably parshvanatha and mahavira samavayanga sutra is a collection of mahavira s teachings and acharanga sutra recounts his asceticism teachings colonial era indologists considered jainism and mahavira s followers a sect of buddhism because of superficial similarities in iconography and meditative and ascetic practices as scholarship progressed differences between teachings of mahavira and buddha were found so divergent that religions were acknowledged as separate mahavira says moriz winternitz taught a very elaborate belief in soul unlike buddhists who denied such elaboration his ascetic teachings have a higher order of magnitude than those of buddhism or hinduism and his emphasis on ahimsa non violence is greater than that in other indian religions agamas mahavira s teachings were compiled by gautama swami his chief disciple canonical scriptures are in twelve parts mahavira s teachings were gradually lost after about according to jain tradition when a severe famine in magadha kingdom dispersed jain monks attempts were made by later monks to gather recite canon and re establish it these efforts identified differences in recitations of mahavira s teachings and an attempt was made in 5thcentury ad to reconcile differences reconciliation efforts failed with svetambara and digambara jain traditions holding their own incomplete somewhat different versions of mahavira s teachings in early centuries of common era jain texts containing mahavira s teachings were written in palm leaf manuscripts according to digambaras acharya bhutabali was last

swastika and five vows jain agamas enumerate five vows which ascetics and householders must observe these ethical principles were preached by mahavira ahimsa non violence or non injury mahavira taught that every living being has sanctity and dignity which should be respected as one expects one s own sanctity and dignity to be respected ahimsa jainism s first and most important vow applies to actions speech and thought satya truthfulness applies to oneself and others asteya non stealing not taking anything that has not been given brahmacharya chastity abstinence from sex and sensual pleasures for monks and faithfulness to one s partner for householders aparigraha non attachment for lay people an attitude of non attachment to property or worldly possessions for mendicants not owning anything goal of these principles is to achieve spiritual peace a better rebirth or ultimately liberation according to chakravarthi these teachings help improve a person s quality of life however dundas writes that mahavira s emphasis on non violence and restraint has been interpreted by some jain scholars to not be driven by merit from giving or compassion to other creatures nor a duty to rescue all creatures but by continual self discipline a cleansing of soul which leads to spiritual development and release mahavira is best remembered in indian traditions for his teaching that ahimsa is supreme moral virtue he taught that ahimsa covers all living beings and injuring any being in any form creates bad karma which affects one s rebirth future well being and suffering according to mahatma gandhi mahavira was greatest authority on ahimsa soul mahavira taught that soul exists a premise shared with hinduism but not buddhism there is no soul or self in buddhism and its teachings are based on concept of anatta non self mahavira taught that soul is dravya substantial eternal and yet temporary to mahavira metaphysical nature of universe consists of dravya jiva and ajiva inanimate objects jiva is bound to samsara transmigration because of karma effects of one s actions karma in jainism includes actions and intent it colors soul affecting how where and as what a soul is reborn after death according to mahavira there is no creator deity and existence has neither beginning nor end gods and demons exist in jainism however whose jivas a part of same cycle of birth and death goal of spiritual practice is to liberate jiva from its karmic accumulation and enter realm of siddhas souls who are liberated from rebirth enlightenment to mahavira is consequence of self cultivation and self restraint anekantavada mahavira taught doctrine of anekantavada many sided reality although word does not appear in earliest jain literature or agamas doctrine is illustrated in mahavira s answers to questions posed by his followers truth and reality are complex and have a number of aspects reality can be experienced but it is impossible to express it fully with language alone human attempts to communicate are nayas partial expression s of truth language itself is not truth but a means of expressing it from truth according to mahavira language returns not other way around one can experience truth of a taste but cannot fully express that taste through language any attempt to express experience is syat valid in some respect but still a perhaps just one perspective incomplete jain philosophy iep mark owen webb texas tech university spiritual truths are also complex with multiple aspects and language cannot express their plurality however they can be experienced through effort and appropriate karma mahavira s anekantavada doctrine is also summarized in buddhist texts such as samannaphala sutta in which he is called and is a key difference between teachings of mahavira and those of buddha buddha taught middle way rejecting extremes of it is or it is not mahavira accepted both it is and it is not with reconciliation and qualification of perhaps jain agamas suggest that mahavira s approach to answering metaphysical philosophical questions was a qualified yes syat a version of this doctrine is also found in school of ancient indian philosophy according to dundas anekantavada doctrine has been interpreted by many jains as promot ing a universal religious tolerance plurality and a benign attitude to other ethical religious positions however this misreads jain historical texts and mahavira s teachings mahavira s many pointedness multiple perspective teachings are a doctrine about nature of reality and human existence not about tolerating religious positions such as sacrificing animals or killing them for food or violence against nonbelievers or any other living being as perhaps right five vows for jain monks and nuns are strict requirements with no perhaps mahavira s jainism co existed with buddhism and hinduism beyond jain communities but each religion was highly critical of knowledge systems and ideologies of their rivals gender an historically contentious view in jainism is partially attributed to mahavira and his ascetic life he did not wear clothing as a sign of renunciation fifth vow aparigraha it was disputed whether a female mendicant could achieve spiritual liberation of a male mendicant sadhu through asceticism major jain traditions have disagreed with digambaras sky clad naked mendicant order believing that a woman is unable to fully practice asceticism and cannot achieve spiritual liberation because of her gender she can at best live an ethical life so she is reborn as a man according to this view women are seen as a threat to a monk s chastity had preached about men and women equality clothes wearing svetambaras have interpreted mahavira s teaching as encouraging both sexes to pursue a mendicant ascetic life with possibility of moksha kaivalya spiritual liberation rebirth and realms of existence rebirth and realms of existence are fundamental teachings of mahavira according to sutra mahavira believed that life existed in myriad forms which included animals plants insects bodies of water fire and wind he taught that a monk should avoid touching or disturbing any of them including plants and never swim light or extinguish a fire or wave their arms in air such actions might injure other beings living in those states of matter mahavira preached that nature of existence is cyclic and soul is reborn after death in one of heavenly hellish or earthly realms of existence and suffering humans are reborn depending on one s karma actions as a human animal element microbe or other form on earth or in a heavenly or hellish realm nothing is permanent everyone including gods demons and earthly beings dies and is reborn based on their actions in their previous life jinas who have reached kevala jnana omniscience are not reborn they enter siddhaloka realm of perfected ones legacy lineage mahavira has been erroneously called founder of jainism jains believe that there were 23 teachers before him and jainism was founded well before mahavira whom they revere as 24th tirthankara 22nd tirthankara is believed to have been born 84 000 years before 23rd tirthankara parshvanatha although mahavira is sometimes placed in parshvanatha s lineage this is contradicted by texts stating that mahavira renounced world alone jain texts suggest that mahavira s parents were lay devotees of parshvanatha lack of detail and mythical nature of legends about parshvanatha combined with medieval era svetambara texts portraying as pseudo ascetics with dubious practices of magic and astrology have led scholars to debate evidence of parshvanatha s historicity according to dundas jains believe that parshvanatha s lineage influenced mahavira parshvanatha as one who removes obstacles and has capacity to save is a popular icon his image is focus of jain temple devotion of 24 tirthankaras jain iconography has celebrated mahavira and parshvanatha most sculptures discovered at mathura
