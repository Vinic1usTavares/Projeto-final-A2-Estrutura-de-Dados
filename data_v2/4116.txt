even though his executive order was sure to be overridden by congress some gay rights advocates criticized clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions their position was that clinton should have integrated military by executive order noting that president harry s truman used executive order to racially desegregate armed forces

relationship with former white house intern monica lewinsky as predatory or non consensual despite fact that lewinsky called relationship consensual at time because of vast power differential between a 22 year old intern and president of united states these allegations have been revisited and lent more credence in 2018 in light of metoo movement with many commentators and democratic leaders now
