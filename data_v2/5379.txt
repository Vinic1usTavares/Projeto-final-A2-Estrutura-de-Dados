black dogfish centroscyllium fabricii is a species of dogfish shark in family etmopteridae it is common over outer continental shelf and continental slope at depths of females generally inhabit deeper water than males and depending on region smaller sharks may occur at different depths than larger ones this species is distributed widely in atlantic ocean from greenland and iceland to virginia and west africa in north and off southwestern africa and argentina in south largest member of its family black dogfish typically measures long it has a stocky dark brown body that is darker below than above and bears scattered minute bioluminescent organs its two dorsal fins are preceded by stout spines and anal fin is absent active and schooling black dogfish is an opportunistic predator and scavenger that mainly consumes bony fishes crustaceans and cephalopods it is aplacental viviparous with females producing litters of four to 40 pups that are sustained to term by a yolk sac there is no well defined breeding season and mating and birthing take place year round black dogfish contributes significantly to bycatch of deep sea commercial fisheries operating in north atlantic it is of little commercial value and is usually discarded as large portions of its range see little deepwater fishing activity and its northwestern atlantic population seems to be stable international union for conservation of nature has listed this species under least concern overall it has been assessed as near threatened in northeastern atlantic where its numbers may have declined from heavy fishing pressure taxonomy and phylogeny thumb upright 1 2 left early illustration of a black dogfish first known specimen of black dogfish was collected near julianehab in greenland and described by danish zoologist johannes reinhardt in his 1825 reinhardt gave it name spinax fabricii in honor of missionary and naturalist otto fabricius who pioneered study of greenlandic fishes german biologists johannes muller and jakob henle in their 1839 41 systematische beschreibung der plagiostomen created new genus centroscyllium for this species according to iucn further taxonomic investigation is required to confirm black dogfish in north atlantic and southeastern atlantic represent same species a 2010 phylogenetic study by nicolas straube and colleagues based on nuclear and mitochondrial dna found black dogfish is sister species of dogfish c and two are in turn sister to clade formed by granular dogfish c and dogfish c nigrum distribution and habitat black dogfish is a common species with a wide but discontinuous distribution in temperate waters of atlantic ocean its range abuts but does not extend into arctic ocean in northeast it occurs from iceland to sierra leone including faroe islands southern norway and rockall trough and porcupine off ireland in northwest it is found from southern greenland and baffin island to virginia being particularly abundant in laurentian channel and may occur further south to gulf of mexico off alabama in southeast it is found off namibia and south africa as far as cape agulhas in southwest it has been recorded from beagle channel at southern tip of argentina inhabiting outer continental shelf and continental slope black dogfish is found mostly near bottom in water deep it is most common at depths of off iceland in rockall trough off greenland off northern canada and below off southern africa species may venture closer to surface in northern extreme of its range particularly during dark cold winter months depth segregation by sex has been documented in north atlantic with females outnumbering males at depths greater than depth segregation by size varies by region larger sharks are generally found in deeper water off western greenland in shallower water off western iceland and without pattern with respect to depth off eastern iceland black dogfish prefers water temperatures of though off northern canada it is most abundant in water of it can tolerate temperatures down to there is some evidence that this species conducts seasonal migrations spending winter and spring in shallower water sharks off northern canada perform development related movements see below not observed off western greenland suggesting presence of two distinct stocks in northwestern atlantic description thumb upright 1 2 black dogfish has a stout dark brown body and large green eyes this specimen has light patches where its dermal denticles have rubbed off from handling adult black dogfish typically measure in length and can reach making it largest member of its family females attain a larger ultimate size than males shark has a rather stocky and laterally compressed body with a moderately long thick and flattened snout that forms a very broad arch at front sizable horizontally oval eyes are a reflective green in life and lack nictitating membranes protective third eyelids they are followed a short distance behind by much smaller spiracles accessory respiratory openings nostrils are anteriorly placed and preceded by short flaps of skin mouth is wide and evenly arched with thin lips and short but deep furrows around corners there are around 34 tooth rows in either side of both jaws each tooth has three occasionally up to five slender cusps with central one longest both dorsal fins are immediately preceded by stout grooved spines with second much longer than first small first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin with its origin lying behind pectoral fins second dorsal fin is rather angular and has about double area of first with its origin located opposite midpoint of pelvic fin bases pectoral fins are small and rounded pelvic fins are about as large as second dorsal fin with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising less than a quarter of total length upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared off tip while lower lobe is indistinct skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles each one is recurved and thorn like rising from an irregular star shaped base this species is a plain dark brown above darkening to almost black below with white dorsal fin spines juvenile sharks have white edges on dorsal pectoral and pelvic fins minute luminescent dots are scattered about skin without a regular pattern biology and ecology black dogfish forms shoals or schools that tend to be larger during winter and spring though fairly active its swimming muscles exhibit lower activity of enzymes and higher activity of creatine compared to shallow water spiny dogfish squalus suggesting a lesser capacity for bursts of speed lipid filled liver comprises about one fifth of its total weight and functions in maintaining neutral buoyancy potential predators of black dogfish are larger sharks and bony fishes it is one of several deep sea sharks parasitized by barnacle which attaches in front of second dorsal fin and impairs reproductive development of its host other known parasites of this species include fluke copepods neoalbionella fabricii and neoalbionella and protozoans haemogregarina and trypanosoma thumb upright 1 2 rattails are among prey consumed by black dogfish apparently opportunistic in feeding habits black dogfish typically hunts in open water but also scavenges off bottom bulk of its diet consists of a variety of bony fishes including rattails whitings rockfishes lanternfishes and as well as pelagic crustaceans such as krill and shrimp and cephalopods fish become a progressively more important food source as shark ages while crustaceans become less important infrequently polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten in northwestern atlantic greenland halibut and offal discarded from fishing vessels have become a major source of food for this species particularly for older sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads life history reproduction in black dogfish occurs year round with no well defined seasonal pattern this species is aplacental viviparous in which developing embryos are retained inside uterus and are sustained to term solely by yolk mature females have two functional ovaries and two functional uteruses fertilized eggs are ovulated into uterus at a diameter of though a few may be retained in ovary eggs are not enclosed in a capsule external yolk sac is fully resorbed when embryo is close to term with remaining yolk having been transferred to an internal yolk sac attached to intestine internal yolk sac serves to provision newborn shark until it learns to feed litter size ranges from four to 40 newborns measure long various authors have reported size at maturity as between for males and for females reflecting differences between geographical areas off northern canada females give birth in portion of laurentian channel less than deep as young grow they migrate into deeper parts of channel and eventually a long distance northward over grand banks or labrador shelf to deep continental slope this movement pattern has not been observed in black dogfish inhabiting adjacent waters off western greenland a number of anomalous hermaphroditic specimens have been documented human interactions black dogfish is harmless to humans and of little commercial value substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial deep sea trawl gillnet and longline fisheries operating throughout north atlantic including icelandic greenland halibut fishery french mixed species trawl fishery and canadian greenland halibut crab redfish monkfish and witch fisheries captured sharks are usually discarded though in recent years this and other small deepwater sharks have been increasingly retained and used for fishmeal reported catches by european countries of which france made largest contribution have followed a declining trend from 486 tons in 2001 to 35 tons in 2006 average catch by canadian fisheries was 68 tons per year from 1996 to 2005 black dogfish occurs mostly too deep for fisheries off southern africa in remainder of its range little information is available on fishery impact international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed black dogfish under least concern worldwide it is minimally affected by fishing activity across many parts of its range while its population in northwestern atlantic presently seems to be stable and may have increased from 1978 to 1995 by contrast intensity of deepwater fisheries in northeastern atlantic has led iucn to give this species a regional assessment of near threatened reproductive characteristics of black dogfish such as a large female maturation size may render it susceptible to overfishing though it is more fecund than other deep sea dogfish sharks in northeastern atlantic catches of this species are managed as part of total allowable catch for deep sea sharks set by international council for exploration
