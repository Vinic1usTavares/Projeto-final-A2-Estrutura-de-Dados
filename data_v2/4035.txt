charter aircraft arriving at same time as both intend to correspond with hurtigruten this causes patronage to rise beyond airport s capacity avinor 2010 10 kirkenes airport had a revenue of nok 26 4 million in 2009 of which commercial income made up fifteen percent and an operating deficit of nok 45 4 million deficit is cross subsidized by profits at avinor s largest airports avinor 2010 35 in

between kirkenes and vadso which would have a service time of 45 minutes brathen 2010 45 there is a possibility of marketing kirkenes as an alternative airport for murmansk as kirkenes can offer cheaper flights to oslo than what is available from murmansk to moscow brathen 2010 51 avinor has also proposed lowering terrain east of airport terrain is actually flatter to east but because runway was expanded in that direction extension cannot be used without removing all ground in twelve degree slope avinor 2010 12 although it has no impact on smaller aircraft reduced runway length has a severe impact on performance of boeing 737 aircraft which are used by both norwegian and sas for instance during winter a 180 seat 737 800 can only utilize 71 percent of its permitted take off weight this would hinder fully loaded aircraft flying further than oslo impacts for 150 seat 737 700 aircraft are smaller as they can reach oslo during winter and berlin during summer airport served 169 428 passengers in 1996 and 216 000 passengers in 2000 project was estimated to cost 267 million norwegian krone avinor 2010 41 estimates show that benefit for society would be lower than investment costs a negative net present value giving an average estimated nok 124 million deficit avinor 2010 45 norwegian air shuttle is building a unified fleet of 737 800 aircraft and will only be able to serve airport during winter if investments are carried out avinor 2010 18 extension would allow increased charter traffic to central 2010 27 and increased regularity with existing flights avinor has stated
