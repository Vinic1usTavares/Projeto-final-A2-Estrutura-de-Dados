arabian or arab horse dmg arabi is a breed of horse that originated on arabian peninsula with a distinctive head shape and high tail carriage arabian is one of most easily recognizable horse breeds in world it is also one of oldest breeds with archaeological evidence of horses in middle east that resemble modern arabians dating back 4 500 years throughout history arabian horses have spread around world by both war and trade used to improve other breeds by adding speed refinement endurance and strong bone today arabian bloodlines are found in almost every modern breed of riding horse arabian developed in a desert climate and was prized by nomadic bedouin people often being brought inside family tent for shelter and protection from theft selective breeding for traits including an ability to form a cooperative relationship with humans created a horse breed that is good natured quick to learn and willing to please arabian also developed high spirit and alertness needed in a horse used for raiding and war this combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern arabian horse owners to handle their horses with competence and respect arabian is a versatile breed arabians dominate discipline of endurance riding and compete today in many other fields of equestrian sport they are one of top ten most popular horse breeds in world they are now found worldwide including united states and canada united kingdom australia continental europe south america especially brazil and their land of origin middle east breed characteristics thumb left a purebred arabian stallion

arabian horses have refined wedge shaped heads a broad forehead large eyes large nostrils and small muzzles most display a distinctive concave or dished profile many arabians also have a slight

is long allowing flexibility in bridle and room for windpipe other distinctive features are a relatively long level croup or top of hindquarters and naturally high tail carriage usef breed standard

build an arabian stallion arabian horse world p 542 reprinted in parkinson pp 157 158 within breed there are variations some individuals have wider more powerfully muscled hindquarters suitable for intense bursts of activity in events such as reining while others have longer leaner muscling better suited for long stretches of flat work such as endurance riding or horse racing schofler flight without wings pp 11 12 most have a compact body with a short back arabians usually have dense strong bone and good hoof walls they are especially noted for their endurance edwards arabian pp 245 246

not all have 5 lumbar vertebrae instead of usual 6 and 17 pairs of ribs rather than 18 edwards arabian pp 27 28 a quality arabian has both a relatively horizontal croup and a properly angled pelvis as well as good croup length and depth to hip determined by length of pelvis that allows agility and impulsion schofler flight without wings p 8 a misconception confuses topline of croup with angle of hip pelvis or ilium leading some to assert that arabians have a flat pelvis angle and cannot use their hindquarters properly however croup is formed by sacral vertebrae hip angle is determined by attachment of ilium to spine structure and length of femur and other aspects of anatomy which is not correlated to topline of sacrum thus arabian has conformation typical of other horse breeds built for speed and distance such as thoroughbred where angle of ilium is more oblique than that of croup typically hip angle is about 35 degrees while croup is about 25 chapter 6 croup anatomy and conformation of horse pp 83 gladys brown an illustrated guide to arabian horse conformation arabian horse world quarterly spring 1998 p 86 reprinted in parkinson p 121 thus hip angle is not necessarily correlated to topline of croup horses bred to gallop need a good length of croup and good length of hip for proper attachment of muscles and so unlike angle length of hip and croup do go together as a rule size breed standard stated by united states equestrian federation describes arabians as standing between tall with occasional individual over or under thus all arabians regardless of height are classified as horses even though is traditional cutoff height between a horse and a pony plumb types and breeds of farm animals p 168 a common myth is that arabians are not strong because they are relatively small and refined however arabian horse is noted for a greater density of bone than other breeds short cannons sound feet and a broad short back all of which give breed physical strength comparable to many taller animals thus even a smaller arabian can carry a heavy rider for tasks where sheer weight of horse matters such as farm work done by a draft horse ensminger horses and horsemanship p 84 any lighter weight horse is at a disadvantage however for most purposes arabian is a strong and hardy light horse breed able to carry any type of rider in most equestrian pursuits ensminger horses and horsemanship p 96 temperament thumb upright arabians are noted for both intelligence and a spirited disposition alt a dark horse moving towards camera with head held high and legs striding forward for centuries arabian horses lived in desert in close association with humans for shelter and protection from theft prized war mares were sometimes kept in their owner s tent close to children and everyday family life upton arabians p 19 only horses with a naturally good disposition were allowed to reproduce with result that arabians today have a good temperament that among other examples makes them one of few breeds where united states equestrian federation rules allow children to exhibit stallions in nearly all show ring classes including those limited to riders

other refined spirited horses bred for speed such as akhal teke barb and thoroughbred like other hot bloods arabians sensitivity and intelligence enable quick learning and greater communication with their riders however their intelligence also allows them to learn bad habits as quickly as good ones handling and understanding horse p 19 and they do not tolerate inept or abusive training practices rashid a good horse is never a bad color p 50 some sources claim that it is more difficult to train a hot blooded horse though most arabians have a natural tendency to cooperate with humans when treated badly like any horse they can become excessively nervous or anxious but seldom become vicious unless seriously spoiled or subjected to extreme abuse at other end of spectrum romantic myths are

horse with a white hair coat and dark skin showing around nose eyes and genitalia gray and white although many arabians appear to have a white hair coat they are not genetically white this color is usually created by natural action of gray gene and virtually all white looking arabians are actually grays a specialized colorization seen in some older gray arabians is so called bloody shoulder which is a particular type of flea bitten gray with localized aggregations of pigment on shoulder there are a very few arabians registered as white having a white coat pink skin and dark eyes from birth these animals are believed to manifest a new form of dominant white a result of a nonsense mutation in dna tracing to a single stallion foaled in 1996 this horse was originally thought to be a sabino but actually was found to have a new form of dominant white mutation now labeled w3 it is possible that white mutations have occurred in arabians in past or that mutations other than w3 exist but have not been verified by genetic testing sabino one spotting pattern sabino does exist in purebred arabians sabino coloring is characterized by white markings such as high white above knees and hocks irregular spotting on legs belly and face white markings that extend beyond eyes or under chin and jaw and sometimes lacy or edges genetic mechanism that produces sabino patterning in arabians is undetermined and more than one gene may be involved studies at university of california davis indicate that arabians do not appear to carry autosomal dominant gene sb1 or sabino 1 that often produces bold spotting and some completely white horses in other breeds inheritance patterns observed in sabino like arabians also do not follow same mode of inheritance as sabino 1 thumb right a chestnut rabicano arabian horse alt a trotting horse with dark reddish brown coloring on neck upper back chest and legs but white hair on middle of body and at base of tail rabicano or roan there are very few arabians registered as roan and according to researcher d phillip sponenberg roaning in purebred arabians is actually action of rabicano genetics unlike a genetic roan rabicano is a partial roan like pattern horse does not have intermingled white and solid hairs over entire body only on midsection and flanks head and legs are solid colored some people also confuse a young gray horse with a roan because of intermixed hair colors common to both however a roan does not consistently lighten with age while a gray does colors that do not exist in purebreds purebred arabians never carry dilution genes beaver horse color p 98 therefore purebreds cannot be colors such as dun cremello palomino or buckskin gower horse color explained p 30 however there is pictorial evidence from pottery

horses with belly spots and other white markings deemed excessive were discouraged from registration and excess white was sometimes penalized in show ring to produce horses with some arabian characteristics but coat colors not found in purebreds they have to be crossbred with other breeds though purebred arabian produces a limited range of potential colors they do not appear to carry any color based lethal disorders such as frame overo gene o that can produce lethal white syndrome lws because purebred arabians cannot produce lws foals arabian mares were used as a non affected

overo lethal white compendium pp 945 950 genetic disorders there are six known genetic disorders in arabian horses two are inevitably fatal two are not inherently fatal but are disabling and usually result in euthanasia of affected animal remaining conditions can usually be treated three are thought to be autosomal recessive conditions which means that flawed gene is not sex linked and has to come from both parents for an affected foal to be born others currently lack sufficient research data to determine precise mode of inheritance goodwin et al caution and knowledge pp 100 105 arabians are not only breed of horse to have problems with inherited diseases fatal or disabling genetic conditions also exist in many other breeds including american quarter horse american paint horse american saddlebred appaloosa miniature horse and belgian genetic diseases that can occur in purebred arabians or in with arabian ancestry in both parents are following severe combined immunodeficiency scid recessive disorder fatal when homozygous carriers heterozygotes show no signs similar to bubble boy condition in humans an affected foal is born with a complete lack of an immune system and thus generally dies of an opportunistic infection usually before age of three months there is a dna test that can detect healthy horses who are carriers of gene causing scid thus testing and careful planned matings can now eliminate possibility of an affected foal ever being born lavender foal syndrome lfs also called coat color dilution lethal recessive disorder fatal when homozygous carriers show no signs condition has its name because most affected foals are born with a coat color dilution that lightens tips of coat hairs or even entire hair shaft foals with lfs are unable to stand at birth often have seizures and are usually euthanized within a few days of birth in november 2009 cornell university announced that a dna test has been developed to detect carriers of lfs simultaneously university of pretoria also announced that they had also developed a dna test bierman a 4 november 2009 lavender foal syndrome genetic test developed in south africa cerebellar ca or cca recessive disorder homozygous horses are affected carriers show no signs an affected foal is usually born without clinical signs but at some stage usually after six weeks of age develops severe incoordination a head tremor wide legged stance and other symptoms related to death of purkinje cells in cerebellum such foals are frequently diagnosed only after they have crashed into a fence or fallen over backwards and often are misdiagnosed as suffering from a head injury caused by an accident severity varies with some foals having fast onset of severe coordination problems others showing milder signs mildly affected horses can live a full lifespan but most are euthanized before adulthood because they are so accident prone as to be dangerous as of 2008 there is a genetic test that uses dna markers associated with ca to detect both carriers and affected animals clinical signs are distinguishable from other neurological conditions and a diagnosis of ca can be verified by examining brain after euthanasia occipital atlanto axial malformation oaam this is a condition where occiput atlas and axis vertebrae in neck and at base of skull are fused or malformed symptoms range from mild incoordination to paralysis of both front and rear legs some affected foals cannot stand to nurse in others symptoms may not be seen for several weeks this is only cervical spinal cord disease seen in horses less than 1 month of age and a radiograph can diagnose condition there is now a genetic test for oaam equine juvenile epilepsy or juvenile idiopathic epilepsy sometimes referred to as benign epilepsy is not usually fatal foals appear normal between epileptic seizures and seizures usually stop occurring between 12 and 18 months affected foals may show signs of epilepsy anywhere from two days to six months from birth equus staff good news about recovery from foal epilepsy equus seizures can be treated with traditional anti seizure medications which may reduce their severity though condition has been studied since 1985 at university of california davis genetic mode of inheritance is unclear though cases studied were all of one general bloodline group recent research updates suggest that a dominant mode of inheritance is involved in transmission of this trait one researcher hypothesized that epilepsy may be linked in some fashion to lavender foal syndrome due to fact that it occurs in similar bloodlines and some horses have produced foals with both conditions guttural pouch tympany occurs in horses ranging from birth to 1 year of age and is more common in fillies than in colts it is thought to be genetic in arabians possibly polygenic in inheritance but more study is needed foals are born with a defect that causes pharyngeal opening of eustachian tube to act like a

arabian horses are topic of many myths and legends one origin story tells how muhammad chose his foundation mares by a test of their courage and loyalty while there are several variants on tale a common version states that after a long journey through desert muhammad turned his herd of horses loose to race to an oasis for a desperately needed drink of water before herd reached water muhammad called for horses to return to him only five mares responded because they faithfully returned to their master though desperate with thirst these mares became his favorites and were called al khamsa

type mare named pure by queen of sheba a different version says that solomon gave a stallion zad el or zad el gift to rider to banu azd people when they came to pay tribute to king this legendary stallion was said to be faster than zebra and gazelle and every hunt with him was successful thus when he was put to stud he became a founding sire of legend chamberlin horse pp 166 167 yet another

description in classical arabic poetry p 19 origins arabians are one of oldest human developed horse breeds in world progenitor stock oriental subtype or proto arabian was believed to be a horse with oriental characteristics similar to modern arabian horses with these features appeared in rock paintings and inscriptions in arabian peninsula dating back 3500 years in ancient history throughout ancient near east horses with refined heads and high carried tails were depicted in artwork particularly that of ancient egypt in 16th century bc edwards arabian p 2 some scholars of arabian horse once theorized that arabian came from a separate subspecies of horse edwards arabian p 27 known as equus caballus other scholars including gladys brown edwards a noted arabian researcher believe that dry oriental horses of desert from which modern arabian developed were more likely equus ferus caballus with specific landrace characteristics based on environments in which they lived rather than being a separate subspecies horses with similar though not identical physical characteristics include marwari horse of india barb of north africa akhal teke of western asia and now extinct turkoman

purity in modern population cannot be traced beyond 200 years desert roots thumb upright carl raswan pictured on an anazeh alt a black and white photograph of a mounted man on a dark horse a hawk is perched on man s outstretched hand there are different theories about where ancestors of arabian originally lived most evidence suggests proto arabian came from area along northern edge of fertile crescent bennett conquerors pp 4 7 another hypothesis suggests southwestern corner of arabian peninsula in modern day yemen where three now dry riverbeds indicate good natural pastures existed long ago perhaps as far back as ice age edwards arabian pp 6 7 this hypothesis has gained renewed attention following a 2010 discovery of artifacts dated between and 7250 bce in al magar in southwestern saudi arabia that appeared to portray horses proto arabian horse may have been domesticated by people of arabian peninsula known today as bedouin some time after they learned to use camel approximately 4 000 5 000 years ago lumpkin camels of service and survival one theory is that this development occurred in nejd plateau in central arabia other scholars noting that horses were common in fertile crescent but rare in arabian peninsula prior to rise of islam theorize that breed as it is known today only developed in large numbers when conversion of persians to islam in 7th century brought knowledge of horse breeding and horsemanship to bedouin oldest depictions in arabian peninsula of horses that are clearly domesticated date no earlier than 1800 2000 bce regardless of origin climate and culture ultimately created arabian desert environment required a domesticated horse to cooperate with humans to survive humans were only providers of food and water in certain areas and even hardy arabian horses needed far more water than camels in order to survive most horses can only live about 72 hours without water where there was no pasture or water bedouin fed their horses dates and camel s milk edwards arabian p 24 desert horse needed ability to thrive on very little food and to have anatomical traits to compensate for life in a dry climate with wide temperature extremes from day to night weak individuals were weeded out of breeding pool and animals that remained were also honed by centuries of human warfare archer arabian horse pp 2 4 bedouin way of life depended on camels and horses arabians were bred to be war horses with speed endurance soundness and intelligence because many raids required stealth mares were preferred over stallions as they were quieter and therefore would not give away position of fighters a good disposition was also critical prized war mares were often brought inside family tents to prevent theft and for protection from weather and predators schofler daughters of desert equestrian magazine though appearance was not necessarily a survival factor bedouin bred for refinement and beauty in their horses as well as for more practical features strains and pedigrees for centuries bedouin tracked ancestry of each horse through an oral tradition horses of purest blood were known as asil and crossbreeding with non asil horses was forbidden mares were most valued both for riding and breeding and pedigree families were traced through female line bedouin did not believe in gelding male horses and considered stallions too intractable to be good war horses thus they kept very few colts selling most and culling those of poor quality edwards arabian pp 24 26 over time bedouin developed several sub types or strains of arabian horse each with unique characteristics and traced through maternal line only derry bred for perfection pp 104 105 according to arabian horse association five primary strains were known as seglawi hamdani and carl raswan a promoter and writer about arabian horses from middle of 20th century held belief that there were only three strains kehilan seglawi and muniqi raswan felt that these strains represented body types of breed with kehilan being masculine seglawi being feminine and muniqi being speedy archer arabian horse p 92 there were also lesser strains sub strains and regional variations in strain names forbis classic arabian horse pp 274 289 therefore many arabian horses were not only asil of pure blood but also bred to be pure in strain with crossbreeding between strains discouraged though not forbidden by some tribes purity of bloodline was very important to bedouin and they also believed in telegony believing if a mare was ever bred to a stallion of impure blood mare herself and all future offspring would be contaminated by stallion and hence no longer asil edwards arabian p 22 this complex web of bloodline and strain was an integral part of bedouin culture they not only knew pedigrees and history of their best war mares in detail but also carefully tracked breeding of their camels dogs and their own family or tribal history eventually written records began to be kept first written pedigrees in middle east that specifically used term arabian date to 1330 ad as important as strain was to bedouin modern studies of mitochondrial dna suggest that

horse is one which appears in any purebred arabian stud book or register listed by waho as acceptable by this definition over 95 of known purebred arabian horses in world are registered in stud books acceptable to waho waho also researched purity question in general and its findings are on its web site describing both research and political issues surrounding arabian horse bloodlines particularly in america at other end of spectrum organizations focused on bloodlines that are most meticulously documented to desert sources have most restrictive definitions for example asil club in europe only accepts a horse whose pedigree is exclusively based on bedouin breeding of arabian peninsula without any crossbreeding with non arabian horses at any time likewise al khamsa organization takes position that horse which are called al khamsa arabian horses are those horses in north america that can reasonably be assumed to descend entirely from bedouin arabian horses bred by horse breeding bedouin tribes of deserts of arabian peninsula without admixture from sources unacceptable to al khamsa most restrictive of all are horses identified as straight egyptian by pyramid society which must trace in all lines to desert and also to horses owned or bred by specific egyptian breeding programs by this definition straight egyptian arabians constitute only 2 of all arabian horses in america ironically some pure blooded desert bred arabians in syria had enormous difficulties being accepted as purebred arabians because many of bedouin who owned them saw no need to obtain a piece of paper
