resumed his visits after their return but he was no longer as close to them as he had been this was in part due to his awkwardness with mary who was preoccupied with her efforts to finish writing

health despite hogg s attempts to dissuade him he often invited hogg to visit him and mary which he never did john and prudentia hogg were glad to hear that shelleys had left england hoping that their

word of their union spread throughout durham and hogg stopped practising law there for some time because of damage to his reputation several of their friends were supportive of their union mary shelley particularly approved of their match despite having earlier been jealous of time hogg had spent with jane couple s first child mary prudentia hogg was born in november 1827 her parents did their best not to spread news because she was born soon after they began cohabiting mary prudentia died in may 1829 jane gave birth to their second daughter prudentia in 1836 and mary shelley was selected as her godmother hogg s friendship with mary shelley was disrupted several years later however when she republished percy shelley s queen mab in 1839 hogg rebuked her for leaving out its previous dedication to harriet shelley and they did not communicate with each other for several years legal career and scholarship hogg continued studying greek literature and was able to publish some of his opinions about greeks in radical westminster review he used opportunity to criticise treatment of greeks in tory publication quarterly review this article caused some controversy among hogg s conservative legal colleagues because advancement of his legal career had been hindered by his marriage to jane hogg hoped to receive a legal appointment from a politically connected acquaintance this was not an immediate option because whig party was in opposition but in summer of 1827 henry brougham promised hogg a future position as a professor of civil law at newly created university college london hogg embarked on a course of study in preparation but professorship was not established owing to a lack of funds this setback upset hogg greatly and he became very bitter about it a lecture that he had intended to give at his inauguration was published in 1831 hogg had also hoped that his friend thomas love peacock who worked for east india company would recommend him for a position there to hogg s dismay peacock would not help him although several years later peacock did help hogg s stepson gain employment with company thumb right lord chancellor brougham hogg published shelley

editor of edinburgh review napier chose another writer to review second volume which infuriated hogg henry brougham became lord chancellor of united kingdom after a whig election victory in 1833 he appointed hogg to a lucrative position on royal commission to examine municipal corporations hogg became a fierce critic of resulting municipal corporations act 1835 he preferred a more deliberate and less ideological approach than most of his fellow commission members and was considered by many to be an unusually conservative whig his commission work required him to be away from home for an extended period which proved to be very difficult for jane she knew that hogg was free to abandon her at any time because they were not legally married after receiving his appointment hogg finally visited norton house after a seven year absence but his family had not altered their opinion of his relationship with jane after his service on commission ended hogg resumed practising law in northern england where his brother john had also recently begun to practice john soon became offended by his brother objecting to his attempt to use family connections to advance his career hogg gained position of revising barrister for northumberland and berwick in 1838 this required him to travel to northern england twice a year jane often complained about these trips but hogg enjoyed visiting north he hoped that his legal service would earn him an appointment as a judge but he was to be disappointed in 1841 hogg wrote some recollections of childhood a historical novel set in london at time of norman conquest he published its chapters in instalments in edward bulwer s monthly chronicle book was not well received by critics who complained of its discursive nature and poor character

alphabet and antiquities entries in seventh edition family conflicts in 1843 hogg became target of a blackmail attempt by john edward johnson jane s husband johnson provided journalist barnard gregory with details of jane s marital status gregory soon published a report on her in satirist but made a crucial mistake gregory claimed that wife of james hogg a member of parliament for beverly was legally married to another man prompting james hogg to initiate a libel suit against gregory johnson quickly disappeared after he learned of error gregory was convicted of libel and served a brief prison sentence following his release he prepared a correction that he intended for publication which could have threatened hogg s legal position hogg appealed to leigh hunt who convinced gregory not to publish john edward johnson died in 1840 ensuring that jane would never be blackmailed because of her marital status although hogg and jane were now free to marry they chose not to to avoid revealing their situation hogg s mother prudentia died in 1839 as a condition of his father s will upon death of his mother thomas jefferson hogg could purchase his brother s share of norton house he decided not to because of potential cost of maintaining house and hostility jane could face there instead he allowed his brother to buy his interest in house a decision that led to conflict between two brothers regarding price and timing of sale they eventually worked out details and their relationship became friendlier once sale was completed hogg and his family subsequently lived a mostly quiet and stable life together at times their finances were strained although they were able to afford a cook and a maid hogg enjoyed spending time with his children and paid particular attention to their education he taught his daughter prudentia greek and latin but discouraged her from becoming a bluestocking hogg also tried to convince jane to study greek but was unsuccessful henry cleveland jane s nephew moved into their household after leaving military hogg then accepted henry as a member of family gardening had always been a hobby of hogg s and in his later years he often spent time maintaining his gardens with jane family s domestic peace was shattered when hogg s stepdaughter jane rosalind became romantically involved with henry hunt son of leigh hunt hunt had no clear employment prospects causing thomas and jane to doubt wisdom of a union hogg was very gentle when discussing this with his stepdaughter hoping to avoid treating her way that timothy shelley had treated percy shelley years earlier but mary shelley thought that hogg took much too passive a stance thomas and jane decided to send jane rosalind to france in an unsuccessful attempt to distract her but she soon returned and married hunt life of percy bysshe shelley in 1857 percy florence shelley poet s only surviving child invited hogg to produce a biography of his father who had died more than 30 years earlier shelley family provided hogg with a number of percy shelley s papers for use in his research first two volumes of life of percy bysshe shelley were published in 1858 but were poorly received by critics book was not as well edited as his previous article and many felt that it did not contain insights about shelley and his works that shelley at oxford did reception was not universally negative however and several of shelley s friends enjoyed book shelley family was very upset at way shelley was portrayed they demanded return of shelley s papers and obtained an injunction preventing publication of any further volumes hogg had begun writing a third but it was never completed death in later life hogg suffered from gout which forced him to curtail many of his
