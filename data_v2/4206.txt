friend august kubizek her jewish sounding maiden name isak has been subject to speculation in this context however there is no evidence apart from kubizek that hitler ever had such an attachment kubizek a childhood friend and later biographer of his childhood experience with hitler wrote about stefanie in his book adolf hitler my childhood friend he alleges that hitler fell in love with her after she passed by him during her daily daughter mother stroll in linz glancing at him in kubizek s account although in love with her to point of suicide hitler never once spoke with her and she later married an austrian army officer stefanie stated in interviews that she was unaware of hitler s feelings towards her and little is known about her life one sided relationship has been discussed in many books some question accuracy of kubizek s memoir only source for story others accept that there is some basis of fact but downplay significance of youthful infatuation while yet others consider that it gives valuable insight into development of hitler s personality background august kubizek a music student from linz first met hitler when two were competing for a place to stand during an opera performance according to him hitler s passion for stefanie began in spring 1905 when he was 16 and attending school in linz and she was 17 and lasted until 1909 when he was 20 kubizek describes first time he heard about hitler s obsession as follows one evening in spring of 1905 as we were taking our usual stroll adolf gripped my arm and asked me excitedly what i thought of that slim blonde girl walking along arm in arm with her mother you must know i m in love with her he added resolutely stefanie beata isak was born on 26 december 1887 in kingdom of bohemia she came from a family of higher social class than hitler s and was more than a year older than him stefanie had returned to linz after professional training in munich and geneva she had a brother karl richard isak who was studying law in vienna in 1950s dr franz jetzinger had two pictures of stefanie in her youth one from 1904 and one in ball dress from 1907 kubizek describes her as a distinguished looking girl tall and slim she had thick fair hair which she mostly wore swept back in a bun her eyes were very beautiful alleged interaction with hitler according to kubizek hitler never spoke to stefanie always saying he would do so tomorrow kubizek wrote that hitler loathed those who flirted with her especially military officers whom he called conceited blockheads he came to feel an uncompromising enmity towards officer class as a whole and everything military in general it annoyed him that stefanie mixed with such idlers who he insisted wore corsets and used scent hitler insisted that kubizek stalk stefanie and delivered daily reports on her activity while he was away visiting his mother or family in one report kubizek wrote that stefanie loved to dance and had taken lessons hitler disliked dancing and reportedly replied stefanie only dances because she is forced to by society on which she unfortunately depends on once stefanie is my wife she won t have slightest desire to dance in june 1906 stefanie allegedly gave hitler a smile and a flower from her bouquet as she was passing him in her carriage kubizek later described scene never again did i see adolf as happy as he was at that moment when carriage had passed he dragged me aside and with emotion he gazed at flower this visible pledge of her love i can still hear his voice trembling with excitement she loves me after hitler s mother died of breast cancer in 1907 funeral procession went through to leonding kubizek remarks that hitler said he had seen stefanie at funeral procession which gave him some consolation kubizek claims that stefanie had no idea how deeply adolf was in love with her she regarded him as a somewhat shy but nevertheless remarkably tenacious and faithful admirer when she responded with a smile to his inquiring glance he was happy and his mood became unlike anything i had ever observed in him but when stefanie as happened just as often coldly ignored his gaze he was crushed and ready to destroy himself and whole world kubizek claims that hitler finally stated he planned to kidnap stefanie and kill both her and himself by jumping off a bridge into danube instead he moved to vienna where according to kubizek an idealised image of stefanie became his moral touchstone stefanie stated in later interviews that she was unaware of hitler at time but that she had received an anonymous love letter asking her to wait for him to graduate and then to marry him which she only realised after being questioned about him must have been from hitler she recalled i once received a letter from someone who said they were to attend academy of arts and that i should wait for him he could come back and marry me i had no idea who letter might have been from or who i should have send it to at christmas in 1913 when he was living in munich hitler was said to have placed an anonymous personal ad in linz newspaper with his best wishes to her but she was already married and in vienna by then later years thumb st gertrud vienna where stefanie was married to maximilian rabatsch little is known about stefanie s overall life she became engaged in 1908 to an officer in hessian regiment stationed in linz on 24 october 1910 stefanie married maximilian rabatsch in vienna in st gertrud 3 in parish of maximilian was appointed captain on 1 november 1909 he was promoted to major on 1

interviewed and hitler s alleged love for her dramatised in a 1973 austro german television film called a young man from she could not understand why hitler if he felt so strongly had not given her any indication of his attachment saying hitler would hardly have suffered from too much shyness maiden name stefanie s maiden name isak sounds jewish although she was not jewish kubizek spelled it isaak correct spelling was identified by anton joachimsthaler in his 2003 hitlers liste ein dokument beziehungen munich 2003 pp 46 52 some historians opine that hitler would have assumed stefanie was of jewish origin american historian graeme donald believes hitler would have inferred that she was jewish but saw no problems with this at time this view is supported by german historian anton joachimsthaler who stated in a bbc interview that hitler must have assumed she was jewish because of her jewish surname british singer songwriter author journalist and paranormal researcher paul roland wrote in his book nazi women that it didn t make slightest difference to hitler whether she was jewish or not scholarly reactions role of rabatsch in hitler s life has been widely studied owens zalampas in a book analyzing relationship between hitler s views on art and his psychology notes that stories about rabatsch have been rejected by some scholars and accepted by others among those who reject stories about rabatsch are franz jetzinger and bradley f smith bradley f smith discussed story in his 1967 adolf hitler his family childhood and youth franz jetzinger discussed story in his 1958 hitler s youth jetzinger attacked kubizek in his book but confirmed that stefanie existed although she did not at time know of alleged infatuation in jetzinger s analysis kubizek relationship between rabatsch and hitler and some of interactions kubizek describes are impossible given timelines of their lives and focus of biographers on relationship represents a misguided attempt to fabricate an early love interest for hitler werner maser agrees with this view in his 1971 adolf hitler legende mythos wirklichkeit and suggests that hitler s behavior towards rabatsch was typical for austrian adolescents of his era zalampas notes that kubizek claims that hitler was interested in rabatsch s singing voice which kubizek claimed was a soprano and its suitability for singing wagnerian roles she suggests that hitler had a fantasy view of stefanie which is indicative of young hitler s mixing of reality and fantasy and his views about art war novels of karl may and wagnerian themes robert g l waite in his 1993 psychopathic god adolf hitler writes that rabatsch served as a defense against feelings of sexual inadequacy he suggests that hitler feared interacting with rabatsch in person since her reality may fall short of ideal of germanic virtue which hitler had fantasized she represented he repeats kubizek s belief that hitler left linz because he was unable to bear remaining in same place as rabatsch kubizek s story has been touched on by a number of other writers william l shirer drew on kubizek s account of one sided romance in his 1960 rise and fall of third reich in 1973 der spiegel reported that german and austrian broadcasters zdf and orf had produced a tv docudrama on hitler s youth that portrayed story of his infatuation with stefanie rabatsch brigitte hamann draws on story in her 2010 hitler s vienna a portrait of tyrant as a young man rose montero draws on kubizek s account in her 2013 las mujeres de los hombres mas de la historia danielle cites kubizek in her 2013 storia di un hugh trevor roper considered kubizek s memoirs to be a valuable examination of hitler s early life and said it will have an important place among source books of history ian kershaw relates story in his 2008 hitler a biography kershaw felt that kubizek had been helped in creating his book by a ghostwriter he considers story of stefanie exaggerated writing there can be little doubt that kubizek greatly embellishes what was at most a passing juvenile infatuation however kershaw concludes that although kubizek s book has weaknesses it also has intrinsic value as a portrait of young hitler frederic in his 2009 hitler and power of aesthetics notes that no documentation or sources other than kubizek s book provide any substantiation for alleged infatuation references notes citations bibliography rabatsch stefanie
