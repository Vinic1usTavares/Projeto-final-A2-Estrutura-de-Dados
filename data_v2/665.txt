droll deadpan monotone vocals difiore s trumpet work originated with mccrea s desire for a second melodic instrument to go with a song he had written a lead guitar playing those lines would have been really hokey i like it when it s a contrapuntal thing where guitar is doing one melody vocal is doing another melody and trumpet plays this third melody if music can be transparent enough you can hear
