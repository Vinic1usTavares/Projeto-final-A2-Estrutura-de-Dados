mann ultimately auditioned seven times before winning role oliver cooper as costa film is cooper s feature film debut costa s confident nature and backstory of being unwillingly moved to film s

brown as j b film is brown s feature film debut dax flame as dax a friend of costa s hired to chronicle party flame was discovered through his personal youtube video blog describing his character

thomas brady hender and nick as everett and tyler a pair of children hired as security for costa s party alexis knapp as alexis a popular high school girl knapp s character required nudity something with which she was initially uncomfortable stating i just had a lot of moral issues with it but i got over it and i heard that it s not that revealing so i m relieved knapp described her character as

drug dealer t rick rob as rob thomas s neighbor caitlin and peter mackenzie as thomas s mom and dad respectively nichole bloom as j b s girl and jesse marco as party dj television hosts jillian reynolds and jimmy kimmel cameo as themselves production development producer todd phillips described film as an experiment after executive producer alex heineman provided a basic concept with production team sharing tales of memorable parties that they had either attended or heard about writer michael bacall developed these stories into an outline scenario in one night with goal of creating high school party of all time remainder of story was fleshed out in following weeks bacall and drake were told to go crazy with script although bacall confessed i was a nerd in high school so i never did anything like what s in movie bacall worked on script generally at nights between simultaneously working on scripts for 21 jump street and scott pilgrim vs world nima nourizadeh had previously only worked directing music videos and commercials but he came to producers attention for his directing work on a series of party themed adidas commercials nourizadeh explained to producers how he would want to develop script and how he would want film to look and feel and he was eventually brought from london to los angeles for what he believed would be two weeks but stretched to two years phillips believed that nourizadeh s interpretation of film was compatible with his vision influencing decision to hire nourizadeh in his feature film debut project x was not intended to be title of film but it was kept to capitalize on interest generated by rumored secrecy surrounding project adding to secrecy producers decided to not send full scripts to any prospective cast member instead providing only watermarked individual pages casting to create impression that events of project x had actually happened producers decided against casting known faces but to find completely new actors phillips stated that goal of open call was to cast unknown actors and real people of all ethnicities who would not normally be given a chance to star in a film phillips and producer joel silver decided to create a nationwide open casting call allowing any united states resident over age of 18 to audition for project x through a specially created website actors were required to provide videos of themselves telling embarrassing or funny stories or dancing however traditional casting was still employed to allow actors with little professional acting credits to audition process allowed traits of selected actors to be incorporated into their characters including in several cases their respective characters taking actors names in casting three leads production avoided solo casting and instead had a group of three actors auditioning together switching out and adding different actors to see which group worked best together casting of low profile actors aided in keeping production budget low by avoiding larger salaries attached to stars to prepare for role and create a believable friendship between leads brown cooper and mann were sent to disneyland together and spent a weekend in a cabin at big bear city california principal photography principal photography was scheduled to begin on june 14 2010 in los angeles on a budget of 12 million filming took place over twenty five nights between 5pm and 5am on warner ranch in burbank california set contained a faux residential area featuring multiple houses house belonging to thomas was situated directly opposite house used by danny glover s character roger murtaugh in silver produced 1987 action film lethal weapon production decided to film on a set because locating a real neighborhood that could be effectively closed off and which would allow filming throughout evening and early morning proved difficult phillips explained that using a real neighborhood would have also proven difficult because of fire damage required for film much of set was destroyed as part of filming film was largely shot in chronological sequence as repairing set damage from a later scene to film an earlier one would have been difficult mann described filming as a party atmosphere with new york disc jockey jesse marco on set performing music even when cameras stopped rolling to maintain energy of cast and extras many of same extras were brought back for multiple nights of filming and would continue to party between scenes periodic takes of up to 20 minutes were made of just extras dancing during filming burbank police were called to set concerning noise complaints made by nearby residents project x was filmed in cinema verite style only displaying events of film through first person view of cameraman observing party to create effect of audience being in attendance at out of control party nourizadeh stated that style allowed film to seem real and show some of realities of what kids do cinematographer ken seng and nourizadeh tested twelve different camera systems before choosing digital hd sony f23 video camera basing their decision on its ability to handle sudden extreme changes in lighting due to natural daylight and strobe lights film is primarily presented from perspective of character dax and his camera but nourizadeh also obtained footage by providing cast and extras with recording devices such as and iphones to capture events occurring outside of perspective or knowledge of cameraman this resulted in hours of unusable footage that had to be observed by nourizadeh and his team to find segments that could be incorporated into final film nourizadeh stated when you have real material being shot by real people it then kind of feels like it is it is found footage i hated spending 10 hours looking through bits of flip footage people didn t press stop it s like in their pockets but yeah it was great man other footage was provided from fictional police and news cameras to give a different perspective on

out of five and referred to central characters portrayed by mann cooper and brown as spectacularly unlikable hewitt labeled characters unrepentant nihilistic vile venal animalistic avaricious charmless entitled sub kardashian stunningly irresponsible brats hewitt ended his review by stating that film was possibly worst film of last 20 years it s certainly worst comedy of last 20 years todd mccarthy of hollywood reporter was similarly critical calling it grimly depressing glumly unfunny but admitted that it would enthrall a portion of high school college age demographic it depicts just as it alternately outrages confounds and disgusts other presumably older audiences usa todays claudia puig found film treated female characters poorly labeling it a heinous misogynistic movie filled with faceless crowds and nary a character who resembles an actual human being a sentiment echoed by melissa anderson of village voice who felt film promoted skull numbing hedonism without consequences and second nature misogyny and that only purpose of male characters is to get high fuck bitches robbie collin of telegraph called film flamboyantly loathsome on every imaginable level and was critical of three lead characters saying unlike leads these three are unpleasant and supposedly comedic banter between them comes off as bullying los angeles timess robert abele called main trio numbingly predictable and film itself unoriginal stating film bears a cravenly attitude toward rewarding socially unacceptable behavior that feels unseemly rather than exciting new york times neil genzlinger said that funny script and skilled editing potentially made it animal house of iphone generation owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly praised film for updating cliches of similarly themed films from 1970s to 1980s like animal house and risky business so that they look just dangerous enough to make nostalgia feel naughty but stated that film does not offer anything more outrageous than real parties despite implying that it s breaking down bold new barriers of misbehavior gleiberman accused negative reviews of fulfilling role of all those uptight parents in 50s news reports about dangers of rock roll by applying moral judgments to events of film time out joshua rothkopf gave film four stars out of five calling it brainless but feeling that sheer anarchy of film s events were thrilling pete travers of rolling stone praised film as gut funny that appealed to a base youth element to become and run amok and said that it puts its own spin on animal house travers gave particular mention to mann as excellent however he also stated that nourizadeh s filmmaking was a disaster several reviewers were particularly critical towards cooper and his character hewitt called him most annoying movie character since jar jar binks while others similarly described him as singularly loathsome venal and without humor supremely annoying that dick in a sweater vest and a misogynistic imitation of jonah hill minus timing sad sack appeal and grace conversely genzlinger praised cooper for bringing a mischievous likability to costa that anchors events accolades cooper was nominated for two 2012
