average grade of a on an a to f scale roger ebert of chicago sun times offered a mixed review giving film three out of four stars despite complaining that film recycles a plot that was already old when tracy and hepburn were trying it out but adding he was eventually won over by performances peter travers of rolling stone was very critical of film calling it insipid he wrote anne fletcher directs peter chiarelli s script like a manufacturer of hard plastic that is guaranteed to ward off intrusion from all recognizable human emotion new york times writer manohla dargis felt that bullock s character was awkward in comparison to her previous work she continued she s always been better in fundamentally independent roles that allow her to grab wheel and take spotlight an independence that persists all way through last act coupling she can smile as brightly at a man as well as next leading lady though like all genuinely big female stars she s really more of a solo act telegraph tim robey expressed disappointment towards film giving it a two out of five stars interaction between reynolds and bullock was well received by critics lisa schwarzbaum of entertainment weekly opined that chemistry between two actors was fresh and irresistible kit of huffington post exclaimed that what kept audiences of this lite fare comedy in their seats is undeniable on screen chemistry between leads sandra bullock and ryan reynolds she continued two are so adept at comedy and have so much fun with one another viewers watching proposal won t be able to resist their charms even when some of plot veers in to unnecessarily silliness betsey of los angeles times felt that their relationship was a cheeky update of taming of shrew she opined bullock s deft physical comedy one of her most endearing qualities is given a full run reynolds ability to deliver a line or a look with withering surgical precision is there at every turn giving it a one out of five stars guardian writer peter bradshaw gave a negative reaction to interaction between reynolds and bullock bradshaw stated their initial sparky detestation isn t convincing and neither is their later thawing and romance in each scene it looks as if they have never met before and margaret isn t permitted to be a convincing cow because that would make her unsympathetic andrew can t be a total wimp because that would be unsexy
