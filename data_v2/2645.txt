notoc 56th independent mixed brigade was an imperial japanese army unit of world war ii it was raised in june 1944 to reinforce defences of japanese occupied borneo and was initially stationed in north east of island in early 1945 most of brigade s units were ordered to move to brunei bay area of west borneo with brigade s personnel subsequently making a difficult march across centre of island during june and july 1945 56th independent mixed brigade saw combat against australian forces in borneo campaign its units were greatly under strength at this time due to casualties suffered while moving across borneo and elements which engaged australian forces were rapidly defeated remainder of brigade withdrew into central borneo and surrendered to australians following end of war history formation during mid 1944 imperial japanese army s general staff decided to reinforce garrisons of southern philippines and borneo ahead of an expected allied offensive to liberate these areas as part of this effort 54th 55th 56th 57th and 58th independent mixed brigades were ordered to be formed for service with southern expeditionary army group during june aside from 58th independent mixed brigade which was formed by converting an existing unit these new brigades were to be organised in forward areas from personnel shipped from japan upon formation 56th independent mixed brigade was assigned to borneo defence force bdf process of establishing 56th independent mixed brigade took longer than expected which delayed its deployment to borneo while three battalions worth of personnel departed japan in mid july 1944 first did not arrive at borneo until september final elements of 56th independent mixed brigade reached borneo in mid november 8 000 personnel allocated to brigade had not trained together while in japan and were organised into fighting units after their arrival in borneo they were also shipped to borneo separately from their weapons and other equipment once its organisation was complete 56th independent mixed brigade comprised six infantry battalions 366th to 371st independent infantry battalions each with an authorised strength of 997 men and small artillery engineer and signal units like other independent mixed brigades raised in mid 1944 56th had only 18 trucks and a small number of horses to transport its equipment and supplies brigade was commanded by major general taijiro akashi bdf and its superior headquarters seventh area army initially disagreed over where 56th independent mixed brigade should be deployed in july 1944 bdf believed that allies were likely to invade northern borneo in january 1945 or later and wanted to station brigade in this area however seventh area army judged that allied forces were more likely to attack brunei bay region in western borneo to support a drive on singapore moreover area army believed that it would be difficult to transfer units from northern to western borneo due to island s rugged terrain bdf eventually won debate and 56th independent mixed brigade s units were landed in sandakan area of north east borneo as they arrived from japan once 56th independent mixed brigade arrived in borneo brigade headquarters and all combat battalions other than 371st independent infantry battalion were concentrated at tawau 371st independent infantry battalion was stationed in sandakan and placed under command of 41st independent garrison battalion as of 20 december 1944 brigade had responsibility for defending area around tawau and tarakan island redeployment thumb alt map of brunei

australian infantry units in north borneo during june and july 1945 in late 1944 37th army former bdf changed its views on likely allied intentions and concluded that expected invasion would probably be focused on brunei bay region southern expeditionary army group agreed with this assessment and ordered in january 1945 that 37th army s forces be concentrated around brunei bay as allies had air superiority over borneo and nearby waters it was not possible to move units in north east borneo by sea instead they would need to march across island 56th independent mixed brigade less its 369th and 370th independent infantry battalions began to march across borneo in late january 1945 this proved difficult with movement through mountainous jungle in centre of island being hampered by poor state of road network bad weather and food shortages many of brigade s soldiers fell sick during march and all four infantry battalions were considerably below their authorised strength by time they arrived at brunei bay between april and june 370th independent infantry battalion was transferred to direct control of 37th army and remained at tawau and 369th independent infantry battalion was shipped to banjarmasin in southern borneo during march and assigned to 22nd special naval base force brigade was widely dispersed following its arrival in brunei bay area in june 1945 brigade headquarters and 366th and 367th independent infantry battalions were stationed in brunei 368th independent infantry battalion was located at inland town of beaufort and 371st independent infantry battalion formed main body of island of labuan s garrison of support units 56th independent mixed brigade artillery unit was at brunei and 56th independent mixed brigade engineer and signal units were at beaufort all of brigade s heavy weapons had been left behind at tawau and due to casualties incurred during march across borneo its combat units were not fit for battle battle of north borneo two brigades of australian 9th division with large numbers of support units invaded brunei bay area on 10 june 1945 at this time 56th independent mixed brigade was main japanese combat force in region but was in process of withdrawing inland to defensive positions located around rice growing areas 371st independent infantry battalion was destroyed on labuan by 24th brigade during 11 days of at times fierce fighting 367th independent infantry battalion retreated from brunei to river as a formed unit and 366th independent infantry battalion broke up into small groups as it fought a rearguard action against australian 20th brigade while beaufort was attacked by 24th brigade 368th independent infantry battalion was not involved in its defence during last weeks of war remnants of 366th independent infantry battalion were pursued by australian army patrols air attacks and groups of local dayaks organised by australian services reconnaissance department these attacks led to disintegration of unit major general akashi led remnants of forces stationed at brunei as well as a number of japanese civilians to inland town of tenom this trek took 40 days and involved traversing mountainous and trackless terrain however forces involved suffered heavy casualties with 50 percent of 367th battalion s soldiers being killed between 10 june and end of war 369th and 370th independent infantry battalions did not see combat and remained largely intact at end of war following japanese surrender survivors of 56th independent mixed brigade were concentrated in locations selected by australian
