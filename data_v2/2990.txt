linx operated routes from oslo norway to stockholm sweden and from oslo via gothenburg sweden to copenhagen denmark services were provided up to ten times per day however slow speeds caused by curvy infrastructure in norway combined with competition from low cost airlines caused company to lose money and eventually grounded operations services were taken over by nsb and sj main rolling stock were eleven x2 electric multiple units although it used sj rc hauled trains on gothenburg oslo service company was based in gothenburg history thumb left linx x2 train at malmo central station linx was established following an informal agreement between ministers of transport in norway sweden and denmark to establish high speed rail connection between countries capitals linx was train operating part of agreement while governments would have to invest in better rail infrastructure to allow higher speeds company was introduced by nsb and sj on 12 may 2000 stated plans were to start with service from gothenburg to copenhagen in january 2001 from oslo to gothenburg in june and from oslo to stockholm in january 2002 company would have its head office in gothenburg and would lease rolling stock from sj nsb s chief executive officer osmund became company s first chair company had a share capital of 10 million swedish krona sek and was owned in equal shares by nsb and sj company s first train ran on 7 january from gothenburg to copenhagen service from oslo to gothenburg started on 17 june because linx was only to operate profitable routes it was decided that company not take over night train service from oslo to copenhagen nsb stated that they wanted all inter scandinavian passenger transport to be operated by new company and therefore decided to terminate night train as of september 2 although night trains were filled during summer and parts of winter there was a low ridership during rest of year however it was a lack of engineers that forced nsb to terminate night train service as of 20 june there were protests against ending of service particularly in norway marketing director oyvind of linx stated that we are concentrating on day trains we want to develop a holistic concept where new modern trains are a major part night trains do not fit into this concept x2 trains were never introduced on section from gothenburg to oslo linx stated that investments for nok 2 billion were needed on ostfold line to reach a travel time from oslo to gothenburg of 3 hours and 30 minutes rather than more than 4 hours at time in contrast norway vanern line on swedish side of border meets necessary standards first service from oslo to stockholm ran on 16 june 2002 initially there were only three daily services but later that year two more daily services were introduced at same time travel time was reduced by 20 minutes as trains stopped at only three intermediate stations linx operated with different prices on same route depending on if ticket was bought in norway or sweden company stated that this was in part because of a strong norwegian krone in part because norwegians were willing to pay more and in part because sales system in sweden was more automated thumb linx x2 unit at stockholm central station in july 2003 linx reduced number of daily services from gothenburg to copenhagen from ten to four company stated that this was because of insufficient ridership linx had offered tickets with a lower price than scandinavian airlines who operated airline service between oslo airport gardermoen and stockholm arlanda airport ryanair also provided an airline service but with fewer departures and with same center to center transport time because it flew from secondary sandefjord airport torp and stockholm airport from 1 september 2003 norwegian air shuttle started services from gardermoen to arlanda and became a more direct competitor to linx from 27 october nordic airlink later flynordic also started a flight between same airports with shorter travel time from center to center and comparable fares norwegian and nordic started taking market shares away from linx starting on december 15 nsb took over three of daily services from oslo to gothenburg by extending three of intercity services along ostfold line onwards from halden station to gothenburg on 24 january 2004 a linx train derailed at vestby station on ostfold line none of 50 passengers were hurt in incident on 11 june 2004 nsb and sj stated that they would discontinue linx and would operate last train on 31 december 2004 company had never made a profit and new low cost airlines had reduced ridership by up to 40 only part of service which was profitable was service from stockholm to karlstad which sj intended to continue nsb stated that if a new oslo stockholm service was to be introduced it would require state grants in september sj s ceo jan forsberg stated that problems lay with infrastructure in norway while speeds were high enough to operate with a profit in sweden and to copenhagen slow lines in norway made services to norway unprofitable linx had by then transported 1 3 million passengers and forsberg stated that had company transported 1 7 million people it would have been profitable closing was criticized by two engineers who stated that company actually made a profit but ended up paying 24 of their revenue in ticket commission to sj and nsb in 2003 company had a revenue of sek 426 8 million of which sek 411 million was from ticket sales company had a deficit of sek 33 8 million of which nsb covered sek 8 1 million and sj sek 25 6 million however nsb took a commission of sek 10 8 million and sj sek 58 5 million this gave a profit before provisions of sek 35 5 million in comparison narvesen took a commission of 2 7 for tickets sold by nsb closing of oslo stockholm service was first time there was not a train service between capitals since 1871 when line opened in addition service cut occurred at same time as centennial of dissolution of union between norway and sweden on 4 november sj and nsb stated that they would continue service but only on weekends they stated that an increased service would either require
