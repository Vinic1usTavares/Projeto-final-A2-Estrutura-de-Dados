for lindwall to see his melbourne masseur ern saunders who had lindwall s leg back to prime condition in a fortnight on public relations front bradman stated his firm belief that lindwall s delivery was fair during lengthy boat journey to england bradman emphasized to lindwall importance of caution with respect to his bowling action bradman advised lindwall to keep his dragging rear right foot even further than usual to avoid being no balled and to avoid bowling at full speed until umpires were satisfied with his action bradman assured lindwall that he was an automatic selection for tests even if he did not take a wicket in lead in tour matches telling him that being passed by umpires was first priority perry 2001 p 222 bradman recalled how ernie mccormick had been no balled 35 times in traditional tour opener against worcester during 1938 tour destroying his confidence lindwall was not no balled in first match at worcester and so it remained for rest of tour with matters now turned to actual bowling lindwall s classical bowling action evoked as much public interest as his captain s batting in a match against nottinghamshire at trent bridge he took 6 14 to gain a psychological blow for forthcoming test at same venue three of his victims were castled by his yorker in following match he twice skittled sussex with match figures of 11 59 five of whom were bowled

ignorance to allow lindwall to relax when teams reconvened at old trafford for third test hutton had been dropped reason was said to be hutton s struggles with lindwall s short pitched bowling perry 2001 p 224 australians were pleased feeling that hutton was england s best batsman england batted first and made 350 with compton making an unbeaten 145 despite being felled by a lindwall bouncer this

wisden recognised him by naming him as one of its five wisden cricketers of year in 1949 citing his ability to allow australia to seize initiative in all but one of tests by achieving early breakthroughs against their batting wisden said that by whatever standard he is judged lindwall must be placed permanently in gallery of great fast bowlers attributing his success to superb control of length and direction his change of pace and general skill like of which in a slower bowler could be classed as cunning ferocity of lindwall s bouncer often prompted opposing batsmen to retreat onto back foot even before he had released ball these efforts led him to achieve number 1 ranking in icc test bowlers ranking for 1948 which he regained in 1949 later career upon return of invincibles to
