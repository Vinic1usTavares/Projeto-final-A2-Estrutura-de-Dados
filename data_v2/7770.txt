hagerstrom joined rest of 8th fs at kila airfield near port moresby new guinea to fight in new guinea campaign he flew several missions out of kila in p 40 all without seeing combat 8th fs then relocated in early april 1943 to nearby dobodura airfield to rejoin rest of 49th fg shortly thereafter hagerstrom was promoted to first lieutenant his first combat experience and aerial victory came on april 11 when he joined a fight over oro bay with several japanese a6m zeros his first attempt at taking a shot at a zero failed because his guns were switched off but he later shot down a zero that was trailing two p 38 lightnings he returned to base with little fuel to spare while at dobodura 8th fs mainly escorted c 47 skytrains airdropping supplies to ground troops below at end of august 1943 squadron was moved to tsili tsili airfield hastily and covertly constructed in july on recently captured territory although it was not known whether surrounding area was clear of japanese forces airstrip was not attacked after two raids august 15 and 16 that did little damage 8th fs switched to escorting b 25 mitchell and a 20 havoc bombers but saw little action themselves they saw more combat when they began escorting high altitude b 17 flying fortress and b 24 liberator bombers however unit was often low on fuel and other supplies as a result of being at end of a long supply chain on october 5 hagerstrom led one of two formations to intercept an approaching ki 46 dinah reconnaissance aircraft over finschhafen he chased plane for twelve minutes climbing at full throttle to before getting within firing range he was able to damage dinah s left engine wing root and fuselage engine exploded and sprayed what hagerstrom guessed to be hydraulic fluid onto his plane causing him eye irritation he pursued crippled aircraft until it hit water after a malfunction with his navigational instruments he had to find his way back to airfield by following markham river running low on fuel and with tsili tsili in blackout due to another enemy reconnaissance plane hagerstrom had to estimate airstrip s location but landed safely later that month heavy rainfall made airstrip too muddy to allow p 38s to take off and 8th fs was relocated north to gusap airfield soon after hagerstrom contracted malaria and was sent to australia to recover for three weeks on january 23 1944 hagerstrom was leading a flight of four aircraft assisting p 38 lightnings escort bombers near wewak they encountered 10 15 enemy aircraft and he and his wingman john bodak dove on a group of zeros that were pursuing four p 38s hagerstrom shot down one of aircraft he took a shot at another zero but missed and was in turn targeted by a zero on his tail bodak destroyed this plane and hagerstrom in turn shot down a zero that was tailing his wingman he got a third zero and then went to assistance of several p 38s who had started a circle defensive maneuver hagerstrom fired a short burst at one of pursuing japanese planes a ki 61 tony he followed damaged aircraft and gave it another burst at short range causing it to catch fire and crash hagerstrom and bodak damaged several more zeros before running out of ammunition hagerstrom returned home with four victories for a total of six making him an ace he was awarded distinguished service cross for his extraordinary heroism during engagement by this time in war much of imperial japanese navy air service s small elite pilot corps had been killed in battle and japanese lacked time and resources to properly train enough replacement airmen by end of 1943 most of japanese pilots in sky were poorly trained and equipped while u s had all along emphasized large numbers of pilots of adequate skill in early february hagerstrom received orders to return home from new guinea which he called a terrible place due to poor conditions he had flown 170 combat missions comprising 350 hours and destroyed six enemy aircraft between wars after a period of rest back home in iowa hagerstrom went to miami florida to be reassigned he requested to be in a unit that flew jet aircraft but jets had not reached widespread production so he was instead made an instructor in army air forces school of applied tactics in p 47 thunderbolts at a base near orlando there he met virginia lee jowell a member of women airforce service pilots wasp and they were married on july 25 1944 shortly after virginia was transferred to brownsville texas to train in fighter aircraft while he was assigned to evansville indiana to be a test pilot for p 47s being produced at republic aviation plant there couple reunited when virginia finished her training and moved to evansville to serve as a ferry pilot for p 47s delivering them to coastal air bases to be shipped overseas james was promoted to rank of captain in january 1945 and he remained in evansville until september 6 of that year when he left usaaf hagerstrom and his now pregnant wife returned to waterloo and he re applied to iowa state teachers college to complete his studies president of college personally re enrolling him in october first of eight children was born hagerstrom graduated in june 1946 with a bachelor s degree in economics and subsequently went to houston texas to work in municipal bonds business he grew bored of bonds industry and wanted to keep flying so he joined 111th fighter bomber squadron 111th fbs of texas air national guard which he and his fellow pilots viewed as bottom of heap he enjoyed his tenure there and was successful becoming operations officer for 111th fbs within six months he flew p 38 lightning and f 51 mustang in national air races in september 1949 he took sixth place in thompson trophy race and won a 1 500 prize flying his f 51 at an average speed of hagerstrom was promoted to major and appointed commander of 111th fbs in june 1950 in october 111th fbs was federalized and ordered into active duty to serve in korean war hagerstrom s assignment was at headquarters of tactical air command tac at langley air force base virginia where he persuaded commander to allow him and some other officers to fly a combat tour in korea they were allowed to transfer from air national guard into active duty air force hagerstrom was sent to nellis air force base in nevada where he was instructed by william t whisner jr in gunnery of jet powered f 80 shooting star and f 86 sabre he became operations officer of 4th fighter interceptor group korean war preparation and first two victories 1952 hagerstrom keen for any edge that would give him chance to be an ace in two wars prepared extensively for flying in korea he studied gun sights and intelligence reports on mig 15 and he made metric conversion tables to allow him to patrol altitudes where migs commonly flew he got a pair of moccasin boots lined with felt a silk lined flight suit for winter insulation and special mirrored sunglasses that allowed him to see twice as far as normal at risk of permanently ruining his eyes air force issued its pilots a standard survival kit to which he added 30 days worth of food including of rice a camp stove maps a monocular a radio and a sleeping bag he had vacuum packed into a tin can he also obtained a 22 hornet rifle issued to strategic air command because he thought standard 45 caliber pistol would be ineffective against patrols with rifles if he had to bail out over enemy territory he planned to fight off any patrols searching for him and then hike a day toward demilitarized zone between north and south korea according to hagerstrom this obsessive preparation helped him control his fear difference between panic and fear is pretty tight and you can spread that line a bit by having one last chance thumb left hagerstrom flew an f 86 sabre in korean war alt an f 86 a single seat jet aircraft in flight upon arrival in korea hagerstrom was assigned to 334th fighter interceptor squadron of fifth air force s 18th fighter bomber wing 18th fbw at this time 4th and 51st fighter interceptor wings were only units equipped with f 86 sabres but hagerstrom was able to convince his commander to let him and several other officers fly these aircraft despite not being in designated wings hagerstrom registered 18th fbw s first victory of war on november 21 1952 about south of yalu river mig pilot hagerstrom was shooting at ejected just before his plane exploded hagerstrom was separated from his wingman and no one witnessed action so kimpo air base group commander royal n baker refused to confirm it unless he had good film from his gun camera this proved unnecessary when baker confirmed victory after seeing that a piece of exploded mig was embedded in hagerstrom s f 86 on december 24 hagerstrom led a group of jets that attacked three migs in formation just south of yalu near sup ung dam twenty more migs arrived from manchuria and hagerstrom managed to damage three enemy aircraft while being chased as far south as chongchon river next day hagerstrom was to have day off for christmas but he still wanted more action i tried to get some of men to trade with me i m not on schedule today but with weather like this they know there are migs up there near yalu no one was willing to trade his mission for my day off he was able to talk his superiors into giving him a mission and he ended up getting only confirmed kill of day when mig he was chasing spun out of control at an altitude of so high that hagerstrom did not fire for fear of stalling pilot ejected most likely dying of exposure to temperatures ace status 1953 in january 1953 hagerstrom was transferred to osan air base to help rest of pilots of 18th fbw transition from propeller p 51 mustangs to jet f 86s beginning on january 28 despite cold weather and a limited number of instructor pilots wing s 125 pilots were trained in f 86 in under a month on february 3 hagerstrom was named commander of 67th fighter bomber squadron and on february 25 he was part of 18th fbw s first patrol in sabre jets he was chasing two migs when he noticed a third attacking another f 86 he engaged and shot it down flying very low over mukden china low on fuel he had just enough to land and park aircraft back at osan on march 13 hagerstrom and his wingman elmer n dunlap came across two migs first of which hagerstrom by his own account shot daylights out of he fired at second until he ran out of ammunition and remaining mig was leaking fuel and its engine had stopped hagerstrom told dunlap to finish off crippled plane and mig s pilot bailed over enemy s antung airfield that mission gave hagerstrom a total of 4 5 victories just short of five kills needed for ace status knowing that he was likely to be transferred out soon he became even more determined to get another victory giving a speech to his men on march 27 gentlemen i ve been living on coffee i haven t been sleeping i ve got to do this thing i m gonna do it and if you don t want to go with me that s fine i ll understand we are going to go up there and give it one good college try south of yalu and if we don t scare anything up i m going after them today as it turned out he did get it that day he sneaked up behind six migs and fired on one but by sheer ass luck it knocked his wing tip off he kept up chase shooting short bursts until pilot chinese ace wang hai ejected right above his own base on way home hagerstrom destroyed another mig bringing total to 6 5 he became war s 28th ace and would be only one from 18th fbw hagerstrom scored another victory on april 13 when he fired a long burst at a single mig flying at plane burst into flames and went down near chongchon river in early may he learned that he was to return to u s on his last day in korea may 16 he was waiting for a military air transport service plane to become available for his flight out to tachikawa airfield when he got a call from a friend who said he needed four planes in air he said i got tired of inaction so i posted name sam kratz on flight board and went out as a regular combat officer and not as a squadron commander as on other missions hagerstrom took off still wearing his blue dress uniform instead of a flight suit and flight soon came across formation of 24 migs he pretended to have communication difficulties to prevent mission from being recalled because they were heavily outnumbered when migs turned and headed toward safety of chinese airspace hagerstrom attacked one of planes and followed it into a dive firing short bursts after his target crashed he pulled out and flight and headed back to base reporting large number of migs during debriefing his commanding officer interrupted and assured hagerstrom that he would be on next c 54 skymaster flight out before he could take another risky flight mission gave him 8 5 victories for war in 101 missions attitude toward combat like many other aces hagerstrom had an aggressive attitude toward his missions in his book officers in flight suits historian john darrell sherwood calls this a flight suit attitude which he defines as a sense of self confidence and pride that verged on arrogance where status was based upon flying ability not degrees rank or officer skills he believes this is why hagerstrom frequently butted heads with military bureaucrats and never became a general himself hagerstrom volunteered for extra flights on his days off once flying under a pseudonym determined to be at full mental capacity during missions he never drank unlike most other pilots some of whom flew while hungover or left korea as alcoholics he was critical of pilots who wanted to just complete their requisite 100 missions and avoid conflict and danger he was twice abandoned by his wingman during a fight hagerstrom enjoyed adrenaline rush of combat and would put himself at more risk in an effort to shoot down more planes he would fly into chinese airspace despite it being forbidden by united nations command and on one mission he buzzed antung airfield by flying near speed of sound at an altitude of in an attempt to get migs off ground because u s pilots were not allowed to attack planes on ground f 86 bases were near seoul south korea which was from where they would patrol in mig alley getting there used so much fuel that they were supposed to spend only twenty minutes flying around yalu in search of migs but hagerstrom did his own calculations and determined he could make it back to base with of fuel half of recommended minimum he had to set an alarm to remind himself when to head back but he often went beyond that once running out of gas just after landing regarding shooting down planes hagerstrom focused on machine rather than human in aircraft saying i never shot directly at pilot nor did i shoot anyone dangling from a parachute he had a similar response whenever a fellow american or allied pilot was killed he thought about technical aspects of death and how it could be prevented in future rather than grieving loss of a friend during world war ii he said there is no emotion like is shown in movies they just say tough luck after korea hagerstrom remained in usaf after he returned to u s after a reunion with his family he was assigned to operations section of ninth air force at pope air force base in fayetteville north carolina he flew an f 86 in september 1953 bendix trophy air race

members of republic of china air force about combat against migs he briefly returned to texas as an advisor for air national guard and in april 1957 was honored with dedication of a new hangar at ellington field in houston in his name he then was sent to hawaii to join staff of feaf which had been renamed pacific air forces pacaf at its new headquarters at hickam air force base he was promoted to colonel in march 1959 and earned a master s degree in economics from jackson college his job with pacaf was to assess air forces of u s and their allies after evaluating new aim 9 sidewinder air to air missile he advocated for retaining guns on fighter jets instead of replacing them with missiles an opinion at odds with military leadership in 1960 he left hawaii for a position with office of inspector general at norton air force base in san bernardino california while at norton he studied at loyola law school in los angeles three nights a week before attending industrial college of armed forces icaf which required him to relocate to washington d c once settled he also enrolled at georgetown law he graduated from icaf in june 1964 having written a thesis on role of air power in a

serve with seventh air force there he flew 30 combat missions while serving as director of combat operations control center at tan son nhut air base he soon came into conflict with general william westmoreland over air force s role in military assistance command vietnam hagerstrom proposed that air assets be used against strategic targets in north vietnam while westmoreland insisted that they be used solely in country to support army ground operations after hagerstrom argued against decision not to bomb hanoi in 1965 westmoreland asked air force to remove hagerstrom from vietnam he was

center to conduct air interdiction operations against north vietnamese army on ho chi minh trail on march 3 royal lao air force commander thao ma requested help from usaf in defending town of laos royal lao armed forces were suffering low morale and faced pressure from viet cong vc fighters who had taken two nearby towns hagerstrom assisted in planning use of an ac 47 spooky gunship equipped with a night vision starlight scope which had previously been typically used by ground forces to attack vc positions around town ambush of vc took place on night of march 4 and was successful despite several malfunctions and aircraft was not hit by enemy fire hagerstrom said he conservatively estimated that 200 vc were killed in attack using this to argue that air attacks cause fewer casualties than a war of attrition strategy with ground forces hagerstrom also tried to obtain release of james robinson risner a prisoner of war who had also been an ace in korea hagerstrom enlisted help of cbs news anchor walter cronkite and lawyer james b donovan who had negotiated release of francis gary powers after 1960 u 2 incident to start a fundraiser for risner s bail but u s state department
