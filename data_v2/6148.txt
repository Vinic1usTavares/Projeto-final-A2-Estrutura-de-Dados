starving literally hinton 1997 page 100 released in 1968 album eventually achieved critical acclaim but it originally received an indifferent response from public it was described by allmusic s william ruhlmann as hypnotic meditative and as possessing a unique musical power it has been compared to french impressionism and mystical celtic poetry hinton 1997 pages 88 89 a 2004 rolling stone magazine review begins with words this is music of such enigmatic beauty that thirty five years after its release astral weeks still defies easy admiring description alan light later described astral weeks as like nothing he had done previously and really nothing anyone had done previously morrison sings of lost love death and nostalgia for childhood in celtic soul that would become his signature it has been placed on many lists of best albums of all time in 1995 mojo list of 100 best albums it was listed as number two and was number nineteen on rolling stone magazine s 500 greatest albums of

morrison in 1972 morrison s third solo album moondance which was released in 1970 became his first million selling album and reached number twenty nine on billboard charts turner 1993 page 95 turner 1993 page 98 style of moondance stood in contrast to that of astral weeks whereas astral weeks had a sorrowful and vulnerable tone moondance restored a more optimistic and cheerful message to his music yorke 1975 page 69 which abandoned previous record s abstract folk compositions in favor of more formally composed songs and a lively rhythm and blues style he expanded on throughout his career title track although not released in us as a single until 1977 received heavy play in fm radio formats rogan 2006 page 250 into mystic has also gained a wide following over years come running which reached american top 40 rescued morrison from what seemed then as hot 100 obscurity moondance was both well received and favourably reviewed lester bangs and greil marcus had a combined full page review in rolling stone saying morrison now had striking imagination of a consciousness that is visionary in strongest sense of word that was type of band i dig morrison said of moondance sessions two horns and a rhythm section they re type of bands that i like best he produced album himself as he felt like nobody else knew what he wanted heylin 2003 page 226 moondance was listed at number sixty five on rolling stone magazine s 500 greatest albums of all time in march 2007 moondance was listed as number seventy two on narm rock and roll hall of fame list of definitive 200 over next few years he released a succession of albums starting with a second one in 1970 his band and street choir had a freer more relaxed sound than moondance but not perfection in opinion of critic jon landau who felt like a few more numbers with a gravity of street choir would have made this album as perfect as anyone could have stood it contained hit single domino which charted at number nine in billboard hot 100 collis 1996 page 122 in 1971 he released another well received album tupelo honey rogan 2006 page 259 this album produced hit single wild night that was later covered by john mellencamp title song has a notably country soul feel about it and album ended with another country tune moonshine whiskey morrison said he originally intended to make an all country album rogan 2006 pages 267 268 recordings were as live as possible after rehearsing songs musicians would enter studio and play a whole set in one take turner 1993 page 107 his co producer ted templeman described this recording process as scariest thing i ve ever seen when he s got something together he wants to put it down right away with no overdubbing hinton 1997 page 137 released in 1972 saint dominic s preview revealed morrison s break from more accessible style of his previous three albums and moving back towards more daring adventurous and meditative aspects of astral weeks combination of two styles of music demonstrated a versatility not previously found in his earlier albums two songs jackie wilson said i m in heaven when you smile and redwood tree reached hot 100 singles chart songs listen to lion and almost independence day are each over ten minutes long and employ type of poetic imagery not heard since astral weeks heylin 2003 pages 255 256 it was his highest charting album in us until his top ten debut on billboard 200 in 2008 he released his next album hard nose highway in 1973 receiving mixed but mostly negative reviews album contained popular song warm love but otherwise has been largely dismissed critically heylin 2003 pages 265 267 in a 1973 rolling stone review it was described as psychologically complex musically somewhat uneven and lyrically excellent during a three week vacation visit to ireland in october 1973 morrison wrote seven of songs that made up his next album veedon fleece turner 1993 page 122 though it attracted scant initial attention its critical stature grew markedly over years with veedon fleece now often considered to be one of morrison s most impressive and poetic works rogan 2006 page 301 in a 2008 rolling stone review andy greene writes that when released in late 1974 it was greeted by a collective shrug by rock critical establishment and concludes he s released many wonderful albums since but he s never again hit majestic heights of this one you don t pull no punches but you don t push river one of album s side closers exemplifies long hypnotic cryptic morrison with its references to visionary poet william blake and to seemingly grail like veedon fleece object rogan 2006 page 300 morrison took three years to release a follow up album after a decade without taking time off he said in an interview he needed to get away from music completely and ceased listening to it for several months rogan 2006 page 306 also suffering from writer s block he seriously considered leaving music business for good heylin 2003 page 305 speculation that an extended jam session would be released either under title mechanical bliss or naked in jungle or stiff upper lip came to nothing rogan 2006 pages 304 306 and morrison s next album was a period of transition in 1977 a collaboration with dr john who had appeared at last waltz concert with morrison in 1976 album received a mild critical reception and marked beginning of a very prolific period of song making into music album s last four songs angelou and healing has begun and it s all in game you know what they re writing about are a veritable tour de force with morrison summoning every vocal trick at his disposal from angelou s climactic shouts to sexually charged half mumbled monologue in and healing has begun to barely audible whisper that is album s final sound scott thomas review following year morrison released wavelength it became at that time fastest selling album of his career and soon went gold hinton 1997 page 210 title track became a modest hit peaking at number forty two making use of 1970s synthesisers it mimics sounds of shortwave radio stations he listened to in his youth opening track kingdom hall name given by jehovah s witnesses to their places of worship evoked morrison s childhood experiences of religion with his mother and foretold religious themes that were more evident on his next album into music considered by allmusic as definitive post classic era morrison into music was released in last year of 1970s songs on this album for first time alluded to healing power of music which became an abiding interest of morrison s hage 2009 page 89

record on site of a former abbey what is considered to be most controversial album in his discography later morrison admitted his original concept was even more esoteric than final product hinton 1997 page 230 heylin 2003 page 365 album common one consisted of six songs longest summertime in england lasted fifteen and a half minutes and ended with words can you feel silence nme magazine s paul du noyer called album colossally smug and cosmically dull an interminable vacuous and egotistical stab at spirituality into muzak greil marcus whose previous writings had been favourably inclined towards morrison critically remarked it s van acting part of mystic poet he thinks he s supposed to be morrison insisted album was never meant to be a commercial album biographer clinton heylin concludes he would not attempt anything so ambitious again henceforth every radical idea would be tempered by some notion of later critics reassessed album more favourably with success of summertime in england lester bangs wrote in 1982 van was making holy music even though he thought he was and us rock critics had made our usual mistake of paying too much attention to lyrics morrison s next album beautiful vision released in 1982 had him returning once again to music of his northern irish roots rogan 2006 page 338 well received by critics and public it produced a minor uk hit single cleaning windows that referenced one of morrison s first jobs after leaving school rogan 2006 pages 337 338 several other songs on album stairway she gives me religion and instrumental scandinavia show presence of a

scandinavia with morrison on piano was nominated in best rock instrumental performance category for 25th annual grammy awards much of music morrison released throughout 1980s continued to focus on themes of spirituality and faith his 1983 album inarticulate speech of heart was a move towards creating music for meditation with synthesisers pipes and flute sounds and four of tracks were instrumentals turner 1993 page 153 titling of album and presence of instrumentals were noted to be indicative of morrison s long held belief that it s not words one uses but force of conviction behind those words that matters during this period of time morrison had studied scientology and gave special thanks to l ron hubbard on album s credits turner 1993 page 150 a sense of wonder morrison s 1985 album pulled together spiritual themes contained in his last four albums which were defined in a rolling stone review as rebirth into music deep contemplation and meditation common one ecstasy and humility beautiful vision and blissful mantra like languor inarticulate speech of heart single tore down a la rimbaud was a reference to rimbaud and an earlier bout of writer s block that morrison had encountered in 1974 heylin 2003 page 308 in 1985 morrison also wrote musical score for movie lamb starring liam neeson collis 1996 page 162 morrison s 1986 release no guru no method no teacher was said to contain a genuine holiness and musical freshness that needs to be set in context to understand hinton 1997 page 255 critical response was favourable with a sounds reviewer calling album his most intriguingly involved since astral weeks and morrison at his most mystical magical best heylin 2003 page 396 rogan 2006 page 360 it contains song in garden that according to morrison had a definite meditation process which is a form of transcendental meditation as its basis it s not tm he entitled album as a rebuttal to media attempts to place him in various creeds hinton 1997 page 253

allmusic who called it a roots effort that never sounds studied music vocals featuring his characteristic growl a mix of folk blues soul jazz gospel and ulster scots celtic influences morrison is widely considered by many rock historians to be one of most unusual and influential vocalists in history of rock and roll critic greil marcus has said no white man sings like van morrison in his 2010 book marcus wrote as a physical fact morrison may have richest and most expressive voice pop music has produced since elvis presley and with a sense of himself as an artist that elvis was always denied marcus 2010 page 7 as morrison began live performances of 40 year old album astral weeks in 2008 there were comparisons to his youthful voice of 1968 his early voice was described as flinty and tender beseeching and plaintive forty years later difference in his vocal range and power were noticeable but reviewers and critic s comments were favourable morrison s voice has expanded to fill his frame a deeper louder roar than blue eyed soul voice of his youth softer on diction but none less impressively powerful morrison also commented on changes in his approach to singing approach now is to sing from lower down diaphragm so i do not ruin my voice before i sang in upper area of my throat which tends to wreck vocal cords over time singing from lower in belly allows my resonance to carry far i can stand four feet from a mic and be heard quite neil chris performing songwriter issue 116 march april 2009 pages 44 50 songwriting and lyrics morrison has written hundreds of songs during his career with a recurring theme reflecting a nostalgic yearning for carefree days of his childhood in belfast some of his song titles derive from familiar locations in his childhood such as cyprus avenue a nearby street orangefield boys school he attended and on hyndford street where he was born also frequently present in morrison s best love songs is a blending of sacred profane as evidenced in into mystic and so quiet in here hinton 1997 page 13 beginning with his 1979 album into music and song and healing has begun a frequent theme of his music and lyrics has been based on his belief in healing power of music combined with a form of mystic christianity this theme has become one of predominant qualities of his work collis 1996 page 149 his lyrics show an influence of visionary poets william blake and w b 1997 page 12 and others such as samuel taylor coleridge and william wordsworth turner 1993 page 145 biographer brian hinton believes like any great poet from blake to seamus heaney he takes words back to their origins in magic indeed morrison is returning poetry to its earliest roots as in homer or old english epics like beowulf or psalms or folk song in all of which words and music combine to form a new reality another biographer john collis believes morrison s style of jazz singing and repeating phrases preclude his lyrics from being regarded as poetry or as collis asserts he is more likely to repeat a phrase like a mantra or burst into scat singing words may often be prosaic and so can hardly be poetry collis 1996 page 10 morrison has described his songwriting method by remarking that i write from a different place i do not even know what it is called or if it has a name it just comes and i sculpt it but it is also a lot of hard work doing sculpting performance style critic greil marcus argues that given truly distinctive breadth and complexity of morrison s work it is almost impossible to cast his work among that of others morrison remains a singer who can be compared to no other in history of rock roll a singer who cannot be pinned down dismissed or fitted into anyone s expectations marcus 1992 page 447 or in words of jay cocks he extends himself only to express himself alone among rock s great figures and even in that company he is one of greatest morrison is adamantly inward and unique although he freely crosses musical boundaries r b celtic melodies jazz rave up rock hymns down and dirty blues he can unfailingly be found in same strange place on his own wavelength his spiritually themed style of music first came into full expression with astral weeks in 1968 and he was noted to have remained a master of his transcendental craft in 2009 while performing astral weeks songs live this musical art form was based on stream of consciousness songwriting and emotional vocalising of lyrics that have no basis in normal structure or symmetry his live performances are dependent on building dynamics with spontaneity between himself and his band whom he controls with hand gestures throughout sometimes signalling impromptu solos from a selected band member music and vocals build towards a hypnotic and trance like state that depends on in moment creativity scott foundas with la weekly wrote he seeks to transcend apparent boundaries of any given song to achieve a total freedom of form to take himself his band and audience on a journey whose destination is anything but known greil marcus wrote an entire book devoted to examining moments in morrison s music where he reaches this state of transcendence and explains but in his music same sense of escape from ordinary limits a reach for or achievement of a kind of violent transcendence can come from hesitations repetitions of words or phrases pauses way a musical change by another musician is turned by morrison as a bandleader or seized on by him as a singer and changed into a sound that becomes an event in and of itself in these moments self is left behind and sound that becomes active agent a musical person with its own mind its own body a book reviewer further described it as this transcendent moment of music when song and singer are one thing not two neither dependent on other or separate from other but melded to other like one like breath and life morrison has said he believes in jazz improvisational technique of never performing a song same way twice and except for unique rendition of astral weeks songs live doesn t perform a concert from a preconceived set list morrison has said he prefers to perform at smaller venues or symphony halls noted for their good acoustics his ban against alcoholic beverages which made entertainment news during 2008 was an attempt to prevent disruptive and distracting movement of audience members leaving their seats during performances in a 2009 interview morrison stated i do not consciously aim to take listener anywhere if anything i aim to take myself there in my music if listener catches wavelength of what i am saying or singing or gets whatever point whatever line means to them then i guess as a writer i may have done a day s work genre music of van morrison has encompassed many genres since his early days as a blues and r b singer in belfast over years he has recorded songs from a varying list of genres drawn from many influences and interests as well as blues and r b his compositions and covers have moved between pop music jazz rock folk country gospel irish folk and traditional big band skiffle rock and roll new age classical and sometimes spoken word coney island and instrumentals hinton 1997 page 15 morrison defines himself as a soul singer morrison s music has been described by music journalist alan light as celtic soul or what biographer brian hinton referred to as a new alchemy called caledonian soul another biographer ritchie yorke quoted morrison as believing that he has spirit of caledonia in his soul and his music reflects it yorke 1975 page 159 according to yorke morrison claimed to have discovered a certain quality of soul when he first visited scotland his belfast ancestors were of ulster scots descent and morrison has said he believes there is some connection between soul music and caledonia yorke said morrison discovered several years after he first began composing music that some of his songs lent themselves to a unique major modal scale without sevenths which of course is same scale as that used by bagpipe players and old irish and scottish folk music caledonia name caledonia has played a prominent role in morrison s life and career biographer ritchie yorke had pointed out already by 1975 that morrison has referred to caledonia so many times in his career that he seems to be obsessed with word in his 2009 biography erik hage found morrison seemed deeply interested in his paternal scottish roots during his early career and later in ancient countryside of england hence his repeated use of term caledonia an ancient roman name for scotland northern britain hage 2009 page 52 as well as being his daughter shana s middle name it is name of his first production company his studio his publishing company two of his backing groups his parents record store in fairfax california in 1970s and he also recorded a cover of song with name spelled caledonia in 1974 collis 1996 morrison used caledonia in what has been called a quintessential van morrison moment in song listen to lion with lyrics and we sail and we sail way up to caledonia morrison used caledonia as a mantra in live performance of song astral weeks recorded at two hollywood bowl concerts as late as 2016 s keep me singing album he recorded a self penned instrumental entitled caledonia swing influence morrison s influence can readily be heard in music of a diverse array of major artists and according to rolling stone encyclopedia of rock and roll simon schuster 2001 his influence among rock singers song writers is unrivaled by any living artist outside of that other prickly legend bob dylan echoes of morrison s rugged and his gruff feverish emotive vocals can be heard in latter day icons ranging from bruce springsteen to elvis costello his influence includes u2 bono was quoted saying i am in awe of a musician like van morrison i had to stop listening to van morrison records about six months before we made unforgettable fire
