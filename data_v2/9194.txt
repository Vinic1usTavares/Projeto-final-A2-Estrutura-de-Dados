battle of milne bay 25 august 7 september 1942 also known as operation re or battle of rabi i by japanese was a battle of pacific campaign of world war ii japanese naval infantry troops known as kaigun tokubetsu rikusentai special naval landing forces with two small tanks attacked allied airfields at milne bay that had been established on eastern tip of new guinea due to poor intelligence work japanese miscalculated size of predominantly australian garrison and believing that airfields were only defended by two or three companies initially landed a force roughly equivalent in size to one battalion on 25 august 1942 allies forewarned by intelligence from ultra had heavily reinforced garrison despite suffering a significant setback at outset when part of their small invasion force had its landing craft destroyed by allied aircraft as they attempted to land on coast behind australian defenders japanese quickly pushed inland and began their advance towards airfields heavy fighting followed as they encountered australian militia troops that formed first line of defence these troops were steadily pushed back but australians brought forward veteran second australian imperial force units that japanese had not expected allied air superiority helped tip balance providing close support to troops in combat and targeting japanese logistics finding themselves heavily outnumbered lacking supplies and suffering heavy casualties japanese withdrew their forces with fighting coming to an end on 7 september 1942 battle is often described as first major battle of war in pacific in which allied troops decisively defeated japanese land forces although japanese land forces had experienced local setbacks elsewhere in pacific earlier in war unlike at milne bay these earlier actions had not forced them to withdraw completely and abandon their strategic objective nor did they have such a profound impact upon thoughts and perceptions of allies towards japanese and their prospects for victory milne bay showed limits of japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in face of increasingly larger allied troop concentrations and command of air as a result of battle allied morale was boosted and milne bay was developed into a major allied base which was used to mount subsequent operations in region background geography milne bay is a sheltered bay at eastern tip of territory of papua now part of papua new guinea it is long and wide and is deep enough for large ships to enter coastal area is flat with good aerial approaches and therefore suitable for airstrips although it is intercut by many tributaries of rivers and mangrove swamps owing to swampy lands and high rainfall about per year area is prone to malaria and flooding after floods coastal plains become virtually impassable quagmires of glutinous mud and ground is not suited for development bay is bounded to its north and south by stirling ranges which at points rise to and are covered in kunai grass and dense scrubland main area of firm ground suitable for construction and development is found directly at head of bay in 1942 this area was occupied by plantations of palm oil coconuts and cocoa as well as a number of jetties and villages connected by what was described by major sydney elliott smith of australian new guinea administrative unit angau as a modest road system that was in actuality only a dirt track wide area was sparsely populated although there were a number of villages along track ahioma was situated farthest east and together with gili gili in west it bounded waga waga goroni kb mission rabi and kilarbo military situation japanese thrust into pacific region had begun in early december 1941 with attacks against british and commonwealth forces in battle of hong kong and malayan campaign and against us pacific fleet much of which was caught at anchor in pearl harbor they rapidly advanced south overwhelming resistance in malaya capturing singapore in february 1942 and successfully occupying timor rabaul and dutch east indies while a japanese naval operation aimed at capturing port moresby was defeated in battle of coral sea in may elsewhere american forces in philippines capitulated and japanese forces advanced towards india through burma although japanese had been defeated in coral sea another attempt at capturing port moresby was anticipated allied supreme commander of south west pacific area general douglas macarthur decided to establish airbases to protect port moresby to west he authorised construction of an airbase at merauke in netherlands new guinea another codenamed boston was authorised to east in largely unexplored abau mullins harbour area on 20 may any japanese force approaching port moresby by sea would have to sail past these bases allowing them to be detected and attacked earlier but base in east had other advantages too bombers flying missions to rabaul and other japanese bases to north from there would not have to overfly owen stanley range and would not be subject to vagaries of weather and air turbulence over mountains for that reason an airstrip suitable for heavy bombers was desired so that they could stage there from port moresby and bases in northern australia commander in chief of allied land forces general sir thomas blamey selected a garrison for boston on 24 may troops were informed that their mission was only to defend against japanese raids and in event of a major attack they would destroy everything of value and withdraw boston project fell through as a reconnaissance of area gave an unfavourable report and elliott smith suggested milne bay as a more suitable alternative site a party of twelve americans and australians set out to explore milne bay in a consolidated pby catalina flying boat on 8 june they were impressed by flat areas roads and jetties all of which would ease airbase construction on receipt of a favourable report from party macarthur s general headquarters ghq cancelled boston on 11 june and substituted milne bay milne bay was given codename fall river use of place names as code names proved to be unwise as some supplies were mistakenly sent to real fall river in massachusetts prelude thumb location of milne bay within territory of papua 1942 highlighted area is enlarged below alt map shows australia s northern tip

and corvette on 25 june docked at a pontoon wharf that had been hastily constructed from petrol drums by papuan workers who had been recruited by angau and who subsequently assisted in unloading ships troops included two and a half companies and a machine gun platoon from 55th infantry battalion of 14th infantry brigade 9th light anti aircraft battery with eight bofors 40 mm guns a platoon of us 101st coast artillery battalion anti aircraft with eight 50 calibre machine guns and two 3 7 inch anti aircraft guns of 23rd heavy anti aircraft battery company e of 46th engineers of us army corps of engineers arrived on with airbase construction equipment some 29 kpm ships had escaped to australia after fall of dutch east indies they were manned by dutch and javanese crews and were lifeline of garrison at milne bay making roughly two out of every three voyages there during campaign remainder being by australian british and us ships five kpm ships would be lost during fighting in papua work on first airfield which became known as no 1 airstrip had commenced on 8 june with area near gili gili being cleared by papuan workers under supervision of angau and by us 96th engineer separate battalion personnel company e of 46th engineers began working on it on 30 june in addition to runway they had to build camouflaged dispersal areas for 32 fighters taxiways and accommodation for 500 men to support airbase and garrison a platoon was diverted to working on docks and roads although channels in milne bay allowed deep draught ships to approach within of shore they had to be unloaded onto pontoons and stores manhandled onto vehicles a labour intensive process three kittyhawks from no 76 squadron raaf landed on airstrip on 22 july while additional aircraft from no 76 and also no 75 squadron raaf arrived on 25 july they found that only of runway was covered with marston matting and that water was frequently over it landing aircraft sprayed water about and sometimes skidded off

were removed for no 2 airstrip and site was levelled and graded but its use first required construction of at least two bridges so work moved to no 3 airstrip near kilarbo its construction was undertaken by 2nd battalion of us 43rd engineers less company e which arrived on 4 august that day japanese aircraft began to bomb and strafe milne bay focusing upon attacking airfields and engineers as they worked four zeros and a dive bomber attacked no 1 airstrip one kittyhawk was destroyed on ground while a kittyhawk from no 76 squadron shot down dive bomber following this australians established a workable radar system to provide early warning on 11 august 22 kittyhawks intercepted 12 zeroes despite their numerical advantage australians lost three kittyhawks while claiming four japanese zeros shot down on 11 july troops of 7th infantry brigade under command of brigadier john field began arriving to bolster garrison brigade consisted of three militia battalions from queensland 9th 25th and 61st infantry battalions they brought with them guns of 4th battery of 101st anti tank regiment 2 6th heavy anti aircraft battery and 2 9th light anti aircraft battery along with first australian engineer unit 24th field company field assumed command of milne force a task force which exercised operational control over all allied air land and naval forces in area but only when an attack was imminent he reported directly to blamey s allied land forces in brisbane rather than new guinea force in port moresby his most urgent tasks were of an engineering nature while american engineers built airstrips and wharves australians worked on roads and accommodation small force of sappers had to be augmented by infantry and papuan labourers although malaria was known to be endemic in milne bay area precautions taken against disease were haphazard men wore shorts and kept their sleeves rolled up their mosquito repellent cream was ineffective quinine was in short supply and many men arrived without their mosquito nets which were stowed deep in ships holds and took several days to unload a daily dosage of was prescribed but field s troops were told not to take their quinine until they had been in area a week by this time many had become infected with disease director of medicine at allied land forces headquarters was brigadier neil hamilton fairley an expert on tropical medicine he visited port moresby in june and was alarmed at ineffectiveness of measures being taken to combat disease which he realised was capable of destroying entire allied force in papua he made sure that 110th casualty clearing station left brisbane for milne bay with a fully equipped pathological laboratory and a large quantity of anti malarial supplies including 200 000 quinine tablets however some equipment was lost or ruined in transit and danger from malaria was not yet appreciated at milne bay thumb squadron leader keith bluey truscott commanding officer of no 76

companies were already badly afflicted by malaria and other tropical diseases and were withdrawn and sent back to port moresby in early august but garrison was further reinforced with second australian imperial force troops of brigadier george wootten s 18th infantry brigade of 7th division which began arriving on 12 august although it would not be complete until 21 august this veteran brigade which had fought in siege of tobruk earlier in war consisted of 2 9th 2 10th and 2 12th infantry battalions anti aircraft and artillery support was provided by 9th battery of 2 3rd light anti aircraft regiment us 709th anti aircraft battery and 9th battery of 2 5th field regiment while various signals and logistics troops provided further support with two brigades now at milne bay major general cyril clowes was appointed to command milne force which was placed under control of new guinea force now commanded by lieutenant general sydney rowell on 12 august clowes headquarters was formed in sydney at end of july and was flown up to milne bay he arrived with some of his staff on 13 august but had to wait until rest arrived before he could formally assume command of milne force on 22 august by this time there were 7 459 australian and 1 365 us army personnel at milne bay of whom about 4 500 were infantry there were also about 600 raaf personnel clowes assigned inexperienced 7th infantry brigade a defensive role guarding key points around milne bay from seaborne or airborne attack and kept veteran 18th infantry brigade in reserve ready to counterattack lacking accurate maps and finding that their signals equipment was unreliable in conditions australian command and control system consisted largely of cable telephones or where there was not enough line available runners soft ground made movement by road and even on foot difficult japanese japanese aircraft soon discovered allied presence at milne bay which was appreciated as a clear threat to japanese plans for another seaborne advance on port moresby which was to start with a landing at samarai island in china strait not far from milne bay on 31 july commander of japanese xvii army lieutenant general harukichi hyakutake requested that vice admiral gunichi mikawa s 8th fleet capture new allied base at milne bay instead mikawa therefore altered his plans for samarai operation and substituted capture of milne bay which was codenamed operation re and scheduled for middle of august operation re received a high priority after aircraft from 25th air flotilla discovered new milne bay airfields on 4 august but was then postponed due to american landings on guadalcanal on 7 august thumb left one of japanese barges after battle fluted bottom allows barge to retract from beach easily alt four shirtless men in a large barge moored at a river bank barge has a ramp at front of a catamaran like hull under misconception that airfields were defended by only two or three companies of australian infantry 300 600 men initial japanese assault force consisted of only about 1 250 personnel imperial japanese army ija was unwilling to conduct operation as it feared that landing barges sent to area would be attacked by allied aircraft following an argument between ija and imperial japanese navy ijn officers it was agreed that navy would have responsibility for landing as a result assault force was drawn from japanese naval infantry known as kaigun rikusentai special naval landing forces some 612 naval troops from 5th kure special naval landing force snlf led by commander masajiro hayashi were scheduled to land on east coast near a point identified by japanese as rabi along with 197 men from 5th sasebo snlf led by lieutenant it was planned that a further 350 personnel from 10th naval landing force along with 100 men from 2nd air advance party would land via barge on northern coast of peninsula at taupota in goodenough bay from where it would strike out over stirling ranges to attack australians from behind following battle chief of staff of japanese combined fleet vice admiral matome ugaki assessed that landing force was not of a high calibre as it contained many 30 to 35 year old soldiers who were not fully fit and had inferior fighting spirit naval support was to be provided by 18th cruiser division under command of rear admiral mitsuharu matsuyama japanese enjoyed some initial advantage in form of possessing two type 95 light tanks after an initial attack however these tanks became marooned in mud and abandoned they also had control of sea during night allowing reinforcement and evacuation allied intelligence advantage countering these japanese tactical advantages allies enjoyed strategic advantage of possessing superior intelligence about japanese plans japanese knew very little about allied forces at milne bay while allies received advance warning that japanese were planning an invasion in mid july codebreakers under command of commander eric nave informed macarthur that toward end of august japanese planned to attack milne bay they provided detailed information about numbers of soldiers to expect which units would be involved their standard of training and names of ships that japanese had allocated to operation macarthur s assistant chief of staff for intelligence brigadier general charles a willoughby had anticipated a japanese reaction against milne force and interpreted japanese reconnaissance on 4 august as foreshadowing an operation after allied naval forces ultra decrypted a message that disclosed that a japanese submarine picquet line had been established to cover approaches to milne bay willoughby predicted that an attack was imminent in response macarthur rushed 18th infantry brigade to milne bay major general george kenney commander of allied air forces ordered air patrols stepped up over likely japanese invasion routes he also ordered pre emptive air strikes against japanese airfields at buna on 24 and 25 august which reduced number of japanese fighters available to support attack on milne bay to just six battle initial landing 300px right thumb battle of milne bay 25 august 7 september 1942 over course of 23 and 24 august aircraft from 25th air flotilla carried out preparatory bombing around airfield at rabi main japanese invasion force left rabaul on 24 august under matsuyama s command at 7 00 am fleet was made up of two light cruisers and as well as three destroyers and in concert with transports maru and maru and submarine chasers ch 22 and ch 24 at 8 30 am on 24 august milne bay ghq was alerted by an raaf hudson bomber near kitava island off trobriand islands and coastwatchers that a japanese convoy was approaching milne bay area escorting transport ss tasman left milne bay area and sailed for port moresby after learning of invasion force reports of second japanese convoy consisting of seven barges which had sailed from buna carrying force that would land at taupota were also received at this time in response to this sighting after initially poor weather had cleared 12 raaf kittyhawks were scrambled at midday barges were spotted beached near goodenough island where 350 troops of 5th sasebo snlf led by commander had gone ashore to rest australian pilots then proceeded to strafe barges and over course of two hours destroyed them all and stranded their former occupants after initial sighting main invasion force consisting of heavy naval screening force and two transports remained elusive until morning of 25 august in an effort to intercept it us b 17s operating from bases at mareeba and charters towers in queensland were dispatched although they were unable to complete their mission as bad weather closed in later in afternoon a number of kittyhawks and a single hudson bomber strafed convoy and attempted to bomb transports with bombs near rabi island only limited damage was caused to convoy and no ships were sunk after this due to withdrawal of only allied naval presence in area arunta and tasman an raaf tender was sent to act as a picket in bay ready to provide early warning of approaching japanese meanwhile earlier in day clowes decided to shorten his lines and passed order for d company 61st infantry battalion which had been sent to in east to withdraw back behind b company at kb mission and reposition itself at no 3 airstrip at gili gili a shortage of water craft however delayed d company s departure until evening of 25 26 august after requisitioning three luggers bronzewing elevala and at around 10 30 pm japanese main force consisting of over 1 000 men and two type 95 ha go tanks had made landfall near waga waga on northern shore of bay due to an error in navigation they came ashore about east of where they had intended placing them further away from their objective nevertheless they quickly sent out patrols to secure area rounding up local villagers and established a beachhead later that evening two of small water craft that d company were using to withdraw to gili gili encountered japanese landing force in firefight that followed one of craft elevala was forced to beach and its occupants forced to return to take to jungle on foot eventually reaching gili gili some time later other bronzewing was holed and of its passengers 11 were killed either in engagement or by japanese following their capture japanese advance inland by dawn of 26 august advancing west along coast with armoured support japanese had reached main position manned by troops from b company 61st infantry battalion around kb mission japanese force moved through jungle at edge of coastal track and was headed by two light tanks although they lacked anti armour weapons australians were able to turn back japanese attack at this stage japanese suffered a serious setback when their base area was heavily attacked at daylight by raaf kittyhawks and a hudson aircraft along with b 25s b 26s and b 17s from us fifth air force as a result of attack a number of japanese troops were killed while a large quantity of supplies was destroyed as were a number of landing barges which were beached near kb mission aside from severely hampering japanese supply system destruction of landing barges also prevented their use to outflank australian battalions japanese did not have any air cover as fighters based at buna which were to patrol over milne bay were shot down by allied fighters shortly after they took off and other aircraft based at rabaul were forced to turn back due to bad weather nevertheless japanese were still pressing on 61st infantry battalion s positions throughout day field who had command responsibility for local area decided to send two platoons from 25th infantry battalion to provide support later remaining two rifle companies from 61st were also dispatched along with their mortar platoon muddy track meant that australians were unable to move anti tank guns into position however as a stop gap measure quantities of sticky bombs and anti tank mines were moved up to forward units at 4 45 pm with air and artillery support australians launched a minor attack upon japanese forward positions which were located about to east of mission pushing japanese back a further weary from day s fighting though they withdrew to west of mission left thumb a japanese type 95 ha go tank near rabi bogged in mud and abandoned alt a small tank on a road which is at a 45 degree angle due to one side being in ditch beside road australians then attempted to break contact and withdraw towards a creek line where they hoped to establish a defensive line as darkness came japanese stayed in close contact with australians harassing their rear elements men from b company then sought to establish their position while 2 10th infantry battalion made preparations to move eastwards towards ahioma passing through lines of 25th and 61st infantry battalions in early evening japanese ships shelled australian positions and later at 10 00 pm japanese launched a heavy attack on australians which continued sporadically through night by 4 00 am following morning japanese began to employ infiltration and deception techniques to try to outflank australian positions anticipating an armoured attack at dawn australians withdrew back to gama river which was situated to west during night destroyer hamakaze entered bay to make contact with japanese troops and land supplies landing force had been out of radio contact since 2 00 pm and destroyer was unable to raise it with either her radio or visual signalling devices as a result hamakaze departed milne bay at 2 30 am without having landed any supplies shortly after dawn in air a japanese force consisting of eight dive bombers with 12 zero fighter escorts attacked allied airfield at gili gili one of attacking aircraft was shot down while only a small amount of damage was inflicted meanwhile around mission as japanese reconnoitred australian positions 2 10th infantry battalion consisting of just 420 men was ordered to gama river by clowes this operation was badly planned and did not have a clear purpose it was launched as both a reconnaissance in force and a counter attack but evolved into an attempt to establish a blocking force at kb mission moreover while australians had no knowledge of strength or intentions of japanese no force would be able to reinforce battalion once it moved outside main defensive lines near airstrips 2 10th s forward patrols made contact with 61st infantry battalion at around 10 30 am on 27 august and upon arrival at around 5 00 pm they began to establish their position with only limited entrenching tools they found going difficult at this point troops from 25th and 61st battalion were ordered to pull back having lost 18 men killed and a further 18 wounded along with an unknown number missing in action at 8 00 pm japanese sent two type 95 tanks with bright headlights into plantation men from 2 10th tried to disable them with sticky bombs but due to humid conditions bombs failed to adhere to japanese armour in fighting that followed over course of two and a half hours australians suffered heavy casualties receiving indirect fire support from 2 5th field regiment s 25 pounder guns situated near gili gili they repelled four frontal attacks however by midnight japanese were inside australian position and in confusion 2 10th withdrew in some disorder to a number of scattered positions on west bank of gama which they reached by about 2 00 am on 28 august a further assault however by tank mounted infantry forced them back further moving back through 61st and 25th infantry battalions towards no 3 airstrip which was still under construction south of kilarbo during brief engagement around kb mission they had lost 43 men killed and another 26 wounded as 2 10th withdrew 25th infantry battalion which had moved forward from gili gili to relieve 61st deployed around airstrip and at rabi creek and kilarbo laying mines in key locations airstrip proved a perfect defensive location offering a wide clear field of fire while at its end thick mud served to prevent movement of japanese tanks around dawn advancing japanese troops reached airstrip and under cover of field artillery and mortars they launched an attack although australians did not know it tanks that were supporting attack became stuck in mud and were subsequently abandoned they would later be discovered by an australian patrol on 29 august meanwhile troops from 25th and 61st infantry battalions along with americans from 709th anti aircraft battery turned back attacking japanese infantry further strafing by kittyhawks followed and japanese were forced to fall back to east of rabi following this for next two days there was a lull in fighting during this time australians consolidated their defences 61st infantry battalion despite being seriously depleted from previous fighting were ordered back to perimeter around airstrip subsequently deploying around stephen s ridge tying in with 25th battalion s positions between coast and creek fire support was provided by mortars from 25th along with vickers machine guns from 61st and 30 and 50 calibre machine guns mounted on american half tracks american engineers and anti aircraft gunners became first american troops to engage in ground combat in new guinea thumb no 3 airstrip with stephen s ridge in foreground alt aerial view of an airstrip elsewhere 2 12th infantry battalion began moving forward from to enable it to join fighting later as a counterattacking force they along with 2 9th were subsequently tasked to carry out an attack from no 3 airstrip to kb mission meanwhile japanese also sought to reconfigure their forces and mikawa decided to reinforce forces that were already ashore these reinforcements consisting of 567 men from 3rd kure snlf and 200 from 5th yokosuka snlf left rabaul on 28 august at around 4 30 pm an raaf patrol spotted japanese convoy consisting of one cruiser and nine destroyers and subsequently reported this to allied headquarters believing that further landings were about to occur clowes cancelled his plans to begin a counterattack with troops from 18th brigade orders were also passed for 30 kittyhawks at gili gili to be flown off to port moresby in case japanese succeeded in breaking through to airfield attack did not take place though and consequently early in morning on 29 august they returned albeit minus two aircraft which had crashed during move japanese convoy arrived off waga waga at 8 15 pm on 29 august and began landing troops and supplies while this was taking place warships shelled allied positions around gili gili and by 11 30 pm had completed their landing shelling was not significant however and no casualties resulted from it throughout 30 august australians carried out patrolling operations while japanese laid up in jungle in preparation for an attack that night later that night japanese began forming up along track at eastern end of no 3 airstrip by sea and at 3 00 am on 31 august they launched their attack advancing over open ground and illuminated by flares fired by australians first japanese attack was repelled by heavy machine gun and mortar fire from 25th and 61st infantry battalions as well as 46th engineer general service regiment and artillery fire from australian 2 5th field regiment a further two banzai charges were attempted only to meet same fate with heavy japanese casualties including japanese commander hayashi at this point commander minoru yano who had arrived with japanese reinforcements on 29 august took over from hayashi and after survivors of attack had reformed in dead ground around creek he led them about north of airstrip in an attempt to outflank 61st infantry battalion s positions on stephen s ridge after running into a platoon of australians who engaged them with bren light machine guns japanese withdrew just before dawn to sounds of a bugle call japanese troops who survived this attack were shocked by heavy firepower allied forces had been able to deploy and assault force was left in a state of disarray australian counterattack thumb john french posthumously awarded victoria cross for his actions at milne bay alt head and shoulders of a man with short dark hair his tunic is buttoned at

along track which had been turned into a quagmire due to heavy rain and equally heavy traffic after passing through 61st infantry battalion s position at around 9 00 am they began their counterattack along north coast of milne bay as australians went they were harassed by snipers and ambush parties they also encountered several japanese soldiers who tried to lure australians in close for attack by pretending to be dead in response some australians systematically bayoneted and shot bodies of japanese soldiers at noon 9th infantry battalion a militia unit from 7th infantry brigade dispatched two companies to occupy some of ground that 2 12th had regained around no 3 airstrip and mission making slow going amidst considerable resistance australians nevertheless reached kb mission late in day a force of japanese remained there and australians attacked with bayonets fixed in fighting that followed 60 japanese were killed or wounded australians were then able to firmly establish themselves at mission meanwhile two companies from 9th battalion took up positions at kilarbo and between gama river and homo creek with orders to establish blocking positions to allow 2 12th to continue its advance following morning that night a force of around 300 japanese who had been falling back since they had run into 61st infantry battalion on stephen s ridge encountered positions manned by 2 12th and 9th infantry battalions around gama river in a surprise attack australians inflicted heavy casualties on japanese after battle australians estimated that up to 90 had been killed following this japanese began to employ infiltration techniques in an attempt to pass through numerous listening posts that had been set up along side of track which formed front of one side of 2 12th s position elsewhere at mission starting at around 8 00 pm they carried out harassment operations in an effort to distract australians and assist their comrades to try to break through australian positions from gama river this lasted throughout night following morning 1 september 2 12th infantry battalion went on offensive again while a force of seven kittyhawks attacked japanese headquarters around waga waga by this time japanese had abandoned objective of reaching airfields and instead sought only to hold off australians long enough to be evacuated this information was not known by allies however who were in fact expecting japanese to undertake further offensive action in this regard 2 9th initially with orders to join 2 12th s counterattack was delayed an extra day after an erroneous intelligence report from macarthur s headquarters warning clowes of a renewed japanese attack forced him to briefly adopt a more defensive posture attack did not occur and as a result on 2 september 2 9th was moved by barge up to kb mission next day it took over from 2 12th and led australian advance with japanese position at milne bay close to collapse on 2 september yano sent a radio message to headquarters of 8th fleet which stated w e have reached worst possible situation we will together calmly defend our position to death we pray for absolute victory for empire and for long lasting fortune in battle for you all terrain in this part of bay offered significant advantage to defending forces lined as it was with numerous creeks which slowed movement and obscured firing lanes throughout 3 september 2 9th infantry battalion came up against significant resistance in one engagement that took place around mid morning along a stream to west of creek they lost 34 men killed or wounded as they attempted to force their way across a creek engaged with sustained machine gun fire two assault platoons withdrew back across creek while elements of another company that was in support moved to northern flank launching their assault they found that japanese had withdrawn leaving about 20 of their dead following this 2 9th advanced a further reaching sanderson s bay before deciding to set up their night location that night japanese ships again shelled australian positions on north shore of bay but without causing any casualties among defenders on 4 september australian advance continued as 2 9th moved up coast either side of coastal track after about one hour advance company struck a japanese defensive position at goroni throughout day australians worked to outflank position before launching an attack at 3 15 pm during this action one of 2 9th s sections was held up by fire from three japanese machine gun positions corporal john french ordered other members of section to take cover before he attacked and destroyed two of machine guns with grenades french then attacked third position with his thompson submachine gun japanese firing ceased and australian section advanced to find that machine gunners had been killed and that french had died in front of third position he was posthumously awarded victoria cross for his cool courage and disregard of his own personal safety which saved members of his section from heavy casualties and was responsible for successful conclusion of attack by end of 4th japanese force included only 50 fully fit soldiers all other surviving troops were either incapacitated or could only offer token resistance in addition commanders of all japanese companies had been killed and only three or four platoon leaders remained japanese withdrawal following fighting on 31 august japanese forces ashore had reported situation to their headquarters at rabaul in response plans were made to send aoba detachment which comprised army s 4th infantry regiment and an artillery company to rabi to complete capture of airfield however they were not scheduled to arrive until 11 september and so it was planned in meantime to reinforce yano s men with 130 men from 5th yokosuka snlf an abortive attempt was made to land these troops on 2 september and then again on 4 september by that time however as further reports were received by japanese headquarters it became apparent that yano s troops would not be able to hold out until aoba detachment could arrive as a result on 5 september japanese high command ordered a withdrawal this was carried out from sea that evening meanwhile six beauforts of no 100 squadron raaf had arrived at milne bay on 5 september an additional three beaufighters of no 30 squadron raaf first to operate this aircraft joined them following day beauforts were tasked with providing additional support against further landings and undertaking anti shipping missions on 6 september allied offensive reached main camp of japanese landing force fighting a number of minor actions against small groups that had been left behind after evacuation thumb anshun lying on her side in milne bay new guinea 1942 shortly after ten on evening of 6 september as freighter was continuing unloading cargo under her lights port came under fire from japanese cruiser tenryu and destroyer arashi with anshun receiving about ten hits from cruiser and rolling onto her side japanese ships also shelled shore positions at gili gili and waga waga and illuminated but did not fire on hospital ship manunda which was displaying her hospital ship colours and lights next night two japanese warships a cruiser and a destroyer bombarded australian positions causing a number of casualties for 15 minutes before leaving bay it would be their final act in battle during mopping up operations that followed patrols by australian troops tracked down and killed a number of japanese troops who were attempting to trek overland to buna 350 japanese troops who had been stranded on goodenough island after their barges were destroyed on 24 august were not rescued until late october an attempt to evacuate force on

searchlights were provided to protect base from naval threats new roads were built and existing ones upgraded to make them passable in wet conditions a meteorological record was set on 29 april 1944 when of rain fell in a 24 hour period by june 1944 there was over of road in area a bitumen surfaced second runway was built at no 1 airstrip by no 6 mobile works squadron raaf after which original runway was only used for emergencies and taxiing minefield around no 3 airstrip was lifted and airstrip was completed with revetments and hardstands for 70 medium bombers a new wharf known as liles wharf after american engineer who supervised its construction was built in september and october 1942 this was capable of handling liberty ships henceforth ships could sail direct to milne bay from united states reducing pressure on australian ports and saving two or three days sailing time plus time taken to unload and then reload cargo on smaller ships pt boats were based at milne bay from december 1942 and a transhipment and staging area overhaul facilities for pt boats a destroyer base and station hospital were also constructed milne bay was used as a staging area for mounting landing at lae in september 1943 and new britain campaign in december base at milne bay remained operational until end of war war crimes during australian counterattack advancing troops found evidence that japanese had committed a number of war crimes at milne bay specifically execution of prisoners of war pows and civilians none of 36 australian troops who were captured by japanese survived a number of them were found to have been executed with some showing signs of having been mutilated as well in addition at least 59 civilians were also murdered between 25 august and 6 september included in this were a number of papuan women who were sexually assaulted before being killed war crimes committed at milne bay hardened australian soldiers attitudes towards japanese troops for remainder of war historian mark johnston has written that australians relentless killing of japanese then and thereafter owed much to a determination both to retaliate in kind and to take revenge for japanese atrocities and rumoured maltreatment of pows later australian minister for external affairs dr h v evatt commissioned a report by william webb on war crimes committed by japanese webb took depositions about milne bay incident from members of allied forces who had been present and used them to form part of his report in 1944 this was submitted to united nations war crimes commission which had been set up by allies following moscow declaration evidence about crimes was presented to tokyo war crimes tribunal on 2 january 1947 but no japanese personnel were prosecuted for actions during fighting at milne bay results australians estimated japanese casualties to be around 700 to 750 killed in action and a japanese source reported 625 killed in action of 1 943 japanese soldiers that were landed at milne bay ships from japanese 18th cruiser division managed to evacuate 1 318 personnel including 311 who were wounded australians suffered 373 casualties of which 167 were killed or missing in action us forces lost 14 personnel killed and several wounded although allied casualties during battle had been light in wake of battle milne bay suffered an epidemic of malaria that posed a threat to base as great as that from japanese attack over one sixth of milne force including clowes came down with disease incidence of malaria soared to 33 per thousand per week in september equivalent to 1 716 per thousand per annum and to 82 per thousand per week in december equivalent to 4 294 per thousand per annum at this rate whole force could have been incapacitated in a matter of months it placed enormous strain on medical units and supplies of anti malarial drugs chief pathologist of new guinea force lieutenant colonel edward ford went to see blamey who was now in personal command of new guinea force and told him that 1 000 men and a large quantity of anti malarial supplies were urgently required at milne bay to avert a disaster blamey took a personal interest in matter he expedited supply shipments and made required personnel available arrival of quantities of new drug atabrine allowed this more effective drug to be substituted for quinine incidence of malaria dropped dramatically after december month in which atabrine became official australian prophylactic drug and by march 1943 crisis had passed after this incidence of malaria amongst garrison at milne bay was similar to other bases in papua and new guinea strategically as a result of fighting around milne bay japanese operations within region were constrained defeat at milne bay kept them from bypassing holding action that australians were conducting on kokoda track milne bay showed limits of japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in face of increasingly larger allied troop concentrations and command of air japanese commanders were then forced to change their plans in region shifting their focus towards repelling us forces that had landed on guadalcanal while maintaining a smaller effort around buna gona under major general tomitaro horii once they had retaken guadalcanal they planned to reinforce horii s forces and launch a reinvigorated attack on australians around port moresby in end subsequent defeats at buna gona and on guadalcanal did not allow them to implement these plans as allies gained ascendency in region throughout late 1942 and japanese were forced to fall back to northern coast of new guinea in aftermath of battle a large amount of intelligence was also gained by allies providing their planners with a better understanding of strengths and weaknesses of japanese and their equipment it also demonstrated that militia were an effective fighting force most significant result though was effect that victory had on morale of allied servicemen elsewhere in asia and pacific especially those on kokoda track and british troops fighting in burma although japanese had previously suffered minor local defeats such as those around changsha in china as well first landing at wake island and battle of tenaru on guadalcanal these actions unlike milne bay had not resulted in complete japanese withdrawal and abandonment of military campaign allied victory at milne bay therefore represented first full scale defeat of japanese on land in australia initial public reaction to victory at time was one of cautious optimism an article in canberra times from early september 1942 labelled victory a tonic surprise and while highlighting example as a portent of future battlefield success by australian forces in region also pointed out task that lay ahead of australians in new guinea remained a major problem most significantly though it highlighted importance of morale in turning tide in war describing it as bridge that must carry all vast and complicated effort being directed towards victory another article which appeared in west australian at same time while also preparing australian public for tough fighting that would follow in new guinea hailed victory at milne bay as a turning point instance of which signalled an end of a rearguard campaign and start of an allied offensive in region amongst individual australian soldiers news of victory helped to dispel some of notions about invincibility of japanese soldier that had developed in psyche of allied soldiers following defeats of early 1942 and which had impacted on allied planning up to that point some of these notions would remain until end of war but news of milne bay allowed some soldiers to rationalise japanese soldiers past victories as being result of tangible factors such as numerical superiority that could be overcome rather than innate factors associated with intangible qualities of japanese soldier that were not so easily overcome after this amongst allies there was a sense that fortune s wheel was turning and although leaders such as blamey emphasised difficulties that lay ahead a feeling of confidence in eventual victory emerged macarthur warned war department that success was attributable to good intelligence that allowed him to concentrate a superior force at milne bay and might not be repeatable after war australian army commemorated battle through awarding of a battle honour titled milne bay to a number of units that took part units chosen were 9th 25th 61st 2 9th 2 10th and 2 12th infantry battalions two raaf fighter squadrons that had taken part in fighting were also singled out for praise by australian commanders for their role in battle rowell stated action of 75 and 76 squadrons raaf on first day was probably decisive factor a view clowes endorsed in his own report see also battle of milne bay order of battle notes references further reading external links milne bay memorial library and research
