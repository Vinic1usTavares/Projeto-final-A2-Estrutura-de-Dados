chaplin married for second time mirroring circumstances of his first union lita grey was a teenage actress originally set to star in film whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced chaplin into

tramp into accidental star of a circus filming was suspended for 10 months while he dealt with divorce scandal and it was generally a trouble ridden production finally completed in october 1927 circus was released in january 1928 to a positive reception at 1st academy awards chaplin was given a special trophy for versatility and genius in acting writing directing and producing circus despite its success he permanently associated film with stress of its production chaplin omitted circus from his autobiography and struggled to work on it when he recorded score in his later years city lights by time circus was released hollywood had witnessed introduction of sound films chaplin was cynical about this new medium and technical shortcomings it presented believing that talkies lacked artistry of silent films he was also hesitant to change formula that had brought him such success and feared that giving tramp a voice would limit his international appeal he therefore rejected new hollywood craze and began work on a new silent film chaplin was nonetheless anxious about this decision and remained so throughout film s production left thumb upright city lights 1931 regarded as one of chaplin s finest works when filming began at end of 1928 chaplin had been working on story for almost a year city lights followed tramp s love for a blind flower girl played by virginia and his efforts to raise money for her sight saving operation it was a challenging production that lasted 21 months with chaplin later confessing that he had worked himself into a neurotic state of wanting perfection one advantage chaplin found in sound technology was opportunity to record a musical score for film which he composed himself chaplin finished editing city lights in december 1930 by which time silent films were an anachronism a preview before an unsuspecting public audience was not a success but a showing for press produced positive reviews one journalist wrote nobody in world but charlie chaplin could have done it he is only person that has that peculiar something called audience appeal in sufficient quality to defy popular penchant for movies that talk given its general release in january 1931 city lights proved to be a popular and financial success eventually grossing over 3 million british film institute cites it as chaplin s finest accomplishment and critic james agee hails closing scene as greatest piece of acting and highest moment in movies city lights became chaplin s personal favourite of his films and remained so throughout his life travels paulette goddard and modern times city lights had been a success but chaplin was unsure if he could make another picture without dialogue he remained convinced that sound would not work in his films but was also obsessed by a depressing fear of being old fashioned in this state of uncertainty early in 1931 comedian decided to take a holiday and ended up travelling for 16 months he spent months travelling western europe including extended stays in france and switzerland and spontaneously decided to visit japan day after he arrived in japan prime minister tsuyoshi was assassinated by ultra nationalists in may 15 incident group s original plan had been to provoke a war with united states by assassinating chaplin at a welcome reception organised by prime minister but plan had been foiled due to delayed public announcement of event s date thumb upright modern times 1936 described by jerome larcher as a grim contemplation on automatization of individual in his autobiography chaplin recalled that on his return to los angeles i was confused and without plan restless and conscious of an extreme loneliness he briefly considered retiring and moving to china chaplin s loneliness was relieved when he met 21 year old actress paulette goddard in july 1932 and pair began a relationship he was not ready to commit to a film however and focused on writing a serial about his travels published in woman s home companion trip had been a stimulating experience for chaplin including meetings with several prominent thinkers and he became increasingly interested in world affairs state of labour in america troubled him and he feared that capitalism and machinery in workplace would increase unemployment levels it was these concerns that stimulated chaplin to develop his new film modern times was announced by chaplin as a satire on certain phases of our industrial life featuring tramp and goddard as they endure great depression it took ten and a half months to film chaplin intended to use spoken dialogue but changed his mind during rehearsals like its predecessor modern times employed sound effects but almost no speaking chaplin s performance of a gibberish song did however give tramp a voice for only time on film after recording music chaplin released modern times in february 1936 it was his first feature in 15 years to adopt political references and social realism a factor that attracted considerable press coverage despite chaplin s attempts to downplay issue film earned less at box office than his previous features and received mixed reviews as some viewers disliked politicising today modern times is seen by british film institute as one of chaplin s great features while david robinson says it shows filmmaker at his unrivalled peak as a creator of visual comedy following release of modern times chaplin left with goddard for a trip to far east couple had refused to comment on nature of their relationship and it was not known whether they were married or not some time later chaplin revealed that they married in canton during this trip by 1938 couple had drifted apart as both focused heavily on their work although goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film great dictator she eventually divorced chaplin in mexico in 1942 citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year 1939 1952 controversies and fading popularity great dictator thumb left upright chaplin satirising adolf hitler in great dictator 1940 1940s saw chaplin face a series of controversies both in his work and in his personal life which changed his fortunes and severely affected his popularity in united states first of these was his growing boldness in expressing his political beliefs deeply disturbed by surge of militaristic nationalism in 1930s world politics chaplin found that he could not keep these issues out of his work parallels between himself and adolf hitler had been widely noted pair were born four days apart both had risen from poverty to world prominence and hitler wore same toothbrush moustache as chaplin it was this physical resemblance that supplied plot for chaplin s next film great dictator which directly satirised hitler and attacked fascism chaplin spent two years developing script and began filming in september 1939 six days after britain declared war on germany he had submitted to using spoken dialogue partly out of acceptance that he had no other choice but also because he recognised it as a better method for delivering a political message making a comedy about hitler was seen as highly controversial but chaplin s financial independence allowed him to take risk i was determined to go ahead he later wrote for hitler must be laughed at chaplin replaced tramp while wearing similar attire with a jewish barber a reference to nazi party s belief that he was jewish in a dual performance he also played dictator adenoid hynkel who parodied hitler great dictator spent a year in production and was released in october 1940 film generated a vast amount of publicity with a critic for new york times calling it most eagerly awaited picture of year and it was one of biggest money makers of era ending was unpopular however and generated controversy chaplin concluded film with a five minute speech in which he abandoned his barber character looked directly into camera and pleaded against war and fascism charles j maland has identified this overt preaching as triggering a decline in chaplin s popularity and writes henceforth no movie fan would ever be able to separate dimension of politics from his star image great dictator received five academy award nominations including best picture best original screenplay and best actor legal troubles and oona o neill in mid 1940s chaplin was involved in a series of trials that occupied most of his time and significantly affected his public image troubles stemmed from his affair with an aspirant actress named joan barry with whom he was involved

with chaplin s child as chaplin denied claim barry filed a paternity suit against him director of federal bureau of investigation fbi j edgar hoover who had long been suspicious of chaplin s political leanings used opportunity to generate negative publicity about him as part of a smear campaign to damage chaplin s image fbi named him in four indictments related to barry case most serious of these was an alleged violation of mann act which prohibits transportation of women across state boundaries for sexual purposes historian otto friedrich has called this an absurd prosecution of an ancient

groups he was also friendly with several suspected communists and attended functions given by soviet diplomats in los angeles in political climate of 1940s america such activities meant chaplin was considered as larcher writes dangerously progressive and amoral fbi wanted him out of country and launched an official investigation in early 1947 chaplin denied being a communist instead calling himself a but felt government s effort to suppress ideology was an unacceptable infringement of civil liberties unwilling to be quiet about issue he openly protested against trials of communist party members and activities of house un american activities committee chaplin received a subpoena to appear before huac but was not called to testify as his activities were widely reported in press and cold war fears grew questions were raised over his failure to take american citizenship calls were made for him to be deported in one extreme and widely published example representative john e rankin

music hall star described in this image as a tramp comedian forced to deal with his loss of popularity although chaplin remained politically active in years following failure of monsieur verdoux his next film about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in edwardian london was devoid of political themes limelight was heavily autobiographical alluding not only to chaplin s childhood and lives of his parents but also to his loss of popularity in united states cast included various members of his family including his five oldest children and his half brother wheeler dryden filming

his family on 18 september 1952 next day attorney general james p mcgranery revoked chaplin s re entry permit and stated that he would have to submit to an interview concerning his political views and moral behaviour in order to re enter us although mcgranery told press that he had a pretty good case against chaplin maland has concluded on basis of fbi files that were released in 1980s that us government had no real evidence to prevent chaplin s re entry it is likely that he would have gained entry if he had applied for it however when chaplin received a cablegram informing him of news he privately decided to cut his ties with united states because all of his property remained in america chaplin refrained from saying anything negative about incident to press scandal attracted vast attention but chaplin and his film were warmly received in europe in america hostility towards him continued and although it received some positive reviews limelight was subjected to a wide scale

casting himself as an exiled king who seeks asylum in united states chaplin included several of his recent experiences in screenplay his son michael was cast as a boy whose parents are targeted by fbi

hate government and rules and fetters people must be free chaplin founded a new production company attica and used shepperton studios for shooting filming in england proved a difficult experience as he was used to his own hollywood studio and familiar crew and no longer had limitless production time according to robinson this had an effect on quality of film a king in new york was released in september 1957 and received mixed reviews chaplin banned american journalists from its paris premiere and decided not to release film in united states this severely limited its revenue although it

hesitant about accepting but decided to return to us for first time in 20 years visit attracted a large amount of press coverage and at academy awards gala he was given a 12 minute standing ovation longest in academy s history visibly emotional chaplin accepted his award for incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures art form of this century although chaplin still had plans for

film industry s tributes director rene clair wrote he was a monument of cinema of all countries and all times most beautiful gift cinema made to us actor bob hope declared we were lucky to have lived in his time on 1 march 1978 chaplin s coffin was dug up and stolen from its grave by two unemployed immigrants roman from poland and from bulgaria body was held for ransom in an attempt to extort money from oona chaplin pair were caught in a large police operation in may and chaplin s coffin was found buried in a field in nearby village of it was re interred in corsier cemetery surrounded by reinforced concrete filmmaking influences chaplin believed his first influence to be his mother who entertained him as a child by sitting at window and mimicking passers by it was through watching her that i learned not only how to express emotions with my hands and face but also how to observe and study people chaplin s early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work he also attended christmas pantomimes at drury lane where he studied art of clowning through performers like dan leno chaplin s years with fred karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker simon louvish writes that company was his training ground and it was here that chaplin learned to vary pace of his comedy concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from karno who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in chaplin s gags a round table chaplin interview in 1952 first broadcast on bbc radio on 15 october 1952 in norwegian from film industry chaplin drew upon work of french comedian max linder whose films he greatly admired in developing tramp costume and persona he was likely inspired by american vaudeville scene where tramp characters were common method thumb a 1922 image of charlie chaplin studios where all of chaplin s films between 1918 and 1952 were produced chaplin never spoke more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods claiming such a thing would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime but research from film historians particularly findings of kevin brownlow and david gill that were presented in three part documentary unknown chaplin 1983 has since revealed his unique working method until he began making spoken dialogue films with great dictator chaplin never shot from a completed script many of his early films began with only a vague premise for example charlie enters a health spa or charlie works in a pawn shop he then had sets constructed and worked with his stock company to improvise gags and business using them almost always working ideas out on film as ideas were accepted and discarded a narrative structure would emerge frequently requiring chaplin to reshoot an already completed scene that might have otherwise contradicted story from a woman of paris onward chaplin began filming process with a prepared plot but robinson writes that every film up to modern times went through many metamorphoses and permutations before story took its final form producing films in this manner meant chaplin took longer to complete his pictures than almost any other filmmaker at time if he was out of ideas he often took a break from shoot which could last for days while keeping studio ready for when inspiration returned delaying process further was chaplin s rigorous perfectionism according to his friend ivor montagu nothing but perfection would be right for filmmaker because he personally funded his films chaplin was at liberty to strive for this goal and shoot as many takes as he wished number was often excessive for instance 53 takes for every finished take in kid for immigrant a 20 minute short chaplin shot 40 000 feet of film enough for a feature length describing his working method as sheer perseverance to point of madness chaplin would be completely consumed by production of a picture robinson writes that even in chaplin s later years his work continued to take precedence over everything and everyone else combination of story improvisation and relentless perfectionism which resulted in days of effort and thousands of feet of film being wasted all at enormous expense often proved taxing for chaplin who in frustration would lash out at his actors and crew chaplin exercised complete control over his pictures to extent that he would act out other roles for his cast expecting them to imitate him exactly he personally edited all of his films trawling through large amounts of footage to create exact picture he wanted as a result of his complete independence he was identified by film historian andrew sarris as one of first auteur filmmakers chaplin did receive help notably from his long time cinematographer roland totheroh brother sydney chaplin and various assistant directors such as harry crocker and charles style and themes thumb upright 1 25 a collection of scenes from kid 1921 demonstrating chaplin s mixture of slapstick pathos and social commentary while chaplin s comedic style is broadly defined as slapstick it is considered restrained and intelligent with film historian philip kemp describing his work as a mix of deft balletic physical comedy and thoughtful situation based gags chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential with more focus on developing viewer s relationship to characters unlike conventional slapstick comedies robinson states that comic moments in chaplin s films centre on tramp s attitude to things happening to him humour does not come from tramp bumping into a tree but from his lifting his hat to tree in apology dan kamin writes that chaplin s quirky mannerisms and serious demeanour in midst of slapstick action are other key aspects of his comedy while surreal transformation of objects and employment of in camera trickery are also common features chaplin s silent films typically follow tramp s efforts to survive in a hostile world character lives in poverty and is frequently treated badly but remains kind and upbeat defying his social position he strives to be seen as a gentleman as chaplin said in 1925 whole point of little fellow is that no matter how down on his ass he is no matter how well jackals succeed in tearing him apart he s still a man of dignity tramp defies authority figures and gives as good as he gets leading robinson and louvish to see him as a representative for underprivileged an everyman turned heroic saviour notes that several of chaplin s films end with homeless and lonely tramp walking optimistically into sunset to continue his journey infusion of pathos is a well known aspect of chaplin s work and larcher notes his reputation for inducing laughter and tears sentimentality in his films comes from a variety of sources with louvish pinpointing personal failure society s strictures economic disaster and elements chaplin sometimes drew on tragic events when creating his films as in case of gold rush 1925 which was inspired by fate of donner party constance b kuriyama has identified serious underlying themes in early comedies such as greed gold rush and loss kid chaplin also touched on controversial issues immigration immigrant 1917 illegitimacy kid 1921 and drug use easy street 1917 he often explored these topics ironically making comedy out of suffering social commentary was a feature of chaplin s films from early in his career as he portrayed underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted difficulties of poor later as he developed a keen interest in economics and felt obliged to publicise his views chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films modern times 1936 depicted factory workers in dismal conditions great dictator 1940 parodied adolf hitler and benito mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism monsieur verdoux 1947 criticised war and capitalism and a king in new york 1957 attacked mccarthyism several of chaplin s films incorporate autobiographical elements and psychologist sigmund freud believed that chaplin always plays only himself as he was in his dismal youth kid is thought to reflect chaplin s childhood trauma of being sent into an orphanage main characters in limelight 1952 contain elements from lives of his parents and a king in new york references chaplin s experiences of being shunned by united states many of his sets especially in street scenes bear a strong similarity to kennington where he grew up stephen m weissman has argued that chaplin s problematic relationship with his mentally ill mother was often reflected in his female characters and tramp s desire to save them regarding structure of chaplin s films scholar gerald mast sees them as consisting of sketches tied together by same theme and setting rather than having a tightly unified storyline visually his films are simple and economic with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage his approach to filming was described by art director eugene lourie chaplin did not think in artistic images when he was shooting he believed that action is main thing camera is there to photograph actors in his autobiography chaplin wrote simplicity is best pompous effects slow up action are boring and unpleasant camera should not intrude this approach has prompted criticism since 1940s for being old fashioned while film scholar donald mccaffrey sees it as an indication that chaplin never completely understood film as a medium kamin however comments that chaplin s comedic talent would not be enough to remain funny on screen if he did not have an ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for film medium composing thumb upright chaplin playing cello in 1915 chaplin developed a passion for music as a child and taught himself to play piano violin and cello he considered musical accompaniment of a film to be important and from a woman of paris onwards he took an increasing interest in this area with advent of sound technology chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack composed by himself for city lights 1931 he thereafter composed scores for all of his films and from late 1950s to his death he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films as chaplin was not a trained musician he could not read sheet music and needed help of professional composers such as david raksin raymond rasch and eric james when creating his scores musical directors were employed to oversee recording process such as alfred newman for city lights although some critics have claimed that credit for his film music should be given to composers who worked with him raksin who worked with chaplin on modern times stressed chaplin s creative position and active participation in composing process this process which could take months would start with chaplin describing to composer s exactly what he wanted and singing or playing tunes he had improvised on piano these tunes were then developed further in a close collaboration among composer s and chaplin according to film historian jeffrey vance although he relied upon associates to arrange varied and complex instrumentation musical imperative is his and not a note in a chaplin musical score was placed there without his assent vance jeffrey 4 august 2003

legacy thumb upright left chaplin as tramp in 1915 cinema s most universal icon in 1998 film critic andrew sarris called chaplin arguably single most important artist produced by cinema certainly its most extraordinary performer and probably still its most universal icon he is described by british film institute as a towering figure in world culture and was included in time magazine s list of 100 most important people of 20th century for laughter he brought to millions and because he more or less invented global recognizability and helped turn an industry into an art image of tramp has become a part of cultural history according to simon louvish character is recognisable to people who have never seen a chaplin film and in places where his films are never shown critic leonard maltin has written of unique and indelible nature of tramp and argued that no other comedian matched his worldwide impact praising character richard schickel suggests that chaplin s films with tramp contain most eloquent richly comedic expressions of human spirit in movie history memorabilia connected to character still fetches large sums in auctions in 2006 a bowler hat and a bamboo cane that were part of tramp s costume were bought for 140 000 in a los angeles auction as a filmmaker chaplin is considered a pioneer and one of most influential figures of early twentieth century he is often credited as one of medium s first artists film historian mark cousins has written that chaplin changed not only imagery of cinema but also its sociology and grammar and claims that chaplin was as important to development of comedy as a genre as d w griffith was to drama he was first to popularise feature length comedy and to slow down pace of action adding pathos and subtlety to it although his work is mostly classified as slapstick chaplin s drama a woman of paris 1923 was a major influence on ernst lubitsch s film marriage circle 1924 and thus played a part in development of sophisticated comedy according to david robinson chaplin s innovations were rapidly assimilated to become part of common practice of film craft filmmakers who cited chaplin as an influence include federico fellini who called chaplin a sort of adam from whom we are all descended jacques tati without him i would never have made a film rene clair he inspired practically every filmmaker michael powell billy wilder vittorio de sica and richard attenborough russian filmmaker andrei tarkovsky praised chaplin as only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt films he left behind can never grow old thumb a chaplin impersonator and his audience in san sebastian spain in 1919 chaplin also strongly influenced work of later comedians marcel marceau said he was inspired to become a mime artist after watching chaplin while actor raj kapoor based his screen persona on tramp mark cousins has also detected chaplin s comedic style in french character monsieur hulot and italian character toto in other fields chaplin helped inspire cartoon characters felix cat and mickey mouse and was an influence on dada art movement as one of founding members of united artists chaplin also had a role in development of film industry gerald mast has written that although ua never became a major company like mgm or paramount pictures idea that directors could produce their own films was years ahead of its time in 21st century several of chaplin s films are still regarded as classics and among greatest ever made 2012 sight sound poll which compiles top ten ballots from film critics
