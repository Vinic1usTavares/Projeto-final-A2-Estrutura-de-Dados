columbian half dollar is a coin issued by bureau of mint in 1892 and 1893 first traditional united states commemorative coin it was issued both to raise funds for 1893 world s columbian exposition and to mark of first voyage to americas of christopher columbus whose portrait it bears columbian half dollar was first american coin to depict a historical person coin stems from desire of columbian exposition s organizers to gain federal money to complete construction of fair congress granted an appropriation and allowed it to be in form of commemorative half dollars which legislators and organizers believed could be sold at a premium fair official james ellsworth wanted new coin to be based on a 16th century painting he owned by lorenzo lotto reputedly of columbus and pushed for this through design process when initial sketches by mint chief engraver charles e barber proved unsatisfactory fair organizers turned to a design by artist olin levi warner which after modification by barber and by his assistant george t morgan was struck by mint some 5 000 000 half dollars were struck far beyond actual demand and half of them were melted appropriation did not cure fair s financial woes as fewer than 400 000 were sold at premium price and some 2 000 000 were released into circulation where they remained as late as 1950s pieces can be purchased in circulated condition for less than 20 coins in near pristine state sell for about 1 000 far less than 10 000 makers of remington typewriter paid as a publicity stunt in 1892 for first specimen struck exposition in 1890 congress passed legislation giving federal sponsorship to an exposition to commemorate 400th anniversary of first voyage of christopher columbus to new world act had established a world s columbian exposition commission to oversee fair leading citizens of chicago established a world s columbian exposition company company to organize construction and company generally emerged as successful in resulting infighting as to which group would be in charge had it not been for daniel burnham head of company s board of architects fair might never have been built burnham whose favorite saying was make no little plans they have no magic to stir men s blood became czar of exposition s construction an undeveloped site of on shores of lake michigan was selected for fairgrounds buildings were in classical style reflecting greek and roman influences and were composed of a combination of plaster of paris and hemp called staff which resembled marble president benjamin harrison invited all world to take part many foreign countries erected buildings and every us state and territory was represented inception thumb left upright border reproduction of painting by lorenzo lotto purportedly of columbus which served as basis for obverse of half dollar efforts to promote a commemorative coin for exposition began around january 1892 they were strongly advocated by head of company s committee on liberal arts james ellsworth who was particularly interested as he had recently purchased a 16th century painting by lorenzo lotto of a learned man said to be columbus ellsworth wanted portrait to be basis of coin in this he was advised by author and journalist william curtis also a fair official in april 1892 partisans had gained support of director of bureau of mint edward o leech who envisioned a coin carrying a visage of columbus on one side and a suitable inscription on other curtis was well aware of difficulties with mint s failed competition for new silver coins in 1891 which had led to issuance of barber coinage designed by mint chief engraver charles e barber new coins were widely criticized and curtis counseled ellsworth to gain control of commemorative coin s design process to ensure both a better design and use of lotto portrait no united states coin had depicted an actual person although goddess of liberty had often been portrayed by may 1892 it was apparent that additional funds were needed to complete fair s buildings company had sold stock and city of chicago had issued bonds to pay for exposition but construction budgets had been greatly underestimated company sought a subsidy of 5 million from federal government to complete work when a direct appropriation met congressional opposition supporters proposed that 5 million be in form of special half dollars which could be sold as souvenirs united states had never struck a commemorative and it was anticipated by organizers that coins could be sold to public at double their face value bullion would come from melting of underweight and obsolete silver coins already held by treasury so there would be no expense to government beyond costs of production during debate over bill in senate iowa senator william b allison foresaw they would not only be souvenirs for this day and generation but would be transmitted to 200 millions that were to dwell here in future children would cry for them and old men would demand them but ohio senator john sherman warned enormous number of such half dollars would destroy their value as souvenirs with congress anxious to escape summer washington heat matter was compromised and amount cut to 2 5 million thus five million half dollars congress passed authorizing legislation on august 5 1892 thumb right upright 1 5 barber s original sketches for half dollar august 1892 in july 1892 curtis sent a photograph of lotto painting to leech who consulted with barber and replied that engraver could not work from a painting in which subject faces forward so that barber could depict columbus in profile curtis arranged for a little known washington d c sculptor stonewall jackson dunbar to create a bust based on painting at company s expense when complete it was forwarded to barber in philadelphia barber prepared sketches based on bust on august 15 and presented them to acting mint director robert e preston leech was on vacation who forwarded them to fair authorities in chicago ellsworth showed them to artists working on exposition and to press artistic reaction was negative and newspapers suggested that sketches resembled more a long haired professor than celebrated mariner this controversy coupled with his anger from public debate over whether painting actually was of columbus caused ellsworth to refuse permission for his painting to be used preparation even before appearance of barber s sketches other designs were being considered for half dollar in early august artist frank millet proposed to fair s director of decorations olin warner that warner design coin warner modeled one depicting a profile of columbus not based on lotto portrait his reverse showed a caravel ship symbolizing santa maria columbus s flagship above two globes representing hemispheres though they lacked continental outlines warner s proposal was praised by artists working on their sculptures at fairgrounds leech also weighed in once he returned from vacation on august 26 sending fair organizers a woodcut engraving based on official spanish medal for 400th anniversary of columbus first voyage and arranging with state department for american embassy in madrid to get one a medal was duly obtained and was subsequently placed in mint s collection thumb right mint director edward o leech on his mint medal by charles e barber mint was willing to defer to company on design ellsworth withdrew his threat not to allow his painting to be used by end of august but company s finance committee was unable to reach a decision on what design to use warner returned to work on badges to be worn by fair s directors at dedication ceremony in october fair itself would not open to public until may 1893 these badges included a round disk with a portrait of columbus in high relief based on lotto portrait and when one was displayed it was immediately spoken of as a possible basis for half dollar company also considered a design with three ships and another with a single ship and a depiction of western hemisphere both provided by mint contemporary accounts also mention a reverse design considered by company which depicted a building at exposition tiring of back and forth fair leaders demanded a meeting with mint officials to settle matter of design company was in severe financial straits and money from sale of coins was needed leech agreed to send barber to chicago where he met with finance committee on september 23 1892 it was agreed that obverse would be based on badges and reverse on warner s caravel concept badge lacked inscriptions required for coins to accommodate them barber shrank design surrounding it with letters ship on reverse did not have sufficient detail in warner s version barber requested a photograph of caravel to be exhibited at fair from ellsworth then turned reverse over to his assistant george t morgan chief engraver had discerned ellsworth s desire to have lotto portrait used and several times in october wrote warmly to him him of progress by october 17 barber had completed test dies by 31st trial strikes were made and barber informed ellsworth that leech had pronounced them best looking coins ever struck by mint mint director had fine tuning of designs for barber coinage previous year this time he did not intervene and departed on november 9 for a monetary conference in brussels on november 11 barber sent ellsworth cardboard impressions of latest versions of coin ellsworth expressed pleasure at their appearance chief engraver made final adjustments directly to master die rather than modifying a larger model to be placed in a reducing lathe this was technique which his father and predecessor as chief engraver had used it was also way in which charles barber preferred to work

columbian half dollars were struck at philadelphia mint on november 19 1892 numismatists anthony swiatek and walter breen in their encyclopedia of early commemoratives suggested that flawed first specimen was not destroyed but was given to ellsworth a noted coin collector who possessed rarities such as brasher doubloon and two specimens of 1804 dollar they deemed it unlikely that experienced mint workers would have selected a flawed planchet to use in first strike and that ellsworth obtained piece with bosbyshell s agreement left thumb upright contemporary woodcut of exposition company

purchased them at local banks that were given allocations no official packaging was provided pieces exist in holders supplied by various banks much of press coverage at time focused on fact that half dollars would be sold for twice face value colorado sun commented world s fair people count upon making a good thing by selling their five million souvenir half dollars at premium chicago propensity

criticizing new coin and sent it to both barber and warner barber responded angrily with a five page rebuttal and suggesting that chicago newspapers not print opinions of people who display a deplorable amount of ignorance and likewise seem inclined to say stinking fish warner reacted with resignation stating that he had not yet seen new coin but i ll wager it doesn t look like model a major objection by critics was that barber had lowered relief of warner s badge to ensure that new coins met standards of circulating coins and could stack properly critics saw this as unnecessary as coins were to be merely souvenirs unlikely to enter circulation a number of proof coins were issued at suggestion of barber and superintendent bosbyshell ellsworth was enthusiastic intending special strikes as gifts but was forced to share them with company president higinbotham to ellsworth s dismay proof coins for year 1892 represented first hundred coins struck as well as numbers 400 1492 and 1892 total number of proof coins struck for 1893 is less certain r s yeoman s a guide book of united states coins states that approximately three to five proofs were struck for 1893 numismatist ira goldberg in a 2011 article gives number as fewer than ten first coin struck in year 1893 in proof is in possession of chicago historical society mint gave consideration to including columbian half dollar in proof sets but at time it sold proof coins for only a few cents above face value and it would have to sell proof columbians for more than 1 so as to avoid devaluing uncirculated

security for loans in march congress impounded an additional 1 141 700 half dollars to cover costs advanced by government such as expense of judging exhibits and providing medals to exhibitors company could redeem half dollars if it agreed to fund that expense which it refused to do calling government s action a breach of faith in return company stated it was no longer bound by a provision of 1892

and for poor condition of many surviving specimens was that while fair was open economic panic of 1893 began one of worst depressions in nation s history fifty cents could make difference between a family eating or starving at a time when average visitor to fair spent 1 18 fairgoers were disinclined to exchange a dollar for a fifty cent piece and those who had bought columbian half dollars
