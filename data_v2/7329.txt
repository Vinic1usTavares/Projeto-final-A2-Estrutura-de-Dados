exmoor pony is a horse breed native to british isles where some still roam as semi feral livestock on exmoor a large area of moorland in devon and somerset in southwest england exmoor has been given endangered status by rare breeds survival trust and threatened status by livestock conservancy it is one of british isles mountain and moorland pony breeds having conformation similar to that of other cold weather adapted pony breeds exmoor pony is hardy and used for a variety of equestrian activities in its free roaming state breed s presence on exmoor contributes to conservation and management of several natural pasture habitats equines have been present in britain since 700 000 bc and fossil remains have been found in area of exmoor dating back to about 50 000 bc some claim that breed has been purebred since ice age others claim this is unsupported by modern dna research there is however a close morphological resemblance to primitive wild horse archeological investigations have shown that horses were used for transport in southwest of england as early as 400 bc and roman carvings show ponies phenotypically similar to exmoor pony domesday book records ponies on exmoor in 1086 and descendants of ponies removed from moor in 1818 form foundation bloodstock of today s exmoor breed although a breed society was not formed until 1921 breed nearly became extinct after second world war owing to soldiers using them for target practice and thieves killing them for their meat after war a small group of breeders worked to save exmoor and during 1950s ponies began to be exported to north america first stud book was published in 1963 and in 1981 publicity resulted in increased interest in breed as of 2010 there were an estimated 800 exmoor ponies worldwide exmoor pony society currently states that there are now approximately 500 ponies on exmoor and a further 3 500 in locations across uk and several other countries although numbers are healthy vast majority of ponies are in non breeding situations characteristics thumb left an exmoor mare and foal exmoor ponies are usually a variant of dark bay called brown with pangare mealy markings around eyes muzzle flanks and underbelly pangare markings occur in other equines as well as horses and are considered to be a primitive trait entry in breed registry requires that animal have no white markings they usually stand with recommended height limit for mares being and that for stallions and geldings however exmoors may be taller than this limit with some reaching 13 with a stocky powerful build exmoor pony is strong for its height and noted for its hardiness and endurance chest is deep and back broad croup level legs are short with good bone and hard hooves although many sources state that exmoor has a distinctly different jaw structure from other horse breeds which includes beginnings of development of a seventh molar this is a misunderstanding based on an incorrect translation of a german study study when properly translated refers to a feature found in multiple horse breeds and perhaps all animals with sizable lower jaws that appears to be an extra branch of blood supply in area while an extra tooth may have eventually developed from this extra blood supply its frequency among general horse population makes its appearance in exmoor pony unremarkable head is somewhat large in proportion to body with small ears and has a unique feature called a toad eye caused by extra of eyelids which helps to deflect water and provide extra insulation as with most cold weather pony breeds exmoor grows a winter coat consisting of a highly insulating woolly underlayer and a topcoat of longer oily hairs that prevent undercoat from becoming waterlogged by diverting water down sides of animal to fall from just a few drip areas mane and tail are thick and long and dock of tail is of a type common in cold weather ponies having coarse hairs called a frost cap snow chute or ice tail that deflects rainwater away from groin and underbelly areas to fall from long hairs on back of hind legs history prehistoric origin theories thumb upright 1 ice age map of peninsula from which british isles were formed showing find sites for pleistocene and holocene horse remains exmoor fanciers claim breed is directly descended from an isolated population of wild ancestors bred pure since ice age and thus more than 10 000 years old modern dna research to date has not supported that traditionally held view of origin of exmoor pony however as existing studies indicate they share their maternally inherited mitochondrial dna with various other horse breeds from across world and their paternally inherited y chromosome is identical to that of most other domesticated horses however horses have been present in britain for hundreds of thousands of years two species of wild horse were identified from remains at pakefield east anglia dating back to 700 000 bc and spear damage on a horse shoulder bone discovered at eartham pit boxgrove dated 500 000 bc showed that early humans were hunting horses in area at that time horse remains from about 50 000 bc have been recovered from kent s cavern in nearby torquay remains dating from around 7 000 bc have been found in gough s cave in cheddar gorge less than from exmoor subfossil horse tracks have been found in bristol channel severn estuary area and pre domesticated horse bones have been found in severn cotswold chamber tombs dating to 3500 bc modern dna studies and archaeology no genetic studies to date have correlated these prehistoric remains to any modern breed what has been studied are y chromosomes y dna and mitochondrial dna mtdna obtained from exmoor ponies y chromosome is passed on through male line and worldwide shows very little genetic variation in horses except for a second y chromosome haplotype found in china suggesting that a very limited number of stallions contributed to original genome of domestic horse exmoor pony shares this general y chromosome haplotype in contrast mitochondrial dna is passed on though female line and shows far more variation than y dna indicating that a large number of wild mares from several regions have contributed to modern domestic breeds some mtdna haplotypes have been found in dna samples obtained from wild horses in prehistoric deposits while other mtdna haplotypes have only been found in domesticated horses from both living individuals and archeological finds exmoor pony has a high frequency of pre domestication mtdna haplotypes but these are also found in different breeds all around world currently for british isles there are only three dna archeological samples available all from ireland although wild horses were abundant after last ice age lack of sufficient pre domestication dna samples makes it impossible to determine contribution of wild horses of british islands to modern breeds including exmoor pony a 1995 study of morphological characteristics outward appearance of organisms indicated that exmoor pottock and now extinct tarpan have an extremely close resemblance these breeds were consistently grouped together in results from several analyses with exmoor showing closest relationship to tarpan of all breeds studied at 0 27 next closest breeds to tarpan were pottock and merens both with a genetic distance from tarpan of 0 47 distance between exmoor and pottock was 0 37 and between exmoor and merens was 0 40 a significantly wider gap than distance between exmoor and tarpan first indication of domesticated horses in england comes from archaeological investigations showing that ancient britons were using wheeled horse drawn transport extensively in southwest england as early as 400 bc recent research has indicated that there was significant roman involvement in mining on exmoor metals including iron tin and copper were transported to head in neighbouring dorset for export and roman carvings showing british and roman chariots pulled by ponies phenotypically similar to exmoor have been found in somerset recorded history and modern times thumb 180px left alt a group of exmoor ponies a herd of exmoor ponies domesday book mentions ponies in exmoor in 1086 mentions of ponies are rare between then and 1818 when royal exmoor forest was sold to a private buyer sir thomas acland exmoor royal forest s last warden took 30 ponies from area to winsford hill where he owned land this herd became known as anchor herd and a small number of descendants of this original herd still remain at winsford hill at same time as acland s removal rest of ponies were sold but some stayed with breeders in area and their families still preserve descendants of those animals from 1820s to 1860s exmoors were used to produce crossbreds which although successful were not as hardy as their ancestors in 1893 ponies were described in sidney s book of horse as around high usually bay in color and with conformation similar to what it is today in late 1800s national pony society began to register exmoors and exmoor crossbreds in 1921 exmoor pony society was formed and published its first stud book in 1963 second world war led to a sharp decrease in breed population as moor became a training ground breed nearly became extinct with only 50 ponies surviving war this was partially due to soldiers using some ponies for target practice and others being stolen and eaten by people in cities after war a small group of breeders including mary etherington continued to preserve population and publicity in 1981 resulted in increased interest in breed first exmoors in north america were imported to canada in 1950s and several small herds are still maintained there in 1990s small herds of exmoor ponies were established in various areas of england these herds are used to maintain vegetation on nature reserves many being managed by organisations such as national trust natural england and county wildlife trusts every purebred registered exmoor is branded with a four point star on near left shoulder until 2000s which attracted criticism however it is now limited to semi feral ponies as breeders choice in 2000 moorland trust a british organisation was established to assist in preservation of exmoor pony there is little market for exmoor colts so organisation works to raise funds for gelding and training of these horses alt three small brown horses on grassy area of exmoor in distance are hills thumb 180px exmoor ponies in their native habitat currently livestock conservancy considers population of exmoor to be at threatened levels meaning that estimated global population of breed is less than 5 000 and there are less than 1 000 registrations annually in us uk rare breeds survival trust considers breed to be endangered meaning that population numbers are estimated to be less than 500 in great britain equus survival trust considers breed to be critical meaning that there are between 100 and 300 active adult breeding mares as of 2010 there were estimated to be around 800 exmoor ponies worldwide uses in past exmoors were used as pit ponies ponies not kept in semi feral conditions are used for a variety of activities including showing long distance riding driving and agility exmoor ponies won both divisions at international horse agility championships in 2011 and took a third title at 2012 championships breed s hardiness makes it suitable for conservation grazing and it contributes to management of many heathland chalk grassland and other natural pasture habitats as well as to conservation of exmoor itself a herd of 14 exmoors from exmoor national park were moved to former military base of district czech republic in an effort to improve biodiversity by conservation grazing in january 2015 according to annual count of 2019 this population has increased to 111 ponies gallery references notes bibliography further reading external links exmoor pony society exmoor
