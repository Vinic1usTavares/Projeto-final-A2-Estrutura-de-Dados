shangani patrol or wilson s patrol was a 34 soldier unit of british south africa company that in 1893 was ambushed and annihilated by more than 3 000 matabele warriors in rhodesia now zimbabwe during first matabele war headed by major allan wilson patrol was attacked just north of shangani river in matabeleland rhodesia its dramatic last stand sometimes called wilson s last stand achieved a prominent place in british public imagination and subsequently in rhodesian history similarly to events such as battle of little bighorn in united states battle of shiroyama in japan battle of alamo in texas and greeks last stand at thermopylae patrol comprised elements of mashonaland mounted police and bechuanaland border police scouting ahead of major patrick forbes s column attempting capture of matabele king lobengula following his flight from his capital bulawayo a month before it crossed shangani late on 3 december 1893 it moved on lobengula next morning but was ambushed by a host of matabele riflemen and warriors near king s wagon surrounded and outnumbered about a hundred fold patrol made a last stand as three of its number broke out and rode back to river to muster reinforcements from forbes however shangani had risen significantly in flood and forbes was himself involved in a skirmish near southern bank wilson and his men therefore remained isolated to north after fighting to last cartridge and killing over ten times their own number they were annihilated patrol s members particularly wilson and captain henry borrow were elevated in death to status of national heroes representing endeavour in face of insurmountable odds anniversary of battle on 4 december 1893 became an annual public holiday in rhodesia two years later and was an official non work day until 1920 a historical war film depicting episode shangani patrol was produced and released in 1970 controversy surrounds breakout before last stand which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion and a box of gold sovereigns which a matabele induna leader later claimed had been given to two unidentified men from forbes s rear guard on 2 december along with a message that lobengula admitted defeat and wanted column to stop pursuing him two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting gold keeping it for themselves and not passing on message but evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial convictions were ultimately overturned background thumb upright king lobengula of matabeleland a posthumous depiction based on a contemporary sketch alt a black and white image depicting a middle aged african king though at first glance a tall strong looking man subject s condition appears to have deteriorated with age his belly appears severely bloated he wears an animal skin loincloth and a necklace made from what appear to be teeth of various creatures he holds a long spear in his right hand which rests on ground amid scramble for africa during 1880s south african based businessman and politician cecil rhodes envisioned annexation to british empire of a swathe of territory connecting cape of good hope and cairo respectively at southern and northern tips of africa and concurrent construction of a line of rail linking two on geopolitical maps british territories were generally marked in red or pink so this concept became known as cape to cairo red line in immediate vicinity of cape this ambition was challenged by presence of independent states to north east of britain s cape colony boer republics and to north of these kingdom of matabeleland under lobengula having secured rudd concession on mining rights from king lobengula on 30 october 1888 rhodes and his british south africa company were granted a royal charter by queen victoria in october 1889 company was empowered under this charter to trade with local rulers form banks own and manage land and raise and run a police force british south africa company s police renamed mashonaland mounted police in 1892 in return for these rights company would govern and develop any territory it acquired while respecting laws enacted by extant african rulers and upholding free trade within its borders first settlers referred to their new home as rhodesia after rhodes though company made good on most of its pledges assent of lobengula and other native leaders particularly regarding mining rights was often evaded misrepresented or simply ignored it also offended lobengula by demanding that he stop customary matabele raids on people who inhabited white governed areas angered by company s attitude towards his authority lobengula made war on new arrivals and mashonas in 1893 matabele warriors began wholesale slaughter of mashonas in vicinity of fort victoria in july that year and an indaba tribal conference organised by company official leander starr jameson to end conflict ended with violence and dispersion by force first matabele war had started company columns rode from fort salisbury and fort victoria and combined at iron mine hill around centre point of country on 16 october 1893 together force totalled about 700 men commanded by major patrick forbes and equipped with five maxim machine guns forbes s combined column moved on matabele king s capital at bulawayo to south west matabele army mobilised to prevent forbes from reaching city and twice engaged column as it approached on 25 october 3 500 warriors assaulted column near shangani river lobengula s troops were well drilled and formidable by pre colonial african standards but company s maxim guns which had never before been used in battle far exceeded expectations according to an eyewitness mow ing them down literally like grass by time matabele withdrew they had suffered around 1 500 fatalities company on other hand had lost only four men a week later on 1 november 2 000 matabele riflemen and 4 000 warriors attacked forbes at bembezi about north east of bulawayo but again they were no match for crushing firepower of major s maxims about 2 500 more matabele were killed lobengula fled bulawayo as soon as he heard news from bembezi on 3 november 1893 with column on outskirts of city he and his subjects left torching royal town as they went in resultant conflagration city s large store of ivory gold and other treasure was destroyed as was its ammunition magazine which exploded flames were still rising when whites entered settlement next day basing themselves in white man s camp already present they set about extinguishing fire which engulfed town using a tree to improvise a flagstaff they hoisted first company flag then union flag reconstruction of bulawayo began almost as soon as blaze was out with a new white run city rising atop ruins of lobengula s former residence jameson who now based himself in bulawayo wrote following letter to matabele king on 7 november 1893 in english dutch and zulu this letter carried by john a coloured man from cape reached lobengula near shiloh mission about north of bulawayo king replied in english jameson did not regard this ambiguity as a proper answer and impatiently waited for further word from king after standing by for specified two days and receiving nothing he correctly concluded that lobengula was stalling him and using extra time to distance himself from his former capital jameson therefore made good on his pledge and called for volunteers he assembled a host of about 470 men mixed together from mashonaland mounted police bechuanaland border police and raaff s rangers an independent unit led by eponymous commandant piet raaff this force was placed under forbes s command with three maxim guns attached jameson told major to scout area between shiloh and inyati for spoor with ultimate objective of capturing lobengula and sent him out just before sunset on 14 november 1893 prelude forbes s pursuit of lobengula thumb route of shangani patrol column left bulawayo heading north and in an attempt to expedite its progress reorganised itself into a more compact 290 man force at shiloh lobengula meanwhile rode north towards shangani in his wagon which left obvious tracks in its wake following wagon tracks forbes s men were soon hot on trail routinely finding recently abandoned matabele camps provisions and stragglers heavy rain slowed both king and his pursuers and led forbes to split his force again moving on with a flying column of 160 men he sent rest back with wagons he pushed on and on 3 december 1893 reached southern bank of shangani from where he could clearly see matabele hastily driving cattle behind an regiment of warriors presence of smouldering fires beside native column betrayed fact that they had just crossed wishing to know whether king had crossed here or at another point on river forbes sent major allan wilson across to scout ahead with 12 men and eight officers and told him to return by nightfall meanwhile forbes formed a laager improvised fort about from southern bank there he interrogated a captive matabele son of an induna tribal leader who said that king was indeed where wilson had gone and was ill exact ailment was not known for sure prisoner said but was suspected to be gout son said that lobengula had with him a force of about 3 000 warriors about half of whom were armed with martini henry rifles they were mixed together from various regiments of previously routed matabele army and largely demoralised but still fiercely determined to prevent lobengula s capture most prominent were imbezu ingubo and regiments imbezu lobengula s favourite was generally considered strongest after three weeks in pursuit of king forbes s rations were running perilously short he therefore resolved to attack next day 4 december hoping to be able to turn back for bulawayo with lobengula in custody before nightfall wilson s men remained north of river far longer than expected and had still not returned when darkness fell forbes meanwhile received a report that most of lobengula s force commanded by induna mjaan had separated from king and was moving to attack laager same night this was actually an exaggeration only about 300 riflemen had split from main matabele force though they were indeed south of river undetected by forbes visibility was poor by now and rain periodically fell laager received no word from wilson until about 21 00 when sergeant major judge and corporal arrived from across river to tell forbes that wilson had found lobengula s tracks and followed him for wilson regarded chances of taking king alive as so good that he was going to remain north of river overnight he asked forbes to send more men and a maxim gun in morning but did not explain what he planned to do with them shangani patrol continued its approach during late evening and scouted close to bush enclosure housing lobengula captain william napier repeatedly called to king in matabele language sindebele but received no reply from matabele leaders who remained silent and hid themselves patrol s actions confused matabele who could not understand why there appeared to be so few company soldiers nor why they would reveal their position like this they concluded that it must be a trap and were only satisfied that it was not when wilson s men had stopped during their approach to call to lobengula five times following fifth call from napier mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around patrol intending to pocket it noticing this wilson ordered a retreat and took up a well covered position in bush where he could hide until daybreak when lieutenant and troopers bradburn and colquhoun were lost amid increasingly stormy night wilson briefly backtracked to recover them on returning to his bush camp wilson sent a further message to laager which reached its destination at around 23 00 napier scout bain and trooper robertson were men acting as runners wilson repeated that he was going to stay north of river overnight close to king and asked forbes to bring whole column across by 04 00 in morning forbes thought it unwise to attempt a full river crossing at night which he reasoned might lead to his force being surrounded in darkness and massacred but also felt he could not recall wilson as to do so would be to lose lobengula for sure as a compromise forbes sent captain henry borrow across with 21 men at 01 00 on 4 december and told borrow to relay to wilson that laager was surrounded and expected to be attacked any moment forbes apparently intended for borrow s reinforcements to secure wilson s position but historian w d gale writes that this was a serious tactical error on forbes s part addition of borrow s men made wilson s patrol too large to be a mere reconnoitring force but still too small to overpower matabele and capture king indeed wilson and his officers looked on gloomily when borrow s men arrived soon after dawn fewer in number than expected and without requested maxim gun only 20 of reinforcements including borrow himself reached wilson troopers landsberg and nesbitt became separated from main group along way and eventually rejoined forbes during morning trooper robertson returned to wilson with borrow giving patrol a total of 37 men including its officers engagement matabele ambushes on both sides of river thumb upright 1 6 sketch map of area drawn by frederick russell burnham 1895 alt a map see text for details wilson conferred with his officers none of whom was particularly optimistic about their prospects this is end said one british soldier and historian roger marston postulates that patrol might still have been safe had it not now pursued king but wilson decided to proceed let s ride on lobengula he said several analysts comment that this was perhaps excessively rash marston says that wilson s actions had a flavour of doomed resignation about them and suggests that major believed no other path was open and was therefore going for broke matabele hovered around vicinity waiting to see what wilson would do next on southern side of river 300 matabele riflemen took up a well covered position near riverbank about to left of forbes s position hidden by a patch of scrub they remained undetected by company troops wilson borrow and 35 others made for lobengula s enclosure king s wagon was still there but when wilson called to him there was no answer king had moved on during night at that moment troopers heard sound of rifles being cocked in wood surrounding them a matabele induna stepped out from behind a tree and announced that enclosure was surrounded by thousands of matabele who wanted to see if white men were afraid to die he then fired his rifle to signal start of attack to his men a volley from matabele riflemen followed but most of shots went too high no company trooper was hit only casualties of this opening volley were two of patrol s horses wilson immediately ordered his men to fall back first to an then to a thick wood three of them were wounded during this retreat but none fatally hearing shots from northern side of river forbes uneasily moved towards southern bank intending to cross and help wilson however forbes s fears of an ambush proved to be well founded at an opportune moment matabele in scrub opened fire catching column in open shots were initially wild and inaccurate but they soon began to focus their fire on exposed maxim guns and horses forcing troopers to retreat to cover five company soldiers were injured resulting skirmish lasted about an hour by which time shangani had been severely swollen by heavy rains upstream causing it to flood meanwhile wilson marched his officers and men back towards river hoping to reunite with forbes they moved on for about but soon noticed that a line of matabele warriors was blocking their way to river wilson refused to sacrifice his wounded by attempting to break through in an act of desperation he instead sent three of his men american scouts frederick russell burnham and pearl pete ingram and australian trooper william gooding to charge through matabele line cross river and bring reinforcements back to help while he borrow and rest made a last stand burnham ingram and gooding broke through while matabele closed in on surrounded patrol from a distance and began to fire on it from cover killing several of its men after a while mjaan ordered his men to charge forward and finish them off but matabele soon fell back having taken about 40 fatalities burnham ingram and gooding reached shangani about 08 00 but quickly saw that water had risen far too high for forbes to provide any assistance realising futility of turning back to wilson without help they decided to rejoin forbes anyway and to that end traversed swollen river with considerable difficulty they then rode to where battle on southern side was still going on on reaching main column shaken and out of breath burnham leapt from his horse and ran to forbes i think i may say that we are sole survivors of that party he quietly confided before loading his rifle and joining skirmish matabele victory north of river wilson s last stand what happened to shangani patrol after this point is known only from matabele sources according to these accounts warriors offered remaining whites their lives if they surrendered but wilson s men refused to give up they used their dead horses for cover and killed more than ten times their own number about 500 mjaan estimated but were steadily whittled down as overwhelming matabele force closed in from all sides company soldiers continued fighting even when grievously wounded to astonishment of matabele who thought whites must be bewitched these are not men but magicians said one matabele induna late in afternoon after hours of fighting wilson s men ran out of ammunition and reacted to this by rising to their feet shaking each other s hands and singing a song possibly god save queen matabele downed their own rifles and ended battle charging with assegai spears some of whites allegedly used their last bullets to commit suicide according to an eyewitness white induna wilson was last to die standing motionless before matabele with blood streaming from wounds all over his body after a few moments of hesitation a young warrior ran forward and killed him with his assegai matabele usually mutilated bodies of their foes after a victory but on this occasion they did not white men died so bravely we would not treat them as we do cowardly mashonas and others an induna explained at mjaan s orders bodies of patrol were left untouched though whites clothes and two of their facial skins were collected next morning to serve as proof to lobengula of battle s outcome i had two sons killed that day ingubo warrior m later said and my brother was shot in stomach whites were brave men they were warriors men of shangani patrol of 43 men involved in wilson s patrol including major himself 37 were present when battle began this was reduced to 34 when wilson ordered burnham ingram and gooding to break out those left behind were all killed in action though men of patrol came from several parts of british empire as well as other countries most were born in britain itself lieutenant colonel hugh marshall hole writes that of these over a dozen were english public school and university men wilson himself was originally scottish while borrow was born in cornwall also represented in patrol were south africa several members most prominently captain william judd united states burnham and ingram india troopers dillon and money canada scout robert bain australia gooding and new zealand trooper frank vogel no member of patrol was born in rhodesia aftermath forbes s retreat lobengula s death and end of war after battle on southern side of shangani was over forbes and his column conducted a cursory search for survivors from wilson s party but unable to cross river could see nothing to tell them what had happened guessing correctly that all company men beyond river had been killed they turned and trekked back to bulawayo in miserable fashion their supplies all but gone and matabele impeding their progress at every turn matabele raiding parties attacked retreating column six times during its two week journey back to bulawayo in pouring rain dishevelled men were soon mostly on foot existing off horse meat and wearing makeshift shoes made from ammunition wallets forbes felt so humiliated by events that he retreated from command in all but name surrendering de facto control to commandant raaff in leading column back to bulawayo raaff repeatedly drew on his experience from anglo zulu war to ensure survival of haggard men he avoided several matabele ambushes and at one point set up a convincing decoy camp that matabele fired on for half a day wasting much of their ammunition on column s return to bulawayo on 18 december 1893 forbes was received in muted disgrace officers and men stood on parade for cecil rhodes and company chief passed major without a word raaff on other hand was publicly commended by rhodes and thanked for ensuring column s safe return meanwhile lobengula moved to north east now well out of company s reach for foreseeable future however his sickness which turned out to be smallpox sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 january 1894 with king dead mjaan most senior of izinduna took command of matabele mjaan was an old man and his only son had been killed in war he wished to make peace in late february 1894 he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with james dawson a trader known to them for many years who offered olive branch on behalf of company izinduna unanimously accepted they also told trader what had happened to shangani patrol and led him to battle site to survey it as well as to examine and identify largely bodies of soldiers which still lay where they had fallen dawson was first non matabele to learn of last stand cultural impact burial and memorial thumb upright 1 4 shangani memorial which was erected at world s view in matopos hills in 1904 alt a white oblong flat topped structure with soldiers depicted on each side in bas relief news of patrol s fate was quickly relayed from rhodesia to south africa and then on to rest of british empire and world in england a patriotic play overtly influenced by incident cheer boys cheer was written by augustus harris cecil raleigh and henry hamilton and staged at theatre royal drury lane starting in september 1895 show tells story of a young colonial army officer in south africa and rhodesia culminating in third act with a fictionalised account of first matabele war this itself climaxes with a scene strongly reminiscent of wilson s last stand production ran for nearly six months in london and then toured british provinces for more than two years reportedly drawing large crowds according to historian neil parsons it contributed to patrol fast gain ing mythological status in historical terms shangani patrol subsequently became an integral part of rhodesian identity with wilson and borrow in particular woven into national tapestry as heroic figures symbolising duty in face of insuperable odds their last stand together became a kind of national myth as lewis gann writes a glorious memory rhodesia s own equivalent of bloody alamo massacre and custer s last stand in american west in 1895 4 december was declared shangani day an annual rhodesian public holiday which endured until 1920 when it was folded into occupation day a national non work day which commemorated several early colonial events together shangani day remained part of national calendar however and was still marked each year remains of patrol s members were buried on 14 august 1894 in ruined city of great zimbabwe rhodes later wrote into his will that he wished to have patrol re interred alongside him at world s view in matopos hills when he died this was done in 1904 two years after rhodes s death also according to rhodes s wishes a memorial to shangani patrol was erected at world s view in july 1904 and dedicated by bishop william gaul of mashonaland monument called shangani memorial is an oblong flat topped structure about tall and made from granite from a nearby kopje it was designed by herbert baker and based on pedestal of agrippa at athens acropolis each of memorial s four sides bears a bronze panel by john tweed depicting members of patrol in relief main inscription reads to brave men with a smaller dedication given beneath erected to enduring memory of allan wilson and his men who fell in fight against matabele on shangani river december 4th 1893 there was no survivor controversy lobengula s box of sovereigns soon following end of war one of lobengula s izinduna told dawson that just before forbes s column had reached shangani two matabele messengers petchan and sehuloholu had been given a box of gold sovereigns by lobengula and instructed to intercept column before it reached river they were to tell whites that king admitted defeat and offered this tribute totalling about ps1 000 on condition that column immediately turn back and cease harassing him gold is only thing that will stop white men lobengula reportedly concluded according to induna petchan and sehuloholu reached column on 2 december 1893 day before it reached shangani and hid in bush as it went by they then caught up with it and gave money and message to two men in rear guard thumb left gold sovereigns bearing likeness of queen victoria minted in 1842 alt two 1842 gold sovereigns side by side one displaying its obverse face other showing reverse dawson relayed this story to bulawayo where company authorities made enquiries no man who had been attached to column corroborated account company thought it unlikely that a matabele induna would simply invent a story such as this however and angrily speculated that if it were true then negotiations with lobengula might have been opened and war ended before wilson crossed river and entire episode of shangani patrol avoided though as historian robert cary writes this ignores fact that forbes had been ordered to capture lobengula not end war lawyers appointed by company launched a formal investigation early in 1894 two officers batmen william charles daniel and james wilson no relation to allan wilson soon became prime suspects with daniel arraigned as senior instigator they were accused of accepting gold from petchan and sehuloholu then keeping it for themselves and not passing on message both men denied all charges neither daniel nor wilson had been members of rear guard on 2 december though either or both could have been there at some point during day no matabele witness recognised either of them at court in bulawayo where case was heard by resident magistrate and four assessors evidence against batmen was largely circumstantial both had been seen to possess unusually large amounts of gold soon after column s return and both had since bought farming rights paying cash daniel said he had won money in his possession playing cards while wilson claimed to have brought his with him when he came to rhodesia witnesses confirmed that there had been heavy gambling at inyati camp in which daniel and wilson had actively taken part both possessing noticeable reserves in gold sovereigns sehuloholu claimed in his statement that both of men he had met in rear guard had fluently and perfectly spoken to him in sindebele but neither of accused men knew language and only member of column who did at a fluent level was a medical orderly who had never been near rear guard prosecutor proposed that sehuloholu could be exaggerating standard of sindebele spoken by men he had met pointing out that most of phrases quoted were actually relatively basic and did not imply a profound understanding of language unable to definitely prove to court where their money had come from daniel and wilson were eventually found guilty and sentenced to 14 years hard labour however maximum term magistrate could legally impose was three months and in 1896 they were released at order of high commissioner for southern africa sir henry brougham loch high commissioner s legal team subsequently quashed convictions altogether saying that evidence against daniel and wilson was not sufficiently conclusive existence of lobengula s box of sovereigns was never proven either way and incident never explained beyond doubt burnham ingram and gooding version of events recorded by history is based on accounts of burnham ingram and gooding matabele present at battle particularly induna mjaan and men of forbes s column burnham ingram and gooding s stories closely corroborate each other their version of events was accepted as true by court of inquiry at bulawayo in december 1893 first hand matabele accounts such as mjaan s which were first recorded during 1894 appear to confirm character of break out saying that three of white men they were fighting including burnham whom several of them recognised left during a lull in battle just after wilson withdrew to his final position letter dated february 1894 detailing matabele accounts quoted in while all of direct evidence given by eyewitnesses supports findings of court of inquiry some historians and writers debate whether or not burnham ingram and gooding really were sent back by wilson to fetch help and suggest that they might have simply deserted when battle got rough proponents of this desertion theory frequently portray burnham as a man who embellished facts and coerced eyewitnesses into falsifying statements earliest recording of this claim of desertion is in a letter written in 1935 by john coghlan a cousin of southern rhodesia s first prime minister charles coghlan john coghlan wrote to a friend john carruthers on 14 december that year that a very reliable man informed me that wools sampson told him that gooding had confessed on his deathbed in 1899 that he and two americans had not actually been despatched by wilson and had simply left on their own accord this double hearsay confession coming from an anonymous source is not mentioned in gooding s 1899 obituary which instead recounts events as generally recorded peter emmerson a historian and supporter of desertion theory asks why wilson would have sent three of his men away at such a precarious moment j p lott another historian comments that wilson had sent runners to forbes twice previous night when he was already at very close quarters with matabele and with far fewer men he surmises that it would not be out of ordinary for major to do so again in his evaluation john o reilly asks why wilson sent gooding back with two americans surely burnham and ingram both seasoned scouts were enough gooding writes in his account that wilson originally only asked burnham to ride to forbes and that captain judd suggested to wilson that burnham should take two men with him chief of scouts requested ingram and borrow asked gooding to go too burnham also says that borrow sent gooding burnham ingram and gooding each received british south africa company medal for their service in first matabele war and all three subsequently served in second matabele war of 1896 97 all of officers and troopers of forbes column reported high praise for burnham s actions and none reported any doubts about his conduct even decades later one member of column trooper m e weale told rhodesia herald on 22 december 1944 that once commandant raaff took over command it was greatly due to burnham s good scouting that column managed to get away i have always felt that honours were equally divided between these two men to whom we owed our lives on that occasion burnham proceeded to become a key figure for a number of commanding officers including frederick carrington robert baden powell and frederick roberts carrington called him finest scout who ever scouted in africa he was my chief of scouts in 96 in matabeleland and he was eyes and ears of my force us president theodore roosevelt described him in 1901 as a scout and a hunter of courage and ability a man totally without fear a sure shot and a fighter ideal scout while fighting with british army in second boer war burnham was adjudged to have shown exceptional heroism and was decorated with distinguished service order then britain s second highest military honour legacy last stand of patrol was re enacted once more at 1899 greater britain exhibition in london during which scenes from matabele wars were re created as part of a play called savage south africa a vivid realistic and picturesque representation of life in wilds of africa culminating in major wilson s last stand show featured lobengula s son peter lobengula described as prince lobengula redoubtable warrior chieftain a short war film based show s version of final engagement major wilson s last stand was released by levi jones company studios in 1899 a song about events shangani patrol was written by rhodesian singer songwriter john edmond and first recorded by south african singer nick taylor in 1966 as b side for another edmond composition u d i song about rhodesia s unilateral declaration of independence in 1965 patriotic record topped rhodesian hit parade for four weeks a historical war film also called shangani patrol was filmed on location and released in 1970 author alexander fullerton wrote a novel about patrol s last stand entitled white men sang 1958 though much of mythology surrounding patrol and site has dissipated in national consciousness since country s reconstitution as zimbabwe in 1980 world s view endures as a
