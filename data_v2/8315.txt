city of jacksonville annexed them and established a streetcar line following great fire of 1901 which destroyed most of downtown jacksonville many displaced residents moved to riverside wealthy citizens built mansions close to river while less well to do purchased more modest bungalows and other plantation houses further inland neighborhood grew steadily with development continuing well beyond its original bounds to south until collapse of florida land boom in late 1920s during this period so many architects working in such a wide variety of contemporary styles experimented in riverside that it has become most architecturally diverse neighborhood in florida largely due to riverside s profusion of bungalow plantation houses jacksonville has what is likely largest number of such structures in state one notable section of riverside is silvertown a subdivision developed in 1887 for african americans initially isolated from largely white riverside to east it was eventually absorbed into growing neighborhood as such silvertown residents became some of few black plantation house owners in riverside through period of segregation a few one story wood frame houses in area

land was largely undeveloped hunters still pursued game there until 1910s in 1920 an investment group led by telfair stockton purchased edgewood and surrounding land to develop as an exclusive upscale subdivision named for cincinnati s avondale neighborhood plantation of former edgewood owner james r challen development was billed as riverside s residential ideal which was desirable because right kind of people have recognized its worth and because wrong kind of people can find property more to their liking elsewhere avondale was a restricted whites only development and most extensively planned community jacksonville had ever seen in contrast to architectural diversity in rest of riverside avondale featured more uniform architecture predominantly in mediterranean revival style following its success several adjacent developments sprung up which eventually became lumped together as part of avondale later history and preservation mid 20th century brought change to riverside and avondale including construction of interstate 95 and fuller warren bridge establishment of st vincent s medical center and construction of office buildings along riverside avenue through this time
