saul austerlitz called it a wickedly funny new novel usa today noted no novelist writing today is more engaging and entertaining when it comes to questions of race class and commercial culture than colson whitehead concluding that novel gets to heart of thing but in a delightfully roundabout way san francisco chronicle gave novel a mixed review commenting it s pure joy to read writing like this

trade news magazine publishers weekly reacted negatively to book writing whitehead disappoints in this intriguingly conceived but static tale of a small town with an identity crisis erin aubry kaplan of los angeles times noted too often whitehead can t resist temptation of irony and his big ideas are sometimes overwhelmed by one wink wink or metaphor too many kirkus reviews praised book writing while making no attempt at depth of characterization whitehead audaciously blurs line between social realism and fabulist satire library journal praised book noting in spare and evocative prose whitehead does shakespeare one better what s in a name and how does our identity relate to our own sense of who we are new york observer was critical of book but noted readers not looking for direct emotional access to characters may find it gratifying to solve intellectual puzzle set here by colson whitehead scott esposito of webzine popmatters gave novel mixed comments writing it is no surprise that apex hides hurt whitehead s third novel is packed with a number of allegorical elements blended into a multi layered structure what s unfortunate however is that all this technical artistry is in service of unremarkable themes and ideas entertainment website a v club complimented book writing perhaps taking his cues from his protagonist s profession whitehead keeps his prose as streamlined as it comes and he uses it to craft a satiric novel in tune with a moment where marketing overshadows content and even lowliest blogger thinks in branding terms michael mcgirr of sydney morning herald
