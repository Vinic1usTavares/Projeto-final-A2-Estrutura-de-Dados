marasmius sasicola is a species of marasmiaceae fungus known from kanagawa prefecture japan first collected in 2000 it was described in 2002 by haruki takahashi species produces small mushrooms with white caps and very short very thin black stems unlike in other similar species stems enter plant matter on which mushroom grows six to eight white gills are spread out around cap and all of them reach stem flesh has no taste or odour found in june species grows on dead sasa leaves from which it takes its specific epithet taxonomy and naming marasmius sasicola was first described by haruki takahashi 2002 in an article in mycoscience based on specimens collected from ikuta ryokuchi park kawasaki kanagawa prefecture japan in 2000 and 2001 specific name sasicola refers to fact species grows upon leaves of sasa species japanese common name for species is sasa no within genus mycena it probably belongs to section marasmius and subsection due to characters of stem gills and pileipellis outer most layer of cap description marasmius sasicola produces mushrooms that have convex caps from in diameter featuring folds or striations caps do not expand or flatten with age and are dry and dull cap surface is covered in tiny grains which vanish as mushrooms age caps of young mushrooms are coloured light brown but paler at cap margin as they mature caps become paler approaching white when fully matured very thin smooth stem measures between in length by thick it connects to centre of cap and is a dark brown to black colour mycelial cords cannot be seen at base of stem which anchors itself into substrate white gills can be adnexed attaching to stem by only part of their depth to adnate attaching by their full depth they are not at all crowded with between 6 and 8 separate gills all of which reach stem each gill is up to broad though it is thinner at edge mushrooms have a very thin layer of whitish flesh up to thick tough but flexible flesh lacks any odour or taste microscopic characteristics marasmius sasicola produces colourless ellipsoid basidiospores of between 8 and 10 by 4 to 6 micrometres mm spores have no ornamentation are not amyloid and have thin cell walls in his examinations takahashi did not observe any basidia but he did describe club shaped basidioles immature basidia which measured from 18 to 26 by 6 to 10 mm tightly packed cheilocystidia cystidia on edge of gill form a sterile edge to gill and there are no pleurocystidia cystidia on face of gill pileipellis top layer of cap forms a hymeniderm a cell structure reminiscent of hymenium on gills this is made up of club shaped cells measuring between 2 and 8 by 7 to 10 mm with reddish brown smooth cell walls up to 1 mm thick stipitipellis outermost layer of stem is made up of cylindrical hyphae measuring from 3 to 6 mm in width which run parallel to one another they have featureless brown cell walls measuring up to 1 mm thick and septa walls separating individual cells have clamp connections flesh in cap is made up of irregularly arranged cylindrical hyphae from 5 to 15 mm wide they stain a dark reddish brown in melzer s reagent or lugol s solution flesh in stem is made up of hyphae which run down stem and measure 4 to 11 mm in thickness smooth cell walls are colorless but again stain a dark reddish brown in melzer s reagent or lugol s solution septa have clamp connections similar species marasmius subconiatus known from sri lanka and indonesia is somewhat similar to m sasicola it can be differentiated as its stem does not enter substrate and gills differ in m subconiatus gills are orange and sport cheilocystidia which are pale yellow habitat and distribution marasmius sasicola is known from lowland forests of kanagawa prefecture japan and can be found in june mushrooms grow in large numbers close together and grow from dead leaves of sasa grass bamboo which have fallen see also list of marasmius species references external links agaricales of southwestern japan images of holotype specimen sasicola category fungi of asia category fungi described in 2002
