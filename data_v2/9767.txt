fairies trip with greater alacrity general air of festivity which predominated in this place so far remote from all those regions which mind has been used to contemplate as mansions of pleasure struck imagination with a delightful surprise analogous to that which is felt at an unexpected emersion from darkness into light when it was time to sup dance ceased and six and thirty persons sat down to two tables in same room after supper ladies sung songs to which i listened as an english audience to an italian opera delighted with sound of words which i did not understand boswell went exploring

unable to take so hardy a walk old mr malcolm m who had promised to accompany me was at my bedside between five and six i sprang up immediately and he and i attended by two other gentlemen traversed country during whole of this day though we had passed over not less than four and twenty miles of very rugged ground and had a highland dance on top of dun can highest mountain in island we returned in evening not at all fatigued and piqued ourselves at not being outdone at nightly ball by our less active friends who had remained at home my survey of rasay did not furnish much which can interest
