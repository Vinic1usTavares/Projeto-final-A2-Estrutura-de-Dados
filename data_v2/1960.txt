banksia coccinea commonly known as scarlet banksia waratah banksia or albany banksia is an erect shrub or small tree in family proteaceae noongar peoples know tree as its distribution in wild is along south west coast of western australia from denmark to stokes national park and north to stirling range growing on white or grey sand in shrubland heath or open woodland reaching up to in height it is a single stemmed plant that has oblong leaves which are long and wide prominent red and white flower spikes appear mainly in spring as they age they develop small follicles that store seeds until opened by fire though widely occurring it is highly sensitive to dieback and large populations of plants have succumbed to disease collected and described by robert brown in early 19th century banksia coccinea appears to be most closely related to banksia speciosa and b baxteri banksia coccinea plants are killed by bushfire and regenerate from seed flowers attract nectar and insect feeding birds particularly honeyeaters and a variety of insects widely considered one of most attractive banksia species b coccinea is a popular garden plant and one of most important banksia species for cut flower industry it is grown commercially in several countries including australia south africa canada united states new zealand and israel in cultivation b coccinea grows well in a sunny location on well drained soil but it cannot survive in areas with humid or wet summers description thumb 160px left image of plant showing erect 160px left infructescence showing small follicles on lower portions scarlet banksia grows as an erect shrub or small tree generally around tall with little lateral spread however it can reach in height particularly in vicinity of albany trunk is generally single at base before branching and covered with smooth grey bark that is thick and lacking in lenticels peaking in summer months pinkish brown new growth is densely hairy oblong cordate or leaves are long and wide with long petioles truncate at apex they have dentate margins with small 1 3 mm long teeth apart separated by shallow u or v shaped sinuses upper surface is covered in fine fur when young and becomes smooth with age while undersurface is covered with white fur particularly along midrib process of flowering takes 9 12 months stems begin developing microscopically in spring with no visible evidence of flower spike development for around five months before buds actually appear flower spikes are in bloom from may to december or january peaking between july and october distinctive inflorescences arise from ends of one year old branchlets squat and roughly cylindrical they are high and wide a field study on southern sandplains revealed an average count of around 286 individual flowers on each spike white flower is covered in grey or pale brown fur and there is little variation in colour style is generally scarlet but can be dark red orange or pink perianth is long while style is long and strongly recurved or looped until they are released at anthesis anthesis is acropetal that is flowers open from base up spike to apex flowers of all banksias arise in a spiral pattern around flower spike axis however in banksia coccinea they develop into distinctive vertical columns which are strongly accentuated by large gaps in between paired in columns red styles contrast with grey white perianth making a striking flower spike infructescence is small with up to 20 small follicles concentrated at lower end of spike each follicle is long high and 2 3 mm c 0 1 in wide and usually opens with fire long seed is composed of cuneate wedge shaped seed body proper measuring long and wide and a papery wing one side termed outer surface is grey black and wrinkled and other inner surface protrudes and is black and glistening seeds are separated by a dark brown seed separator that is roughly same shape as seeds with a depression where seed body sits adjacent to it in follicle it measures long and wide dull green cotyledons of seedlings are long and wide described by alex george as cuneate to obovate each cotyledon has a auricle at its base thick smooth hypocotyl is high and 1 5 mm thick seedling leaves are crowded above cotyledons and linear to spathulate in shape with recurved and deeply serrated margins with v shaped sinuses almost dividing leaves into triangular lobes first pair are long with next 2 4 leaves up to long successive leaves are more obovate in shape and up to long and wide seedling stems are covered in white hair taxonomy discovery and naming thumb right upright plate 3 of ferdinand bauer s 1813 illustrationes florae novae hollandiae first known specimens of banksia coccinea were collected in december 1801 during visit to king george sound of hms investigator under command of matthew flinders on board were botanist robert brown botanical artist ferdinand bauer and gardener peter good all three men gathered plant specimens but those collected by bauer and good were incorporated into brown s herbarium without attribution so it is not possible to identify actual collector of this species surviving specimen of b coccinea held by natural history museum in london is annotated in brown s hand king george iiids sound princess royal harbour especially near observatory observatory was apparently located in what is now central business district of albany no further information on collection is available as species is mentioned in neither brown s nor good s diary good also made a separate seed collection which included b coccinea and species was drawn by bauer like nearly all of bauer s field drawings of proteaceae original field sketch of b coccinea was destroyed in a hofburg fire in 1945 however a watercolour painting by bauer based on his field sketches still survives at natural history museum in london and a hand coloured copper engraving from that painting was published as plate 3 of bauer s 1813 illustrationes florae novae hollandiae german botanist adalbert described b purpurea in 1843 now regarded as a synonym of b coccinea common names include scarlet banksia waratah banksia and albany banksia brown published species in his 1810 on proteaceae of jussieu its species name derived from latin coccineus meaning scarlet and referring to pistils he recorded 31 species of banksia in his 1810 work prodromus florae novae hollandiae et insulae van diemen and in his taxonomic arrangement placed taxon in subgenus banksia verae true banksias because inflorescence is a typical banksia flower spike by time carl meissner published his 1856 arrangement of genus there were 58 described banksia species meissner divided brown s banksia verae which had been renamed eubanksia by stephan endlicher in 1847 into four series based on leaf properties he placed b coccinea in series quercinae george bentham published a thorough revision of banksia in his landmark publication flora australiensis in 1870 in bentham s arrangement number of recognised banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46 bentham defined four sections based on leaf style and pollen presenter characters banksia coccinea was placed in section orthostylis in 1891 german botanist otto kuntze challenged generic name banksia l f on grounds that name banksia had previously been published in 1775 as banksia j r forst g forst referring to genus now known as pimelea kuntze proposed sirmuellera as an alternative republishing b coccinea as sirmuellera coccinea challenge failed and banksia l f was formally conserved alex george published a new taxonomic arrangement of banksia in his classic 1981 monograph genus banksia l f proteaceae endlicher s eubanksia became b subgenus banksia and was divided into three sections george placed banksia coccinea in its own series banksia series coccineae within section b section banksia on account of a unique combination of characters namely vertical arrangement of flowers on spike combined with branched open habit broad leaves and very small follicles members of series quercinae and five species within series spicigerae share vertically aligned flowers but do not wholly exhibit other characters kevin thiele and pauline ladiges published a new arrangement for genus in 1996 their morphological cladistic analysis yielded a cladogram significantly different from george s arrangement they were uncertain of b placement as it had highly autapomorphic characteristics which made analysis of its relationships difficult hence in their arrangement it was located within series banksia but not allocated to a subseries incertae sedis it was reclassified in its own section coccinea in 1996 by tina maguire and colleagues pollen compatibility tests indicated its pollen was most compatible with banksia ericifolia b micrantha and b sphaerocarpa all of section oncostylis however they did not place it in that section as all members of oncostylis have hooked styles at anthesis this was upheld by george in his monograph for flora of australia series b coccinea s placement within banksia according to flora of australia is as follows genus banksiasubgenus banksiasection banksia sect coccineae b 2002 a molecular study by austin mast again showed banksia coccinea to be next closest relative of a group comprising banksia speciosa and b baxteri and only distantly related to other members of series banksia this was reinforced in a 2013 molecular study by marcel cardillo and colleagues using chloroplast dna and combining it with earlier results mast eric jones and shawn havery published results of their cladistic analyses of dna sequence data for banksia in 2005 they inferred a phylogeny greatly different from accepted taxonomic arrangement including finding banksia to be paraphyletic with respect to dryandra a new taxonomic arrangement was not published at time but early in 2007 mast and thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring dryandra to banksia and publishing b subgenus spathulatae for species having spoon shaped cotyledons in this way they also redefined autonym b subg banksia they foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once dna sampling of dryandra was complete in meantime if mast and thiele s nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement then b coccinea is placed in b subg banksia no subspecies are recognised although dna analysis showed that a population at redmond was genetically distinctive while those at gull rock two peoples bay and cheyne beach were unusually diverse distribution and habitat thumb right upright range along southern west australian coccinea occurs close to south coast of western australia from hay river northeast of denmark albany in west east to stokes national park southeast of munglinup and inland to stirling range and northern border of fitzgerald river national park around 47 of plants are protected in conservation areas while 13 are located on road verges it prefers deep white or grey sand among tall shrubland heath mallee heath associated with such species as banksia baxteri b speciosa b attenuata and lambertia inermis or low open woodland in stirling range and near albany where it is found with eucalyptus marginata banksia attenuata and b ilicifolia most of its range has a gently undulating topography but it also occurs on a steep rocky slope at ellen peak in stirling ranges annual rainfall is ecology thumb banksia coccinea at gull rock national park a field study conducted around albany found honey possum tarsipes rostratus sometimes visit banksia coccinea as do new holland honeyeater phylidonyris novaehollandiae white cheeked honeyeater p nigra and western spinebill acanthorhynchus superciliosus banksia coccinea flowers are visited by colletid bees alcyoneus and h short billed black cockatoo breaks off old cones with follicles to eat seed often doing so before seed is ripe b coccinea is killed by fire and regenerates afterwards from seed released from burnt follicles it has is some degree of serotiny that is it has an aerial seed bank in its canopy in form of follicles of old flower spikes however numbers of seed are less than other co occurring species of banksia on southern plains and peak several years after a fire unusually for banksias b coccinea can release seed with resulting seedlings growing in absence of a bushfire trigger plants flower and fruit three years after germination and are shorter lived than other banksias appearing in poor health or dying before 20 years of age they hence appear to be suited to fire intervals of less than 20 years manipulating growing conditions on plants in cultivation showed that longer daylight 16 hours vs 8 hours led to development of more flower spikes indicating that flower initiation was related to day length extremely sensitive to dieback caused by phytophthora cinnamomi banksia coccinea is an indicator species for presence of disease there is no known means of eradicating dieback much of stirling range national park is infested though fitzgerald river national park has been largely spared applying phosphite to infested areas has been shown to reduce mortality rates to around 50 b coccinea has shown some symptoms of toxicity to application of phosphite with some patchy necrosis of leaves but plant s uptake of compound is somewhat lower compared with uptake by other shrub species unusually symptoms do not appear to be proportional to exposure levels dying stands of b coccinea were observed in 1989 and fungus isolated as cause in 1995 disease a form of aerial canker manifested initially as dead dry brown leaves and tips of new growth plants would die from top downwards with larger branches affected over time under outer bark orange and brown patches of necrosis spread out from leaf nodes until they encircle stem which then dies flower spikes may be affected during flowering season in humid spells during warm weather white or pink spore tendrils are produced on dead wood one affected stand monitored over three years from october 1989 to june 1992 showed a 97 mortality of plants compared with a baseline 40 investigators bryan shearer and colleagues isolated another virulent pathogen that they identified as a species of however it appeared to invoke an immune response in plant this immune response coupled with fact that it had not been observed in wild led them to believe it was not a major pathogen of species this species has since been reclassified and named as b coccinea is a host for gall midge banksiae a species of fly that attacks and lays eggs on leaves between late october and early december round white hairy galls are 5 7 mm in diameter and generally contain one larva or up to five on severely infested plants larvae moult and feed until january to march when they reduce activity until early october although these are not harmful to plant they disfigure cut foliage and hence reduce its value cultivation widely considered one of most attractive banksia species b coccinea is a popular garden plant and one of most important banksia species for cut flower industry it is grown commercially in australia south africa canada united states new zealand israel and trialled in france spain and south america its striking terminal inflorescences and furry new growth are its main horticultural attributes however it is highly sensitive to dieback and succumbs readily when exposed it is difficult to keep alive in areas of heavy soils or summer rainfall or humidity such as australian east coast furthermore flowering may be sparse or not occur when cultivated in warmer climates such as perth pruning promotes branching which leads to more flower spikes being produced propagation is by seed though these can be difficult to extract from follicles seeds do not require any treatment before sowing and take 12 to 48 days to germinate cultivars require propagation by cutting for progeny to grow true cuttings are slow to strike attempts to graft b coccinea have met with little success in a breeding program conducted by margaret sedgley of department of horticulture viticulture and oenology waite agricultural research institute of university of adelaide in adelaide south australia two forms of banksia coccinea were bred registered under plant breeders rights pbr and commercially propagated mainly for cut flower industry banksia waite flame is an early flowering somewhat orange hued form and b waite crimson is a red flowering form that
