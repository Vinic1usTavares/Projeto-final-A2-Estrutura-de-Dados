trident also known as trident nuclear programme or trident nuclear deterrent covers development procurement and operation of nuclear weapons in united kingdom and their means of delivery its purpose as stated by ministry of defence is to deter most extreme threats to our national security and way of life which cannot be done by other means trident is an operational system of four s armed with trident ii d 5 ballistic missiles able to deliver thermonuclear warheads from multiple independently targetable re entry vehicles mirvs it is operated by royal navy and based at clyde naval base on west coast of scotland from glasgow at least one submarine is always on patrol to provide a continuous at sea capability each one carries up to eight missiles and forty warheads although their capacity is much larger missiles are american drawn from a common pool british government initially negotiated with carter administration for purchase of trident i c 4 missile in 1981 reagan administration announced its decision to upgrade its trident to new trident ii d 5 missile this necessitated another round of negotiations and concessions uk trident programme was announced in july 1980 and patrols began in december 1994 trident replaced submarine based polaris system in operation from 1968 until 1996 since tactical we 177 free fall bombs were decommissioned in 1998 trident has been only nuclear weapon system that is operated by uk nato s military posture was relaxed after collapse of soviet union in 1991 trident s missiles were detargetted in 1994 ahead of maiden voyage of first vanguard class boat meaning that warheads are not aimed at specific targets but await co ordinates that can be programmed into their computers and fired with several days notice although trident was designed as a strategic deterrent end of cold war led british government to conclude that a sub strategic but not tactical role was required a programme for replacement of vanguard class is under way on 18 july 2016 house of commons voted by a large majority to proceed with building a fleet of s to be operational by 2028 with current fleet completely phased out by 2032 background during early part of second world war britain had a nuclear weapons project code named tube alloys which 1943 quebec agreement merged with american manhattan project to create a combined american british and canadian project british government expected that united states would continue to share nuclear technology which it regarded as a joint discovery but united states atomic energy act of 1946 mcmahon act ended technical co operation fearing a resurgence of united states isolationism and britain losing its great power status british government resumed its own development effort first british atomic bomb was tested in operation hurricane on 3 october 1952 subsequent british development of hydrogen bomb and a fortuitous international relations climate created by sputnik crisis facilitated amendment of mcmahon act and 1958 us uk mutual defence agreement mda which allowed britain to acquire nuclear weapons systems from united states thereby restoring nuclear special relationship thumb left a polaris missile at royal air force museum cosford with chevaline right during 1950s britain s nuclear deterrent was based around v bombers of royal air force raf but developments in radar and surface to air missiles made it clear that bombers were becoming increasingly vulnerable and would be unlikely to penetrate soviet airspace by mid 1970s to address this problem united kingdom embarked on development of a medium range ballistic missile called blue streak but concerns were raised about its own vulnerability and british government decided to cancel it and acquire american skybolt air launched ballistic missile in return americans were given permission to base us navy s polaris boats at holy loch in scotland in november 1962 american government decided to cancel skybolt president john f kennedy and prime minister harold macmillan then negotiated nassau agreement under which us would sell to uk polaris systems for uk built submarines this was formalised in polaris sales agreement first british polaris ballistic missile submarine ssbn was laid down by vickers armstrongs at its yard at barrow in furness in cumbria on 26 february 1964 she was launched on 15 september 1965 commissioned on 2 october 1967 and conducted a test firing at american eastern range on 15 february 1968 she was followed by which was completed by vickers armstrongs on 29 september 1968 and two boats built by cammell laird in birkenhead which was completed on 15 november 1968 and which was completed on 4 december 1969 four boats were based at hmnb clyde at faslane on firth of clyde not far from us navy s base at holy loch which opened in august 1968 it was served by a weapons store at nearby rnad coulport hm dockyard rosyth was designated as refit yard for 10th submarine squadron as polaris boats became operational thumb 200px polaris missile launch from submarine in 1983 polaris proved to be reliable and its second strike capability conferred greater strategic flexibility than any previous british nuclear weapons system but it had a limited lifespan and was expected to become obsolete by 1990s it was considered vital that an independent british deterrent could penetrate existing and future soviet anti ballistic missile abm capabilities a powerful abm system abm 1 defended moscow and nato believed ussr would continue to develop its effectiveness deterrent logic required ability to threaten destruction of soviet capital and other major cities to ensure that a credible and independent nuclear deterrent was maintained uk developed an improved front end codenamed chevaline which replaced one of three warheads in a polaris missile with multiple decoys chaff and other defensive countermeasures chevaline was extremely expensive it encountered many of same issues that had affected british nuclear weapons projects of 1950s and postponed but did not avert polaris s obsolescence conservative party had a strong pro defence stance and supported british nuclear weapons programme although not necessarily at expense of conventional weapons rival labour party had initiated acquisition of nuclear weapons but in late 1950s its left wing pushed for a policy of nuclear disarmament resulting in an ambiguous stance while in office from 1964 to 1970 and 1974 to 1979 it built and maintained polaris and modernised it through secret chevaline programme while out of office in 1980 1981 and 1982 it adopted a policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament more important than political differences was a shared sense of british national identity britain was seen as a pivotal player in world affairs its economic and military weaknesses offset by its membership of european union nato and group of seven its permanent seat on un security council its leadership of commonwealth of nations and above all nuclear special relationship with united states to accept a position of inferiority to its ancient rival france was unthinkable moreover britain was perceived as being more enlightened than other countries a force for good in world with a moral duty to intervene with military force if need be to defend not just its interests but its values by 1980s possession of nuclear weapons was considered a visible sign of britain s enduring status as a great power in spite of loss of british empire and had become a component of national self image negotiations thumb right margaret thatcher visits president jimmy carter on 17 december 1979 cabinet secretary sir john hunt briefed cabinet on polaris on 28 november 1977 noting that a possible successor might take up to 15 years to bring into service depending on nature of system chosen and whether it was to be developed by united kingdom or in collaboration with france or united states with recent experience of chevaline in mind option of a purely british project was rejected a study of options was commissioned in february 1978 from a group chaired by deputy under secretary of state at foreign office sir antony duff with chief scientific adviser to ministry of defence sir ronald mason duff mason report was delivered to prime minister james callaghan in parts on 11 and 15 december it recommended purchase of american trident i c 4 missile then in service with us navy c 4 had multiple independently targetable re entry vehicle mirv capability which was needed to overcome soviet anti ballistic missile defences callaghan approached president jimmy carter in january 1979 who responded positively but non carter administration s main priority was salt ii agreement with soviet union which limited nuclear weapons stockpiles it was signed on 18 june 1979 but carter faced an uphill battle to secure its ratification by united states senate mirv technology had proved to be a major loophole in 1972 salt i agreement which limited numbers of missiles but not warheads during salt ii negotiations us had resisted soviet proposals to include british and french nuclear forces in agreement but there were concerns that supplying mirv technology to uk would be seen by soviets as violating spirit of non circumvention clause in salt ii callaghan was succeeded by margaret thatcher after general election on 3 may 1979 and she discussed issue with carter in october who agreed to supply c 4 but he asked that uk delay a formal request until december in order that he could get salt ii ratified beforehand in meantime mda without which uk would not be able to access us nuclear weapons technology was renewed for five more years on 5 december and misc 7 cabinet committee formally approved decision to purchase c 4 following day when thatcher met with carter again on 17 december he still asked for more time but soviet invasion of afghanistan on 24 december ended all hope of senate ratification of salt ii clearing way for sale to proceed british government hoped that trident could be secured on same terms as polaris but when its chief negotiator robert wade gery sat down with his american counterpart david l aaron in march 1980 he found this was not case instead of 5 per cent levy on cost of equipment supplied in recognition of us research and development r d costs that had already been incurred that kennedy had agreed to in polaris sales agreement which would have been about 100 million a 1976 law now required a pro rata fixed fee payment which in this case came to around 400 million thumb left upright margaret thatcher and ronald reagan on 26 february 1981 law could be waived if president determined that it was in interest of united states to do so but for that carter administration wanted undertakings that uk would raise defence spending by same amount or pay cost of us forces manning rapier batteries and ground launched cruise missile sites in uk on 2 june 1980 thatcher and united states secretary of defense harold brown agreed to 2 5 billion for c 4 missile system plus a 5 per cent r d levy british personnel for rapier batteries and an expansion of us base on diego garcia which had assumed great importance since soviet invasion of afghanistan secretary of state for defence francis pym informed cabinet of decision to purchase trident on 15 july 1980 and announced it in house of commons later that day agreement was effected by amending polaris sales agreement changing polaris to trident however on 4 november 1980 ronald reagan was elected president part of his election platform was to modernise us strategic nuclear forces on 24 august 1981 reagan administration informed british government of its intention to upgrade its trident to new trident ii d 5 missile by 1989 and indicated that it was willing to sell it to uk despite name d 5 was not an improved version of c 4 but a completely new missile its purchase had already been considered in duff mason report but had been rejected as its additional capability extended range from was not required by uk and it was more expensive exactly how much more expensive was uncertain as it was still under development at same time british government was well aware of costs of not having same hardware as us nor did reagan administration promise to sell d 5 on same terms as c 4 to pay for trident british government announced deep cuts to other defence spending on 25 june 1981 negotiations commenced on 8 february with british team again led by wade gery americans were disturbed at proposed british defence cuts and pressed for an undertaking that aircraft carrier be retained in service which they felt was necessary to avert trouble over guatemalan territorial dispute they accepted a counter offer that britain would retain two landing platform dock ships and for which americans reduced r d charge under agreement uk would purchase 65 trident ii d 5 missiles that would operate as part of a shared pool of weapons based at naval submarine base kings bay in united states us would maintain and support missiles while uk would manufacture its own submarines and warheads to go on missiles warheads and missiles would be mated in uk this was projected to save about ps500 million over eight years at coulport while americans spent 70 million upgrading facilities at kings bay sale agreement was formally signed on 19 october 1982 by british ambassador to united states sir oliver wright and united states secretary of state george shultz trident programme was projected to cost ps5 billion including four submarines missiles new facilities at coulport and faslane and five per cent contribution to trident ii d 5 r d it was expected to absorb 5 per cent of defence budget as with polaris option for a fifth submarine allowing two to be on patrol at all times was discussed but ultimately rejected thatcher s popularity soared as a result of british victory in falklands war in which ships that americans had insisted be retained played a crucial part trident s future was secured following year when conservative party won 1983 general election defeating a labour party that had pledged to cancel trident first trident boat was ordered on 30 april 1986 in view of labour party s continued opposition to trident vickers insisted that contract include substantial compensation in event of cancellation uk nuclear policy thumb right upright alt photograph of a hand holding a pistol grip grip has a red trigger button and a coiled cable connected to its base trigger used to launch a trident missile on cold war trident programme was initiated during cold war and its capabilities were designed to deter powerful soviet union and its warsaw pact allies in europe it was designed to provide an ongoing independently controlled deterrent against major threats to security of uk and its nato allies including threats posed by non nuclear weapons to provide an effective deterrent trident system was intended to pose a potential threat to key aspects of soviet state power whilst being invulnerable to a surprise or pre emptive nuclear strike as with polaris trident was owned and operated by uk but committed to nato and targeted in accordance with plans set out by organisation s supreme allied commander europe who is traditionally a senior figure in united states military under terms of polaris sales arrangement united states does not have a veto on use of british nuclear weapons which uk may launch independently but this would only occur if supreme national interests required it final decision on firing missiles is responsibility of prime minister who upon taking office writes four identical letters of last resort one of which is locked in a safe on board each of vanguard class submarines if contact with uk is lost commanding officer of a submarine has to follow instructions in letter if they believe that united kingdom has suffered an overwhelming attack options include retaliating with nuclear weapons not retaliating putting submarine under command of an ally or acting as captain deems appropriate exact content of letters is never disclosed and they are destroyed without being opened upon election of a new prime minister post cold war by time of first vanguard patrol in december 1994 soviet union no longer existed and

followed suit deployment of ships carrying nuclear weapons caused embarrassment during falklands war and in aftermath it was decided to stockpile them ashore in peacetime nuclear depth bombs were withdrawn from service in 1992 followed by we 177 free fall bombs used by royal navy and raf on 31 march 1998 and all were dismantled by end of august this left trident as britain s sole nuclear weapons system although trident was designed as a strategic deterrent end of cold war led british government to conclude that a sub strategic but not tactical role was required with trident missiles assuming role formerly handled by raf s we 177 bombs 1994 defence white paper stated we also need capability to undertake nuclear action on a more limited scale in order to halt aggression without inevitably triggering strategic nuclear exchanges a later statement read we also intend to exploit flexibility of trident to provide vehicle for both sub strategic and strategic elements of our deterrent as an insurance against potential adverse trends in international situation on 19 march 1998 defence secretary george robertson was asked to provide a statement on development of a lower yield variant of trident warhead for sub strategic role he replied uk has some flexibility in choice of yield for warheads on its trident missiles uk has not declared a no first use policy regarding launching a nuclear attack former british defence secretary geoff hoon stated in 2002 and 2003 that uk would be willing to attack rogue states with them if nuclear weapons were used against british troops in april 2017 defence secretary michael fallon confirmed that uk would use nuclear weapons in a pre emptive initial strike in most extreme circumstances fallon stated in a parliamentary answer that uk has neither a first use or no first use in its nuclear weapon policy so that its adversaries would not know when uk would launch nuclear strikes design development and construction vanguard

missiles rather than 24 on board an ohio boat boats are significantly larger than resolution class and were given names formerly associated with battleships and aircraft carriers befitting their status as capital ships an important consideration was depth of walney channel which connected barrow to irish sea which limited draft to while ohio class boats had a draft of each boat is long and in diameter and carries a crew of 150 officers and ratings submarines use a tactical information and weapons control system called submarine command system next generation this system was developed in collaboration with microsoft and is based on same technology as windows xp which led media to give it nickname windows for submarines in addition to missile tubes submarines are fitted with four torpedo tubes and carry spearfish torpedo allowing them to engage submerged or surface targets at ranges up to two sse mark 10 launchers are also fitted allowing boats to deploy type 2066 and type

warheads are dismantled and refurbished warheads have been assembled at awe facilities near aldermaston and burghfield berkshire since 1992 they are transported to armaments depot away at coulport by heavily guarded convoys between 2000 and 2016 vehicles were involved in 180 incidents ranging from delays and diversions because of accidents protests or bad weather to a sudden loss of power in one of lorries which halted a convoy and caused a double lane closure and a tailback on m6 motorway incidents have been more frequent in recent years convoys often use motorway through centre of glasgow where an accident leaking radiation could affect hundreds of thousands of people according to international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons under 1958 us uk mutual defence agreement uk is allowed to draw upon us warhead design information but constructing and maintaining warheads for trident programme is responsibility of awe exact number of warheads carried on patrol at any given time is classified information an article by federation of american scientists argued that british nuclear warhead is based on us warhead engineering design a conclusion that defence select committee concurred with in 2006 national audit office recorded in 1987 that most of warhead development and production expenditure was planned to be incurred in us additionally much of nuclear materials for warheads was purchased from us on cost grounds 3 controller r d establishments research and nuclear programmes element of trident programme consists of four major areas development production special ie fissile materials and capital items although last item accounts for only 5 per cent of nuclear programme expenditure most of development and production expenditure is incurred in us nao s examination showed that consideration was given to purchase of special materials from us on cost grounds in 1982 ministers decided after taking account of possible options for procurement together with political economic and employment considerations that a substantial proportion should be purchased in uk us president george h w bush authorised transfer of nuclear warhead components to uk between 1991 and 1996 each warhead is housed in a cone shaped re entry vehicle made in united states this shell protects it from high temperatures experienced upon re entry into earth s atmosphere trident warhead s fusing arming and firing mechanisms are carefully designed so that it can only detonate after launch and ballistic deployment conservative governments were sensitive to charges that replacement of polaris with trident would involve an escalation in numbers of british nuclear weapons when decision to purchase trident ii was announced in 1982 it was stressed that while american trident boats carried 24 missiles with eight warheads each a total of 192 warheads british trident boats would carry no more than 128 warheads same number as polaris in november 1993 secretary of state for defence malcolm rifkind announced that each boat would deploy no more than 96 warheads in 2010 this was reduced to a maximum of 40 warheads split between eight missiles consequent reduction in warhead production and refurbishment was estimated to save ps22 million over a ten year period trident ii d 5 missiles thumb left test launch of a trident ii missile trident ii d 5 is a submarine launched ballistic missile built by lockheed martin space systems in sunnyvale california and deployed with us navy and royal navy british government contributed five per cent of its r d costs under modified polaris sales agreement development contract was issued in october 1983 and first launch occurred in january 1987 first submarine launch was attempted by in march 1989 this attempt failed because plume of water following missile rose to a greater height than expected resulting in water being in nozzle when motor ignited once problem was understood simple changes were very quickly made but problem delayed entry into service of trident ii until march 1990 trident ii d 5 was designed to be more sophisticated than its predecessor trident i c 4 and has a greater payload capacity all three stages of trident ii d 5 are made of graphite epoxy making missile much lighter than its predecessor first test from a british vanguard class submarine took place in 1994 missile is long weighs has a range of a top speed of over mach 17 4 and a circular error probable cep accuracy to within a few feet it is guided using an inertial navigation system combined with a star tracker and is not dependent on american run global positioning system gps 1998 strategic defence review decided to limit number of missile bodies to 58 already purchased or under order and not receive final seven

2016 fewer than 10 test flights have been failures and royal navy is not known to have had a previous failure cost in 1990s total acquisition cost of trident programme was ps9 8 billion about 38 per cent of which was incurred in united states in 2005 06 annual expenditure for running and capital costs was estimated at between ps1 2 billion and ps1 7 billion and was estimated to rise to to ps2 2 billion in 2007 08 including atomic weapons establishment costs since trident became operational in 1994 annual expenditure has ranged between 3 and 4 5 per cent of annual defence budget and was projected to increase to 5 5 per cent of defence budget by 2007 08 as of 2009 each missile cost united states government nearly ps16 8 million 29 1 million to build an important factor in cost was

in opposition to nuclear testing it reached its peak around 1960 by which time it had evolved into a broader movement calling for britain to unilaterally give up nuclear weapons withdraw from nato and end basing of bombers armed with nuclear weapons in uk end of atmospheric nuclear testing internal squabbles and activists focusing their energies on other causes led to a rapid decline but it revived in early 1980s in wake of thatcher government s december 1979 decision to deploy glcms in uk under nato double track decision and announcement of decision to purchase trident in july 1980 membership leapt from 3 000 in 1980 to 50 000 a year later and rallies for unilateral nuclear disarmament in london in october 1981 and june 1982 attracted 250 000 marchers largest ever mass demonstrations in uk up to that time 1982 labour party conference adopted a platform calling for removal of glcms scrapping of polaris and cancellation of trident this was reaffirmed by 1986 conference while party was

institute rusi a british defence and security think tank released a paper in july 2010 assessing four possible options for maintaining both an effective nuclear deterrent and also reducing costs in light of anticipated budget restrictions these proposals were motivated by fact that funding for trident renewal programme now had to come from core ministry of defence budget four alternatives were considered trident submarines on continuous patrol trident submarines not on patrol continuously attack submarines armed with nuclear cruise missiles and land based nuclear weapons paper concluded that given opportunity costs for conventional capabilities that current plans for trident renewal are due to incur over next decade there is now a growing case for a re examination of whether there are less expensive means of pursuing this objective a key element of such a review is likely to be a reconsideration of need to maintain a commitment to casd in strategic circumstances that are now very different from those in which it was first introduced trident alternatives review 2013 trident alternatives review was an 18 month study led by cabinet office that was aimed at establishing whether or not there were credible alternatives to uk s submarine based casd accordingly review analysed a range of delivery systems and warhead designs with respect to their affordability and effectiveness against potential targets ultimately trident alternatives review came to conclusion that there were alternatives to trident that would enable uk to be capable of inflicting significant damage such that most potential adversaries around world would be deterred but none would offer same degree of resilience as current posture review asserted that whether or not cruise missile based systems offer a credible alternative was contingent upon a political judgement on whether uk could accept a significant increase in vulnerability and a reduction in who it could deter publication of report was met with a mixed and varied reception from different political parties and non governmental organisations ngos in field of non proliferation and disarmament while it was welcomed by prime minister david cameron as having confirmed necessity of like for like replacement of trident liberal democrat cabinet minister danny alexander deemed it a demonstration of fact there are credible and viable alternatives to uk s current approach to nuclear deterrence ngos including british american security information council basic a non proliferation and disarmament think tank criticised report for its limited scope and its failure to engage with a wider array of considerations related to nuclear weapons including environmental and humanitarian issues trident commission in 2011 basic

commission operated under chairmanship of former labour secretary of state for defence lord browne of former conservative defence and foreign secretary sir malcolm rifkind and sir menzies campbell former leader of liberal democrats and shadow foreign secretary after three years of deliberation commission released its final report on 1 july 2014 it suggested with important caveats that uk should retain a nuclear deterrent conclusion acknowledged that it remains crucial that uk show keen regard for its position within international community and for shared responsibility to achieve progress in global nuclear disarmament basic s interpretation of report also focused on this point emphasising that commissioners agreed that health of global strategic environment particularly nuclear non proliferation is critical to national security and is a central consideration they talk of need for britain to maintain its glide path down towards disarmament to ensure that renewal decisions next

kingdom s nuclear deterrent recommended that nuclear weapons should be maintained and outlined measures that would do so until 2040s it advocated currently preferred submarine based system as it remained cheapest and most secure deterrence option available costs for this option are estimated at ps15 20 billion based on ps0 25 billion to participate in us trident d 5 missile life extension programme ps11 14 billion for a class of four new ssbns ps2 3 billion for refurbishing warheads ps2 3 billion for infrastructure these 2006 07 prices would equate to about for successor class submarines 2011 initial gate report confirmed estimates of ps2 3bn each for warheads and infrastructure these cost estimates exclude vanguard five year life extension and decommissioning and it is unclear if new trident missiles will need to be purchased for life extension programme running costs would be about ps1 5 billion per year at 2006 prices paper suggested parts of existing trident system be refitted to some extent to prolong their lives however relatively short five years life extension potential of vanguard class meant that a new class of ssbns should replace it in early 2020s first boat of new ssbn class would take 17 years to be designed and built making a five year life extension of vanguard class necessary parliamentary support a decision on renewal of trident was made on 4 december 2006 prime minister tony blair told mps it would be unwise and dangerous for uk to give up its nuclear weapons he outlined plans to spend up to on a new generation of submarines for trident missiles he said submarine numbers may be cut from four to three while number of nuclear warheads would be cut by 20 to 160 blair said although cold war had ended uk needed nuclear weapons as no one could be sure another nuclear threat would not emerge in future on 14 march 2007 labour government won house of commons support for plans to renew submarine system proposals were passed by house of commons by a majority of 248 despite a clarification that vote was just for concept stage of new system 95 labour mps rebelled and it was only passed with support of opposition conservative party it was first time mps had been given chance to vote on whether uk should remain a nuclear power and biggest rebellion since beginning of 2003 iraq war labour government proposed that final decision to manufacture should be made in 2014 new 2010 coalition government agreed that renewal of trident should be scrutinised to ensure value for money research and development work continued with an initial gate procurement decision but main gate decision to manufacture a replacement was rescheduled for 2016 after 2015 general election vote on whether to replace vanguard class with successor class was held on 18 july 2016 in house of commons motion passed with a significant majority extending programme s life until at least 2060s although 48 labour mps voted against it 41 did not vote and 140 labour votes were cast in favour of motion thumb left upright 1 2 leanne wood speaks at stoptrident rally on 27 february 2016 she was arrested on 8 january 2007 for protesting against uk s trident nuclear missile programme at faslane 2010 strategic defence and security review 2010 strategic defence and security review concluded that successor class submarines would have eight operational missiles carrying no more than 40 operational warheads between them this would allow uk to reduce its stocks of operational warheads from 160 to 120 and overall stockpile from no more than 225 to no more than 180 they would be carried in a 12 missile common missile compartment designed in collaboration with us common missile compartment which could accommodate current trident ii d 5 missiles and any replacement missile once d 5 reaches end of its expected life in 2040s expert opinion two non representative polls of experts from rusi and royal institute of international affairs commonly known as chatham house were conducted in 2010 rusi found a majority for those who think benefits of trident outweigh costs 53 compared to those that think costs outweigh benefits 13 or are evenly balanced 34 chatham house poll found a minority in favour of trident replacement 22 with more in favour of replacing with a cheaper system 43 and 29 saying uk should not replace trident at all public opinion in april 2015 a yougov poll found that 38 of people thought that trident should be replaced in full 28 wanted to replace it with a cheaper system 19 thought uk should completely give up its nuclear weapons and 15 did not know in september 2015 a poll found that 29 agreed that trident should be reformed to make it cheaper 26 that it should be renewed in full and 18 that it should be scrapped 27 did not know nuclear weapons are not nation s biggest issue with just 2 of people saying that it was nation s biggest worry in may 2015 compared to 21 in june 1987 dreadnought class submarine in february 2016 bae systems began design work on prototypes of new submarines provisionally known as successor class a vote in house of commons on 18 july 2016 determined that uk should proceed with construction of this next generation of submarines with 472 votes in favour of replacement to 117 against successor class was officially named on 21 october 2016 submarines were expected to become operational starting in 2028 with current fleet phased out by 2032 at time of commons vote there was already some urgency to move ahead because some experts predicted it could take 17 years to develop new submarine to replace vanguard class final cost of replacing vanguard class will not be known until project has been completed in october 2015 reuters claimed it would cost ps167 billion over its 30 year lifespan or ps5 56 billion per year this figure was disputed by secretary of state for defence michael fallon ministry of defence put cost of building testing and commissioning replacement vessels at ps31 billion plus a contingency fund of ps10 billion over 35 years or about 0 2 per cent of government spending or 6 per cent of defence spending every year crispin blunt chair of foreign affairs select committee estimated in july 2016 that programme would cost billion in total over its lifetime for 2018 19 financial year national audit office found that spending on nuclear deterrent will cost ps5 2 billion or 14 of defence budget with ps600 million of contingency funding used costs were projected at about ps51 billion over following 10 years ps2 9 billion above projected budget which already anticipated finding ps3 billion of savings which daily telegraph described as a ps6 billion shortfall footnotes notes references trident programme category lockheed corporation trident
