switzerland made detailed plans to acquire and test nuclear weapons during cold war less than two weeks after nuclear bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki swiss government started studying possibility of building nuclear weapons and continued its military nuclear program for 43 years until 1988 it has since signed and ratified treaty on non proliferation of nuclear weapons switzerland never possessed biological weapons but did have a program of swiss army high command to develop and test chemical weapons military nuclear program thumb left 200px paul scherrer in late 1940s he played an important role in swiss nuclear program on 15 august 1945 hans frick a colonel in swiss military sent a letter to federal councillor karl kobelt requesting that switzerland study possibility of acquiring nuclear weapons in order to defend itself federal council authorized creation of a commission to do such in november 1945 efforts were well under way in 1945 on 8 june 1946 study commission for nuclear energy ska was created by swiss government under leadership of dr paul scherrer a physicist and professor at eth zurich commission had objective of studying civil use of atomic energy and secret objective of studying scientific and technical basis for building nuclear weapons activity of this group was low and only slow progress was made however events of cold war especially soviet invasion of hungary in 1956 and nuclear arms race of mid 1950s provided new impetus while his specific role is questioned scherrer played an important role in swiss nuclear program secret study commission for possible acquisition of own nuclear arms was instituted by chief of general staff louis de with a meeting on 29 march 1957 aim of commission was to give swiss federal council an orientation towards possibility of acquisition of nuclear arms in switzerland recommendations of commission were ultimately favorable federal council released a public statement on 11 july 1958 stating that although a world without nuclear weapons was in switzerland s interest its neighboring countries adopting nuclear weapons would force it to do likewise on 23 december 1958 federal council instructed military department to study logistics and execution of attaining nuclear arms however efforts remained focused on study and planning rather than implementation in a referendum held in april 1962 swiss people rejected a proposal to ban nuclear weapons within country next year in may swiss voters again rejected a referendum that would have required swiss voters to approve of armed forces being equipped in nuclear weapons if it chose to do so by 1963 planning had proceeded to point that detailed technical proposals specific arsenals and cost estimates were made on 15 november 1963 dr paul schmid prepared a 58 page report laying theoretical foundations for swiss nuclear armaments on 28 november 1963 deputy chief of general staff estimated that costs of building a uranium bomb at 720 million swiss francs over 35 years initially including 20 million francs for pure research that would be needed for planning it also calculated that should decision be for plutonium instead of highly enriched uranium then estimate would be 2 100 million francs over 27 years on 4 may 1964 military joint staff issued a recommendation to have about 100 bombs 60 100 kilotons 50 artillery shells 5 kt and 100 rockets 100 kt within next 15 years at costs of about 750 million swiss francs there were plans for 7 underground nuclear tests in uninhabited regions of switzerland a location with a radius of that can be sealed off completely in addition to this switzerland purchased uranium and stored it in nuclear reactors purchased from united states first of which was built in 1960 between 1953 and 1955 switzerland procured around of enriched uranium from belgian congo with authorization of u s and united kingdom switzerland had also considered purchasing from republic of china and union of south africa were stored in diorit reactor in while a stockpile of of uranium and of uranium oxide was stored at until 1981 and it was not covered by international safeguards meant to prevent spread of nuclear weapons additionally in 1969 swiss government unsuccessfully tried to purchase of weapons grade plutonium from norway in spring of 1964 a group working within military department which approved of nuclear tests in switzerland presented a secret plan for attainment of nuclear weapons to federal council in first phase of plan 50 bombs from 60 100 kt would be procured in phase two another 200 bombs would be procured to clarify definitively whether nuclear tests should be carried out in switzerland military chief of staff jacob requested of federal councillor paul head of military department to obtain authorization for total budget of 20 million swiss francs from federal council thumb 200px a swiss mirage iiis in 1988 besides having a main military goal of deterrence strategists envisioned swiss nuclear strike capability as part of a preemptive war against soviets swiss air force mirage iii jet would have been able to carry nuclear bombs as far as moscow they also suggested weapons could be used on swiss soil against a possible invading force switzerland possessed of separated plutonium coming from reprocessed spent fuel of heavy water research reactor diorit it was stored for several decades under international atomic energy agency safeguards at paul scherrer institute but this supply was not directly suitable for building nuclear weapons in february 2016 nearly three decades after end of its nuclear program and in time for 2016 nuclear security summit swiss government shipped this excess plutonium to united states for disposal financial problems with defense budget in 1964 prevented substantial sums required from being allocated continuing financial short falls prevented proposed effort from getting off ground this as well as a serious accident in 1969 which caused a partial meltdown in small pilot reactor strengthened opposition against swiss nuclear program switzerland signed treaty on non proliferation of nuclear weapons on 27 november 1969 and its process of ratification first met with resistance of federal department of defense after signing treaty switzerland s policy of pursuing acquiring nuclear weapons was replaced by one of studying acquisition to provide options in case treaty broke down switzerland ratified treaty on 9 march 1977 soon after that switzerland ratified seabed arms control treaty on 30 april 1969 working committee for nuclear issues aaa was created it met 27 times between 26 september 1969 and 25 october 1988 however committee had only a preparatory role as cold war started coming to an end aaa became less relevant on 1 november 1988 federal councillor arnold koller signed dissolution order and aaa ceased to exist on 31 december of that year thus ending 43 year swiss nuclear weapons program nuclear weapons ban on july 7 2017 switzerland voted in favor of treaty on prohibition of nuclear weapons first such international treaty to ban nuclear weapons however in 2018 swiss government changed its position and opposed signing treaty because of security concerns biological and chemical weapons switzerland did not possess biological weapons nor did they see it as in their interest to acquire them thus banning of such weapons was in country s interest switzerland signed biological weapons convention in april 1972 and ratified treaty in 1976 with three reservations country also signed chemical weapons convention in january 1993 and ratified it in march 1995 in 1937 general henri guisan and swiss army high command commissioned a secret program to develop and utilize chemical weapons from 1939 onwards contact poison sulfur mustard was manufactured as well as chloride http www dhs dss ch textes d php in summer of 1940 extensive exercises were held in several cantons using mortars with polychlorinated naphthalene gas in canton of uri alone 14 000 farm cows were poisoned which swiss army then euthanized program also produced 330 tons of mustard gas which proved difficult to store and thus program was halted in 1943 by general guisan who ordered chemical weapons to be burned on grounds of altdorf known today as see also modern history of
