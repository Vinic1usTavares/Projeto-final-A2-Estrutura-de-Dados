new wave of british heavy metal commonly abbreviated as nwobhm was a nationwide musical movement that started in united kingdom in late 1970s and achieved international attention by early 1980s journalist geoff barton coined term in a may 1979 issue of british music newspaper sounds to describe emergence of new heavy metal bands in mid to late 1970s during period of punk rock s decline and dominance of new wave music although encompassing diverse mainstream and underground styles music of nwobhm is best remembered for drawing on heavy metal of 1970s and infusing it with intensity of punk rock to produce fast and aggressive songs diy attitude of new metal bands led to spread of raw sounding self produced recordings and a proliferation of independent record labels song lyrics were usually about escapist themes such as mythology fantasy horror and rock lifestyle nwobhm began as an underground phenomenon growing in parallel to punk and largely ignored by media it was only through promotion of rock dj neal kay and sounds campaigning that it reached public consciousness and gained radio airplay recognition and success in uk movement involved mostly young white male and working class musicians and fans who suffered hardships brought on by rising unemployment for years after 1973 75 recession as a reaction to their bleak reality they created a community separate from mainstream society to enjoy each other s company and their favourite loud music nwobhm was heavily criticised for excessive hype generated by local media in favour of mostly talentless musicians nonetheless it generated a renewal in genre of heavy metal music and furthered progress of heavy metal subculture whose updated behavioural and visual codes were quickly adopted by metal fans worldwide after spread of music to continental europe north america and japan movement spawned perhaps a thousand heavy metal bands but only a few survived advent of mtv and rise of more commercial glam metal in second half of 1980s among them iron maiden and def leppard became international stars and motorhead and saxon had considerable success other groups such as diamond head venom and raven remained underground but were a major influence on successful extreme metal subgenres of late 1980s and 1990s many bands from nwobhm reunited in 2000s and remained active through live performances and new studio albums background social unrest left thumbnail a miners strike rally in 1984 in second half of 1970s united kingdom was in a state of social unrest and widespread poverty as a result of ineffective social politics of both conservative and labour party governments during a three year period of economic recession as a consequence of unemployment rate was exceptionally high especially among working class youth it continued to rise in early 1980s peaking in february 1983 discontent of so many people caused social unrest with frequent strikes and culminated in a series of riots see 1981 brixton riot 1981 toxteth riots during this period mass of young people deprived of prospect of even relatively low skill jobs that were available to previous generations searched for different ways to earn money in music and entertainment businesses explosion of new bands and new musical styles coming from uk in late 1970s was a result of their efforts to make a living in economic depression that hit country before governments of prime minister margaret thatcher desperation and violent reaction of a generation robbed of a safe future are well represented by british punk movement of 1977 1978 whose rebellion against establishment continued diluted in new wave and post punk music of 1980s these self proclaimed punks were politically militant relishing their anarchic attitude and stage practices like pogo dancing they wore short and spiked hairstyles or shaved heads often with safety pins and ripped clothes and considered musical prowess unimportant as long as music was simple and loud however not all working class male youths embraced punk movement some preferred to escape from their grim reality in heavy metal which was equally effective in providing fun stress relief and peer companionship otherwise denied because of their unemployment heavy rock in uk uk was a cradle of first wave of heavy metal which was born at end of 1960s and flowered in early 1970s of many british bands that came to prominence during that period led zeppelin black sabbath and deep purple achieved worldwide success and critical acclaim success of music genre usually called heavy rock at time generated a community of uk fans with strong ties to psychedelia hippie doctrines and biker subculture each of these bands was in crisis in mid to late 1970s led zeppelin were plagued by discord and personal tragedies and had drastically reduced their activities black sabbath finally fired their charismatic but unreliable frontman ozzy osbourne and deep purple disbanded as a consequence whole movement lost much of its momentum and media interest which were refocused on what british writer malc macmillan calls more fashionable or lucrative markets of day such as disco glam mod revival new wave and electronic music just like progressive rock acts and other mainstream music groups of 1970s heavy rock bands were viewed as in words of journalist garry bushell lumbering dinosaurs by a music press infatuated with punk rock and new wave some writers even declared premature demise of heavy metal altogether crisis of british heavy rock giants left space for rise of other rock bands in mid 1970s including queen hawkwind budgie bad company status quo and nazareth all of which had multiple chart entries in uk and had conducted successful international tours british chart results of period show that there was still a vast audience for heavy metal in country and upcoming bands thin lizzy ufo and judas priest also had tangible success and media coverage in late 1970s foreign hard rock acts such as blue oyster cult and kiss from us rush from canada scorpions from germany and especially ac dc from australia climbed british charts in same period motorhead right thumbnail ian lemmy kilmister of motorhead was a reference figure for whole movement band motorhead was founded in 1975 by already experienced musicians their leader ian lemmy kilmister was a former member of space rock band hawkwind larry wallis had played with pink fairies and eddie clarke had been a member of curtis knight s zeus their previous experience is one element which divides critics and fans over whether band belongs to new wave of british heavy metal some believe that band should be considered an inspiration for movement but not part of it because they had signed recording contracts toured country and had chart success before any nwobhm band had stepped out of their local club scene motorhead were also only metal band of period recording songs with veteran bbc radio dj john peel for his peel sessions program and first to reach no 1 in uk albums chart with live album no sleep til hammersmith in june 1981 lemmy himself said nwobhm didn t do us much good because motorhead came along a bit too early for it other critics view motorhead as first significant exponent of movement and first band to fully implement a crossover between punk rock and heavy metal their fast music renunciation of technical virtuosity in favour of sheer loudness and their uncompromising attitude were welcomed equally by punks and heavy metal fans motorhead were supported by many nwobhm bands on tour and they also shared stage with lemmy s friends punk band damned motorhead s musical style became very popular during nwobhm making them a fundamental reference for nascent movement and for musicians of various metal subgenres in following decades characteristics identity and style nwobhm involved both musicians and fans who were largely young male and white and shared class origin ethic and aesthetic values american sociologist deena weinstein in her book heavy metal music and its culture describes rise and growth of movement as achievement of maturity for heavy metal after its birth in early 1970s and before branching out into various subgenres in following years british heavy metal fans commonly known as muthas metalheads or headbangers for violent rhythmic shaking of their heads in time to music dismissed simplistic image of rebellious youth inherited from counterculture of 1960s and psychedelic attachments characteristic of heavy rock in 1970s updating shared principles and codes of heavy metal subculture and definitely separating it from mainstream society left thumbnail patches with band logos and cover art are usually sewn on denim jackets of metalheads towards end of 1970s british metalheads coalesced into a closed community of peers that exalted power and celebrated masculinity according to deena weinstein s analysis their male camaraderie and general absence of women in their ranks did not turn into machismo and misogyny in same article she wrote that british heavy metal is not racist despite its uniformly white performers and its lyrics are devoid of racial references another characteristic of subculture was its latent homophobia less violent but not dissimilar to british skinheads disposition in his book running with devil power gender and madness in heavy metal music robert walser calls it a collective affirmation of heterosexuality and in a journal british sociologist john clarke regards it as a reaction against erosion of traditionally available stereotypes of masculinity headbangers showed little interest in political and social problems finding in each other s company in consumption of beer and in music means to escape their bleak reality for this reason they were often accused of nihilism or escapism in contrast with punks they loved musicianship and made idols of virtuoso guitarists and vocalists viewing live show as full realisation of their status fans were very loyal to music to each other and to bands with whom they shared origins and from whom they required coherence with their values authenticity and continuous accessibility to depart from this strict code meant being marked as a sell out or poseur and being somewhat excluded from community lyrics of song denim and leather by saxon reflect precisely condition of british metalheads in those years of great enthusiasm access to this male dominated world for female musicians and fans was not easy and only women who adapted to their male counterparts standards and codes were accepted as attested by girlschool and rock goddess only notable all female heavy metal bands of that era music philosophy and lifestyle of heavy metal bands and fans were often panned by both left wing critics and conservative public opinion described as senseless ridiculous to limit of self parody and even dangerous for young generation 1984 mockumentary this is spinal tap addressed many idiosyncrasies of british metal bands showing comic sides of that world which external observers would judge absurd instead metal musicians regarded movie s content as much too real visual aspects dress code of british headbangers reflected newly found cohesion of movement and recalled look of 1960s rockers and american bikers common elements were long hair and jeans black or white t shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches following example of judas priest elements of s m fashion entered metal wardrobe of 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers elements of militaria such as bullet belts and insignia were also introduced at this time this style of dress quickly became uniform of metalheads worldwide most bands of nwobhm had same look as their fans and produced rock shows without special visual effects a notable exception was iron maiden which created grisly character eddie head as a stage prop to enrich their performances very early in their career other exceptions were demon cloven hoof and samson which used various props costumes and tricks in their shows while pagan altar and venom became well known for their elaborate scenography inspired by shock rock and satanism musical and lyrical elements nwobhm comprising bands with very different influences and styles was promoted as both a movement and a distinct music genre only in its formative years during mid to late 1970s especially in those early years what characterised flood of new music was its raw sound due in large part to low budget productions but also to amateurish talents of many young bands those young musicians were also linked by a shared inspiration from works of aforementioned successful heavy rock bands of late 1960s and 1970s and kept a sort of continuity with earlier acts whose music had temporarily gone out of fashion but was still thriving underground however media of 1980s and promotional literature of record labels typically placed rock music that employed loud guitars but was not classifiable as punk under blanket term heavy metal subsuming entire spectrum of nwobhm bands within a single music genre following a largely organic and uncalculated impulse many of these new bands infused classic heavy metal with immediacy of pub rock and intensity of punk rock implementing to various degrees crossover of genres started by motorhead in general they shunned ballads de emphasised harmonies and produced shorter songs with fast tempos and a very aggressive sound based on riffs and power chords featuring vocals ranging from high pitched wails to gruff and low growls iron maiden angel witch saxon holocaust tygers of pan tang girlschool tank and more are notable performers of this style which bands such as jaguar raven and venom stretched to produce even more extreme results critics consider this new approach to heavy metal greatest musical accomplishment of nwobhm and an important evolutionary step for genre left thumbnail iron maiden s eddie in a horror sci fi setting horror and science fiction were recurring themes in both lyrics show scenography and cover art for nwobhm bands a style more melodic and more akin to hard rock of bands like rainbow magnum ufo thin lizzy and whitesnake was equally represented during nwobhm music of def leppard praying mantis white spirit demon shy gaskin and many others contained hooks as much as riffs often retained a closer link with blues rock included power ballads and featured keyboards acoustic instruments and melodic and soaring vocals after peak of movement in 1981 this style was favoured by media and gained greater acceptance among british audience it became prevalent when bands usually playing more aggressive style of metal adapted to more popular sound which resembled that of mainstream american acts these changes in musical direction disoriented some fans and led them to reject those bands which were perceived as having compromised key elements of their musical identity in pursuit of success these two styles do not exhaust all of musical influences found in british heavy metal music of early 1980s because many bands were also inspired by progressive rock iron maiden diamond head blitzkrieg demon saracen shiva witchfynde boogie rock saxon vardis spider le and glam rock girl wrathchild doom metal bands pagan altar and witchfinder general were also part of nwobhm and their albums are considered among best examples of that already established subgenre british writer john tucker writes that nwobhm bands were in general fuelled by their first experiences with adult life and their lyrics rolled everything into one big youthful fantasy they usually avoided social and political themes in their lyrics or treated them in a shallow street level way preferring topics from mythology occult fantasy science fiction and horror films songs about romance and lust were rare but frequent lyrics about male bonding and rock lifestyle contain many sexist allusions christian symbolism is often present in lyrics and cover art as is figure of satan used more as a shocking and macabre subject than as antireligious device of 1990s black metal subculture history underground

already playing international arenas when new heavy metal bands composed of very young people debuted in small venues in many cities in uk country s larger venues were usually reserved for chart topping disco music because their use as rock music clubs was considered much less profitable like most british bands in past new groups spent their formative years playing live in clubs pubs dance halls and social circles for low wages this training honed their skills created a local fan base and enabled them to come in contact with managers and record label agents angel witch iron maiden praying mantis and samson from london son of a bitch later saxon from barnsley diamond head from stourbridge marseille from liverpool white spirit from hartlepool witchfynde from derbyshire vardis from wakefield def leppard from sheffield raven and tygers of pan tang from around newcastle and holocaust from edinburgh were most important metal bands founded between 1975 and 1977 that animated club scene in their respective cities and towns first bands of newborn musical movement competed for space in venues with punk outfits often causing clubs to specialise presenting only punk or only rock and hard rock differences in ideology attitude and looks also caused heated rivalries between two audiences what punk and nwobhm musicians had in common was their do it yourself attitude toward music business and consequent practice of self production and self distribution of recorded material in form of audio cassette demos or privately pressed singles aimed initially at local supporters it also led to birth and diffusion of small independent record labels often an extension of record shops and independent recording studios which sometimes produced both punk and metal releases indie labels are considered important to movement s evolution because they removed intrusion of corporate business which had hindered rock music in late 1970s giving local bands chance to experiment with more extreme forms of music while british and international media covered punk intensively new grassroots metal movement remained underground until 1978 largely ignored by popular music magazines such as new musical express face and melody maker and by radio stations news about bands and music circulated by word of mouth and fanzines or through interested djs who travelled country from club to club neal kay was one of those djs he started to work in 1975 at a disco club called bandwagon in kingsbury north west london housed in back room of prince of wales pub and equipped with a massive sound system he transformed his nights at bandwagon into heavy metal soundhouse a spot specialising in hard rock and heavy metal music and a place to listen to albums of established acts and to demos of new bands which circulated among fans through cassette trading nwobhm international heroes lead singer and songwriter sean t wright was a renowned cassette trader at time besides participating in air guitar competitions and watching live shows audience could also vote for kay s selections dj made a weekly heavy metal top 100 list of most requested songs at soundhouse by both newcomers and established bands and sent it to record shops and to music journal sounds only paper that showed interest in developing scene many young musicians realised that they were not alone in playing metal only through that weekly list which included bands from all over country at time geoff barton was a staffer at sounds who wrote features on new up and coming metal bands and was pivotal in directing developing subculture of metalheads with his articles at suggestion of his editor alan lewis and in an attempt to find a common stylistic element in bands music he used term new wave of british heavy metal for first time in his review of a gig on metal crusade tour featuring angel witch iron maiden and samson at music machine in london on 8 may 1979 term soon became identifier for whole movement first wave 1979 1981 compilation albums featuring bands from nascent movement started to circulate issued by neat records heavy metal records and ebony records companies that became leaders in independent metal label market during 1980s fresh outlet of neal kay s chart attention of sounds and many compilations issued by independent labels focused efforts of new bands on producing demos and singles iron maiden s soundhouse tapes is one of best known collections of such demos as barton recalled there were hundreds of these bands maybe even thousands barely a day would go by without a clutch of new nwobhm singles arriving in sounds office tommy vance a bbc radio host took notice of phenomenon and played singles by new metal bands on his late night friday rock show on bbc radio 1 along with john peel s broadcast vance s was only mainstream radio show to feature songs from underground metal acts many of whom were invited to play live at bbc studios under supervision of long time collaborator and producer tony wilson alice s restaurant rock radio a pirate fm radio station in london also championed new bands on air and with their own roadshow in rock pubs and clubs left thumbnail upright steve steaming clark lead guitarist of def leppard extended virtuoso guitar solos were a characteristic of heavy metal music in 1980s despite transition of young bands from being local attractions to touring extensively in uk major record labels a r agents still did not recognise rising new trend thus most new bands signed contracts with small independent labels which could afford only limited printings of singles and albums and usually offered only national distribution many other bands including iron maiden def leppard and diamond head self produced their first releases and sold them through mail order or at concerts saxon were first to sign with an internationally distributed label french carrere records followed by def leppard with phonogram in august 1979 and iron maiden with emi in december 1979 in early 1980 emi tested market with neal kay compiled album metal for muthas and a uk tour of bands that had contributed to compilation eventually signing angel witch who were dropped after release of their first single and ethel frog sounds gave metal for muthas a poor review but album was nevertheless a commercial success and may have been instrumental in encouraging major labels to sign a few more bands a ii z fist white spirit and praying mantis were dropped after release of their debut albums while tygers of pan tang samson more demon and girlschool had more success and lasted longer on major labels line ups new releases by these bands were better produced and some of them with support of intensive tours in uk and europe obtained good chart results best chart performances of that period were for iron maiden s debut album iron maiden and for wheels of steel by saxon which reached no 4 and no 5 on uk albums chart respectively while their singles running free wheels of steel and 747 strangers in night entered uk singles chart top 50 immediate consequence of that success was increased media coverage for metal bands which included appearances on british music tv shows top of pops and old grey whistle test emergence of many new bands in period between 1978 and 1980 was another remarkable effect of promotion of movement to a relevant national phenomenon momentum behind nwobhm also benefited already established bands which reclaimed spotlight with new and acclaimed releases ex deep purple singer ian gillan returned to sing heavy metal with album mr universe in 1979 and was on forefront of british metal scene with his band gillan in following years his former deep purple bandmate ritchie blackmore also climbed uk charts with his hard rock group rainbow s releases down to earth 1979 and difficult to cure 1981 black sabbath recovered and returned to success with albums heaven and hell 1980 and mob

ready an willing at no 6 judas priest s best seller british steel and motorhead s ace of spades at no 4 while back in black by ac dc reached number one as proof of successful revival of british hard rock and metal scene tours and gigs of old and new acts were sold out both at home and in other european countries where movement had spread groups arising from nwobhm were no longer precluded from world tours and were often chosen as opening acts for major bands in arenas and stadiums iron maiden supported kiss in europe in 1980 embarking on their first world tour as headliners in 1981 as well as opening for judas priest and ufo in us def leppard visited us for first time in 1980 for a three month trek supporting pat travers judas priest ted nugent ac dc and sammy hagar saxon opened for judas priest in europe and for rush and ac dc in us in 1981 nwobhm bands were already present on roster of famous reading festival in 1980 and were quickly promoted to headliners for 1981 and 1982 events 1980 edition was also remarkable for violent protests against def leppard whose declared interest in american market was received badly by british fans in addition to reading a new festival called monsters of rock was created in 1980 at castle donington england to showcase only hard rock and heavy metal acts into mainstream 1981 1986 right thumbnail number of beast cover art shows in

and music that present darker themes and images nwobhm eventually found space in newspapers and music magazines other than sounds as journalists caught up with next big thing happening in uk melody maker even published a weekly heavy metal chart based on record shop sales sounds publisher exploited his support of movement to launch first issue of kerrang a colour magazine directed by geoff barton devoted exclusively to hard rock and heavy metal in june 1981 kerrang was an unexpected success and soon became reference magazine for metalheads worldwide followed shortly by american circus and hit parader dutch german metal hammer and british metal forces attention of international media meant more record sales and more world tours for nwobhm bands whose albums entered many foreign charts their attempts to climb british charts culminated in iron maiden s number of beast topping uk albums chart on 10 april 1982 and staying at number 1 for two weeks album charted at number 33 in us where band acquired a reputation as devil worshippers due to album cover s depiction of a hellish scene success of music produced by movement and its passage from underground phenomenon to mainstream genre prompted its main promoter geoff barton to declare nwobhm finished in 1981 he felt disappointed by low quality of new bands and frustrated by ease with which record labels exploited enthusiasm for heavy metal coincidentally in same year bandwagon was closed and prince of wales pub was subsequently demolished to build a restaurant although movement had lost some of its appeal for diehard fans as evidenced by increased popularity of american influenced aor releases on sales based national polls it retained enough vitality to launch a second wave of bands which rose from underground and released their first albums in 1982 and 1983 nwobhm bands had been touring steadily in united states but had not yet received enough fm radio airplay there to make a significant impression on american charts def leppard remedied that releasing pyromania at beginning of 1983 an album with a more melodic and fm friendly approach in comparison with more aggressive sound of their earlier music band s goal of reaching a wider international audience which included many female fans was attained completely in us where pyromania peaked at no 2 on billboard 200 chart behind michael jackson s thriller thanks to a string of hit singles and heavy rotation of their music videos on recently launched mtv album had sold more than six millions copies in us by 1984 and made def leppard superstars overwhelming international success of pyromania induced both american and british bands to follow def leppard s example giving a decisive boost to more commercial and melodic glam metal and heralding end of nwobhm decline left thumbnail upright 0 9 blitzkrieg are one of nwobhm bands which re formed in 2000s uk had been a home for music video pioneers when music video cable channel mtv started broadcasting in 1982 importance of videos abruptly grew changing video from an occasional promotional tool to an indispensable means of reaching an audience mtv filled its programs with many hard rock and heavy metal videos but these were too expensive for bands who either had no recording contract or had signed to small independent labels moreover music videos exalted visual appeal of a band an area where some british metal groups were deficient so nwobhm suffered same decline as other musical phenomena that were based on low budget productions and an underground following many of its leaders such as diamond head tygers of pan tang angel witch and samson were unable to follow up on their initial success their attempts to update their look and sound to match new expectations of wider audience not only failed but also alienated their original fans by mid 1980s image driven sex celebrating glam metal emanating from hollywood s sunset strip spearheaded by van halen and followed by bands such as motley crue quiet riot dokken great white ratt and w a s p quickly replaced other styles of metal in tastes of many british rock fans new jersey act bon jovi and swedish europe thanks to their successful fusion of hard rock and romantic pop also became very popular in uk with former even headlining 1987 monsters of rock festival record companies latched on to more polished glam metal subgenre over nwobhm bands which maintained a fan base elsewhere in europe but found themselves crowded out of uk and us markets by success of these american groups while attention devoted to nwobhm bands waned a new succession of far less mainstream metal subgenres began to emerge and attract many british metalheads power metal and thrash metal both stemming from nwobhm and maintaining much of its ethos were gaining critical acclaim and commercial success in second half of 1980s with their even faster and heavier sound bands such as helloween savatage metallica slayer megadeth and anthrax captured much of market share of those metalheads who were not content with sound or style of more mainstream pop oriented metal bands n w o b h m encyclopedia by malc macmillan lists more than 500 recording bands established in decade between 1975 and 1985 and related to movement probably as many bands launched in same period but never emerged from their local club scene or recorded nothing more than demo tapes or limited pressings of self produced singles disinterest of record labels poor management of bands internal struggles and musical choices that turned off much of their original fan base resulted in most groups disbanding and disappearing by end of decade a few of best known groups such as praying mantis in japan and saxon demon and tokyo blade in mainland europe survived in foreign markets some others namely raven girlschool and grim reaper tried to break through in us market signing with american labels but their attempts were unsuccessful two of more popular bands of movement however went on to considerable lasting success iron maiden has since become one of most commercially successful and influential heavy metal bands of all time even after adopting a more progressive style def leppard became even more successful targeting american mainstream rock market with their more refined hard rock sound revival widespread popularity of internet in late 1990s early 2000s helped nwobhm fans and musicians to reconnect and rekindle their shared enthusiasm nwobhm experienced a minor revival highlighted by good sales of old vinyl and collectibles and by demand for new performances statements of appreciation by metal bands of 1990s success of tribute bands re issues of old albums and production of new thoroughly edited compilations attracted media s attention and encouraged many of original groups to reunite for festival appearances and tours according to macmillan and allmusic reviewer eduardo rivadavia probably most important of those compilation albums was new wave of british heavy metal 79 revisited compiled by metallica s drummer lars ulrich and former sounds and kerrang journalist geoff barton it was released in 1990 as a double cd featuring bands as obscure as hollow ground right through to major acts of era a new publication called classic rock featuring barton and many of writers from kerrang s first run championed nwobhm revival and continues to focus much of its attention on rock acts from 1980s starting in 2000s many reunited bands recorded new albums and revisited their original styles abandoned in second half of 1980s their presence at metal festivals and on international rock club circuit has been constant ever since influences and legacy right thumbnail cronos of venom venom are considered precursors of both black metal and thrash metal nwobhm triggered a renaissance in a stagnant rock genre but took on heavy criticism for excessive local media hype surrounding a legion of typically mediocre musicians detractors think that unlike heavy metal of preceding decades their music was unoriginal and included no classic rock recordings nevertheless these bands and their diverse output offered a blueprint that counterparts across western world would later emulate and expand collision of styles that characterised nwobhm is now seen as key to diversification of heavy metal in second half of 1980s into various subgenres that came to fore in 1990s stardom of def leppard in us provided a catalyst for growth of glam metal just as bands like angel witch witchfynde cloven hoof and especially venom generated music lyrics cover art and attitude that sparked black metal in its various forms in europe and america motorhead iron maiden raven tank venom and several minor groups are viewed as precursors of speed metal and thrash metal two subgenres which carried forward crossover with punk incorporating elements of hardcore while amplifying volume velocity and aggressive tone starting around 1982 distant points such as north america west germany and brazil each became locus of its own distinctive thrash metal scenes east coast and bay area teutonic and brazilian thrash metal their debt to nwobhm was acknowledged for example by metallica s lars ulrich an active fan and avid collector of nwobhm recordings and memorabilia under his influence setlists of metallica s early shows were filled with covers of british metal groups sound of nwobhm even cross pollinated a subgenre of punk as uk 82 street punk bands like discharge blended punk music with elements of metal birth of speed metal in early 1980s was also pivotal for evolution of power metal in latter half of decade as exemplified by helloween from germany and manowar savatage and virgin steele from us since beginning of nwobhm north american bands like anvil riot twisted sister manowar virgin steele rods hellion cirith ungol and had a continuous exchange with other side of atlantic where their music was appreciated by british metalheads in this climate of reciprocity manowar and virgin steele initially signed with british indie label music for nations while twisted sister recorded their first two albums in london sound of japanese bands loudness anthem and other minor groups was also influenced by nwobhm whose british sound engineers were used for their early albums japanese band bow wow even transferred to england to be part of british metal scene germany sweden denmark belgium netherlands france and spain promptly welcomed new british bands and spawned imitators almost immediately acts like accept grave digger sinner and warlock from germany e f band from sweden fate from denmark killer and ostrogoth from belgium picture and bodine from netherlands trust and nightmare from france and baron rojo and angeles del infierno from spain formed between 1978 and 1982 and were heavily influenced by sound of nwobhm many of these bands signed with dutch roadrunner records or with belgian
