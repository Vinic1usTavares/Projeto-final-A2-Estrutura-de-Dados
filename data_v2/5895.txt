sir rudolf ernst peierls 5 june 1907 19 september 1995 was a jewish german born british physicist who played a major role in manhattan project and tube alloys britain s nuclear programme his obituary in physics today described him as a major player in drama of eruption of nuclear physics into world affairs peierls studied physics at university of berlin at university of munich under arnold sommerfeld university of leipzig under werner heisenberg and eth zurich under wolfgang pauli after receiving his dphil from leipzig in 1929 he became an assistant to pauli in zurich in 1932 he was awarded a rockefeller fellowship which he used to study in rome under enrico fermi and then at cavendish laboratory at university of cambridge under ralph h fowler due to adolf hitler s rise to power in germany he elected to not return home in 1933 but to remain in britain where he worked with hans bethe at university of manchester then at mond laboratory at cambridge in 1937 mark oliphant newly appointed australian professor of physics at university of birmingham recruited him for a new chair there in applied mathematics in march 1940 peierls co authored frisch peierls memorandum with otto robert frisch this short paper was first to set out that one could construct an atomic bomb from a small amount of fissile uranium 235 until then it had been assumed that such a bomb would require many tons of uranium and consequently was impractical to build and use paper was pivotal in igniting interest of first british and later american authorities in nuclear weapons he was also responsible for recruitment of his compatriot klaus fuchs to work on tube alloys as british nuclear weapons project was called which resulted in peierls falling under suspicion when fuchs was exposed as a spy for soviet union in 1950 after war peierls returned to university of birmingham where he worked until 1963 and then was wykeham professor of physics at university of oxford until he retired in 1974 at birmingham he worked on nuclear forces scattering quantum field theories collective motion in nuclei transport theory and statistical mechanics and was a consultant to atomic energy research establishment at harwell he received many awards including a knighthood in 1968 and wrote several books including quantum theory of solids laws of nature 1955 surprises in theoretical physics 1979 more surprises in theoretical physics 1991 and an autobiography bird of passage 1985 concerned with nuclear weapons he had helped to unleash he worked on bulletin of atomic scientists was president of atomic scientists association in uk and was involved in pugwash movement early life rudolf ernst peierls was born in berlin suburb of youngest of three children of heinrich peierls an electrical engineer from a family of jewish merchants who was managing director of a cable factory of allgemeine gesellschaft aeg and his first wife elisabeth weigert rudolf had an older brother alfred and an older sister annie his mother died from hodgkin s lymphoma in 1921 and his father married else hermann sister in law of playwright ludwig fulda family was jewish but assimilated and peierls and his siblings were baptised as lutherans when he came of age peierls left church peierls commenced school a year late because he needed glasses and his parents did not trust him not to lose them or break them after two years at local preparatory school he entered his local gymnasium where he spent next nine years passing his abitur examinations in 1925 he wanted to study engineering but his parents who doubted his practical abilities suggested physics instead he entered university of berlin where he listened to lectures by max planck walther bothe and walther nernst fellow students included kurt hirsch and kate sperling physics laboratory classes were overcrowded so first year students were encouraged to take theoretical physics courses instead peierls found that he liked subject in 1926 peierls decided to transfer to university of munich where arnold sommerfeld who was considered to be greatest teacher of theoretical physics was fellow students there included hans bethe hermann bruck and william v houston at time bohr sommerfeld theory was being overturned by new quantum mechanics of werner heisenberg and paul dirac in 1928 sommerfeld set off on a world tour on his advice peierls moved to university of leipzig where heisenberg had been appointed to a chair in 1927 heisenberg set peierls a research project on ferromagnetism it was known that this was caused by spin of electrons in metal aligning but reason for this was unknown heisenberg suspected that it was caused by a quantum mechanical effect caused by pauli exclusion principle peierls was unable to develop theory but work on hall effect was more productive anomalous hall effect could not be explained with classical theory of metals and heisenberg sensed an opportunity to demonstrate that quantum mechanics could explain it peierls was able to do so resulting in his first published paper heisenberg left in 1929 to lecture in america china japan and india and on his recommendation peierls moved on to eth zurich where he studied under wolfgang pauli pauli set him a problem of investigating vibration of atoms in a crystal lattice peierls explored and named phenomenon of umklapp scattering he submitted this work as his dphil thesis zur theorie der in on kinetic theory of heat conduction in crystals which was accepted by university of leipzig in 1929 his theory made specific predictions of behaviour of metals at very low temperatures but another twenty years would pass before techniques were developed to confirm them experimentally early career peierls accepted an offer from pauli to become his assistant vice felix bloch lev landau was there at this time on a scholarship from government of soviet union and peierls and landau became friends they collaborated on deriving a series of wave equations similar to schrodinger equation for photons unfortunately their equations while complicated were nonsensical in 1930 peierls travelled to netherlands to meet hans kramers and to copenhagen to meet niels bohr in august 1930 pauli and peierls attended a physics congress in odessa and met a young physics graduate eugenia genia who like landau came from leningrad since he did not speak russian and she did not speak german they conversed in english during a subsequent visit by peierls to lecture in leningrad they were married on 15 march 1931 however she had to wait for a passport and exit visa they finally left for zurich that summer they had four children gaby ellen b 1933 ronald frank b 1935 catherine kitty b 1948 and joanna b 1949 peierls assisted egon in understanding force required to move a dislocation which would be expanded on by frank nabarro and called peierls nabarro force in 1929 he studied solid state physics in zurich under tutelage of heisenberg and pauli his early work on quantum physics led to theory of positive carriers to explain thermal and electrical conductivity behaviours of semiconductors he was a pioneer of concept of holes in semiconductors 1 r e peierls zur theorie der 1929 2 r e peierls zur theorie des hall 1929 english translation of these 2 papers can be found in selected scientific papers of sir rudolf peierls edited by r h dalitz sir rudolf peierls world scientific 1997 he established zones before leon brillouin despite brillouin s name being currently attached to idea and applied it to phonons doing this he discovered boltzmann equations for phonons and umklapp process he submitted a paper on subject for his habilitation acquiring right to teach at german universities physics today noted that his many papers on electrons in metals have now passed so deeply into literature that it is hard to identify his contribution to conductivity in magnetic fields and to concept of a hole in theory of electrons in solids academic in exile in 1932 peierls was awarded a rockefeller fellowship to study abroad which he used to study in rome under enrico fermi and then at cavendish laboratory at university of cambridge in england under ralph h fowler in rome peierls completed two papers on electronic band structure in which he introduced peierls substitution and derived a general expression for in metals at low temperatures this provided an explanation of hitherto mysterious properties of bismuth in which properties were more pronounced than in other metals thumb left poynting physics building at university of birmingham its mode of construction helped give rise to phrase redbrick university due to adolf hitler s rise to power in germany he elected to not return home in 1933 but to remain in britain he declined an offer from otto stern of a position at university of hamburg granted leave to remain in britain he worked at university of manchester with funding from academic assistance council which had been set up to help academic refugees from germany and other fascist countries most of his immediate family also left germany his brother and his family settling in britain and his sister and her family along with his father and stepmother moved to united states where his uncle siegfried lived peierls collaborated with bethe on photodisintegration and statistical mechanics of alloys when challenged by james chadwick their results still serve as basis for mean field theories of structural phase changes in complete alloys although most of his work continued to be about electron theory of metals he also looked at dirac s hole theory and co wrote a paper with bethe on neutrino university of manchester awarded him a d sc degree moving back to cambridge he worked with david at mond laboratory on superconductivity and liquid helium to allow him to lecture in accordance with its rules st johns college cambridge awarded him an ex officio m a degree in 1936 mark oliphant was appointed professor of physics at university of birmingham and he approached peierls about a new chair in applied mathematics that he was creating there applied mathematics being what would today be called theoretical physics peierls got job despite competition from harrie massey and appointment at last gave peierls a secure permanent position his students included fred hoyle and p l kapur a student from india with kapur he derived dispersion formula for nuclear reactions originally given in perturbation theory by gregory breit and eugene wigner but now included generalising conditions this is now known as kapur peierls derivation it is still used but in 1947 wigner and developed a more widely used alternative method in 1938 peierls paid visits to copenhagen where he collaborated with bohr and george placzek on a paper on what is now known as bohr peierls placzek relation second world war broke out before it could be published but drafts were circulated for comment and it became one of most cited unpublished papers of all time second world war frisch peierls memorandum thumb right university of birmingham poynting physics building blue plaque after outbreak of second world war in september 1939 peierls started working on nuclear weapons research with otto robert frisch a fellow refugee from germany ironically they were excluded from work on radar at university of birmingham because it was considered too secret for scientists who were enemy aliens peierls was naturalised as a british subject on 27 march 1940 he was eager to participate in fight against fascism and militarism but only organisation that would accept him was auxiliary fire service he accepted an offer from university of toronto to send his two children to live with a family in canada in february and march 1940 peierls and frisch co authored frisch peierls memorandum which peierls typed this short paper was first to establish that an atomic bomb could be created from a small amount of fissile uranium 235 based on information at hand they calculated that less than 1 kg would be required true figure for critical mass is about four times as large but until then it had been assumed that such a bomb would require many tons of uranium and consequently was impractical to build and use they went on to estimate size of explosion and its physical military and political effects frisch peierls memorandum was pivotal in igniting interest of first british and later american authorities in atomic weapons in 1941 its findings made their way to united states through report of maud committee an important trigger in establishment of manhattan project and subsequent development of atomic bomb with frisch peierls memorandum and maud committee report british and american scientists were able to begin thinking about how to create a bomb not whether it was possible as enemy aliens frisch and peierls were initially excluded from maud committee but absurdity of this was soon recognised and they were made members of its technical subcommittee this did not mean that they were cleared for radar work when oliphant made services of his secretary available for typing up s and frisch s papers for maud committee in september 1940 they were not allowed to enter nuffield building where she worked so peierls submitted them for typing by dictaphone on wax cylinders frisch and peierls thought at first that uranium enrichment was best achieved though thermal diffusion but as difficulties with this approach became more apparent they switched to gaseous diffusion bringing in a fellow refugee from germany franz simon as an expert on subject peierls also recruited yet another refugee from germany klaus fuchs as his assistant in may 1941 manhattan project as a result of maud committee s findings a new directorate known as tube alloys was created to coordinate nuclear weapons development effort sir john anderson lord president of council became minister responsible and wallace akers from imperial chemical industries ici was appointed director of tube alloys peierls chadwick and simon were appointed to its technical committee which was chaired by akers its first meeting in november 1941 was attended by two american visitors harold urey and george b pegram later that year peierls flew to united states where he visited urey and fermi in new york arthur h compton in chicago robert oppenheimer in berkeley and jesse beams in charlottesville virginia when george kistiakowsky argued that a nuclear weapon would do little damage as most of energy would be expended heating air peierls fuchs geoffrey taylor and j g worked out hydrodynamics to refute this signing of quebec agreement on 19 august 1943 merged tube alloys with manhattan project akers had already cabled london with instructions that chadwick peierls oliphant and simon should leave immediately for north america to join british mission to manhattan project and they arrived day agreement was signed simon and peierls were attached to kellex corporation which was engaged in k 25 project designing and building american gaseous diffusion plant while kellex was located in woolworth building peierls simon and nicholas kurti had their offices in british supply mission on wall street they were joined there by tony skyrme and frank kearton who arrived in march 1944 kurti returned to england in april 1944 and kearton in september peierls moved on to los alamos laboratory in february 1944 skyrme followed in july and fuchs in august at los alamos british mission was fully integrated into laboratory and british scientists worked in most of its divisions only being excluded from plutonium chemistry and metallurgy when oppenheimer appointed bethe as head of laboratory s prestigious theoretical t division he offended edward teller who was given his own group tasked with investigating teller s super bomb oppenheimer then wrote to director of manhattan project brigadier general leslie r groves jr requesting that peierls be sent to take teller s place in t division peierls arrived from new york on 8 february 1944 and subsequently succeeded chadwick as head of british mission at los alamos peierls also became leader of t 1 implosion group and so was responsible for design of explosive lenses used in implosion type nuclear weapon to focus an explosion onto a spherical shape he sent regular reports to chadwick head of british mission to manhattan project in washington dc when groves found out he asked peierls to send him reports too peierls was one of those present at trinity nuclear test on 16 july 1945 he returned to england in january 1946 for his services to nuclear weapons project he was appointed a commander of order of british empire in 1946 new year honours and was awarded us medal of freedom with silver palm in 1946 espionage peierls was responsible for recruitment of fuchs to british project an action which was to result in peierls falling under suspicion when fuchs was exposed as a soviet spy in 1950 in 1999 spectator garnered outrage from peierls s family when it published an article by journalist nicholas farrell that alleged that peierls was a spy for soviet union article was based on information supplied by intelligence historian nigel west who identified peierls as spy codenamed fogel and later pers in venona intercepts and his wife genia as spy codenamed tina however association of tina with genia did not fit with what was known about tina and she was conclusively revealed to be melita norwood in 1999 nor did peierls fit pers as latter worked at clinton engineer works whereas peierls did not there were good reasons for postwar intelligence agencies to suspect peierls he had not only recruited fuchs and served as his sponsor on recruitment and security matters but had pressed authorities for fuchs to be given a full security clearance without which he could not have assisted peierls in his work fuchs lived with peierls family for a time peierls had a russian wife as did his brother and he maintained close contact with colleagues in soviet union before and after second world war while not a communist like fuchs peierls was known to have left wing political views and had colleagues with similar views he was denied a visa to visit united states to attend a nuclear physics conference in chicago in 1951 a similar request following year was granted but in 1957 americans expressed concerns about him indicating that they were unwilling to share information with atomic energy research establishment at harwell while he remained as a consultant post war physicists were in demand after war and peierls received offers from several universities he seriously considered an offer of a position at cambridge from william lawrence bragg but decided to return to birmingham he worked on nuclear forces scattering quantum field theories collective motion in nuclei transport theory and statistical mechanics peierls had largely left solid state physics behind when in 1953 he began collecting his lecture notes on subject into a book reconsidering way that atoms in metal crystals are arranged he noted an instability this became known as peierls transition peierls built up physics department at birmingham by attracting high quality researchers these included gerald e brown max krook tony skyrme dick dalitz freeman dyson stuart butler walter marshal stanley mandelstam and elliott h lieb an undergraduate school of mathematical physics was created peierls delivered lectures on quantum mechanics a subject that had not been taught at birmingham before war in 1946 peierls became a consultant to atomic energy research establishment at harwell after fuchs was dismissed from his position there as head of theoretical physics division in 1950 maurice pryce acted in position in a part time capacity but when he went to america for a year on sabbatical peierls took his place position was finally filled permanently by brian flowers peierls resigned from harwell in 1957 due to what he saw as a lack of openness in security vetting at request of americans which he felt indicated a lack of trust in him on part of senior staff but he was invited to rejoin in 1960 and did so in 1963 remaining as a consultant for another 30 years peierls became wykeham professor of physics at university of oxford in 1963 he remained there until he retired in 1974 he wrote several books including quantum theory of solids 1955 laws of nature 1955 surprises in theoretical physics 1979 more surprises in theoretical physics 1991 and an autobiography bird of passage 1985 concerned with nuclear weapons he had helped to unleash he worked on bulletin of atomic scientists was president of atomic scientists association in uk and was involved in pugwash movement and freeze now known as genia died on 26 october 1986 peierls remained active although his eyesight deteriorated in 1994 he suffered a combination of health problems including heart kidney and lung problems and relocated himself to a nursing home near oxfordshire he liked to read scientific papers in enlarged script on a computer screen during 1995 his health continued to decline and he required regular kidney dialysis sessions at churchill hospital where he died on 19 september 1995 key contributions over a long career peierls contributed a number of fundamental results to our understanding of quantum physics some of which are essential parts of any quantum physics curriculum amongst these are discovery of umklapp process bohr peierls placzek relation or optical theorem which relates forward amplitude in a quantum scattering process to total scattering cross section peierls theory of defects in quantum theory of crystals notion of peierls stress peierls method of quantization and peierls transition instability in 1 d metals honours peierls was knighted in 1968 birthday honours
