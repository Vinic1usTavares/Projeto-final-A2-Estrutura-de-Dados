james clerk maxwell 13 june 1831 5 november 1879 was a scottish scientist in field of mathematical physics his most notable achievement was to formulate classical theory of electromagnetic radiation bringing together for first time electricity magnetism and light as different manifestations of same phenomenon maxwell s equations for electromagnetism have been called second great unification in physics after first one realised by isaac newton with publication of a dynamical theory of electromagnetic field in 1865 maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at speed of light he proposed that light is an in same medium that is cause of electric and magnetic phenomena this article accompanied an 8 december 1864 presentation by maxwell to royal society his statement that light and magnetism are affections of same substance is at page 499 unification of light and electrical phenomena led his prediction of existence of radio waves maxwell is also regarded as a founder of modern field of electrical engineering tapan k sakar magdalena salazar palma dipak l sengupta james clerk maxwell founder of electrical engineering 2010 second region 8 ieee conference on history of communications ieee he helped develop maxwell boltzmann distribution a statistical means of describing aspects of kinetic theory of gases he is also known for presenting first durable colour photograph in 1861 and for his foundational work on analysing rigidity of rod and joint frameworks trusses like those in many bridges his discoveries helped usher in era of modern physics laying foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics many physicists regard maxwell as 19th century scientist having greatest influence on 20th century physics his contributions to science are considered by many to be of same magnitude as those of isaac newton and albert einstein in millennium poll a survey of 100 most prominent physicists maxwell was voted third greatest physicist of all time behind only newton and einstein on centenary of maxwell s birthday einstein described maxwell s work as most profound and most fruitful that physics has experienced since time of newton einstein when he visited university of cambridge in 1922 was told by his host that he had done great things because he stood on newton s shoulders einstein replied no

robert cay and sister of john cay his birthplace now houses a museum operated by james clerk maxwell foundation his father was a man of comfortable means of clerk family of penicuik holders of baronetcy of clerk of penicuik his father s brother was 6th baronet he had been born john clerk adding maxwell to his own after he inherited as an infant in 1793 middlebie estate a maxwell property in dumfriesshire james was a first cousin of both artist jemima blackburn daughter of his father s sister and civil engineer william dyce cay son of his mother s brother cay and maxwell were close friends and cay acted as his best man when maxwell married maxwell s parents met and married when they were well into their thirties his mother was nearly 40 when he was born they had had one earlier child a daughter named elizabeth who died in infancy when maxwell was young his family moved to glenlair in which his parents had built on estate which comprised all indications suggest that maxwell had maintained an unquenchable curiosity from an early age by age of three everything that moved shone or made a noise drew question what s go o that in a passage added to a letter from his father to his sister in law jane cay in 1834 his mother described this innate sense of inquisitiveness education 1839 1847 recognising boy s potential maxwell s mother frances took responsibility for his early education which in victorian era was largely job of woman of house at eight he could recite long passages of milton and whole of 119th psalm 176 verses indeed his knowledge of scripture was already detailed he could give chapter and verse for almost any quotation from psalms his mother was taken ill with abdominal cancer and after an unsuccessful operation died in december 1839 when he was eight years old his education was then overseen by his father and his father s sister in law jane both of whom played pivotal roles in his life his formal schooling began unsuccessfully under guidance of a 16 year old hired tutor little is known about young man hired to instruct maxwell except that he treated younger boy harshly chiding him for being slow and wayward tutor was dismissed in november 1841

forces of inspiration new scientist pages 712 3 via google books alt thumb edinburgh academy where maxwell was educated maxwell was sent to prestigious edinburgh academy he lodged during term times at house of his aunt isabella during this time his passion for drawing was encouraged by his older cousin jemima 10 year old maxwell having been raised in isolation on his father s countryside estate did not fit in well at school first year had been full obliging him to join second year with classmates a year his senior his mannerisms and galloway accent struck other boys as rustic having arrived on his first day of school wearing a pair of homemade shoes and a tunic he earned unkind nickname of he never seemed to resent epithet bearing it without complaint for many years social isolation at academy ended when he met lewis campbell and peter guthrie tait two boys of a similar age who were to become notable scholars later in life they remained lifelong friends maxwell was fascinated by geometry at an early age rediscovering regular polyhedra before he received any formal instruction despite winning school s scripture biography prize in his second year his academic work remained unnoticed until at age of 13 he won school s mathematical medal and first prize for both english and poetry maxwell s interests ranged far beyond school syllabus and he did not pay particular attention to examination performance he wrote his first scientific paper at age of 14 in it he described a mechanical means of drawing mathematical curves with a piece of twine and properties of ellipses cartesian ovals and related curves with more than two foci his work oval curves was presented to royal society of edinburgh by james forbes a professor of natural philosophy at university of edinburgh because maxwell was deemed too young to present work himself work was not entirely original since rene descartes had also examined properties of such multifocal ellipses in 17th century but he had simplified their construction university of edinburgh 1847 1850 left thumb old college university of edinburgh maxwell left academy in 1847 at age 16 and began attending classes at university of edinburgh he had opportunity to attend university of cambridge but decided after his first term to complete full course of his undergraduate studies at edinburgh academic staff of university included some highly regarded names his first year tutors included sir william hamilton who lectured him on logic and metaphysics philip kelland on mathematics and james forbes on natural philosophy he did not find his classes at university demanding and was therefore able to immerse himself in private study during free time at university and particularly when back home at glenlair there he would experiment with improvised chemical electric and magnetic apparatus however his chief concerns regarded properties of polarised light he constructed shaped blocks of gelatine subjected them to various stresses and with a pair of polarising prisms given to him by william nicol viewed coloured fringes that had developed within jelly through this practice he discovered which is a means of determining stress distribution within physical structures at age 18 maxwell contributed two papers for transactions of royal society of edinburgh one of these on equilibrium of elastic solids laid foundation for an important discovery later in his life which was temporary double refraction produced in viscous liquids by shear stress his other paper was rolling curves and just as with paper oval curves that he had written at edinburgh academy he was again considered too young to stand at rostrum to present it himself paper was delivered to royal society by his tutor kelland instead university of cambridge 1850 1856 thumb right upright a young maxwell at trinity college cambridge he is holding one of his colour wheels in october 1850 already an accomplished mathematician maxwell left scotland for university of cambridge he initially attended peterhouse however before end of his first term transferred to trinity where he believed it would be easier to obtain a fellowship at trinity he was elected to elite secret society known as cambridge apostles maxwell s intellectual understanding of his christian faith and of science grew rapidly during his cambridge years he joined apostles an exclusive debating society of intellectual elite where through his essays he sought to work out this understanding extent to which maxwell ploughed up his christian beliefs and put them to intellectual test can be judged only incompletely from his writings but there is plenty of evidence especially from his undergraduate days that he did deeply examine his faith certainly his knowledge of bible was remarkable so his confidence in scriptures was not based on ignorance in summer of his third year maxwell spent some time at suffolk home of rev c b tayler uncle of a classmate g w h tayler love of god shown by family impressed maxwell particularly after he was nursed back from ill health by minister and his wife on his return to cambridge maxwell writes to his recent host a chatty and affectionate letter including following testimony in november 1851 maxwell studied under william hopkins whose success in nurturing mathematical genius had earned him nickname of senior wrangler maker in 1854 maxwell graduated from trinity with a degree in mathematics he scored second highest in final examination coming behind edward routh and earning himself title of second wrangler he was later declared equal with routh in more exacting ordeal of smith s prize examination immediately after earning his degree maxwell read his paper on transformation of surfaces by bending to cambridge philosophical society this is one of few purely mathematical papers he had written demonstrating his growing stature as a mathematician maxwell decided to remain at trinity after graduating and applied for a fellowship which was a process that he could expect to take a couple of years buoyed by his success as a research student he would be free apart from some tutoring and examining duties to pursue scientific interests at his own leisure nature and perception of colour was one such interest which he had begun at university of edinburgh while he was a student of forbes with coloured spinning tops invented by forbes maxwell was able to demonstrate that white light would result from a mixture of red green and blue light his paper experiments on colour laid out principles of colour combination and was presented to royal society of edinburgh in march 1855 maxwell was this time able to deliver it himself maxwell was made a fellow of trinity on 10 october 1855 sooner than was norm and was asked to prepare lectures on hydrostatics and optics and to set examination papers following february he was urged by forbes to apply for newly vacant chair of natural philosophy at marischal college aberdeen his father assisted him in task of preparing necessary references but died on 2 april at glenlair before either knew result of maxwell s candidacy he accepted professorship at aberdeen leaving cambridge in november 1856 marischal college aberdeen 1856 1860 thumb left maxwell proved that rings of saturn were made of numerous small particles 25 year old maxwell was a good 15 years younger than any other professor at marischal he engaged himself with his new responsibilities as head of a department devising syllabus and preparing lectures he committed himself to lecturing 15 hours a week including a weekly pro bono lecture to local working men s college he lived in aberdeen with his cousin william dyce cay a scottish civil engineer during six months of academic year and spent summers at glenlair which he had inherited from his father thumb upright james and katherine maxwell 1869 he focused his attention on a problem that had eluded scientists for 200 years nature of saturn s rings it was unknown how they could remain stable without breaking up drifting away or crashing into saturn problem took on a particular resonance at that time because st john s college cambridge had chosen it as topic for 1857 adams prize maxwell devoted two years to studying problem proving that a regular solid ring could not be stable while a fluid ring would be forced by wave action to break up into blobs since neither was observed he concluded that rings must be composed of numerous small particles he called brick bats each independently orbiting saturn maxwell was awarded ps130 adams prize in 1859 for his essay on stability of motion of saturn s rings he was only entrant to have made enough headway to submit an entry his work was so detailed and convincing that when george biddell airy read it he commented it is one of most remarkable applications of mathematics to physics that i have ever seen it was considered final word on issue until direct observations by voyager flybys of 1980s confirmed maxwell s prediction that rings were composed of particles it is now understood however that rings particles are not stable at all being pulled by gravity onto saturn rings are expected to vanish entirely over next 300 million years in 1857 maxwell befriended reverend daniel dewar who was then principal of marischal through him maxwell met dewar s daughter katherine mary dewar they were engaged in february 1858 and married in aberdeen on 2 june 1858 on marriage record maxwell is listed as professor of natural philosophy in marischal

comparatively little is known of katherine although it is known that she helped in his lab and worked on experiments in viscosity maxwell s biographer and friend lewis campbell adopted an uncharacteristic reticence on subject of katherine though describing their married life as one of unexampled devotion in 1860 marischal college merged with neighbouring king s college to form university of aberdeen there was no room for two professors of natural philosophy so maxwell despite his scientific reputation found himself laid off he was unsuccessful in applying for forbes s recently vacated chair at edinburgh post instead going to tait maxwell was granted chair of natural philosophy at king s college london instead after recovering from a near fatal bout of smallpox in 1860 he moved to london with his wife king s college london 1860 1865 thumb left 400 px commemoration of maxwell s equations at king s college one of three identical ieee milestone plaques others being at maxwell s birthplace in edinburgh and family home at glenlair maxwell s time at king s was probably most productive of his career he was awarded royal society s rumford medal in 1860 for his work on colour and was later elected to society in 1861 this period of his life would see him display world s first light fast colour photograph further develop his ideas on viscosity of gases and propose a system of defining physical quantities now known as dimensional analysis maxwell would often attend lectures at royal institution where he came into regular contact with michael faraday relationship between two men could not be described as being close because faraday was 40 years maxwell s senior and showed signs of senility they nevertheless maintained a strong respect for each other s talents thumb blue plaque 16 palace gardens terrace kensington maxwell s home 1860 1865 this time is especially noteworthy for advances maxwell made in fields of electricity and magnetism he examined nature of both electric and magnetic fields in his two part paper on physical lines of force which was published in 1861 in it he provided a conceptual model for electromagnetic induction consisting of tiny spinning cells of magnetic flux two more parts were later added to and published in that same paper in early 1862 in first additional part he discussed nature of electrostatics and displacement current in second additional part he dealt with rotation of plane of polarisation of light in a magnetic field a phenomenon that had been discovered by faraday and is now known as faraday effect later years 1865 1879 thumb gravestone at parton kirk galloway of james clerk maxwell his parents and his wife thumb this memorial stone to james clerk maxwell stands on a green in front of church beside war memorial at parton galloway in 1865 maxwell resigned chair at king s college london and returned to glenlair with katherine in his paper on governors 1868 he mathematically described behaviour of governors devices that control speed of steam engines thereby establishing theoretical basis of control engineering maxwell j c 1868 on governors from proceedings of royal society no 100 in his paper on reciprocal figures frames and diagrams of forces 1870 he discussed rigidity of various designs of lattice he wrote textbook theory of heat 1871 and treatise matter and motion 1876 maxwell was also first to make explicit use of dimensional analysis in 1871 in 1871 he returned to cambridge to become first cavendish professor of physics maxwell was put in charge of development of cavendish laboratory supervising every step in progress of building and of purchase of collection of apparatus one of maxwell s last great contributions to science was editing with copious original notes of research of henry cavendish from which it appeared that cavendish researched amongst other things such questions as density of earth and composition of water maxwell died in cambridge of abdominal cancer on 5 november 1879 at age of 48 his mother had died at same age of same type of cancer minister who regularly visited him in his last weeks was astonished at his lucidity and immense power and scope of his memory but comments more particularly as death approached maxwell told a cambridge colleague maxwell is buried at parton kirk near castle douglas in galloway close to where he grew up extended biography life of james clerk maxwell by his former and lifelong friend professor lewis campbell was published in 1882 his collected works were issued in two volumes by cambridge university press in 1890 personal life as a great lover of scottish poetry maxwell memorised poems and wrote his own best known is rigid body sings closely based on comin through rye by robert burns which he apparently used to sing while accompanying himself on a guitar it has opening lines a collection of his poems was published by his friend lewis campbell in 1882 descriptions of maxwell remark upon his remarkable intellectual qualities being matched by social awkwardness maxwell was an evangelical presbyterian and in his later years became an elder of church of scotland maxwell s religious beliefs and related activities have been focus of a number of papers attending both church of scotland his father s denomination and episcopalian his mother s denomination services as a child maxwell later underwent an evangelical conversion in april 1853 one facet of this conversion may have aligned him with an position scientific legacy electromagnetism thumb left a postcard from maxwell to peter tait maxwell had studied and commented on electricity and magnetism as early as 1855 when his paper on faraday s lines of force was read to cambridge philosophical society paper presented a simplified model of faraday s work and how electricity and magnetism are related he reduced all of current knowledge into a linked set of differential equations with 20 equations in 20 variables this work was later published as on physical lines of force in march 1861 around 1862 while lecturing at king s college maxwell calculated that speed of propagation of an electromagnetic field is approximately that of speed of light see speed of light electromagnetic constants he considered this to be more than just a coincidence commenting we can scarcely avoid conclusion that light consists in transverse undulations of same medium which is cause of electric and magnetic phenomena working on problem further maxwell showed that equations predict existence of waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that travel through empty space at a speed that could be predicted from simple electrical experiments using data available at time maxwell obtained a velocity of in his 1864 paper a dynamical theory of electromagnetic field maxwell wrote agreement of results seems to show that light and magnetism are affections of same substance and that light is an electromagnetic disturbance propagated through field according to electromagnetic laws his famous twenty equations in their modern form of four partial differential equations first appeared in fully developed form in his textbook a treatise on electricity and magnetism in 1873 most of this work was done by maxwell at glenlair during period between holding his london post and his taking up cavendish chair maxwell expressed electromagnetism in algebra of quaternions and made electromagnetic potential centrepiece of his theory in 1881 oliver heaviside replaced maxwell s electromagnetic potential field by force fields as centrepiece of electromagnetic theory heaviside reduced complexity of maxwell s theory down to four differential equations known now collectively as maxwell s laws or maxwell s equations according to heaviside electromagnetic potential field was arbitrary and needed to be murdered b j hunt 1991 maxwellians pages 165 6 cornell university press use of scalar and vector potentials is now standard in solution of maxwell s equations a few years later there was a debate between heaviside and peter guthrie tait about relative merits of vector analysis and quaternions result was realisation that there was no need for greater physical insights provided by quaternions if theory was purely local and vector analysis became commonplace maxwell was proven correct and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics maxwell also introduced concept of electromagnetic field in comparison to force lines that faraday described by understanding propagation of electromagnetism as a field emitted by active particles maxwell could advance his work on light at that time maxwell believed that propagation of light required a medium for waves dubbed luminiferous aether over time existence of such a medium permeating all space and yet apparently undetectable by mechanical means proved impossible to reconcile with experiments such as michelson morley experiment moreover it seemed to require an absolute frame of reference in which equations were valid with distasteful result that equations changed form for a moving observer these difficulties inspired albert einstein to formulate theory of special relativity in process einstein dispensed with requirement of a stationary luminiferous aether colour vision thumb first durable colour photographic image demonstrated by james clerk maxwell in an 1861 lecture along with most physicists of time maxwell had a strong interest in psychology following in steps of isaac newton and thomas young he was particularly interested in study of colour vision from 1855 to 1872 maxwell published at intervals a series of investigations concerning perception of colour colour blindness and colour theory and was awarded rumford medal for on theory of colour vision isaac newton had demonstrated using prisms that white lights such as sunlight are composed of a number of monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights hence paradox that puzzled physicists of time two complex lights composed of more than one monochromatic light could look alike but be physically different called thomas young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in eyes which he proposed to be threefold trichromatic colour theory maxwell used recently developed linear algebra to prove young s theory any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights in fact by any set of three different lights he demonstrated that to be case inventing colour matching experiments and maxwell was also interested in applying his theory of colour perception namely in colour photography stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour then colour photographs could be produced with a set of three coloured filters in course of his 1855 paper maxwell proposed that if three black and white photographs of a scene were taken through red green and blue filters and transparent prints of images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters when superimposed on screen result would be perceived by human eye as a complete reproduction of all colours in scene this thought experiment is described on pages 283 284 short wavelength filter is specified as violet but during 19th century violet could be used to describe a deep violet blue such as colour of cobalt glass during an 1861 royal institution lecture on colour theory maxwell presented world s first demonstration of colour photography by this principle of three colour analysis and synthesis thomas sutton inventor of single lens reflex camera took picture he photographed a tartan ribbon three times through red green and blue filters also making a fourth photograph through a yellow filter which according to maxwell s account was not used in demonstration because sutton s photographic plates were insensitive to red and barely sensitive to green results of this pioneering experiment were far from perfect it was remarked in published account of lecture that if red and green images had been as fully photographed as blue it would have been a truly coloured image of riband by finding photographic materials more sensitive to less refrangible rays representation of colours of objects might be greatly improved researchers in 1961 concluded that seemingly impossible partial success of red filtered exposure was due to ultraviolet light which is strongly reflected by some red dyes not entirely blocked by red filter used and within range of sensitivity of wet collodion process sutton employed kinetic theory and thermodynamics thumb right maxwell s demon a thought experiment where entropy decreases thumb maxwell s sketch of three dimensional thermodynamic surface later named after him letter to thomson 8 july 1875 maxwell also investigated kinetic theory of gases originating with daniel bernoulli this theory was advanced by successive labours of john john james waterston james joule and particularly rudolf clausius to such an extent as to put its general accuracy beyond a doubt but it received enormous development from maxwell who in this field appeared as an experimenter on laws of gaseous friction as well as a mathematician between 1859 and 1866 he developed theory of distributions of velocities in particles of a gas work later generalised by ludwig boltzmann formula called maxwell boltzmann distribution gives fraction of gas molecules moving at a specified velocity at any given temperature in kinetic theory temperatures and heat involve only molecular movement this approach generalised previously established laws of thermodynamics and explained existing observations and experiments in a better way than had been achieved previously his work on thermodynamics led him to devise thought experiment that came to be known as maxwell s demon where second law of thermodynamics is violated by an imaginary being capable of sorting particles by energy in 1871 he established maxwell s thermodynamic relations which are statements of equality among second derivatives of thermodynamic potentials with respect to different thermodynamic variables in 1874 he constructed a plaster thermodynamic visualisation as a way of exploring phase transitions based on american scientist josiah willard gibbs s graphical thermodynamics papers control theory maxwell published paper on governors in proceedings of royal society vol 16 1867 1868 this paper is considered a central paper of early days of control theory here governors refers to governor or centrifugal governor used to regulate steam engines legacy thumb upright james clerk maxwell monument in edinburgh
