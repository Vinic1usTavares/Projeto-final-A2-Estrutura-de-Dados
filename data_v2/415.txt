mandarin oriental bend corner fenestraz used his car s four new tyres to overtake his teammate ilott and eriksson to advance from fourth to second place on first lap ilott fell to fifth because he was

chain reaction accident and all four drivers retired due to car damage ticktum held lead at restart with a healthy advantage over fenestraz in second place on fourth lap eriksson was close behind

oriental bend turn and lisboa corner despite green flag conditions some drivers slowed more than predicted in response daruvala slowed and florsch was tucked into his slipstream a lack of reaction time caused florsch to hit daruvala s right rear wheel that caused florsch to spin through 90 degrees to right and she made contact with a crash barrier at high speed which removed left hand side wheels from her vehicle she entered lisboa corner s speed trap at florsch s trajectory caused her to hit newly installed raised kerbs on right of lisboa corner which lifted her vehicle slightly airborne lift raised her car high enough to hit roll hoop of tsuboi s vehicle with her car s wheels florsch who removed her hands from her steering wheel catapulted backwards to top of a catch fence and went through it after it absorbed a large amount of impact force with speed of her car greatly reduced from collision it struck a photographer s bunker backwards with its roll hoop and cockpit before it was flipped upwards photographer s banker was heavily damaged by collision and it significantly shifted florsch s car fell onto an armco barrier below marshal s post and was covered in fire

lisboa corner two laps later ahmed crashed at moorish hill bend and retired from eleventh place safety car was subsequently dispatched because track marshals required space to extricate his car via a crane race restarted on eleventh lap ticktum carried enough speed through fisherman s bend and reservoir bend corners to lead his teammate eriksson by 0 721 seconds at lap s end however eriksson slipstreamed ticktum but only to extent that he drew alongside left hand side of latter s car going into lisboa corner s braking zone ticktum held his advantage on ideal line and extended his lead to 1 028 seconds at end of lap 12 he further increased this by 1 513 seconds and by another 0 037 seconds to start final lap eriksson could not respond to his teammate ticktum s advantage and latter

katayama sakaguchi vips and kumita post race alt thumb upright dan ticktum was third driver to win macau grand prix in consecutive years top three drivers appeared on podium to collect and spoke to media in a later press conference ticktum spoke of perfect weekend that enabled him to win race i can t really remember a weekend where i ve performed so well and that s not only just me it s all people around me all support i ve had it s been just perfect weekend thank you a lot to team car was just so good i m immensely proud to represent timo s motopark founder team in f3 eriksson said that he lost some ground to his teammate ticktum before safety car was withdrawn and spoke of a tough race overtake on sacha was quite tight but i knew i needed to pass him early in race to have a chance on dan because i knew he was quick all weekend and i had same speed as him third placed fenestraz stated it was best finish he could attain due to eriksson and ticktum s fast pace obviously i wanted win but for my second time here it s pretty good i m already looking forward to next year i think i did a really good job it was going to be hard to beat dan and eriksson they were quick all weekend it s true we had an advantage with new tyres but with red flag and all that stuff you cannot take most out of it i would say i still had a little advantage but they were too fast florsch s crash overshadowed race she had an 11 hour operation on her back on 19 november and surgeons removed a bone splinter that was close to her spinal cord they removed a bone from her hip and used it to form a new hip a titanium plate was installed to support it florsch vomited from taking painkillers and rendered unmovable for five days as she lost of muscle mass and had a large amount of hip ache she was released from hospital on 26 november and flew to germany tsuboi and were discharged from hospital shortly after while chan was hospitalised for a ten day surgery to his lacerated liver florsch began rehabilitation in early december 2018 to ensure she lost no more muscle strength and to strengthen her body with weights on a gradual scale she said she remembered everything about crash it probably is a miracle but that s probably also reason why i am happy and why i am normal it happened quite fast top speed was but i can do nearly everything again so for me it s just to be happy and to continue to be positive i remember everything from crash it felt just completely different for me because it just happened so fast jean todt president of fia announced that crash would be investigated governing body seized video footage from florsch s on board television camera and those of drivers she was close by when accident happened van amersfoort racing team owner fritz van amersfoort spoke of his belief that accident could have occurred on other circuits and fia s race director charlie whiting stated that guia circuit was not dangerous and no major alterations to its configuration were necessary grand prix drivers association director and haas f1 driver romain grosjean said its members would probably raise issue of raised kerbs on right of lisboa corner with fia crash reminded him of konstantin tereshchenko s accident in a gp3 series race at circuit de spa francorchamps in 2014 according to jonathan noble of motorsport com and racing driver ryan lewis installation of raised kerbs prevented florsch s car striking cockpit sidepod of tsuboi s vehicle in a similar style to takuma sato and nick heidfeld s crash at 2002 austrian grand prix classification qualifying driver team
