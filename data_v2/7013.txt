perspective and levithan writing from nick s perspective cera and dennings recorded voice over narration to mimic first person perspective from which novel is written but voice overs were not included in final cut of film scafaria says that differences between novel and film were to make it a little more cinematic she said that nick and norah s parents were written out of script to absorb what it s like to be young because you re not thinking about your parents when you re out all night in addition to searching for where s fluffy sollett felt that film needed a second macguffin to propel story forwards so norah s best friend caroline got drunk and then lost giving nick and norah an additional objective filming shooting on a budget of us 10million principal photography of nick and norah s
