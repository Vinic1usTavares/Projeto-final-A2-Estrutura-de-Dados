great migration of african americans out of south to north was beginning blacks in two regions dealt with different conditions vast majority of millions of african americans still lived in south many in rural areas where they were majority population but they were effectively disfranchised by new electoral rules and state constitutions utterly closed out of political process this situation would

other radicals tended to come from north where african americans exercised more rights in daily life including suffrage were more urbanized and had achieved more in work and education but were still subject to discrimination following their failure to advance radical agenda in louisville trotter and other radicals sought a more sympathetic forum in which to attack booker t washington an
