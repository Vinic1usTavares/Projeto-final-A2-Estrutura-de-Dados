seattle it has become a fremont landmark and is often decorated or vandalized statue has also sparked political controversy including criticisms for communist chic and not taking historic meaning of lenin and communism seriously or for taking it all too seriously or by comparing purported acceptance of such a charged political symbol to removal of confederate monuments and memorials much of debate ignores that former monument is on private property with public and government having virtually no say in matter commission and construction statue was constructed by bulgarian sculptor emil venkov 1937 2017 under a 1981 commission from communist party of czechoslovakia while following bounds of his commission venkov intended to portray lenin as a bringer of revolution in contrast to

monumental statue lying in a scrapyard with a homeless man living inside it lenin statue was waiting to be cut up and sold for price of bronze carpenter had met and befriended venkov in an earlier visit to czechoslovakia carpenter s initial interest in buying statue was to preserve it for its historic and artistic merit later he intended to use it to attract customers for an ethnic slovak restaurant he wanted to open in issaquah in close collaboration with a local journalist and good friend tomas fulopp carpenter approached city officials saying that despite its current unpopularity statue was still a work of art worth preserving and offered to buy it for after bureaucratic hurdles he signed a contract with mayor of poprad on march 16 1993 mayor then began to reconsider and asked city council to vote on sale after they voted to approve it poprad council reconsidered and asked slovak ministry of culture for its blessing which they gave four more months later after final approval to buy and move statue out of country carpenter consulted with both venkov and architect who had overseen original casting of bronze before deciding to cut statue into three pieces and ship

representing quirky nature of artistic neighborhood whose motto is libertas freedom to be peculiar like fremont troll and waiting for interurban sculpture lenin statue is often decorated appropriated or vandalized with various intentions both whimsical and serious knute berger acknowledging that we are supposed to be amused by hippie whimsy of a soviet symbol in middle of an american city said that seeing statue cannot help but remind us of killing and repression lenin inspired but berger reflected that perhaps meaning of this soviet relic is opposite that it is a trophy of western triumphalism representing victory over communism and fall of berlin wall by removing statue from its original context where it was meant to keep slovak people in awe given a new context where it oppresses no one and is used entirely in service of free enterprise and profit making berger goes on to compare lenin statue with native american totem poles so many of which were once on display in city that they became a symbol of seattle some of seattle s most iconic totem poles actually alaskan tlingit carved house posts were brazenly stolen from an alaska village by respected members of scientific and business community harriman alaska expedition so immersed in triumph of their own culture over that of native americans that little thought was given to what dr robin k wright of burke museum called a very clear case of theft berger said story of victory of one culture over another told by totem pole or lenin statue make it an icon but if you know story a complicated one a glowing

seattle city council was considering debating a symbolic resolution on removing lenin statue and confederate memorial though city government has no power to remove either against wishes of owners since neither monument nor properties they are on are city owned in an article discussing confederate monuments in usa today allen said that there should be a movement of protesters asking that statue be removed as lenin s murderous ideas and deeds dwarf any of sins of robert e lee a bill introduced to state legislature in early 2019 by a group of republican representatives called for statue s removal and replacement in response to a bill reconsidering a statue of marcus whitman at washington state capitol one of fremont s major landowners businesswoman suzie burke told radio that if any of bill s sponsors actually lived in seattle area she would have invited them to come to fremont to discuss it and she would have reminded them that government does not have authority to remove privately
