1952 kern county earthquake occurred on july 21 in southern san joaquin valley and measured 7 3 on moment magnitude scale main shock occurred at 4 52 am pacific daylight time 11 52 utc killed 12 people and injured hundreds and caused an estimated 60 million in property damage a small sector of damage near bealville corresponded to a maximum mercalli intensity of xi extreme though this intensity rating was not representative of majority of damage earthquake occurred on white wolf fault near community of wheeler ridge and was strongest to occur in california since 1906 san francisco earthquake town of tehachapi suffered greatest damage and loss of life from earthquake though other locations in kern county experienced significant damage as well but its effects were widely felt throughout central and southern california july mainshock had a significant aftershock sequence that persisted into july and august with many magnitude 5 events with intensities of v moderate to vii very strong six of these aftershocks occurred on day of mainshock but strongest aftershock came on august 22 as a m5 8 event that had a maximum perceived intensity of viii severe and resulted in deaths of two people and caused an additional 10 million in property damage following event a field survey was conducted along fault zone with goal of estimating peak ground acceleration of shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators ground disturbances that were created by earthquakes were also surveyed both in valley and in foothills with both vertical and horizontal displacements present in epicentral area strong motion records that were acquired from event were significant and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of event and how it set a standard for those types of engineering or scientific papers repercussions of sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in heavily damaged downtown area of bakersfield well into 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of surviving unreinforced masonry buildings tectonic setting at lebec california just south of epicenter of july mainshock san andreas fault comes together with fault which is positioned at northern border of mojave desert san andreas has been responsible for considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections and traverses area near transverse ranges kern canyon fault mirrors path of kern river and was thought to have a connection with white wolf fault but indicators observed following july 21 earthquake demonstrated that two are offset owens valley fault on east side of sierran block has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by 1952 shocks other fault zones are present in region and have been of interest because they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes but they are considered not as significant as kern canyon owens valley and san andreas faults 1952 earthquakes were first to be observed well within kern county lines other strong but remote events were previously felt in area but they were distant enough to cause only occasional destructive effects county is bounded on western side by range which is adjacent to southern san andreas fault other large events have affected area as well like january 1857 fort tejon earthquake that severely affected fort tejon about south of wheeler ridge earthquake m7 3 earthquake occurred on strike slip white wolf fault in southern san valley historically left lateral fault has had a component of reverse slip and at time of july mainshock ratio of reverse left lateral slip was about 1 2 1 epicenter of shock was at fault s southwestern end at a point where it may end or merge with east west trending thrust fault white wolf fault as illuminated by aftershocks was found to be curved with less dip on northeast end though that zone also had a higher strike slip component other distinct characteristics on that end of fault were shallower shocks and less overall slip if total fault displacement came about as a result of same type of large displacement shocks like one in 1952 recurrence interval was proposed to be 170 450 years 1995 working group on california earthquake probabilities gave a high uncertainty slip rate estimate of 2 mm per year seismologists have recently proposed hypothesis that earthquake is an exceptional instance of induced seismicity triggered by petroleum extraction from wheeler ridge oil field oil production from that field began 98 days before earthquake about from white wolf fault according to this hypothesis petroleum extraction did not contribute to energy of earthquake but rather altered conditions in fault enabling catastrophic release of accumulated stress a comparable or perhaps more destructive spontaneous earthquake would have occurred along fault at some later time mercalli intensities for mainshock were gauged to be viii severe especially in tehachapi and close to epicenter but southeast of bealville thick reinforced concrete railroad tunnel walls were cracked tracks were warped and gap between tunnel entrances was reduced by up to because of extraordinary damage there an intensity rating of xi extreme was assigned specifically for that location damage thumb left a collapsed school in kern county california though damage was spread throughout a large area most was concentrated in town of tehachapi where at least 11 were killed and 35 were injured an early estimate reported in los angeles times had damage at 2 6 million with 700 families affected in tehachapi alone where most of town s buildings sustained damage fifteen homes were destroyed there 53 were heavily damaged and another 75 sustained light damage in bakersfield windows were broken and dislodged plaster littered residential and commercial districts and county jail was damaged two tunnels used by southern pacific railroad and santa fe railroad collapsed between tehachapi and marcel six more tunnels received lesser damage and of track was distorted through two horseshoe curves to southwest of bakersfield in maricopa justice court building maricopa hotel post office and several businesses were condemned because of heavy damage in small town of taft disruption was light with exception of a destroyed wall at a j c penney department store and a single home that was damaged in former settlement of paloma a fire burned at an oil refinery and an explosion occurred at a refinery in long beach due to a cracked pipe but most of greater los angeles area was free from heavy damage due to distant location around 10 miles southwest of tehachapi of earthquake power disruptions affected van nuys and los angeles and in long beach some windows were broken other moderate damage in that area included a crack on a street in hollywood and a crack in a santa ana parking lot aftershocks aftershocks mmi vi strong mag date utc mmi 5 1 july 21 at 15 13 vi 5 7 july 23 at 00 38

through late september caltech seismometers recorded 188 aftershocks higher than magnitude 4 0 six of those on day of mainshock were m5 and above but some of these like 12 05 m6 3 shock were only felt and didn t cause any damage july 21 m5 1 shock at 15 13 gmt and july 23 shock at 00 38 both damaged buildings in arvin and latter event also caused slight damage in fresno and near bakersfield three additional shocks on july 23 were particularly destructive walls and other portions of buildings that had been previously damaged took a second hit from 07 53 m5 2 event and a house that saw only minor damage during mainshock was nearly destroyed by it gas and water lines were also severed and transformers were loosened or dislodged 13 17 m5 8 shock compounded problems at tehachapi and arvin with damage to previously affected buildings that was described as serious but 18 13 shock on july 23 only had a slight affect at arvin two shocks on july 25 that occurred within an hour of each other were felt throughout central california and caused pipeline damage south of bakersfield and other minor building damage in several locations pre existing ground disturbances were enhanced in tejon canyon and landslides occurred at caliente creek canyon oiler canyon grade and on state route 178 between kernville and bakersfield a number of fires were initiated by july 29 aftershock intensity vii very strong and other severe damage was caused by it especially to buildings that had already been damaged including one in bakersfield strongest aftershock in sequence came on august 22 as a magnitude 5 8 event with a maximum perceived intensity of viii severe damage was especially heavy to brick buildings in bakersfield and although only a few buildings collapsed outright 90 of 264 buildings that shock damaged needed to be brought down completely total damage from this event alone was estimated to be 10 million with several injuries and two additional deaths peak acceleration prior to 1999 chi chi earthquake in nantou county taiwan little information was available for estimating ground motion that resulted from large greater than m7 thrust earthquakes and whether values seen in that event are commonplace remains unresolved foam rubber modeling numerical modeling and field studies have shown that intense ground motions close to 1g are possible on hanging wall side of fault during some large thrust earthquakes a common occurrence of shattered rock that has been observed on hanging wall of thrust faults reinforces existence of strong motions but precarious rock surveys have indicated that smaller ground motions are present on foot wall side of fault foam rubber modelling studies confirm that ground motion on foot wall side can be lower by a factor of up to five and an example of this imbalance was displayed during september 1999 m7 6 earthquake in taiwan rocks are classified as precarious if their toppling accelerations are 3g or less and semi precarious at 3 5g area around white wolf fault was surveyed by a group of earth scientists with extensive experience estimating thousands of rock formations toppling accelerations of many rocks were assessed by three geologists with individual estimates usually agreeing within 1g on foot wall side many precarious and semi precarious rock formations were observed and allowed for peak ground acceleration to be estimated at 5g within a kilometer of fault trace while rock shattering and a lack of precarious rocks on hanging wall side suggested a value near 1g had been experienced at time of shock ground effects many erratic surface fractures were generated in san joaquin valley along white wolf fault cracks were not well defined and were result of disturbance of alluvium that makes up valley floor rather than cracking along fault trace northeast trending cracks ranging from hairline width to near five inches wide were seen between arvin and california state route 166 and some showed clear lateral offset but those were determined to be localized effects some of fractures in ground were aligned with fault and some were perpendicular to general trend but more significant breaks were believed to be a direct result of faulting at depth this was true in mountainous areas as well but some of breaks at higher elevations were probably related to slumping northeast trending breaks were described in a report from state of california that was prepared by well known geologists and seismologists as thrusting of southeast block up and over northwest block and or a lateral movement of southeast block to northeast offset rows of cotton were documented at a number of locations along northeast trending fault breaks in valley an offset of was seen south of bakersfield about east of california state route 99 and southwest of arvin a north south oriented row was offset with movement towards west on south side of shift at same location an east west road was dislocated towards northeast a minimum of and near mouth of comanche creek south of arvin a shallow sloped fault scarp was raised with a maximum vertical displacement of about response thumb left looking northbound on ridge route in angeles national forest beno gutenberg a german american seismologist was director of caltech seismological laboratory at time of shock he commented about event first by saying that energy of event was 100 times that of 1933 long beach earthquake in statements made in july 22 los angeles times shock was compared to 1857 fort tejon event he went on to say there is no doubt that yesterday s quake is largest southern california has had in this century and is largest to occur in this area since modern instruments were available it s possible that 1857 quake might have been more intense charles richter departed lab in pasadena in a mobile seismograph truck bound for epicentral area to record aftershocks close to fault and harry o wood founder of lab thirty years prior visited lab following onset of shocks and commented that it was still not possible to predict location of large earthquakes american red cross called it a major disaster but getting relief into area was stalled because of landslides blocking ridge route running between los angeles and kern counties california state route 99 was also blocked by a landslide ten miles south of gorman but highway was quickly reopened later in day all aircraft not related to relief effort were ordered not to land at tehachapi municipal airport all 417 inmates from tehachapi prison for women were evacuated because of damage california department of corrections stated that facility was left unusable most of injured received medical care at kern county general hospital and some sought treatment at tehachapi valley hospital where some existing patients were moved to make room for new arrivals railroad was reopened in 25 days by a construction force of one thousand men and 175 pieces of earth moving equipment including seven track gangs nine bridge and building gangs and personnel and equipment from morrison knudsen four tunnels were quickly repaired two more were daylighted by removing overburden to convert them to cuts one was partially daylighted and of fill were placed to construct a temporary alignment around eighth tunnel while permanent repairs were underway aftermath downtown bakersfield was heavily impacted by earthquakes and many damaged buildings were bulldozed to make room for buildings that were eventually constructed with newer architectural styles after world war ii and with a booming economy region was experiencing a period of urban renewal kern county courthouse st francis church and original beale memorial clock tower were all damaged and were leveled or rebuilt in what may have been an overambitious push for renewal some historic buildings that may have been able to be salvaged also were brought down though some stood for many years after earthquakes some of bakersfield s unreinforced masonry buildings survived shocks and were still in use years later but cost of retrofitting these buildings was often prohibitive for their owners and bakersfield city council was given authority to seize or demolish them in 1993 city changed its approach in late 1990s after building owners complained that upgrade process was too expensive and possibility that city may be left in possession of properties that were left needing costly renovations following most present day damaging earthquakes teams of investigators from institutions such as earthquake engineering research institute are sent to affected region to set up instruments to capture strong motion records and to study damage and other effects of event this has not always been case and 1954 report from and moran that thoroughly detailed effects especially to buildings of 1952 shocks put in place a model for how modern earthquake reconnaissance reports are written strong motion record that was obtained from 1952 shock as well as accelerogram from 1940 el centro earthquake were most widely used data sets until 1971 san fernando earthquake see also california earthquake forecast
