provincial armenians he became so popular that men he led came to refer to him always by his first name andranik intended to attract attention of foreign consuls at mush to plight of armenian peasants and to provide hope for oppressed armenians of eastern provinces according to trotsky andranik s political thinking took shape in a setting of activity and diplomatic intrigue 1904 sasun uprising and

overwhelming armenian 769 armenian and 155 kurdish was traditionally considered their main operational area region was in a state of revolutionary turmoil because local armenians had refused to pay

villages ottoman forces and kurdish irregulars suppressed uprising by may 1904 they outnumbered armenian forces several times minor clashes occurred thereafter according to christopher j walker fedayi came near to organising an uprising and shaking ottoman power in armenia but even then it was unthinkable that empire would lose any of her territory since idea of intervention was far from russia

got to aghtamar island with sailing ships they escaped to persia via van in september 1904 leaving little more than a heroic memory trotsky states that they were forced to leave turkish armenia to

with around 30 000 refugees and an estimated force of between 3 000 and 5 000 men he established effective control of region by september role of zangezur was crucial because it was a connection point between turkey and azerbaijan under andranik region became one of last centers of armenian resistance after treaty of batum andranik s irregulars remained in zangezur surrounded by muslim villages that controlled key routes connecting different parts of zangezur according to donald bloxham andranik initiated change of zangezur into a solidly armenian land by destroying muslim villages and trying to ethnically homogenize key areas of armenian state in late 1918 azerbaijan accused andranik of killing innocent azerbaijani peasants in zangezur and demanded that he withdraw armenian units from area wrote that without presence of general andranik and his special striking division what is now zangezur district of armenia would be party of azerbaijan today without general andranik and his

and on 23 december 1918 a group of armenian leaders met in a conference and concluded that zangezur could not cope with influx of refugees until spring they agreed that first logical step in relieving tension was reparation of more than 15 000 refugees from adjoining district that had been evacuated by ottoman armies andranik and conference called upon british to provide for refugees in interim major w d gibbon arrived with limited supplies and money donated by armenians of baku but this was not enough to support refugees thumb andranik ozanian and hovhannes tumanyan in tiflis at end of
