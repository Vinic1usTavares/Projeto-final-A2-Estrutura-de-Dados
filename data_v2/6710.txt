a vanderwerff was unconvinced that episode along with tempus fugit merited being stretched over two parts however she felt that character of fenig was a simultaneous paean to many many lives lost in this fictional war and a very real story about someone who could very well live on edges of our society driven mad by visions that are only real to himself visions rest of us would immediately disregard as unbelievable and surreal paula vitaris writing for cinefantastique rated max one and a half stars out of four vitaris praised episode s visual effects however she felt that two parts of story would have better served as a taut one hour episode vitaris also felt that episode s final act featuring mulder on an airplane saw mulder uncharacteristically putting civilians at risk and was an example of out and out bad writing robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to x files millennium lone gunmen rated episode four stars out of five describing it as satisfying witty and touching shearman noted that second half of two part episodes in series tended to drop ball but felt that story arc of tempus fugit and max was very solid calling them most satisfying event that x files has ever done shearman and pearson p 98 references bibliography external links category 1997 american television episodes category television episodes about
