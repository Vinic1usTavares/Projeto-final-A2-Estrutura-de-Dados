doug anthony all stars or doug anthony allstars daas d a a s or stylised as da as were an australian musical comedy alternative rock and vocal group who initially performed together between 1984 and 1994 group were an acoustic trio originally comprising paul mcdermott and tim ferguson on main vocals and richard fidler on guitar and backing vocals group reformed in 2014 with paul livingston aka flacco replacing fidler on guitar daas were known for their aggressive provocative style their habit of involving audience members and their tendency to attack topical and sometimes controversial issues in their comedy daas began performing as buskers on streets of canberra in 1984 while they were attending university after winning pick of fringe award at 1986 adelaide fringe festival group relocated from canberra to melbourne but it was not until they travelled to edinburgh festival fringe in 1987 that they first achieved success they quickly gained popularity in united kingdom where they made numerous television appearances but remained virtually unknown in australia until 1989 when they were made regular performers on australian comedy show big gig these appearances gained them recognition and they remained a popular feature of show until 1991 when they left to create their own abc comedy series daas kapital group released four live recordings and one studio album daas icon which achieved some independent success in australia but was briefly banned in britain they also released a collection of dark short stories in 1989 entitled book which took a markedly different tone from their comedic stage performances they also made two live concert videos and one film edinburgh years group split up in 1994 following a final farewell tour of australia although they reunited in 2003 to perform together at a benefit concert were interviewed together in 2008 in support of their dvd and reunited for a one off show to launch daas kapital dvd in 2013 three ruled out suggestion of a reunion tour at time in december 2013 mcdermott and ferguson announced they would be performing as daas for group s 30th anniversary at canberra comedy festival in march 2014 with paul livingston performing role of fidler this current line up has announced subsequent shows in hobart melbourne wollongong perth brisbane and bendigo with more dates to follow group have been inactive since end of 2017 style thumb daas frequently involved audience in their act in this scene group mock threaten to shoot an audience member daas employ an aggressive confrontational style which author and journalist geoff bartlett describes as pushing boundaries of humour and good taste to their absolute limits they frequently delve into topical and taboo subject matter with songs such as commies for christ and i fuck dogs long before anyone knew term one of our greatest driving forces was to be politically incorrect said ferguson each band member developed distinctive onstage characters with mcdermott adopting a nasty mean persona while ferguson played a narcissistic character who was gorgeous but stupid fidler initially played straight man but as group became more aggressive he developed into a character who was naturally happy and caring but frequently victimised by his fellow band members group drew inspiration from short lived punk bands like fat lone reagans and forbidden mule whom ferguson describes as like all punk bands very fast and furious much of band s provocative style emerged from their origins as street performers where to get people s attention they resorted to outrageous or theatrical tactics group would sometimes walk into street and stop traffic to get noticed sometimes we have to do really ugly or horrendous things to get people s attention and we re not afraid to do that we ll hit someone if it gets a bit of discourse going said mcdermott neil pigot who did some work with group describes their style as a sort of extension of python tradition but very much in an australian context he says that daas were crucially important in development of australian comedy directly contributing to styles of successful comedy shows such as d generation fast forward and out of work at time daas emerged pigot says comedy in australia was dominated by joke tellers and impersonators by contrast daas were belligerent and confrontational frequently attacking topical issues invading people s personal space and involving audience in their act mark who frequently collaborated with group described their work as true genius their great shows were among greatest evenings i ve witnessed in my life and their worst shows were among worst he said they d whip up an audience and appeal to people s darker side it was very dada what they were doing and what happens with that is you re just as often likely to have people who want to kill you as applaud you in addition abc comedy producer ted robinson says that group played an important role in raising profile of australian comedy overseas particularly in britain where daas were very popular british comedian al murray said of seeing group at edinburgh festival in 1988 they came onstage with attitude of feral invaders and left it with no taboo untouched murray described all stars as an insanely hot act from oz who sang cursed sweated and insulted each other and their audiences with a level of commitment and polish that seemed exotically charged and almost transgressive in late 80s daas were known for continuing to act or to remain in character during interviews much of this was just banter but they also had serious messages daas were often criticising media and part of this was to tell outrageous lies to journalists during interviews and attempt to see them published as fact in one of best known instances of this group told british reporters that their namesake former australian politician doug anthony was a much loved prime minister of australia who had been assassinated on 11 november 1975 by right wing extremists in fact anthony is a former deputy prime minister of australia who had led right of center national party of australia from 1971 to 1984 lie was printed in times guardian and independent this game continued undetected until in 1990 group told a reporter that they had been cast in batman and had become great friends with jack nicholson both lies story was reported as fact in newspapers around australia and appeared as a cover story in tv guide of melbourne s herald sun before media realised hoax history early years tim ferguson met richard fidler busking on streets of canberra in 1984 while they were both attending university ferguson recalls richard was playing guitar something from cat stevens one day and i walked up to him and we did wild

anthony all stars they derived their name from doug anthony a former country party leader and deputy prime minister of australia according to fidler during their earlier gigs in clubs and as street

united nations and in march 2013 was named deputy special coordinator for middle east peace process and humanitarian coordinator for occupied palestinian territory regional humanitarian coordinator for sahel united nations office for coordination of humanitarian affairs with piper s departure paul mcdermott who performed at one of daas s regular clubs was invited to join he accepted although he did not like their material which he considered too sweet fidler says mcdermott changed group s dynamic he wrote majority of their songs and prompted a darker tone after winning pick of fringe award at 1986 adelaide fringe festival group relocated from canberra to melbourne where they based themselves with a regular gig at prince patrick hotel in collingwood in an effort to save enough money to travel to edinburgh fringe initially daas found that melbourne audiences did not respond to their act and to provoke a reaction they became more aggressive with mcdermott and ferguson adopting more abusive personas and often picking on fidler s naturally happy but stupid character they made their first overseas performance at edinburgh fringe in 1987 to sold out crowds successes following their
