grand crimean central railway was a military railway built in 1855 during crimean war by great britain its purpose was to supply ammunition and provisions to allied soldiers engaged in siege of sevastopol who were stationed on a plateau between balaklava and sevastopol it also carried world s first hospital train railway was built at cost and without any contract by a partnership of english railway contractors led by samuel morton peto within three weeks of arrival of fleet carrying materials and men railway had started to run and in seven weeks of track had been completed railway was a major factor leading to success of siege after end of war track was sold and removed start of siege thumb shown as chemin de fer anglais on a contemporary french army map britain and france declared war on russia on 28 march 1854 in support of ottoman empire by late summer of 1854 british led by lord raglan with their french and turkish allies decided that a siege of black sea port of sevastopol held by russians would be best method of forcing an end to war after landing their forces to north of sevastopol british set up a base in narrow harbour of balaclava about south of sevastopol in september 1854 most of land between balaclava and sevastopol was a plateau about above sea level towns were connected by a road which was little more than a track this travelled northwards rising slightly to village of kadikoi about from balaclava it then turned west climbing steeply to plateau via col of balaclava french were supplied from harbour at kamiesch during early part of october british troops with their supplies and artillery made their way with difficulty up road to prepare for siege when they were all in place first bombardment took place starting on october 17 it had been expected that bombardment would be effective and that siege would be short lived certainly over before winter however russians blew up one of french magazines and damage done by british gunfire was soon repaired british were running out of ammunition and supplies winter was approaching and with onset of bad weather road became virtually impassable supplies were arriving at crowded port of balaclava but it was impossible to convey them to besieging troops who were increasingly suffering from disease frostbite and malnutrition conditions in balaclava itself were also deteriorating towards a railway thumb samuel morton peto news of these conditions was relayed to britain mainly by william howard russell special correspondent of times hearing news samuel morton peto one of leading railway contractors of day offered with his partners edward betts and thomas brassey to build at cost without any contract or personal advantage a railway to transport supplies from port of balaclava to troops outside sevastopol they promised to have a railroad at work in three weeks after landing at balaclava offer was accepted and contractors began to obtain supplies to purchase or hire ships and to recruit men who included specialists and navvies fleet set sail on december 21 and arrived at beginning of february meanwhile james beatty who had played an important part in working with peto s partnership to build european and north american railway was recruited as chief engineer line was surveyed by donald campbell who had also worked on european and north american railway campbell s first task was to create a wharf at balaclava where railway materials could be unloaded with a yard adjacent he planned for track to pass along middle of main street of town it then went through a gorge at north of town close to water s edge and over swampy ground to village of kadikoi from here railway had to rise some to top of plateau of routes available campbell chose to follow existing road although at parts its gradient was as steep as 1 in 7 campbell managed find a route with a maximum gradient of 1 in 14 a stationary engine would be required at top of this stretch to pull railway carriages up incline once on plateau ground was rough but fairly level and here it presented fewer problems lord raglan s headquarters were at top of col and it was decided that a depot should be constructed here construction thumb railway yard at balaclava photograph by roger fenton by february 8 1855 less than a week after landing navvies were laying first rails in main street of balaclava a trial assembly of stationary engines two had been acquired in case of failure of one of them was made and on february 10 they were working by 13th railway had reached a point from town and on 19th it was at kadikoi it began to function on 23rd when horse drawn supplies were taken from balaclava to kadikoi this was 15 days after starting to lay first rails and about three weeks after arrival of fleet in port railway yard in balaclava was being extended and accommodation was being built for workers and for storage of materials by march 26 line was complete to top of col and first load was taken to headquarters depot by this time line had been double tracked from balaclava to and various sidings had been constructed near wharf in less than seven weeks of track had been laid during this time pioneer photographer roger fenton had arrived and he recorded railway and its progress on april 2 railway was used to carry sick and injured from plateau down to balaclava it has been argued that this was first hospital train ever to run also during this time colonel william mcmurdo had been appointed to be in charge of a new department of army land transport corps he arrived in crimea in early march and one of his duties was to take over operation of railway from contractors felix wakefield was given temporary rank of lieutenant colonel and he arrived to take command of army works corps employed on project it was finally handed over by peto brassey and betts in early july war continues existence of railway meant that sufficient supplies and armaments had been transported to plateau for allies to resume their attack second bombardment started on april 9 and continued for ten days initially little progress seemed to have been made because again russians were able to repair damage caused and russians continued to deliver supplies to sevastopol from north however they had sustained heavy casualties following a period of stalemate allied forces cut off one of main russian supply lines at kerch on may 24 increased supply of ammunition meant that allies were able to mount third bombardment on june 6 this was much more intensive than previous ones it was followed by an assault on 7th and 8th which met with a limited degree of success more supplies were brought by railway and fourth bombardment took place on june 17 subsequent attack was mismanaged and was a failure end of siege russians suffered a significant defeat at battle of tchernaya on august 16 fifth bombardment took place for five days from 17th with intention of destroying as many russian defence works as possible sixth bombardment was followed by a successful allied attack on september 8 bringing siege to an end two days later during summer further surveys had been carried out with intention of supplying not just british forces but also their french and sardinian allies sardinia had joined war towards end of 1854 by rail from balaclava at this time electric telegraphy by underwater cable was first used in warfare connecting crimea to allies base at varna in bulgaria locomotives and more lines locomotives were used first one running by november 8 but this was too late to affect outcome of siege locomotives were not effective because they could not manage even easy gradient from balaclava to kadikoi with more than a light load five second hand locomotives purchased by contractors from collieries and railway companies in england are known to have arrived alliance and victory were two small 0 6 0 saddle tanks built by e b wilson co of leeds in 1854 5 two from london north western railway nos 13 and 50 were 2 2 0 bury type passenger engines built by benjamin hick son of bolton in 1838 and 1840 fifth locomotive was swan from st helens canal railway co but its details remain obscure james beatty left crimea in november to return to england a sick man and donald campbell took over earlier in september her majesty s floating factory chasseur arrived at balaclava to provide an engineering service under direction of robert frazer a third stationary engine also arrived due to haste in which railway had been constructed it was in danger of being severely damaged by weather of coming winter william doyne organised building of new lines of a superior quality again in a short time by november 10 of track had been laid between balaclava and british headquarters lines towards sardinian and french headquarters were also advancing towards end of war towards and during second winter supplies carried by railway were different siege had ended carriage of ammunition was less important and supplies related more to accommodation and comfort of troops these included huts to replace tents clothing food books and medical supplies colonel mcmurdo also left crimea as a sick man on december 1 passing control of railway to colonel edward wetherall following completion of sardinian branch railway had reached its limit in all it measured about plus a few miles of sidings and loops sevastopol lay in ruins after end of siege tsar nicholas i died on 2 march 1855 and peace negotiations were opened by new tsar alexander ii hostilities ended between allies and russians on 29 february 1856 and treaty of paris was signed on 30 march 1856 russians sold track to turks soon after war ended rails had already been uprooted and taken away and railway ceased to exist argentina myth a now discounted popular legend claims that two steam engines from crimean line went on to a new life on newly started buenos ayres western railway in argentina according to myth this is reason many railways in argentina were built to which builders of grand crimean central railway had supposedly chosen as it enabled them to requisition for use in crimea available engines and rolling stock which had already been built for lines in india research in 1950s showed that this story is untenable contemporary information shows that crimean railway was standard gauge despite subsequent rumours that it was 5 3 irish gauge or while argentina s neighbours chile and paraguay had already adopted 5 6 gauge works number of two argentine steam engines ndeg1 la portena on display at provincial transport museum in lujan and la argentina show that they left manufacturer e b wilson and company of leeds in 1856 after demolition of crimea railway had already begun their dimensions and characteristics would have been unsuitable for steep gradients in balaclava and technical considerations would have prevented their conversion from standard to broad gauge on other hand contemporary reports claim that engines from went to argentina see for instance richard francis burton who mentions in his letters from battlefields of paraguay 1870 that train he travelled in was pulled by an asthmatic little engine which after serving its time upon balaklava line and being condemned as useless at buenos aires had been shipped off to paraguay references notes
