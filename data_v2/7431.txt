largely targeting alternative rock and hip hop alike album also includes style parodies imitations of specific artists like they might be giants and elvis costello amish paradise caused a minor controversy after rapper coolio expressed distaste at having his song parodied by yankovic although two later made amends bad hair day was met with mixed to positive reviews with many critics praising

association cria production recording in november 1994 yankovic entered santa monica sound recorders in santa monica california to begin first of bad hair day sessions which he produced himself recording with yankovic were jon bermuda schwartz on drums steve jay on bass and jim west on guitar album was recorded in five sessions first session started on november 30 and yielded two originals callin in sick and everything you know is wrong second session started next day and produced original songs i remember larry night santa went crazy and since you ve been gone third session took place on november 5 1995 and resulted in original i m so sick of you and parody cavity search fourth session yielded alternative polka medley and two parodies gump and phony calls fifth and final recording session produced amish paradise and syndicated inc both of which were parodies originals callin in sick is a style parody of music popular in seattle washington most notably grunge everything you know is wrong is a stylistic pastiche of they might be giants yankovic explained that he tried to write a song sort of in their style but perhaps even a little bit more twisted for fans of they might be giants he put little references in here and there little allusions to other songs of theirs yankovic later admitted that it is a little bit harder i think to decipher exactly where inspiration is coming from song title is taken from 1974 firesign theatre album of same name i remember larry is a style parody of hilly michaels and it tells tale of a neighborhood bully who after myriad pranks is brutally murdered by narrator at 3 10 mark song contains a message which when reversed reads wow you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands night santa went crazy tells story of santa snapping embarking on a killing spree and eventually being arrested originally song had a different third verse differing in fact that at end of song santa is killed by swat team extra gory version was eventually released on single for amish paradise another version was written for touring with scissors tour in 1999 combining elements of album version and extra gory version since you ve been gone is a generic doo wop a cappella track that details a lover s torment after object of his affections breaks up with him yankovic performed most of vocals himself and to make sure that he stayed on key a scratch guitar track was recorded when song was mixed guitar track was removed bassist steve jay provides low voices in song finally i m so sick of you a style parody of elvis costello in which singer tells his girlfriend all things he hates about her parodies and polka first parody recorded for album was cavity search a parody of u2 s hit hold me thrill me kiss me kill me song which recounts horror of having to go to dentist features sound of an actual dental drill to enhance dental theme of song yankovic called in his actual dentist who brought a real drill and a human tooth which two took turns drilling while recording second parody was a pastiche of tlc s hit waterfalls called phony calls about prank calls during bridge a clip from simpsons second season episode blood feud is played on top of music because sound clip was from a preexisting episode yankovic noted that it was a pretty sweet deal for simpsons voice actors they each got a nice pile of money and they didn t even have to come to studio next parody recorded for album was gump a parody of lump by presidents of united states of america song recounts basic plot to 1994 film forrest gump about a naive and slow witted yet athletically prodigious native of alabama who witnesses and in some cases influences some of defining events of latter half of 20th century in united states gump was released as second single from album and received a video thumb upright right in amish paradise yankovic raps about simple amish way of life in an ironically boastful style 250px on january 15 1996 yankovic began recording lead single for album amish paradise yankovic felt that parodying coolio would pay off because coolio had such an identifiable image that a lot of things could be done with he noted i like to play around with people that have some you know a lot of style as opposed to somebody who s kind of sic and bland and has no personality and coolio certainly kind of sticks out in a crowd yankovic felt that juxtaposing original song s gangsta themes with amish lifestyle would produce a humorous end result after yankovic revealed to his label that he would be doing a coolio parody they requested that album artwork for release also parody coolio yankovic had been toying with name bad hair day for a time and felt that he could adequately use name and lampoon coolio who was known for his distinct hair style at same time final parody recorded for album syndicated inc is a parody of misery by soul asylum a loving ode to syndicated television much like yankovic s previous album bad hair day features a polka medley of then current hit songs alternative polka alternative polka originally contained chorus of weezer s song buddy holly performed by yankovic but song s writer weezer front man rivers cuomo requested its removal just before album s release yankovic was forced to physically cut bit out of master tape but weezer was still given credit in liner notes because notes were already printed on june 25 2010 over 14 years after album s release yankovic released un mixed and un mastered buddy holly clip on his official youtube channel unused parodies in addition to five parodies on album yankovic had several parody ideas that were turned down originally yankovic wanted to turn offspring s hit come out and play into an ode about doing laundry called laundry day there are conflicting stories as to why song was never recorded either yankovic never approached offspring about releasing parody or band denied permission either way yankovic performed song in concert from 1996 through 2000 despite not being able to parody come out and play yankovic would later be granted permission to parody their 1998 hit pretty fly for a white guy as pretty fly for a rabbi on his 1999 album running with scissors yankovic also wanted to record a parody of beatles anthology hit free as a bird entitled gee i m a nerd yankovic asked paul mccartney a supporter of yankovic s work if he could parody free as a bird mccartney had no problem with parody but because free as a bird was written by john lennon mccartney deferred decision to yoko ono who denied permission because she was uncomfortable with parody idea yankovic had also intended to record a parody of u2 song numb and a parody of rembrandts s hit song i ll be there for you numb spoof would have been called green eggs and ham a song in which yankovic recited various lines from dr seuss book of same name u2 approved parody but yankovic was unable to get permission from seuss estate likewise yankovic had wanted to turn i ll be there for you into i ll repair for you and write it about popular 1990s sitcom home improvement rembrandts had also given approval when yankovic asked but producers of friends did not want theme song to get overexposed and refused permission all of rejected parodies were later performed in concert controversy thumb upright right coolio felt that amish paradise ed his song 250px album s lead single amish paradise caused a minor controversy after rapper coolio said that yankovic had never asked for permission to record parody yankovic traditionally secures permission from artists he parodies even though this is not legally required as parodies are covered under fair use guidelines but when he inquired about gangsta s paradise yankovic was told by scotti brothers records that coolio had given permission coolio later claimed that he had not given such permission making a statement at grammys saying that he did not appreciate yankovic desecrating his song speculation surfaced that coolio had actually given permission but later changed his mind or that yankovic s record label had lied to yankovic in hopes that song would become popular yankovic later stated on vh1 s behind music that he had written a sincere letter of apology to coolio which was never returned and that coolio never complained when he received his royalty check from proceeds of song a series of photos taken at xm satellite radio booth at 2006 consumer electronics show and a post on ask al feature on yankovic s website suggested that yankovic and coolio made amends according to yankovic he was very surprised when coolio came over to chat he later joked on his site s q a feature that i doubt i ll be invited to coolio s next birthday party but at least i can stop wearing that bulletproof vest to mall promotion scotti brothers records developed a promotion strategy for bad hair day which included yankovic dressing up in exaggerated coolio styled hair and presenting an award at american music awards in january 1996 according to billboard this was a hint as to who would be next victim of a yankovic parody amish paradise was then released in very beginning of march as a radio and commercial single when gangsta s paradise was still receiving radio airplay four days later video was released album s success was also bolstered by release of gump as a single on april 25 and a video four days later in addition wea who had taken over distributing scotti brothers albums from bmg helped with initial release of album to promote album yankovic undertook bad hair tour which spanned from may 24 1996 to october 19 1997 tour was largely centered in united states although first half saw yankovic perform in canada yankovic performed over 130 shows during tour initially there were preliminary plans to have yankovic tour europe based on whether all american music group would secure album s international release although this venture never came to fruition critical reception mike joyce of washington post wrote that amish paradise was by far cleverest and funniest track that bad hair day has to offer and it ranks right up there with such yankovic classics as another one rides bus smells like nirvana and eat it he also enjoyed gump but felt that remainder of parodies were weak particularly citing cavity search as a sophomoric attempt to extract yuks however joyce noted that some of biggest laugh getters on album were yankovic s originals a record review from pittsburgh post gazette concluded that weird al yankovic s ninth collection of original songs and parodies reinforces his reign as pop music s king of comedy and that record showcases yankovic s unparalleled ability to capture styles of other bands and turn boring pop songs into fun tunes j d considine of baltimore sun noted that while yankovic s music can be sophomoric and silly yankovic himself can also be pretty smart review highlighted among other songs alternative polka and night santa went crazy as some of album s best songs not all reviews were positive stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic criticized lack of humor on album saying music on bad hair day not only lacks humor it lacks impish energy that made weird al s first albums such fun rolling stone record guide awarded album two out of five stars however book later referred to album s lead single amish paradise as gut busting commercial performance bad hair day was released on march 12 1996 and eventually became yankovic s best selling album domestically album debuted at number 28 on billboard 200 on march 30 1996 it eventually peaked at number 14 album remained on chart for a total of 56 weeks making it yankovic s longest charting album in 1996 alone album sold 1 317 000 copies in united states setting a
