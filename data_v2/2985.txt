recorded yet and applauded tweedy for offering illuminating curiosity about what can happen in a song billboard cited it as wilco s most difficult and uncompromising album to date akiva gottlieb of stylus magazine praised a ghost is born as being even more brilliant than yankee hotel foxtrot a sentiment echoed by michael of popmatters who added that album made him surprised and delighted enough to last several lifetimes keith phipps of a v club wrote that a ghost is born channels its shaggy sound into pop music that constantly threatens to erupt into noise or fade into silence but it s still hard not to hum along james hunter of village voice felt that wilco s ideas are unremarkable but are worked out with intelligence and striking conception and as it happens new organic emphasis tables some of wilco s lamer stylistic obsessions q called album more meandering than yankee hotel foxtrot but also more confident more coherent yielding an all enveloping warmth that s entirely resistant to any ipod shuffle function among mixed reviews rob mitchum of pitchfork criticized a ghost is born as wildly uneven and less cohesive than any other wilco release village voice critic robert christgau called it a privileged self indulgence due to its extreme musical dynamics nme wrote of album it s like scissor sisters on tranquilisers with a bit of elo and a dash of ramones and with this eclecticism a worrying lack of focus joshua klein of chicago tribune felt that album possessed an incomplete quality which nonetheless can be quite intriguing more of a side step than a forward leap but a worthy experiment all same ann powers of blender wrote that on first listen album is rather monotonous a bunch of moderately singable tunes with some noise piled up around edges but that it starts to insinuate meaning over subsequent listens in 2005 a ghost is born won two grammy awards for best alternative music album and best recording package although band was nominated for grammys
