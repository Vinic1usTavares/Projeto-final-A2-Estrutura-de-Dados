on 26 october 1890 eldest of three boys all of whom progressed to play first class cricket his father was a greengrocer and a coal merchant who followed cricket closely in london evening papers lee thompson 1948 p 8 during lee s youth he developed his cricket by playing against lamp posts and reflected in his autobiography that if a bowler can clean bowl a man nine times out of ten against a lamp post he will not miss a full sized wicket when he gets chance his cricketing talent was encouraged at school he first attended barrett street school and then st thomas s school in portman square both schools had headmasters who were sports enthusiasts and at st thomas s headmaster mr despicht offered a penny to any schoolboy who could bowl him out a feat lee achieved regularly mr despicht also taught lee to concentrate on bowling a good length and lee played primarily as a bowler during his school years during his final year at st thomas s school reached final of local church school s league shield and lee earned victory for his school with six wickets lee thompson 1948 pp 9 11 when lee left school he worked with his father as a greengrocer a job he liked but not enough to stop him writing a letter to marylebone cricket club asking for a job on ground staff at lord s cricket ground lee thompson 1948 p 11 along with approximately 25 other boys lee was invited for a trial at lord s early in 1906 and bowled under observation of alfred and head groundsman tom hearne lee described his first over as six of worst balls that anyone can ever have pitched but as his nerves calmed he improved and was eventually selected as one of five ground staff boys by hearne lee thompson 1948 pp 12 13 as a ground boy lee had numerous tasks sweeping dusting and cleaning seats preparing nets marking pitch weeding and similar on a match day jobs included selling scorecards operating score board or fielding in practice nets lee thompson 1948 pp 14 15 all of this left little time for boys to practise their own game no formal coaching was in place but lee was guided by a few different players england internationals teddy wynyard and albert trott among them lee thompson 1948 p 19 in 1909 and 1910 seasons lee started to gain some attention from middlesex county cricket club he scored 39 runs in a match for middlesex colts in 1909 and 60 runs against reading cricket club in 1910 lee thompson 1948 p 26 he was making more appearances for marylebone cricket club mcc collecting runs and wickets regularly but not prolifically in 1911 when a number of middlesex side were missing due to

wicketless from nine overs in match lee was given greater opportunities in 1912 appearing seven times for middlesex in championship first of these appearances against warwickshire at edgbaston brought lee his first wicket in first class cricket when he caught charles baker off his own bowling lee thompson 1948 p 29 he claimed five wickets in match and another three against nottinghamshire a month later to total eight wickets for season at 9 50 runs apiece and finish technically at top of county s bowling averages for season lee joined mcc bowling staff in 1913 at invitation of a j webbe lee thompson 1948 p 30 but he was used sparingly in first class cricket that season playing just three times all for middlesex in first of these matches lee scored 35 not out at end of middlesex s innings helping his side to avoid follow on his plucky knock was praised by captain pelham warner lee thompson 1948 pp 32 33 who promoted him to bat at number five in fourth innings by which stage game was heading for a draw during 1913 although certainly not a regular in middlesex team lee asked his captain for his county cap a request which warner responded to with surprise that he had not already received it and promptly asked for one to be sent down in 1914 season lee almost doubled his total of first class appearances two early season appearances against oxford and cambridge universities brought a few runs and a match for mcc against hampshire saw lee bat at number six in both innings he played just twice in county championship prior to august both times against warwickshire start of first world war in early august initially resulted in cancellation of middlesex s tour of northern counties yorkshire and lancashire but this decision was later reversed and middlesex took a heavily

utilised heavily being middlesex s third most used bowler he did not travel to south africa in either of 1923 24 or 1924 25 a fact which he describes as cause and effect of his poor form in 1924 and 1925 he travelled to south africa again in 1926 spending first of three successive winters in cape town coaching at south african college schools lee thompson 1948 p 93 94 this coincided with a

third and final double century scoring 225 runs against surrey at oval during which he shared a second wicket partnership of 319 with gubby allen lee s 1 617 runs for middlesex in county championship in 1929 made him their leading run scorer although both hearne and hendren topped 1 000 runs with superior averages following season saw lee accumulate 1 485 first class runs at an average of 26 05 in

a draw during match mcc were contacted by one of schools he had been coaching at which claimed that lee had broken his contract by leaving without permission lee argued vehemently against these claims citing fact that at school had told jack white that he had permission to leave but mcc were unmoved and refused to issue lee his england cap and blazer until he had apologised lee felt he had no need to apologise and never received either cap or blazer though small compensation came in form of an england touring tie which jack hobbs gave to him later career though now into his forties lee remained a regular in middlesex side in early 1930s and in 1931 he scored 1 291 runs at an average of 30 02 including two centuries both of his brothers jack and frank also scored a first class century during

he was a regular attendee at lord s throughout remainder of his life and by time of his death in 1981 he was england s second oldest test cricketer playing style in his own words lee was not a brilliant youngster like jack hearne or denis compton but an ordinary average county cricketer despite this assertion lee s 18 594 first class runs for middlesex rank him eleventh in their all time list and he is one of only seventeen cricketers to have scored over 5 000 runs and taken over 300 wickets for county h s altham and e w swanton suggested that figures alone do show his true worth as at time lord s pitch did not favour batsmen and had he played his career on some other ground where pitch was a batsman s paradise his figures would have borne a truer relation to his value altham swanton 1938 p 388 lee batted with a noticeable crouch and scored predominantly on leg side his style was unattractive to watch but effective and although hearne and hendren drew most of plaudits for their more colourful methods lee received praise for his toughness and courage notes and references notes references national archives bibliography external links category 1890 births category 1981
