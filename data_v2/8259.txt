ss great britain is a museum ship and former passenger steamship which was advanced for her time she was longest passenger ship in world from 1845 to 1854 she was designed by isambard kingdom brunel 1806 1859 for great western steamship company s transatlantic service between bristol and new york while other ships had been built of iron or equipped with a screw propeller great britain was first to combine these features in a large ocean going ship she was first iron steamer to cross atlantic which she did in 1845 in time of 14 days ship is in length and has a 3 400 ton displacement she was powered by two inclined 2 cylinder engines of direct acting type with twin high pressure cylinders diameter uncertain and twin low pressure cylinders bore all of stroke cylinders she was also provided with secondary masts for sail power four decks provided accommodation for a crew of 120 plus 360 passengers who were provided with cabins and dining and promenade saloons when launched in 1843 great britain was by far largest vessel afloat but her protracted construction time of six years 1839 1845 and high cost had left her owners in a difficult financial position and they were forced out of business in 1846 having spent all their remaining funds refloating ship after she ran aground at dundrum bay in county down near newcastle in what is now northern ireland after a navigation error in 1852 she was sold for salvage and repaired great britain later carried thousands of immigrants to australia from 1852 until being converted to all sail in 1881 three years later she was retired to falkland islands where she was used as a warehouse quarantine ship and coal hulk until she was scuttled and sunk in 1937 98 years since being laid down at start of her construction in 1970 after great britain had lain under water and abandoned for 33 years half a world away sir jack arnold hayward obe 1923 2015 paid for vessel to be raised and repaired enough to be towed north through atlantic back to united kingdom and returned to bristol dry dock where she had been built 127 years earlier hayward was a prominent businessman developer philanthropist and owner of english football club wolverhampton wanderers now listed as part of national historic fleet great britain is a visitor attraction and museum ship in bristol harbour with between 150 000 and 200 000 visitors annually development thumb left on her maiden voyage after initial success of its first liner of 1838 great western steamship company collected materials for a sister ship tentatively named city of new york same engineering team that had collaborated so successfully on great western isambard brunel thomas christopher claxton and william patterson was again assembled this time however brunel whose reputation was at its height came to assert overall control over design of ship a state of affairs that would have far reaching consequences for company construction was carried out in a specially adapted dry dock in bristol england adoption of iron hull two chance encounters were to profoundly affect design of great britain in late 1838 john laird s english channel packet ship rainbow largest iron hulled ship then in service made a stop at bristol brunel despatched his associates christopher claxton and william patterson to make a return voyage to antwerp on rainbow to assess utility of new building material both men returned as converts to iron hulled technology and brunel scrapped his plans to build a wooden ship and persuaded company directors to build an iron hulled ship great britains builders recognised a number of advantages of iron over traditional wooden hull wood was becoming more expensive while iron was getting cheaper iron hulls were not subject to dry rot or woodworm and they were also lighter in weight and less bulky chief advantage of iron hull was its much greater structural strength practical limit on length of a wooden hulled ship is about 300 feet after which hogging flexing of hull as waves pass beneath it becomes too great iron hulls are far less subject to hogging so that potential size of an iron hulled ship is much greater ship s designers led by brunel were initially cautious in adaptation of their plans to iron hulled technology with each successive draft however ship grew ever larger and bolder in conception by fifth draft vessel had grown to 3 400 tons over 1 000 tons larger than any ship then in existence adoption of screw propulsion thumb left artist s impression of thumb replica of great britains original six bladed propeller on museum ship this propeller proved totally unsatisfactory in service and was quickly replaced with a four bladed model in early 1840 a second chance encounter occurred arrival of revolutionary at bristol first screw propelled steamship completed only a few months before by f p smith s propeller steamship company brunel had been looking into methods of improving performance of great britains paddlewheels and took an immediate interest in new technology smith sensing a prestigious new customer for his own company agreed to lend archimedes to brunel for extended tests over several months smith and brunel tested a number of different propellers on archimedes to find most efficient design a four bladed model submitted by smith having satisfied himself as to advantages of screw propulsion brunel wrote to company directors to persuade them to embark on a second major design change abandoning paddlewheel engines already half constructed for completely new engines suitable for powering a propeller brunel listed advantages of screw propeller over paddlewheel as follows screw propulsion machinery was lighter in weight thus improving fuel economy screw propulsion machinery could be kept lower in hull lowering ship s centre of gravity and making it more stable in heavy seas by taking up less room propeller engines would allow more cargo to be carried elimination of bulky paddle boxes would lessen resistance through water and also allow ship to manoeuvre more easily in confined waterways depth of a paddlewheel is constantly changing depending on ship s cargo and movement of waves while a propeller stays fully submerged and at full efficiency at all times screw propulsion machinery was cheaper brunel s arguments proved persuasive and in december 1840 company agreed to adopt new technology decision became a costly one setting ship s completion back by nine months reporting on ship s arrival in new york in its first issue scientific american opined if there is any thing objectionable in construction or machinery of this noble ship it is mode of propelling her by screw propeller and we should not be surprised if it should be ere long superseded by paddle wheels at sides launch right thumb a painting of launch in 1843 launching or more accurately float out took place on 19 july 1843 conditions were generally favourable and diarists recorded that after a dull start weather brightened with only a few intermittent showers atmosphere of day can best be gauged from a report following day in bristol mirror large crowds started to gather early in day including many people who had travelled to bristol to see spectacle there was a general atmosphere of anticipation as royal emblem was unfurled processional route had been cleaned and temple street decorated with flags banners flowers and ribbons boys of city school and girls of red maids were stationed in a neat orderly formation down entire length of exchange route was a mass of colour and everybody was out on streets as it was a public holiday atmosphere of gaiety even allowed thoughts to drift away from problems of political dissension in london prince albert arrived at 10 a m at great western railway terminus royal train conducted by brunel himself had taken two hours and forty minutes from london there was a guard of honour of members of police force soldiers and dragoons and as prince stepped from train band of life guards played works by and a selection from ballet of alma two sections of platform were boarded off for reception and it was noted by bristol mirror that parts were covered with carpets from council house prince consort dressed as a private gentleman was accompanied by his equerry in waiting personal secretary marquess of exeter and lords wharncliffe liverpool lincoln and wellesley thumb launch of great britain at bristol july 1843 introductions were made followed by address to his royal highness prince albert by town clerk d burgess honours were then bestowed on him by society of merchant venturers and there were speeches from members of bristol clergy royal party then had breakfast and after 20 minutes reappeared to board horse drawn carriages at noon prince arrived at great western steamship yard only to find ship already launched and waiting for royal inspection he boarded ship took refreshments in elegantly decorated lounge then commenced his tour of inspection he was received in ship s banqueting room where all local dignitaries and their ladies were gathered after banquet and toasts he left for naming ceremony it had already been decided that christening would be performed by clarissa 1790 1868 wife of philip john miles 1773 1845 and mother of bristol s mp philip william skinner miles 1816 1881 a director of company victorian era miles family kings weston action group nonesuch expeditions from slaves to sleepers dark saga of men who built steam ship great britain she stepped forward grasped champagne bottle and swung it towards bows unfortunately steam packet avon had started to tow ship into harbour and bottle fell about short of its target and dropped unbroken into water a second bottle was rapidly obtained and prince hurled it against iron hull in her haste avon had started her work before shore warps had been released tow rope snapped and due to resultant delay prince was obliged to return to railway station and miss end of programme another extended delay thumb left fitting out in bristol floating harbour april 1844 this historic photograph by william talbot is believed to be first ever taken of a ship following launch ceremony builders had planned to have great britain towed to thames for her final fitting out unfortunately harbour authorities had failed to carry out necessary modifications to their facilities in a timely manner exacerbating problem ship had been widened beyond original plans to accommodate propeller engines and her designers had made a belated decision to fit engines prior to launch which resulted in a deeper draught this dilemma was to result in another costly delay for company as brunel s negotiations with bristol dock board dragged on for months it was only through intervention of board of trade that harbour authorities finally agreed to lock modifications begun in late 1844 after being trapped in harbour for more than a year great britain was at last floated out in december 1844 but not before causing more anxiety for her proprietors after passing successfully through first set of lock gates she jammed on her passage through second which led to river avon only seamanship of captain claxton who after naval service held position of quay warden harbour master at bristol enabled her to be pulled back and severe structural damage avoided following day an army of workmen under direct control of brunel took advantage of slightly higher tide and removed coping stones and lock gate platforms from junction lock allowing tug samson again under claxton s supervision to tow ship safely into avon that midnight description general description thumb sketch of great britain lower image shows internal arrangement of her decks and machinery when completed in 1845 great britain was a revolutionary vessel first ship to combine an iron hull with screw propulsion and at in length and with a 3 400 ton displacement more than longer and 1 000 tons larger than any ship previously built her beam was and her height from keel to main deck she had four decks including spar upper deck a crew of 120 and was fitted to accommodate a total of 360 passengers along with 1 200 tons of cargo and 1 200 tons of coal for fuel like other steamships of era great britain was provided with secondary sail power consisting of one square rigged and five schooner rigged masts a relatively simple sail plan designed to reduce number of crew required masts were of iron fastened to spar deck with iron joints and with one exception hinged to allow their lowering to reduce wind resistance in event of a strong headwind rigging was of iron cable instead of traditional hemp again with a view to reducing wind resistance another innovative feature was lack of traditional heavy bulwarks around main deck a light iron railing both reduced weight and allowed water shipped in heavy weather to run unimpeded back to sea hull and single funnel amidships were both finished in black paint with a single white stripe running length of hull highlighting a row of false gunports hull was flat bottomed with no external keel and with bulges low on each side amidships which continued toward stern in an unusual implementation of tumblehome a result of late decision to install propeller engines which were wider at base than originally planned paddlewheel engines brunel anxious to ensure avoidance of hogging in a vessel of such unprecedented size designed hull to be massively redundant in strength ten longitudinal iron girders were installed along keel running from beneath engines and boiler to forward section iron ribs were in size iron keel plates were an inch thick and hull seams were lapped and double riveted in many places safety features which also contributed to structural strength of vessel included a double bottom and five watertight iron bulkheads total amount of iron including engines and machinery was 1 500 tons machinery thumb right upright a model of great britains engines two giant propeller engines were installed amidships they had a combined weight of 340 tons they were built to a modified patent of brunel s father marc engines which rose from keel through three lower decks to a height just below main deck were of direct acting type with twin bore stroke cylinders inclined upward at a 60deg angle capable of developing a total of at 18 rpm steam power was provided by three long by high by wide square saltwater boilers forward of engines with eight furnaces each four at each end in considering gearing arrangement brunel had no precedent to serve as a guide gearing for archimedes of spur and pinion type had proven almost unbearably noisy and would not be suitable for a passenger ship brunel s solution was to install a chain drive on crankshaft between great britains two engines he installed a diameter primary which by means of a set of four massive inverted tooth or silent chains operated smaller secondary gear near keel which turned propeller shaft this was first commercial use of silent chain technology and individual silent chains installed in great britain are thought to have been largest ever constructed great britains main propeller shaft built by mersey iron works was largest single piece of machinery long and in diameter shaft was bored with a diameter hole reducing its weight and allowing cold water to be pumped through to reduce heat at each end of main propeller shaft were two secondary coupling shafts a diameter shaft beneath engine and a screw shaft of in diameter at stern total length of three shafts was and total weight 38 tons shaft was geared upward at a ratio of 1 to 3 so that at engines normal operating speed of 18 rpm propeller turned at a speed of 54 rpm initial propeller was a six bladed windmill model of brunel s own design in diameter and with pitch of interior thumb left looking down one aisle of reconstructed dining saloon in museum ship ss great britain interior was divided into three decks upper two for passengers and lower for cargo two passenger decks were divided into forward and aft compartments separated by engines and boiler amidships in after section of ship upper passenger deck contained after or principal saloon long by wide which ran from just aft of engine room to stern on each side of saloon were corridors leading to 22 individual passenger berths arranged two deep a total of 44 berths for saloon as a whole forward part of saloon nearest engine room contained two ladies or private sitting rooms which could be accessed without entering saloon from 12 nearest passenger berths reserved for females opposite end of saloon opened onto stern windows broad iron staircases at both ends of saloon ran to main deck above and dining saloon below saloon was painted in delicate tints furnished along its length with fixed chairs of oak and supported by 12 decorated pillars beneath after saloon was main or dining saloon long by wide with dining tables and chairs capable of accommodating up to 360 people at one sitting on each side of saloon seven corridors opened onto four berths each for a total number of berths per side of 28 56 altogether forward end of saloon was connected to a stewards galley while opposite end contained several tiers of sofas this saloon was apparently ship s most impressive of all passenger spaces columns of white and gold 24 in number with ornamental capitals of great beauty were arranged down its length and along walls while eight arabesque pilasters decorated with beautifully painted oriental flowers and birds enhanced aesthetic effect archways of doors were tastefully carved and gilded and surmounted with medallion heads mirrors around walls added an illusion of spaciousness and walls themselves were painted in a delicate lemon tinted hue with highlights of blue and gold two forward saloons were arranged in a similar plan to after saloons with upper promenade saloon having 36 berths per side and lower 30 totalling 132 further forward separate from passenger saloons were crew quarters overall finish of passenger quarters was unusually restrained for its time a probable reflection of proprietors diminishing capital reserves total cost of construction of ship not including ps53 000 for plant and equipment to build her was ps117 000 ps47 000 more than her original projected price tag of ps70 000 service history transatlantic service thumb main funnel on 26 july 1845 seven years after great western steamship company had decided to build a second ship and five years overdue great britain embarked on her maiden voyage from liverpool to new york under captain james hosken with 45 passengers ship made passage in 14 days and 21 hours at an average speed of almost slower than prevailing record she made return trip in 13 1 2 days again an unexceptional time brunel who prior to commencement of service had substituted a six bladed windmill design of his own for smith s proven four bladed propeller design now decided to try to improve speed by riveting an extra two inches of iron to each propeller blade on her next crossing to new york carrying 104 passengers ship ran into heavy weather losing a mast and three propeller blades on 13 october she ran aground on massachusetts shoals she was refloated and after obtaining a supply of coal from american schooner david coffin resumed her voyage after repairs in new york she set out for liverpool with only 28 passengers and lost four propeller blades during crossing by this time another design flaw had become evident ship rolled heavily especially in calm weather without steadying influence of sail causing discomfort to passengers shareholders of company again provided further funding to try to solve problems six bladed propeller was dispensed with and replaced with original four bladed cast iron design third mast was removed and iron rigging which had proven unsatisfactory was replaced with conventional rigging in a major alteration two bilge keels were added to each side in an effort to lessen her tendency to roll these repairs and alterations delayed her return to service until following year thumb left stranded in dundrum bay 1846 in her second season of service in 1846 great britain successfully completed two round trips to new york at an acceptable speed but was then laid up for repairs to one of her chain drums which showed an unexpected degree of wear embarking on her third passage of season to new york her captain made a series of navigational errors that resulted in her being run hard aground in dundrum bay on northeast coast of ireland on 22 september there was no formal inquiry but it has been recently suggested that it was mainly due to captain not having updated charts so that he mistook new st john s light for calf light on isle of man she remained aground for almost a year protected by temporary measures organised by brunel and james bremner on 25 august 1847 she was floated free at a cost of ps34 000 and taken back to liverpool but this expense exhausted company s remaining reserves after languishing in prince s dock liverpool for some time she was sold to gibbs bright co former agents of great western steamship company for a mere ps25 000 refit and return to service thumb great britain in 1853 after her refit to four masts new owners decided not merely to give vessel a total refit keel badly damaged during grounding was completely renewed along a length of and owners took opportunity to further strengthen hull old were replaced and ten new ones laid which ran entire length of keel both bow and stern were also strengthened by heavy frames of double angle iron reflecting rapid advances in propeller engine technology original engines were removed and replaced with a pair of smaller lighter and more modern oscillating engines with cylinders and stroke built by john penn sons of greenwich they were also provided with more support at base and supported further by addition of both iron and wood beams running transversely across hull which had added benefit of reducing engine vibration cumbersome chain drive gearing was replaced with a simpler and by now proven cog wheel arrangement although gearing of engines to propeller shaft remained at a ratio of one to three three large boilers were replaced with six smaller ones operating at or twice pressure of their predecessors along with a new cabin on main deck smaller boilers allowed cargo capacity to be almost doubled from 1 200 to 2 200 tons four bladed propeller was replaced by a slightly smaller three bladed model and bilge keels previously added to reduce tendency to roll were replaced by a heavy external oak keel for same purpose five masted schooner sail plan was replaced by four masts two of which were square rigged with refit complete great britain went back into service on new york run after only one further round trip she was sold again to antony gibbs sons which planned to place her into england australia service australian service antony gibbs sons may have intended to employ great britain only to exploit a temporary demand for passenger service to australian gold fields following discovery of gold in victoria in 1851 but she found long term employment on this route for her new role she was given a third refit her passenger accommodation was increased from 360 to 730 and her sail plan altered to a traditional three masted square rigged pattern she was fitted with a removable propeller which could be hauled up on deck by chains to reduce drag when under sail power alone in 1852 great britain made her first voyage to melbourne australia carrying 630 emigrants she excited great interest there with 4 000 people paying a shilling each to inspect her she operated on england australia route for almost 30 years interrupted only by two relatively brief as a troopship during crimean war and indian mutiny gradually she earned a reputation as most reliable of emigrant ships to australia and carried first english cricket team to tour australia in 1861 alexander reid writing in 1862 recorded some statistics of a typical voyage ship with a crew of 143 put out from liverpool on 21 october 1861 carrying 544 passengers including english cricket team that was first to visit australia a cow 36 sheep 140 pigs 96 goats and 1 114 chickens ducks geese and turkeys journey to melbourne her ninth occupied 64 days during which best day s run was 354 miles and worst 108 with favourable winds ship travelled under sail alone screw being withdrawn from water three passengers died en route captain was john gray a scot who had held post since before crimean war on thursday 8 october 1868 argus melbourne reported to day at daylight fine steamship great britain will leave her anchorage in hobson s bay for liverpool direct on this occasion she carries less than her usual complement of passengers season not being a favourite one with colonists desiring to visit their native land great britain however has a full cargo and carries gold to value of about ps250 000 as she is in fine trim we shall probably have in due time to congratulate captain gray on having achieved another successful voyage gray died under mysterious circumstances going missing overnight during a return voyage from melbourne on night of 25 26 november 1872 later history thumb left ship s mizzen mast in port stanley in 1882 great britain was converted into a sailing ship to transport bulk coal she made her final voyage in 1886 after loading up with coal and leaving penarth dock for panama on 8 february after a fire on board en route she was found on arrival at port stanley in falkland islands to be damaged beyond economic repair she was sold to falkland islands company and used afloat as a storage hulk coal bunker until 1937 when she was towed to sparrow cove from port stanley scuttled and abandoned as a bunker she coaled south atlantic fleet that defeated admiral graf maximilian von spee s fleet in first world war battle of falkland islands in second world war some of her iron was scavenged to repair one of royal navy ships that fought graf spee and was badly damaged during battle of river plate recovery and restoration salvage operation made possible by several large donations including from sir jack hayward and sir paul getty was organised by ss great britain project chaired by richard goold adams ewan corlett conducted a naval architect s survey reporting that she could be refloated a submersible pontoon iii was chartered in february 1970 a german tug varius ii was chartered reaching port stanley on 25 march by 13 april after some concern about a crack in hull ship was mounted successfully on pontoon and following day tug pontoon and great britain sailed to port stanley for preparations for transatlantic voyage voyage code name voyage 47 began on 24 april stopped in montevideo from 2 may to 6 may for inspection then across atlantic arriving at barry docks west of cardiff on 22 june voyage 47 was chosen as code name because it was on her 47th voyage from penarth in 1886 that during a tempest she had sought shelter in falklands bristol based tugs then took over and towed her still on her pontoon to avonmouth docks ship was then taken off pontoon in preparation for her re entry into bristol now truly afloat on sunday 5 july amidst considerable media interest ship was towed up river avon to bristol perhaps most memorable moment for crowds that lined final few miles was her passage under clifton suspension bridge another brunel design she waited for two weeks in cumberland basin for a tide high enough to get her back through locks to floating harbour and her birthplace dry dock in great western dockyard now a grade ii listed building disused since bomb damage in second world war thumb 220px left air seal around great britains hull recovery and subsequent voyage from falklands to bristol were depicted in 1970 bbc chronicle programme great iron ship original intent was to restore her to her 1843 state however philosophy changed and conservation of all surviving pre 1970 material became aim in 1984 ss great britain was designated as a historic mechanical engineering landmark by american society of mechanical engineers fourth such designation outside usa by 1998 an extensive survey discovered that hull was continuing to corrode in humid atmosphere of dock and estimates gave her 25 years before she corroded away extensive conservation work began which culminated in installation of a glass plate across dry dock at level of her water line with two dehumidifiers keeping space beneath at 20 relative humidity sufficiently dry to preserve surviving material this being completed ship was re launched in july 2005 and visitor access to dry dock was restored site is visited by over 150 000 visitors per year with a peak in numbers in 2006 when 200 000 people visited awards engineers fenton holloway won award for heritage buildings in 2006 for restoration of great britain in may of that
