fredmans epistlar english fredman s epistles or epistles of fredman is a collection of 82 poems set to music by carl michael bellman a major figure in swedish 18th century song though first published in 1790 it was created over a period of twenty years from 1768 onwards a companion volume fredmans sanger fredman s songs was published following year epistles vary widely in style and effect from rococo themed pastorale with a cast of gods and demigods from classical antiquity to laments for effects of drinking tavern scenes and apparent improvisations lyrics based on lives of bellman s contemporaries in age sweden describe a gallery of fictional and semi fictional characters and events taking place in stockholm jean fredman an alcoholic former watchmaker is central character and fictional narrator soliloquy of epistle 23 a description of fredman lying drunk in gutter and then recovering in crawl in tavern was described by oscar levertin as to be or not to be of swedish literature britten austin 1967 page 61 ulla winblad based on one of bellman s friends is chief of fictional nymphs she is half goddess half prostitute a key figure among demimonde characters of fredman s epistles epistles are admired for way that their poetry and music fit so well together bellman chose not to compose tunes instead borrowing and adapting existing melodies most likely to exploit humour of contrasting associations of well known tunes with meanings he gave them this may also have been intended to provide historical depth to his work he sometimes devoted considerable energy to adapting melodies to fit an epistle s needs many of epistles have remained culturally significant in scandinavia especially in sweden they are widely sung and recorded by choirs such as orphei drangar by professional solo singers such as fred akerstrom and cornelis vreeswijk and by ensemble singers such as sven bertil taube and william clauson epistles have been translated into german french english russian polish finnish italian and dutch overview thumb left bellman s artistry in songs of fredman s epistles has been compared with william hogarth s work as a painter as here in gin lane 1751 bellman wrote a total of 82 fredman s epistles starting in 1768 overall theme of epistles is on surface drinking and its effects but epistles are very far from being drinking songs instead they are a diverse collection of songs often telling stories they are sometimes romantically pastoral sometimes serious even mournful but always dramatic full of life together they paint in words and music a canvas of their age britten austin 1967 page 11 they are populated by a lengthy cast of characters and set firmly in bellman s time and place eighteenth century stockholm but are simultaneously decorated for romantic or humorous effect in rococo style as a result listeners are confronted with both striking realism and classical imagery within these general themes epistles follow no discernible pattern and do not join together to tell any single story their tunes too are borrowed from a variety of sources often french words that are fitted to tunes are often in parodic contrast to their original themes very likely achieving humorous effects on their eighteenth century audiences fredman s epistles are thus not easy to categorise and critic johan henric kellgren stated that bellman s songs had no model and can have no successors britten austin 1967 page 60 bellman was a skilful and entertaining performer of his songs accompanying himself on putting on different voices and imitating sounds made by a crowd of people he is unusual even unique among major poets in that almost all of his work was conceived to music his achievement has been compared to shakespeare beethoven mozart and hogarth bellman however was no great playwright nor a major classical composer his biographer paul britten austin suggests that comparison with hogarth is closer to mark bellman had a gift for using elegant classical references in comic contrast to sordid realities of drinking and prostitution way he does this at once regretting and celebrating these excesses in song achieves something of what hogarth achieved in engravings and paint art historian axel describes bellman s sensibility as if he had been a painter an unusual swiftness of apprehension both optical and aural must have distinguished him britten austin 1967 page 125 britten austin agrees with this noting that when bellman s words and music have faded into silence it is visual image which remains jan comments in historical dictionary of scandinavian literature and theater that bellman s achievement consists in taking this humble and unrecognized literary form drinking song and raising it to a genre that became impossible to ignore while in process creating songs and characters that have become an indispensable part of sweden s literary and cultural heritage epistles thumb upright detail of watercolour by johan fredrik martin of a scene reminiscent of ulla winblad s journey back from lake malaren to stockholm in epistle no 48 solen glimmar blank och trind many of 82 fredman s epistles remain popular in sweden their diverse styles and themes may be illustrated with examples of some of best known songs to begin with no 23 ach du min alas thou my mother which has been described as to be or not to be of swedish literature tells in realist style story of a drunk who wakes in a stockholm gutter outside crawl in tavern he curses his parents for conceiving him perhaps upon a table as he looks at his torn clothes then tavern door opens and he goes in and has his first drink song ends with loud thanks to drunk s mother and father britten austin 1967 pages 60 93 in contrast rococo no 28 i gar sag jag ditt barn min froja yesterday i saw thy child my freya tells tale of an attempt to arrest nymph ulla winblad based on a real event bellman here combines realism ulla wearing a black embroidered bodice and losing her watch in a named street in stockholm s gamla stan with images from classical mythology such as a myrtle crown and an allusion to goddess aphrodite quite a different tone is set in no 40 ge rum i din hund make room in wedding hall you dog as some unruly soldiers interfere in a chaotic wedding mixing roughly with musicians and wedding party shouts of shoulder arms and panic at a chimney fire combine with a complex rhyming pattern to create a humorous picture of disastrous event massengale 1979 pages 112 116 story ends with priest pocketing some of collection money a later epistle no 48 solen glimmar blank och trind sun smooth and round narrates relaxed and peaceful journey of a boat bringing ulla winblad home to stockholm across lake malaren on a lovely spring morning after a night of carousing boatmen call to each other apparently haphazardly but each detail helps to create a pastoral vision as gradually wind blows up in fallen sails pennant stretches and with an oar olle stands on a song is one of bellman s greatest creating an incomparable panorama of that eighteenth century stockholm which meets us in elias martin s canvasses no 71 ulla min ulla saj far jag dig ulla my ulla say may i offer thee is another of best loved pastoral epistles and melody may well be by bellman himself it imagines how fredman sitting on horseback outside ulla s window at on a summer s day invites her to come and dine with him on reddest strawberries in milk and wine britten austin 1967 pages 155 156 following epistle no 72 glimmande nymf gleaming nymph is a night piece set to an andante melody from a french opera comique it describes in erotic detail nymph asleep in her bed to create desired mood of rising excitement bellman creates a rainbow after sunset britten austin comments that audience does not even notice massengale 1979 page 100 meanwhile no 80 liksom en herdinna like a shepherdess in her best dress is a pastorale almost paraphrasing nicolas boileau despreaux s french guide to construction of pastoral verse starting with as a shepherdess splendidly dressed by spring one day in june gathers from grass s rosy bed adornments and accents for her dress effect is of an almost religious invocation final epistle no 82 vid denna kalla rest by this spring is both pastoral and rococo depicting a little breakfast in stockholm countryside red wine flows there is roast chicken and an almond tart flowers of a thousand kinds are all around a stallion parades in a field with his mare and foal a bull roars a cockerel hops on roof and a magpie chatters meanwhile musicians are exhorted to blow along with wind god eol small love sprites are asked to sing and ulla is called a nymph final chorus asks

characters who take part in more or less real events in and around stockholm of bellman s time this cast includes some 44 named personages many of whom appear only once or twice some like principal characters jean fredman and ulla winblad are based on real people and in fredman s case his real name was used fredman of epistles is an alcoholic former watchmaker and is central character and fictional narrator he is thus supposedly present in all epistles but is only named in a few of them backdrop of many of epistles stockholm s taverns is also frequented by musicians including christian wingmark on flute father berg on various instruments father movitz and dance master corporal a particular group is order of bacchus orden to become a member one must be seen lying in a drunken stupor

contemporary stockholm bellman himself provided a list of descriptions of his characters giving a brief pen portrait of each one like anders wingmark a former clothier in very cheerful and full of commonsense different characters appear in different epistles making them realistically episodic there is a fire in epistle 34 a funeral is busily prepared in epistles 46 and 47 and a fight breaks out in epistle 53 many of songs are about effects of strong drink from damage to lund tavern in epistle 12 to masterly portrait of a drunkard lying in gutter of epistle 23 described by oscar levertin as to be or not to be of swedish literature pastoral epistles too give impression of being in real places with flesh and blood people at specific times of day epistle 48 tells how friends return to stockholm by boat after a night out on lake malaren one summer morning in 1769 each of its twenty one verses paints a picture of a moment in peaceful journey from wind stirring fallen sails skipper s daughter coming out of her cabin cockerel crowing church clock striking four in morning sun glimmering on calm water effects may seem to be haphazard but each stanza is a little picture framed by its melody we remember it all seem to have lived through it like a morning in our own lives britten austin calls it a new vision of natural and urban scene fresh as martin s detailed as hogarth s frail and ethereal as watteau s britten austin 1967 pages 103 105 thumb upright an 1825 broadside with fredman s epistle no 30 ur ditt glas se pa dig vantar in paul britten austin s translation drain off thy glass see death upon thee waiting britten austin tempers his praise for bellman s realism with observation that effects are chosen to work in song rather than to be strictly correct or even possible thus in epistle 72 glimmande nymf memorable rainbow with its glowing colours of purple gold and green is seen after nightfall he comments never mind it is a beautiful scene even if its chronology calls for much poetic license or in epistle 80 liksom en herdinna farmer is for some reason going to or coming from market on a sunday when market would be closed and his cart heavy on staggering wheel must have been absurdly full if it contained chickens lambs and calves all at once but it had to be a sunday to allow ulla winblad to step out of her swaying chaise on an outing from city britten austin remarks that until such solecisms are actually pointed out one does not even notice them it is same with meals which would cause terrible indigestion if listener actually had to eat them but as a feast for mind eye and ear they are highly satisfactory imagination filled with all poetic wealth that bellman provides britten austin 1967 page 132 literary historian lars warme observes that bellman s sharp eye for detail has brought him praise for being first swedish realist but at once balances this by saying that warme credits bellman with a good knowledge of a literary craftsman s tools using rhetoric and classical knowledge to provide a theatrical backdrop for his tavern folk result is an astonishing mixture of realism and wild mythological fantasy set to complicated musical structures fitted to music thumb upright 1 25 sheet music for fredman s epistle 80 liksom en herdinna as a shepherdess a pastorale critic johan henric kellgren in his introduction to first edition found that songs could not be known fully only as poems never before he stated had art of poetry and art of music been more fraternally united they were not kellgren argued verse that had been set to music not music set to verse but two were so thoroughly melted together into one beauty that it was impossible to see which would most miss other for its fulfilment quoting this in final paragraph of his thesis musicologist james massengale commented that is how it ought to be said massengale 1979 page 150 massengale argues that given that music is so important in epistles and that bellman had more than enough musical skill to write a tune it is remarkable that all or almost all tunes are borrowed he suggests that this seems to indicate that bellman wanted to preserve some vestige of borrowing that borrowing was not just about saving effort or making up for absent skill massengale argues is demonstrated by fact that amount of work bellman had to put into melodies for epistles 12 grat fader berg och and 24 kara syster was surely tantamount to production of new melodies borrowing was accepted even encouraged at time but that does not explain why bellman would have done it so consistently poetic possibility massengale suggests is that bellman wished to exploit humorous contrast between a melody of one type and a story of another or between an existing image associated with melody and a fresh one presented in an epistle in addition bellman was able to use what his audience knew to be borrowed music to reinforce historical flavour of epistles introducing exactly kind of ambiguity that he was seeking massengale 1979 pages 78 79 massengale points out that in epistles bellman employs a variety of methods to make poetry work for example in epistle 35 fara val bellman uses a panoply of metrical devices to counteract metrically plodding melody he uses rhetorical figure repeating last word of a clause at start of next in verse 3 with jag barnet barnet det dog got i child child died and again in verse 4 he uses repeating first word of a clause at its end in verse 3 with men min anna greta men but my anna greta but and again in verse 5 and he uses anaphora repeating a word at starts of neighbouring clauses in verse 4 hall den pa hall man fyra pour pour out four and again in verse 5 massengale observes that good musical poetry like this epistle is always a compromise as it has both to fit its music or be no good as a musical setting and to contrast with its music or be no good as poetry final verse containing all three metrical devices is not argues massengale an example of decay but shows bellman s freedom change of focus from lament to acceptance and closure of epistle massengale 1979 pages 147 148 impact in bellman s lifetime king gustav iii called bellman il signor master improviser bellman is said to have had an enormous reputation in his lifetime critic kellgren however objected both to bellman s fame and to his flouting of rules of good literary taste kellgren put his objections into verse britten austin 1967 pages 120 123 in other words bellman was a tavern admittedly with a wonderful gift of improvisation who wildly ignored rules of literary genres for example within classical tradition odes and satires were supposed to have different metres and different use of language kellgren did not mind amoral attitude indeed he shared it but an epistle like no 28 traversed all moods from lyrical to humorous tragic descriptive and dramatic it was too much for critics such as kellgren in later times thumb left 19th century illustration for ulla winblad kara syster du ar och fredman s epistle no 3 by carl 1810 1858 bellman was sung with delight by students and schoolchildren from start of 19th century romantic movement treated bellman as an inspired genius whereas later he was admired more for his artistic skill and literary innovation research into bellman s work began in 19th century bellman society formalised bellman studies with their standard edition and their publications in 20th century towards end of 20th century an increasing number of doctoral theses have been written on bellman s life and work many of songs have remained culturally significant in scandinavia especially in sweden where bellman remains widely popular to this day in 1989 swedish government subsided an edition of bellman s epistles and songs with illustrations by peter dahl to bring texts to a wide audience hassler and dahl 1989 cover bellman has been compared with poets and musicians as diverse as 1996 page 149 and beethoven hassler and dahl 1989 page 6 kleveland notes that he has been called swedish poetry s mozart and hogarth observing that britten austin says instead simply that charles wharton stork commented in his 1917 anthology of swedish verse that anthologist finds little to pause over until he comes to poetry of karl mikael bellman 1740 1795 but here he must linger long describing him as a master of improvisation stork 1917 page xvii he wrote performance and recordings epistles are widely sung and recorded by amateur choirs and professional singers alike orphei drangar orpheus s farmhands are a choir named for a phrase in epistle 14 and set up to perform bellman s works they give concerts of music by many composers around world several professional solo singers in swedish ballad tradition largely made their name in 1960s singing bellman while accompanying themselves in style with a guitar they were members of storks artistic community in stockholm and they include fred akerstrom 1937 1985 with his albums fred bellman glimmande nymf and vila vid denna kalla and cornelis vreeswijk with his albums spring mot ulla spring and movitz movitz hassler and dahl 1989 pages 284 285 other singers such as sven bertil taube and william clauson used less authentic accompaniment of an ensemble clauson was also first to release a recording of bellman in english alongside his swedish recordings britten austin 1967 page 180 singers from other traditions sometimes sing bellman for example folk singer sofia karlsson and rock musician editions thumb pastoral head piece engraving in first edition 1790 edition was only one to appear in bellman s lifetime it was published by olof ahlstrom by royal privilege he held a monopoly on printing of sheet music in sweden ahlstrom arranged songs for piano and kellgren edited song texts and wrote an introduction but extent of their influence on shape of fredman s epistles cannot be fully determined edition was illustrated with a frontispiece by leading swedish artist johan tobias sergel engraved by johan fredrik martin corpus of published epistles did not change after bellman s death many minor selections from epistles have been published sometimes with illustrations and introductions epistles have been translated at least partially into danish german french english russian polish finnish norwegian italian spanish and dutch as shown below english edition by britten austin is a selection of epistles and is in rhyming verse in original metre britten austin describes challenge of translation as difficult or impossible and admits that in one way his translations are inevitably a little faint he explains this is because bellman s colloquialisms which offended his contemporaries still strike swedish ears as language of everyday speech my renderings therefore may seem a trifle too antique in flavour but to have jumbled up as bellman brilliantly does modern sounding slang with graces of rococo diction would have produced a horrid effect britten austin 1967 pages 11 12 editions and selections of epistles some with illustrations some with music some printed together with fredman s
