referring to how its first season only had five episodes joyce millman of salon com stated that she disliked seinfelds pilot episode but after seeing a scene from ex girlfriend in which jerry and kramer discuss returning fruit she was awed by seinfeld and co creator writer larry david s brilliant grasp of a working class jewish craziness and b absurd humor of deeply mundane in a review of episode jon burlingame of spokesman review stated seinfeld is an offbeat take on standard sitcom concept while rarely hilarious it s often smart and amusing in his review of episode chicago tribune critic rick kogan stated hip without posing it delivers its comedy in sharp and spectacular style mike flaherty and mary kaye schilling of entertainment weekly called ex girlfriend series most multifaceted if not most engaging narrative so far and graded it with a b david sims gave episode an a writing george is really most revolutionary character he s often repulsive and pathetic but here these are traits we heartily enjoy and sympathize with and want more of best thing about this episode is that jerry almost immediately getting with george s ex girlfriend creates no drama in group though it would on almost any other sitcom a relatively negative review came from chicago sun times critic lon grahnke who criticized seinfeld s part in episode this comedy series must ride on shoulders of its star and seinfeld spends too much time shrugging he also noted dreyfus was not granted screentime as opposed to richards whose acting performances he described as get ting tiresome overall grahnke commented at his best seinfeld draws a chuckle or two from his middle brow remarks on modern life and its perplexing contradictions at his worst comedian shows smugness of a detached star who can mechanically control level of laughter that greets whatever quip he may utter references reflist 30em external links episode script ex girlfriend on sony pictures category 1991 american
