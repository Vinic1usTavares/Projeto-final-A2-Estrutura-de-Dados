hmas melbourne r21 was a majestic class light aircraft carrier of royal australian navy ran operating from 1955 until 1982 she was third and final conventional aircraft carrier to serve in ran melbourne was only commonwealth naval vessel to sink two friendly warships in peacetime collisions ship was laid down for royal navy as lead ship of majestic class in april 1943 and was launched as hms majestic in february 1945 at end of world war ii work on ship was suspended until she was purchased by ran in 1947 at time of purchase it was decided to incorporate new aircraft carrier technologies into design making melbourne third ship to be constructed with an angled flight deck delays in construction and integrating enhancements meant that carrier was not commissioned until 1955 melbourne never fired a shot in anger during her career having only peripheral non combat roles in relation to indonesia malaysia confrontation and vietnam war she was however involved in two major collisions with allied vessels though melbourne was found not to be primary cause of either incident first occurred on evening of 10 february 1964 in which melbourne rammed and sank ran destroyer when latter altered course across her bow eighty two of voyagers personnel were killed and two royal commissions were held to investigate incident second collision occurred in early morning of 3 june 1969 when melbourne also rammed united states navy usn destroyer in similar circumstances seventy four american personnel died and a joint usn ran board of inquiry was held these incidents along with several minor collisions shipboard accidents and aircraft losses led to reputation that melbourne was jinxed melbourne was paid off from ran service in 1982 a proposal to convert her for use as a floating casino failed and a 1984 sale was cancelled before she was sold for scrap in 1985 and towed to china for breaking scrapping was delayed so melbourne could be studied by people s liberation

fitting out of majestic and her five sister ships construction resumed in 1946 and major modifications to design were incorporated a review by australian government s defence committee held after recommended that post war forces of ran be structured around a task force incorporating multiple aircraft carriers donohue from empire defence to long haul p 33 initial plans were for three carriers
