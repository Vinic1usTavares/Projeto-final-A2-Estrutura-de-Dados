reviews from critics a v club reviewer myles mcnutt wrote that while series had two goals to perform by end of episode to turn nellie into a relatable character and break andy and jessica up he felt that both plots failed in execution he wrote that because audience knew nothing about jessica and that he had already given up on nellie as a character episode ultimately became an unfunny experience he ultimately gave episode a c cindy white of ign compared writer s attempt to humanize nellie to previous seasons specifically dundies when writers humanized michael and wrote that she hoped writers would continue to do this with nellie she also went on to praise interaction between jim and pam saying their ability to communicate volumes with a few words or merely a glance demonstrates why their chemistry has been so difficult to replicate with other couples despite her mainly positive review she criticized andy and erin subplot because she neither cared about jessica or andy and erin s relationship and called whole subplot a waste of time she ultimately gave episode a 7 5 10 calling it good writing for new york lucy teitler unfavorably compared andy erin plotline to jim and pam s from early seasons of series writing that romance was not able to take off because erin has no real agency and that scene where andy returned to bachelorette party felt too superficial to reach its potential of becoming a classic office scene cold open received particularly positive reviews from critics myles mcnutt called it clever and noted that even he had forgotten whether stanley had a mustache lucy teitler positively compared it to guys and dolls cindy white considered a great ensemble bit and that it showed promise for episode although it did not reach that promise references
