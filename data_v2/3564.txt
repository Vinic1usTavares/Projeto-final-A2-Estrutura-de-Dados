attractions including several copies of gettysburg cyclorama once an individual had seen a particular cyclorama it was unlikely that they would purchase a ticket to revisit it this meant that low quality copies could be exhibited with a very low risk that a ticket holder would request a refund as they would likely never have seen original tickets could be sold at same price as admission to see an original and exhibitor of a buck eye could visit original themselves obtain copies of all of pamphlets and promotional materials and have them cheaply copied for sale alongside attraction in fact
