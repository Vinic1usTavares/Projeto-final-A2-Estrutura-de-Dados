order to provide a national body in united kingdom which could organise and support rapidly growing number of scout patrols and troops which had begun to form spontaneously following publication of scouting for boys and scout magazine in 1908 it was also wish of baden powell to wrest control of scouting from his book s publishers as it was felt scout movement was not given status it deserved as

participating in rough and tumble and wild activities of scouts and so girl guides were created by baden powell and his sister agnes to provide a more proper programme of activities solution for younger boys was creation of younger wolf cubs section which was trialed from 1914 and openly launched in 1916 later many of those who had grown out of scouts still wanted to be a part of scouting resulting in another section rover scouts for those over 18 being created in 1918 scouting spread throughout british empire and wider world on 4 january 1912 boy scouts association was incorporated

1966 and changes were implemented later that year and throughout 1967 as a result word boy was dropped from association s name which was changed to scout association and major changes were made to sections and their respective programmes youngest section were now named cub scouts boy scout section was renamed simply as scout section and senior scouts and rover scout section was replaced with venture scouts for 16 to 20 year olds scout uniform was also changed with inclusion of long trousers for scouts as opposed to compulsory wearing of knee length shorts and wearing of a beret instead of

variety of topics such as public relations and information technology developing practical and employability skills new badges drew mixed reactions from several public figures with some praising association for moving with times and others feeling changes went against scouting ethos of baden powell further changes took place in 2003 when association s adult training scheme was relaunched to be more focused and targeted to volunteers individual role as opposed to more general training received before association also began to change in its focus with a renewed emphasis on outdoor

tests and how to pass them commemorative 1914 edition michael o mara books ltd pp 13 18 with creation of wolf cub section in 1916 a similar system was devised awards being first star and second star and an award called leaping wolf was added later which required cubs to move up to scout troop in parallel with this scheme cubs and scouts were able to earn proficiency badges for specific skills and hobbies an idea that baden powell probably copied from ernest thompson seton moynihan p 26 test requirements for baden powell s scheme were revised in 1944 and again in 1958 without altering basic structure moynihan pp 176 and 180 1966 advance party report recommended a wholly new progressive training scheme for cub scouts bronze silver and gold arrows for scouts scout standard advanced scout

but content has been revised and made more challenging beavers have to earn six challenge badges to gain bronze chief scout s award cubs seven for silver and scouts nine for gold final three awards chief scout s platinum and diamond awards and queen s scout award are available in explorer scout and scout network sections awards build on requirements of duke of edinburgh s award at bronze silver and gold level respectively consisting of a period of time volunteering in local community a prolonged physical activity advancement of a skill and undertaking an expedition allowing a participant to achieve both and scout award at same time in addition these three awards do not have to be completed in order and participants can skip straight to a specific award although additional work is involved achieving queen s scout award is seen as a significant event on a national scale recipients of award are invited to join st george s day service at windsor castle year after completing scheme and parade before queen or her representative awards for gallantry meritorious conduct and good service cornwell scout badge may be awarded to youth members who display pre eminently high character and devotion to duty together with great courage and endurance any member of association may be awarded gilt cross or silver cross for gallantry or bronze cross for special heroism or action in face

scout promise and law on my honour i promise that i will do my best to do my duty to god and to queen to help other people and to keep scout law for beavers and cubs a simpler promise is used cub scouts utilise normal promise with omission of opening on my honour and a change in final line to keep cub scout law while beaver scouts use a different promise altogether i promise to do my best to be kind and helpful and to love god in addition to promise there is a scout law which dictates what qualities a scout should hold scout law is as follows a scout is to be trusted a scout is loyal a scout is friendly and considerate a scout belongs to world wide family of scouts a scout has courage in all difficulties a scout makes good use of time and is careful of possessions and property a scout has self respect and respect for others this law is used for all sections except cubs and beavers beaver scouts have no law as these values are to be demonstrated through meetings themselves cub scout law is different again cub scouts always do their best think of others before themselves and do a good turn every day motto of association as with many other scouting organisations is be prepared variations of promise there are permitted variations to original scout promise to accommodate those whose faith or national allegiance are different association expects that phrases duty to god and to love god will be suitable for most faiths including christians hindus jews muslims and sikhs muslims who have difficulty with phrase on my honour because of islamic proscription of swearing oaths are able to say in name of allah most beneficent most merciful instead if they prefer also duty to allah and to queen may be used hindus and buddhists may promise duty to my dharma foreign nationals resident in united kingdom are able to promise to do their duty to god and to country in which i am now living although british subjects must include queen in their promise in 2012 association reviewed its fundamentals and launched a consultation to ask its members whether an alternative version of scout promise should be developed for atheists and those unable to make existing commitment scouting launches consultation on considering welcoming atheists as full members in 2013 it was announced that consultation had led to addition of an alternative promise for humanists and atheists scouts introduce additional alternative promise taking effect on 1 january 2014 members can choose to replace duty to god with to uphold our scout values change has been welcomed by representatives of church of england roman catholic church free churches group and british humanist association revised fundamentals of scouting alternative promise takes following form on my honour i promise that i will do my best to uphold our scout values to do my duty to queen to help other people and to keep scout law uniform thumb right one of baden powell s drawings for scouting for boys
