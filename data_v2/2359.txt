convinced routon to work on a turn based hitman game which became hitman go and released to what developers considered a positive response quick turn based puzzle concept itself came from a focus on short sessions while keeping bespoke series visual aesthetic like an elegant board game through many rounds of iteration team felt that their product distilled franchise s elements into its simplest form upon seeing hitman franchise reduced to its core elements development team saw a lara croft tomb raider version as an obvious next step or as they called it a go brainer team consisted of ten people on average who were able to work closely and similar to an indie development team they fit lara croft in hitman go setting and knew to change elements like less focus on assassinating foes less board game aesthetic more animations and more emphasis on environment than enemies team chose classic tomb raider visual design over that of series reboot but reconstructed that series aesthetic from memory rather than from its actual design documents they sought to recreate moments of being chased by a giant animal or boulder in place of time restraints like quick time events from series developers added floors that crack with each successive turn to give a sense of time based urgency team also emphasized gameplay for player to learn without tutorial and storytelling that did not interrupt play experience compared to previous game developers wanted lara croft go puzzles to have fewer elements and be completely visible without scrolling such that player could see puzzles in their entirety and focus instead on solving for correct sequence camera also follows croft rather than remaining stationary game was built in unity game engine which enabled faster prototyping across
