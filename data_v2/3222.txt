ctenophora singular ctenophore or from and phero to carry commonly known as comb jellies comprise a phylum of invertebrate animals that live in marine waters worldwide they are notable for groups of cilia they use for swimming commonly referred to as combs and they are largest animals to swim with help of cilia depending on species adult ctenophores range from a few millimeters to in size only 100 to 150 species have been validated and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named textbook examples are cydippids with egg shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla little tentacles that are covered with colloblasts sticky cells that capture prey their bodies consist of a mass of jelly with a layer two cells thick on outside and another lining internal cavity phylum has a wide range of body forms including egg shaped cydippids with retractable tentacles that capture prey flat generally platyctenids and large mouthed beroids which prey on other ctenophores almost all ctenophores function as predators taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to adults of small crustaceans exceptions are juveniles of two species which live as parasites on salps on which adults of their species feed despite their soft gelatinous bodies fossils thought to represent ctenophores appear in lagerstatten dating as far back as early cambrian about 525 million years ago position of ctenophores in tree of life has long been debated in molecular phylogenetics studies biologists proposed that ctenophores constitute second earliest branching animal lineage with sponges being sister group to all other multicellular animals other biologists once believed that ctenophores were emerging earlier than sponges which themselves appeared before split between cnidarians and bilaterians however reanalysis of data showed that computer algorithms used for analysis were misled by presence of specific ctenophore genes that were markedly different from those of other species a recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippid like and that all modern groups appeared relatively recently probably after cretaceous paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago evidence accumulating since 1980s indicates that cydippids are not monophyletic in other words they do not include all and only descendants of a single common ancestor because all other traditional ctenophore groups descend from various cydippids distinguishing features among animal phyla ctenophores are more complex than sponges about as complex as cnidarians jellyfish sea anemones etc and less complex than bilaterians which include almost all other animals unlike sponges both ctenophores and cnidarians have cells bound by inter cell connections and carpet like basement membranes muscles nervous systems and some have sensory organs ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts which are sticky and adhere to prey although a few ctenophore species lack them like sponges and cnidarians ctenophores have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jelly like material which is called mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly like layer hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic along with sponges both ctenophores and cnidarians have a type of muscle that in more complex animals arises from middle cell layer and as a result some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic while others still regard them as diploblastic comb jellies have more than 80 different cell types exceeding numbers from other groups like placozoans sponges cnidarians and some deep branching bilaterians ranging from about to in size ctenophores are largest non colonial animals that use cilia hairs as their main method of locomotion most species have eight strips called comb rows that run length of their bodies and bear comb like bands of cilia called ctenes stacked along comb rows so that when cilia beat those of each comb touch comb below

simple simple to complex muscles none mostly mostly myoepithelial mostly myocytes description thumb comb jelly aquarium chicago for a phylum with relatively few species ctenophores have a wide range of body plans coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study in addition oceanic species do not preserve well and are known mainly from photographs and from observers notes hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera pleurobrachia beroe and mnemiopsis at least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on cydippid pleurobrachia since body of many species is almost radially symmetrical main axis is oral to aboral from mouth to opposite end however since only two of canals near statocyst terminate in anal pores ctenophores have no mirror symmetry although many have rotational symmetry in other words if animal rotates in a half circle it looks same as when it started common features ctenophore phylum has a wide range of body forms including flattened deep sea platyctenids in which adults of most species lack combs and coastal beroids which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large stiffened cilia that act as teeth body layers like those of cnidarians jellyfish sea anemones etc ctenophores bodies consist of a relatively thick jelly like mesoglea sandwiched between two epithelia layers of cells bound by inter cell connections and by a fibrous basement membrane that they secrete epithelia of ctenophores have two layers of cells rather than one and some of cells in upper layer have several cilia per cell outer layer of epidermis outer skin consists of sensory cells cells that secrete mucus which protects body and interstitial cells which can transform into other types of cell in specialized parts of body outer layer also contains colloblasts found along surface of tentacles and used in capturing prey or cells bearing multiple large cilia for locomotion inner layer of epidermis contains a nerve net and myoepithelial cells that act as muscles internal cavity forms a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles a pharynx throat a wider area in center that acts as a stomach and a system of internal canals these branch through mesoglea to most active parts of animal mouth and pharynx roots of tentacles if present all along underside of each comb row and four branches around sensory complex at far end from mouth two of these four branches terminate in anal pores inner surface of cavity is lined with an epithelium gastrodermis mouth and pharynx have both cilia and well developed muscles in other parts of canal system gastrodermis is different on sides nearest to and furthest from organ that it supplies nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells that store nutrients in vacuoles internal compartments germ cells that produce eggs or sperm and photocytes that produce bioluminescence side furthest from organ is covered with ciliated cells that circulate water through canals punctuated by ciliary rosettes pores that are surrounded by double whorls of cilia and connect to mesoglea feeding excretion and respiration when prey is swallowed it is liquefied in pharynx by enzymes and by muscular contractions of pharynx resulting slurry is wafted through canal system by beating of cilia and digested by nutritive cells ciliary rosettes in canals may help to transport nutrients to muscles in mesoglea anal pores may eject unwanted small particles but most unwanted matter is regurgitated via mouth little is known about how ctenophores get rid of waste products produced by cells ciliary rosettes in gastrodermis may help to remove wastes from mesoglea and may also help to adjust animal s buoyancy by pumping water into or out of mesoglea locomotion outer surface bears usually eight comb rows called swimming plates which are used for swimming rows are oriented to run from near mouth oral pole to opposite end aboral pole and are spaced more or less evenly around body although spacing patterns vary by species and in most species comb rows extend only part of distance from aboral pole towards mouth combs also called ctenes or comb plates run across each row and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia up to unlike conventional cilia and flagella which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 2 pattern these cilia are arranged in a 9 3 pattern where extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function these normally beat so that propulsion stroke is away from mouth although they can also reverse direction hence ctenophores usually swim in direction in which mouth is eating unlike jellyfish when trying to escape predators one species can accelerate to six times its normal speed some other species reverse direction as part of their escape behavior by reversing power stroke of comb plate cilia it is uncertain how ctenophores control their buoyancy but experiments have shown that some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater if they enter less dense brackish water ciliary rosettes in body cavity may pump this into mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density to avoid sinking conversely if they move from brackish to full strength seawater rosettes may pump water out of mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density nervous system and senses ctenophores have no brain or central nervous system but instead have a nerve net rather like a cobweb that forms a ring round mouth and is densest near structures such as comb rows pharynx tentacles if present and sensory complex furthest from mouth their nerve cells arise from same progenitor cells as colloblasts tentacles of comb jellies may have revealed when nerve cells first evolved largest single sensory feature is aboral organ at opposite end from mouth its main component is a statocyst a balance sensor consisting of a statolith a tiny grain of calcium carbonate supported on four bundles of cilia called balancers that sense its orientation statocyst is protected by a transparent dome made of long immobile cilia a ctenophore does not automatically try to keep statolith resting equally on all balancers instead its response is determined by animal s mood in other words overall state of nervous system for example if a ctenophore with trailing tentacles captures prey it will often put some comb rows into reverse spinning mouth towards prey ctenophore nerve cells and nervous system have different biochemistry as compared to other animals for instance they lack genes and enzymes required to manufacture neurotransmitters like serotonin dopamine nitric oxide octopamine noradrenaline and others otherwise seen in all other animals with a nervous system with genes coding for receptors for each of these neurotransmitters missing they have been found to use l glutamate as a neurotransmitter and have an unusually high variety of glutamate receptors and genes for glutamate synthesis and transport compared to other metazoans therefore if ctenophores are sister group to all other metazoans nervous systems may have either been lost in sponges and placozoans or arisen more than once among metazoans cydippids thumb sp a cydippid ctenophore cydippid ctenophores have bodies that are more or less rounded sometimes nearly spherical and other times more cylindrical or egg shaped common coastal sea gooseberry pleurobrachia sometimes has an egg shaped body with mouth at narrow end although some individuals are more uniformly round from opposite sides of body extends a pair of long slender tentacles each housed in a sheath into which it can be withdrawn some species of cydippids have bodies that are flattened to various extents so that they are wider in plane of tentacles tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla little tentacles although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it colloblasts are specialized mushroom shaped cells in outer layer of epidermis and have three main components a domed head with vesicles chambers that contain adhesive a stalk that anchors cell in lower layer of epidermis or in mesoglea and a spiral thread that coils round stalk and is attached to head and to root of stalk function of spiral thread is uncertain but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape and thus prevent from being torn apart in addition to colloblasts members of genus haeckelia which feed mainly on jellyfish incorporate their victims stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles some cnidaria eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense tentilla of euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids they contain striated muscle a cell type otherwise unknown in phylum ctenophora and they are coiled when relaxed while tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed euplokamis tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey they may flick out very quickly in 40 to 60 milliseconds they can wriggle which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms and they coil round prey unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of striated muscle wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles but of a highly specialized type coiling around prey is accomplished largely by return of tentilla to their inactive state but coils may be tightened by smooth muscle there are eight rows of combs that run from near mouth to opposite end and are spaced evenly round body combs beat in a rhythm rather like that of a mexican wave from each balancer in statocyst a ciliary groove runs out under dome and then splits to connect with two adjacent comb rows and in some species runs along comb rows this forms a mechanical system for transmitting beat rhythm from combs to balancers via water disturbances created by cilia lobates thumb bathocyroe a common but fragile deep sea lobate oriented mouth down lobata has a pair of lobes which are muscular cuplike extensions of body that project beyond mouth their inconspicuous tentacles originate from corners of mouth running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over inner surface of lobes rather than trailing far behind as in cydippida between lobes on either side of mouth many species of lobates have four auricles gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward mouth this combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey lobates have eight comb rows originating at aboral pole and usually not extending beyond body to lobes in species with four auricles cilia edging auricles are extensions of cilia in four of comb rows most lobates are quite passive when moving through water using cilia on their comb rows for propulsion although leucothea has long and active auricles whose movements also contribute to propulsion members of lobate genera bathocyroe and can escape from danger by clapping their lobes so that jet of expelled water drives them back very quickly unlike cydippids movements of lobates combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by cilia yet combs on same row beat in same mexican wave style as mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids this may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have less egg like shapes an unusual species first described in 2000 has been classified as a lobate although lobes are primitive and body is medusa like when floating and disk like when resting on sea bed beroids thumb beroe sp swimming with open mouth at left this animal is 3 6 cm long beroida also known as nuda have no feeding appendages but their large pharynx just inside large mouth and filling most of saclike body bears macrocilia at oral end these fused bundles of several thousand large cilia are able to bite off pieces of prey that are too large to swallow whole almost always other ctenophores in front of field of macrocilia on mouth lips in some species of beroe is a pair of narrow strips of adhesive epithelial cells on stomach wall that zip mouth shut when animal is not feeding by forming intercellular connections with opposite adhesive strip this tight closure streamlines front of animal when it is pursuing prey other body forms ganeshida has a pair of small oral lobes and a pair of tentacles body is circular rather than oval in cross section and pharynx extends over inner surfaces of lobes thalassocalycida only discovered in 1978 and known from only one species are medusa like with bodies that are shortened in oral aboral direction and short comb rows on surface furthest from mouth originating from near aboral pole they capture prey by movements of bell and possibly by using two short tentacles cestida belt animals are ribbon shaped planktonic animals with mouth and aboral organ aligned in middle of opposite edges of ribbon there is a pair of comb rows along each aboral edge and tentilla emerging from a groove all along oral edge which stream back across most of wing like body surface can swim by undulating their bodies as well as by beating of their comb rows there are two known species with worldwide distribution in warm and warm temperate waters veneris venus girdle is among largest ctenophores up to long and can undulate slowly or quite rapidly which is typically less than long can move much faster in what has been described as a darting motion most platyctenida have oval bodies that are flattened in oral aboral direction with a pair of tentilla bearing tentacles on aboral surface they cling to and creep on surfaces by everting pharynx and using it as a muscular foot all but one of known species lack comb rows platyctenids are usually cryptically colored live on rocks algae or body surfaces of other invertebrates and are often revealed by their long tentacles with many side branches seen streaming off back of ctenophore into current reproduction and development thumb cydippid larva of bolinopsis sp a few mm long adults of most species can regenerate tissues that are damaged or removed although only platyctenids reproduce by cloning splitting off from edges of their flat bodies fragments that develop into new individuals almost all species are hermaphrodites in other words each individual can function as both male and female some are simultaneous hermaphrodites which can produce both eggs and sperm at same time while others are sequential hermaphrodites in which eggs and sperm mature at different times gonads are located in parts of internal canal network under comb rows and eggs and sperm are released via pores in epidermis fertilization is generally external but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep eggs in brood chambers until they hatch self fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of genus mnemiopsis and it is thought that most of hermaphroditic species are self fertile development of fertilized eggs is direct in other words there is no distinctive larval form juveniles of all groups are generally planktonic and most species resemble miniature adult cydippids gradually developing their adult body forms as they grow in genus beroe however juveniles have large mouths and like adults lack both tentacles and tentacle sheaths in some groups such as flat bottom dwelling platyctenids juveniles behave more like true larvae they live among plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents only attaining adult form by a more radical metamorphosis after dropping to sea floor in contrast to general hermaphroditism in two species of genus individuals remain same single sex throughout their lives at least in some species juvenile ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size and adults produce eggs and sperm for as long as they have sufficient food if they run short of food they first stop producing eggs and sperm and then shrink in size when food supply improves they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction these features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly members of lobata and cydippida also have a reproduction form called two sexually mature stages first as larva and later as juveniles and adults during their time as larva they are capable of releasing gametes periodically after their reproductive larval period is over they will not produce more gametes again until after metamorphosis a population of mertensia ovum in central baltic sea have become and consist solely of sexually mature larvae less than 1 6 mm colors and bioluminescence thumb left undescribed deep sea species known as tortugas red with trailing tentacles and clearly visible sidebranches or tentilla most ctenophores that live near surface are mostly colorless and almost transparent however some deeper living species are strongly pigmented for example species known as tortugas red see illustration here which has not yet been formally described platyctenids generally live attached to other sea bottom organisms and often have similar colors to these host organisms gut of deep sea genus bathocyroe is red which hides bioluminescence of copepods it has swallowed comb rows of most planktonic ctenophores produce a rainbow effect which is not caused by bioluminescence but by scattering of light as combs move most species are also bioluminescent but light is usually blue or green and can only be seen in darkness however some significant groups including all known platyctenids and cydippid genus pleurobrachia are incapable of bioluminescence when some species including euplokamis and are disturbed they produce secretions ink that luminesce at much same wavelengths as their bodies juveniles will luminesce more brightly in relation to their body size than adults whose luminescence is diffused over their bodies detailed statistical investigation has not suggested function of ctenophores bioluminescence nor produced any correlation between its exact color and any aspect of animals environments such as depth or whether they live in coastal or mid ocean waters in ctenophores bioluminescence is caused by activation of calcium activated proteins named photoproteins in cells called photocytes which are often confined to meridional canals that underlie eight comb rows in genome of mnemiopsis leidyi ten genes encode photoproteins these genes are co expressed with opsin genes in developing photocytes of mnemiopsis leidyi raising possibility that light production and light detection may be working together in these animals ecology distribution ctenophores are found in most marine environments from polar waters to tropics near coasts and in mid ocean from surface waters to ocean depths best understood are genera pleurobrachia beroe and mnemiopsis as these planktonic coastal forms are among most likely to be collected near shore no ctenophores have been found in fresh water in 2013 marine ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi was recorded in a lake in egypt accidentally introduced by transport of fish mullet fry this was first record from a true lake though other species are found in brackish water of coastal lagoons and estuaries ctenophores may be abundant during summer months in some coastal locations but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find in bays where they occur in very high numbers predation by ctenophores may control populations of small organisms such as copepods which might otherwise wipe out phytoplankton planktonic plants which are a vital part of marine food chains prey and predators almost all ctenophores are predators there are no vegetarians and only one genus that is partly parasitic if food is plentiful they can eat 10 times their own weight per day while beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores other surface water species prey on zooplankton planktonic animals ranging in size from microscopic including mollusc and fish larvae to small adult crustaceans such as copepods amphipods and even krill members of genus haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey s nematocysts stinging cells into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey some hang motionless in water using their tentacles as webs some are ambush predators like salticid jumping spiders and some dangle a sticky droplet at end of a fine thread as spiders do this variety explains wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species two tentacled cydippid lampea feeds exclusively on salps close relatives of sea squirts that form large chain like floating colonies and juveniles of lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow members of cydippid genus pleurobrachia and lobate bolinopsis often reach high population densities at same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey pleurobrachia s long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods while bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae ctenophores used to be regarded as dead ends in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals it is also often difficult to identify remains of ctenophores in guts of possible predators although combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue detailed investigation of chum salmon oncorhynchus keta showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population most fish that prey on them are generalists and may have a greater effect on populations than specialist jelly eaters this is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in red sea larvae of some sea anemones are parasites on ctenophores as are larvae of some flatworms that parasitize fish when they reach adulthood ecological impacts most species are hermaphrodites and juveniles of at least some species are capable of reproduction before reaching adult size and shape this combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate thumb right beroe ovata at surface on black sea coast ctenophores may balance marine ecosystems by preventing an over abundance of copepods from eating all phytoplankton planktonic plants which are dominant marine producers of organic matter from non organic ingredients on other hand in late 1980s western atlantic ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into black sea and sea of azov via ballast tanks of ships and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed adult fish mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized black sea as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities impact was increased by chronic overfishing and by eutrophication that gave entire ecosystem a short term boost causing mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal and above all by absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by accidental introduction of mnemiopsis eating north american ctenophore beroe ovata and by a cooling of local climate from 1991 to 1993 which significantly slowed animal s metabolism however abundance of plankton in area seems unlikely to be restored to pre mnemiopsis levels in late 1990s mnemiopsis appeared in caspian sea beroe ovata arrived shortly after and is expected to reduce but not eliminate impact of mnemiopsis there mnemiopsis also reached eastern mediterranean in late 1990s and now appears to be thriving in north sea and baltic sea taxonomy number of known living ctenophore species is uncertain since many of those named and formally described have turned out to be identical to species known under other scientific names claudia mills estimates that there about 100 to 150 valid species that are not duplicates and that at least another 25 mostly deep sea forms have been recognized as distinct but not yet analyzed in enough detail to support a formal description and naming early classification early writers combined ctenophores with cnidarians into a single phylum called on account of morphological similarities between two groups like cnidarians bodies of ctenophores consist of a mass of jelly with one layer of cells on outside and another lining internal cavity in ctenophores however these layers are two cells deep while those in cnidarians are only a single cell deep ctenophores also resemble cnidarians in relying on water flow through body cavity for both digestion and respiration as well as in having a decentralized nerve net rather than a brain genomic studies have suggested that neurons of ctenophora which differ in many ways from other animal neurons evolved independently from those of other animals and increasing awareness of differences between comb jellies and other has persuaded more recent authors to classify two as separate phyla position of ctenophores in evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated and majority view at present based on molecular phylogenetics is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores modern taxonomy traditional classification divides ctenophores into two classes those with tentacles tentaculata and those without nuda nuda contains only one order beroida and family and two genera beroe several species and one species tentaculata are divided into following eight orders cydippida egg shaped animals with long tentacles lobata with paired thick lobes platyctenida flattened animals that live on or near sea bed most lack combs as adults and use their as suckers to attach themselves to surfaces ganeshida with a pair of small lobes round mouth but an extended pharynx like that of platyctenids thalassocalycida with short tentacles and a jellyfish like umbrella cestida ribbon shaped and largest ctenophores evolutionary history despite their fragile gelatinous bodies fossils thought to represent ctenophores apparently with no tentacles but many more comb rows than modern forms have been found in lagerstatten as far back as early cambrian about nevertheless a recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concludes that common ancestor originated approximately 350 million years ago 88 million years ago conflicting with previous estimates which suggests it occurred after cretaceous paleogene extinction event fossil record because of their soft gelatinous bodies ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerstatten places where environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue until mid 1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known both members of crown group from early devonian emsian period three additional putative species were then found in burgess shale and other canadian rocks of similar age about ma 505 in mid cambrian period all three lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows far more than 8 typical of living species they also appear to have had internal organ like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores one of fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular evidence from china a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in cambrian but perhaps very different from modern species for example one fossil s comb rows were mounted on prominent vanes ediacaran could putatively represent a comb jelly it has eightfold symmetry with eight spiral arms resembling comblike rows of a ctenophore if it is indeed a ctenophore it places group close to origin of bilateria early cambrian sessile frond like fossil stromatoveris from china s chengjiang lagerstatte and dated to about is very similar to of preceding ediacaran period de gan shu simon conway morris et al found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia used for filter feeding they suggested that stromatoveris was an evolutionary aunt of ctenophores and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system other fossils that could support idea of ctenophores having evolved from sessile forms are dinomischus and which also lived on seafloor had organic skeletons and cilia covered tentacles surrounding their mouth although not all yet agree that these were actually comb jellies 520 million year old sea monster with 18 tentacles could be comb jellies ancestor 520 million years old cambrian fossils also from chengjiang in china show a now wholly extinct class of ctenophore named that had a complex internal skeleton with long spines ancient jellies had spiny skeletons no tentacles skeleton also supported eight soft bodied flaps which could have been used for swimming and possibly feeding one form had a streamlined body resembling that of arrow worms and could have been an agile swimmer relationship to other animal groups phylogenetic relationship of ctenophores to rest of metazoa is very important to our understanding of early evolution of animals and origin of multicellularity it has been focus of debate for many years ctenophores have been purported to be sister lineage to bilateria sister to cnidaria sister to cnidaria placozoa and bilateria and sister to all other animals a series of studies that looked at presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways e g nuclear receptors wnt signaling pathway and sodium channels showed evidence congruent with latter two scenarios that ctenophores are either sister to cnidaria placozoa and bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as sister lineage to all other animals this position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types either were lost in major animal lineages e g porifera and placozoa or evolved independently in ctenophore lineage other researchers have argued that placement of ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes and that porifera sponges is earliest diverging animal taxon instead as such ctenophora appear to be a basal clade in agreement with latter point analysis of a very large sequence alignment at metazoan taxonomic scale 1 719 proteins ca 400 000 amino acid positions showed that ctenophores emerge as second earliest branching animal lineage and sponges are sister group to all other multicellular animals also research on mucin genes which allow an animal to produce mucus shows that sponges have never had them while all other animals including comb jellies appear to share genes with a common origin yet another study strongly rejects hypothesis that sponges are sister group to all other extant animals and establishes placement of ctenophora as sister group to all other animals and disagreement with last mentioned paper is explained by methodological problems in analyses in that work neither ctenophores or sponges possess hif pathways and are only known animal phyla that lack any true hox genes although these are secondary lost in nemertean larva evolution and development page 38 hox genes pattern anterior posterior axis of juvenile but not larva in a maximally indirect developing invertebrate alaskensis walter garstang in his book larval forms and other zoological verses mulleria and ctenophore expressed a theory that ctenophores were descended from a neotenic mulleria larva of a relationships within ctenophora relationships within ctenophora since all modern ctenophores except beroids have cydippid like larvae it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids having an egg shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles richard harbison s purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that cydippids are not monophyletic in other words do not contain all and only descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids he also suggested that last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid like or like a molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001 using 26 species including 4 recently discovered ones confirmed that cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid like it also found that genetic differences between these species were very small so small that relationships between lobata cestida and thalassocalycida remained uncertain this suggests that last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent and perhaps survived cretaceous paleogene extinction event while other lineages perished when analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain a clade including mertensia and euplokamis may be sister lineage to all other ctenophores
