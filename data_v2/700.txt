tropical cyclone trina fiji meteorological service designation 01f joint typhoon warning center designation 06p was a weak but destructive tropical cyclone in late 2001 which caused some of worst flooding in south pacific island of mangaia cook islands in nearly 50 years forming out of an upper level low pressure system on november 29 near island of rarotonga or roughly 1 470 mi 2 365 km southeast of fiji trina remained practically stationary as it meandered in same general area for over a week due to unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis storm struggled to develop significant convection preventing it from intensifying beyond 65 km h 40 mph after finally succumbing to wind shear on december 2 system weakened to a tropical depression near mangaia and dissipated several days later as a result of cyclone s slow movement heavy rains impacted same area for more than a week resulting in severe flooding throughout mangaia nearly 90 of islands staple crop was lost and about 60 of livestock perished following an assessment of damage it was determined that us 52 000 was needed to repair losses due to severity of damage caused by trina its name was retired in may 2002 and replaced with tino meteorological history tropical cyclone trina was identified by regional specialized meteorological center in nadi fiji fiji meteorological service fms on november 18 2001 as an upper level low west of rarotonga an island situated roughly 2 355 km 1 465 mi east southeast of fiji little development took place over following ten days as low gradually made its way to surface situated in a region of relatively low wind shear system acquired subtropical characteristics before deep convection formed around its center late on november 29 fms upgraded low to a tropical depression and assigned it identifier 01f however system later entered an area unfavorable to tropical cyclogenesis consisting of increasing shear and marginally warm sea surface temperatures estimated between drifting westward convection managed to increase despite unfavorable conditions as low passed roughly 45 km 30 mi southwest of rarotonga on november 30 later that day joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert stating a good chance of system becoming a tropical cyclone within 48 hours although center remained partially devoid of convective activity system was declared tropical depression 06p by agency within hours of alert later on november 30 depression further intensified into a tropical cyclone and was given name trina by fms at this time gale force winds were only present in one quadrant of storm in previous years gale force winds had to be present all around center for system to receive a name upon receiving its name trina attained its peak intensity with winds of 65 km h 40 mph along with a barometric pressure of 995 mbar hpa 29 38 inhg remaining nearly stationary trina succumbed to strong wind shear during evening of november 30 jtwc only classified trina as a tropical storm for 12 hours before downgrading system and issuing their final advisory early on december 1 however according to fms system retained gale force winds through december 2 by which time it was situated about 70 km 45 mi northwest of mangaia now significantly displaced from any convective activity remnants of trina persisted in same general area for several more days before completely dissipating impact and aftermath thumb right cyclone trina succumbing to wind shear hours after being named on november 30 following tropical depression 01f s upgrade to tropical cyclone trina on november 30 cook islands were placed under a cyclone alert gale warnings were also put in place for islands of rarotonga and mangaia for several days air new zealand flights and many social events were canceled to ensure public safety due to low intensity of storm main threat was not wind damage although gusts up to 100 km h 65 mph were reported in rarotonga owing to slow movement of storm heavy rains associated with trina fell on mangaia for nearly eight days resulting in widespread flooding parts of island were inundated with up to of water destroying nearly 95 of taro crop and drowning numerous livestock several of islands main roads were washed out and a few reports of landslides were made flooding on mangaia was regarded as worst in almost 50 years as nearly entire island was affected according to locals ocean surrounding island became red at one point due to amount of soil being washed out to sea despite initial reports that local water supply was contaminated international federation of red cross and red crescent societies ifrc stated that it was safe to drink and there was a sufficient amount for all of islands 744 residents offshore a sailboat was severely damaged by large swells produced by storm and was on verge of sinking sailor managed to secure vessel and make it safely to shore flooding on mangaia persisted for nearly a week before finally subsiding once waters receded full extent of damage was revealed although only minor structural damage was sustained agricultural sector received extensive losses nearly 90 of islands staple crop was lost and about 60 of all livestock perished following an assessment made by cook islands national disaster management council it was determined that us 52 000 was needed to repair losses from trina international assistance from united nations was eventually requested on december 12 allowing for relief funds from several agencies to be delivered to area fears of food shortages also prompted local government to begin stockpiling food should it become a necessary relief supply a total of us 24 140 was committed in relief funds by new zealand norway and united nations to assist cook islands in recovering from storm by late december an additional f 20 000 us 11 000 was distributed by pacific islands forum secretariat to affected islands in months following cyclone trina debris removal and cleanup was relatively slow delaying efforts to replant crops lost in floods food shortage issues became apparent in february 2002 prompting ifrc to distribute food to all of mangaia s residents due to severity of damage caused by trina its name was later retired see also 2001 02 south pacific cyclone season list of historic tropical cyclone names
