with plp in 1972 in 1997 at a meeting of former draft resistance activists at arlington street church in boston putnam described his involvement with plp as a mistake he said that he had been impressed at first with plp s commitment to alliance building and its willingness to attempt to organize from within armed forces in 1976 he was elected president of american philosophical association following year he was selected as walter beverly pearson professor of mathematical logic in recognition of his contributions to philosophy of logic and mathematics while breaking with his radical past

physical it can be seen that more than one p can instantiate one m but not vice versa causal relations between states are represented by arrows m1 goes to m2 etc putnam s best known work concerns philosophy of mind his most noted original contributions to that field came in several key papers published in late 1960s that set out hypothesis of multiple realizability bickle john multiple realizability stanford encyclopedia of philosophy fall 2006 edition edward n zalta ed in these papers putnam argues that contrary to famous claim of type identity theory it is not necessarily true that pain is identical to c fibre firing pain according to putnam s papers may correspond to utterly different physical states of nervous system in different organisms and yet they all experience same mental state of being in pain putnam cited examples from animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis he asked whether it was likely that brain structures of diverse types of animals realize pain or other mental states same way if they do not share same brain structures they cannot share same mental states and properties answer to this puzzle had to be that mental states were realized by different physical states in different species putnam then took his argument a step further asking about such things as nervous systems of alien beings artificially intelligent robots and other silicon based life forms these hypothetical entities he contended should not be considered incapable of experiencing pain just because they lack same neurochemistry as humans putnam concluded that type identity theorists had been making an ambitious and highly implausible conjecture which could be disproven with one example of multiple realizability putnam h 1975 mind language and reality philosophical papers vol 2 cambridge cambridge university press 1975 this argument is sometimes referred to as likelihood argument putnam formulated a complementary argument based on what he called functional isomorphism he defined concept in these terms two systems are functionally isomorphic if there is a correspondence between states of one and states of other that preserves functional relations in case of computers two machines are functionally isomorphic if and only if sequential relations among states in first are exactly mirrored by sequential relations among states in other therefore a computer made out of silicon chips and a computer made out of cogs and wheels can be functionally isomorphic but constitutionally diverse functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability this argument is sometimes referred to as an a priori argument jerry fodor putnam and others noted that along with being an effective argument against type identity theories multiple realizability implies that any low level explanation of higher level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general fodor j 1974 special sciences in synthese 28 pp 97 j 1980 mind body problem scientific american 244 pp 124 132 functionalism which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively in terms of causes and effects abstracts from level of microphysics and therefore seemed to be a better explanation of relation between mind and body in fact there are many functional kinds such as software and bookshelves which are multiply realized at physical level machine state functionalism first formulation of such a functionalist theory was put forth by putnam himself this formulation which is now called machine state functionalism was inspired by analogies noted by putnam and others between mind and turing machines point for functionalism is nature of states of turing machine each state can be defined in terms of its relations to other states and to inputs and outputs and details of how it accomplishes what it accomplishes and of its material constitution are completely irrelevant according to machine state functionalism nature of a mental state is just like nature of a turing machine state just as state one simply is state in which given a particular input such and such happens so being in pain is state which disposes one to cry ouch become distracted wonder what cause is and so forth rejection of functionalism in late 1980s putnam abandoned his adherence to functionalism and other computational theories of mind his change of mind was primarily due to difficulties that computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions with respect to externalism of mental content this is illustrated by putnam s own twin earth thought experiment see philosophy of language he also developed a separate argument against functionalism in 1988 based on fodor s generalized version of multiple realizability asserting that functionalism is really a watered down identity theory in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds putnam argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds argument for functionalism is that same mental state could be implemented by different states of a universal turing machine putnam hilary 1988 representation and reality cambridge massachusetts mit press despite putnam s rejection of functionalism it has continued to flourish and has been developed into numerous versions by thinkers as diverse as david marr daniel dennett jerry fodor and david lewis sadi 2004 enciclopedia della filosofia ed gianni vattimo milan garzanti editori functionalism helped lay foundations for modern cognitive science and is dominant theory of mind in philosophy today levin janet functionalism stanford encyclopedia of philosophy fall 2004 edition edward n zalta ed by 2012 putnam accepted a modification of functionalism called liberal functionalism view holds that what matters for consciousness and for mental properties generally is right sort of functional capacities and not particular matter that those capacities specification of these capacities 1 may refer to what goes on outside organism s brain 2 may include intentional idioms and 3 need not describe a capacity to compute something or other philosophy of language semantic externalism one of putnam s contributions to philosophy of language is his claim that meaning just ain t in head his views on meaning first laid out in meaning and reference 1973 then in meaning of meaning 1975 use his famous twin earth thought experiment to illustrate that meaning of terms are determined by factors outside mind twin earth shows this according to putnam since on twin earth everything is identical to earth except that its lakes rivers and oceans are filled with xyz whereas those of earth are filled with h2o consequently when an earthling fredrick uses earth english word water it has a different meaning from twin earth english word water when used by his physically identical twin frodrick on twin earth since fredrick and frodrick are physically indistinguishable when they utter their respective words and since their words have different meanings meaning cannot be determined solely by what is in their heads this led putnam to adopt a version of semantic externalism with regard to meaning and mental content late philosopher of mind and language donald davidson despite his many differences of opinion with putnam wrote that semantic externalism constituted an anti subjectivist revolution in philosophers way of seeing world since time of descartes philosophers had been concerned with proving knowledge from basis of subjective experience thanks to saul kripke putnam tyler burge and others davidson said philosophy could now take objective realm for granted and start questioning alleged truths of subjective experience davidson d 2001 subjective objective oxford oxford university press theory of meaning putnam along with saul kripke keith donnellan and others contributed to what is known as causal theory of reference in particular putnam maintained in meaning of meaning that objects referred to by natural kind terms such as tiger water and tree are principal elements of meaning of such terms there is a linguistic division of labor analogous to adam smith s economic division of labor according to which such terms have their references fixed by experts in particular field of science to which terms belong so for example reference of term lion is fixed by community of zoologists reference of term elm tree is fixed by community of botanists and reference of term table salt is fixed as nacl by chemists these referents are considered rigid designators in sense and are disseminated outward to linguistic community putnam specifies a finite sequence of elements a vector for description of meaning of every term in language such a vector consists of four components object to which term refers e g object individuated by chemical formula h2o a set of typical descriptions of term referred to as stereotype e g transparent colorless and semantic indicators that place object into a general category e g natural kind and liquid syntactic indicators e g concrete noun and mass noun such a meaning vector provides a description of reference and use of an expression within a particular linguistic community it provides conditions for its correct usage and makes it possible to judge whether a single speaker attributes appropriate meaning to that expression or whether its use has changed enough to cause a difference in its meaning according to putnam it is legitimate to speak of a change in meaning of an expression only if reference of term and not its stereotype has changed however since there is no possible algorithm that can determine which aspect stereotype or reference has changed in a particular case it is necessary to consider usage of other expressions of language since there is no limit to number of such expressions which must be considered putnam embraced a form of semantic holism dell utri massimo 2002 olismo quodlibet macerata philosophy of mathematics putnam made a significant contribution to philosophy of mathematics in quine putnam indispensability argument for mathematical realism c s hill ed philosophy of hilary putnam fayetteville arkansas 1992 this argument is considered by stephen yablo to be one of most challenging arguments in favor of acceptance of existence of abstract mathematical entities such as numbers and sets form of argument is as follows one must have ontological commitments to all entities that are indispensable to best scientific theories and to those entities only commonly referred to as all and only mathematical entities are indispensable to best scientific theories therefore one must have ontological commitments to mathematical entities putnam h mathematics matter and method philosophical papers vol 1 cambridge cambridge university press 1975 2nd ed 1985 justification for first premise is most controversial both putnam and quine invoke naturalism to justify exclusion of all non scientific entities and hence to defend only part of all and only assertion that all entities postulated in scientific theories including numbers should be accepted as real is justified by confirmation holism since theories are not confirmed in a piecemeal fashion but as a whole there is no justification for excluding any of entities referred to in well confirmed theories this puts who wishes to exclude existence of sets and non euclidean geometry but to include existence of quarks and other undetectable entities of physics for example in a difficult position putnam holds view that mathematics like physics and other empirical sciences uses both strict logical proofs and quasi empirical methods for example fermat s last theorem states that for no integer are there positive integer values of x y and z such that before this was proven for all in 1995 by andrew wiles it had been proven for many values of n these proofs inspired further research in area and formed a quasi empirical consensus for theorem even though such knowledge is more conjectural than a strictly proven theorem it was still used in developing other mathematical ideas mathematics and computer science putnam has contributed to scientific fields not directly related to his work in philosophy as a mathematician putnam contributed to resolution of hilbert s tenth problem in mathematics this problem now known as matiyasevich s theorem or theorem was settled by yuri matiyasevich in 1970 with a proof that relied heavily on previous research by putnam julia robinson and martin davis s barry cooper computability theory p 98 in computability theory putnam investigated structure of ramified analytical hierarchy its connection with constructible hierarchy and its turing degrees he showed that there exist many levels of constructible hierarchy which do not add any subsets of integers and later with his student george that first such non index is ordinal of ramified analysis this is smallest such that is a model of full second order comprehension and also together with a separate paper with richard boyd another of putnam s students and gustav how davis kleene hierarchy of arithmetical degrees can be naturally extended up to in computer science putnam is known for davis putnam algorithm for boolean satisfiability problem sat developed with martin davis in 1960 algorithm finds if there is a set of true or false values that satisfies a given boolean expression so that entire expression becomes true in 1962 they further refined algorithm with help of george and donald w loveland it became known as algorithm this algorithm is efficient and still forms basis of most complete sat solvers epistemology thumb right a brain in a vat putnam uses this thought experiment to argue that skeptical scenarios are impossible in field of epistemology putnam is known for his brain in a vat thought experiment a modernized version of descartes s evil demon hypothesis argument is that one cannot coherently state that one is a disembodied brain in a vat placed there by some mad scientist this follows from causal theory of reference words always refer to kinds of things they were coined to refer to thus kinds of things their user or user s ancestors experienced so if some person mary were a brain in a vat whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by mad scientist then mary s idea of a brain would not refer to a real brain since she and her linguistic community have never seen such a thing rather she saw something that looked like a brain but was actually an image fed to her through wiring similarly her idea of a vat would not refer to a real vat so if as a brain in a vat she were to say i m a brain in a vat she would actually be saying i m a brain image in a vat image which is incoherent on other hand if she is not a brain in a vat then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent but now because she actually means opposite this is a form of epistemological externalism knowledge or justification depends on factors outside mind and is not solely determined internally putnam has clarified that his real target in this argument was never skepticism but metaphysical realism putnam h realism and reason philosophical papers vol 3 cambridge cambridge university press 1983 wright c 1992 on putnam s proof that we are not brains in a vat proceedings of aristotelian society 92 since realism of this kind assumes existence of a gap between how man conceives world and way world really is skeptical scenarios such as this one or descartes evil demon present a formidable challenge putnam by arguing that such a scenario is impossible attempts to show that this notion of a gap between man s concept of world and way it is is in itself absurd man cannot have a god s eye view of reality he is limited to his conceptual schemes metaphysical realism is therefore false according to putnam dell utri m 1990 choosing conceptions of realism case of brains in a vat mind 99 metaphilosophy and ontology in late 1970s and 1980s stimulated by results from mathematical logic and by some ideas of quine putnam abandoned his long standing defence of metaphysical realism view that categories and structures of external world are both causally and ontologically independent of conceptualizations of human mind he adopted a rather different view which he called internal realism putnam h many faces of realism la salle ill open court 1987 also pragmatic realism ernest sosa putnam s pragmatic realism journal of philosophy 90 12 dec 1993 pp 605 626 esp 605 putnam argues against metaphysical realism and in favor of his own internal or pragmatic realism internal realism was view that although world may be causally independent of human mind structure of world its division into kinds individuals and categories is a function of human mind and hence world is not ontologically independent general idea is influenced by immanuel kant s idea of dependence of our knowledge of world on categories of thought problem with metaphysical realism according to putnam was that it fails to explain possibility of reference and truth according to metaphysical realist our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with pre structured categories kinds and individuals that are inherent in external world but how is it possible that world carves up into certain structures and categories mind carves up world into its own categories and structures and two carvings perfectly coincide answer must be that world does not come pre structured but that structure must be imposed on it by human mind and its conceptual schemes in reason truth and history putnam identified truth with what he termed idealized rational acceptability theory which owes something to c s peirce is that a belief is true if it would be accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions nelson goodman had formulated a similar notion in fact fiction and forecast in 1956 in that work goodman went as far as to suggest that there is no one world but many worlds each created by human mind goodman n fact fiction and forecast

1983 putnam rejected this form of social constructivism but retained idea that there can be many correct descriptions of reality no one of these descriptions can be scientifically proven to be one true description of world this does not imply relativism for putnam because not all descriptions are equally correct and ones that are correct are not determined subjectively putnam renounced internal realism in his reply to simon blackburn in volume reading putnam peter clark and bob hale eds reading putnam oxford blackwell 1994 reasons he gave up his antirealism are stated in first three of his

internal realism putnam still resists idea that any given thing or system of things can only be described in exactly one complete and correct way he thus accepts conceptual relativity view that it may be a matter of choice or convention e g whether mereological sums exist or whether space time points are individuals or mere limits in other words having abandoned internal realism putnam came to accept metaphysical realism in simply broad sense of rejecting all forms of and all talk of our making world under influence of c s peirce and william james putnam also became convinced that there is no fact value dichotomy that is normative e g ethical and aesthetic judgments often have a factual basis while scientific judgments have a normative element and wittgenstein at end of 1980s putnam became increasingly disillusioned with what he perceived as scientism and rejection of history that characterize modern analytic philosophy he rejected internal realism because it assumed a cognitive interface model of relation between mind and world putnam claimed that very notion of truth would have to be abandoned by a consistent eliminative materialist edward last superstition st augustine

both ruth anna putnam and hilary putnam was published pragmatism as a way of life lasting legacy of william james and john dewey harvard up 2017 many of putnam s most recent works have addressed concerns of ordinary people particularly their concerns about social problems reed edward 1997 defending experience a philosophy for post modern world in genetic journal of jean piaget society volume 25 number 3 for example he has written about nature of democracy social justice and religion he has discussed ideas of continental philosopher jurgen habermas and has written articles influenced by continental ideas criticism putnam himself may be his own most formidable philosophical adversary his frequent changes of mind have led him to attack his previous positions however many significant criticisms of his views have come from other philosophers and scientists for example multiple realizability has been criticized on grounds that if it were true research and experimentation in neurosciences would be impossible bechtel william and mundale jennifer multiple realizability revisited in philosophy of science 66 175 207 according to william bechtel and jennifer mundale to be able to conduct such research in neurosciences universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures it is similarity or homology of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species if multiple realizability were an empirical fact results from experiments conducted on one species of animal or one organism would not be meaningful when generalized to explain behavior of another species or organism of same species kim testing multiple realizability a discussion of bechtel and mundale in philosophy of science 69 606 610 other criticisms of

churchland patricia 1986 neurophilosophy cambridge massachusetts mit press one of main arguments against functionalism was formulated by putnam himself twin earth thought experiment however there have been other criticisms chinese room argument by john searle 1980 is a direct attack on claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions thought experiment is designed to show that it is possible to mimic intelligent action without any interpretation or understanding through use of a purely functional system in short searle describes a situation in which a person who speaks only english is locked in a room with chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in english for moving symbols around person is instructed by people outside room to follow rule book for sending certain symbols out of room when given certain symbols further suppose that people outside room are chinese speakers and are communicating with person inside via chinese symbols according to searle it would be absurd to claim that english speaker inside knows chinese based on these syntactic processes alone this thought experiment attempts to show that systems that operate merely on syntactic processes cannot realize any semantics meaning or intentionality thus searle attacks idea that thought can be equated with following of a set of syntactic rules thus functionalism is an inadequate theory of mind searle john 1980 minds brains and programs behavioral and brain sciences vol 3 online several other arguments against functionalism have been advanced by ned block block ned 1980b troubles with functionalism in block 1980a putnam has consistently adhered to idea of semantic holism in spite of many changes in his other positions problems with this position have been described by michael dummett jerry fodor ernest lepore and others in first place they suggest that if semantic holism is true it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn meaning of an expression for any expression of language given limits of our cognitive abilities we will never be able to master whole of english or any other language even based on false assumption that languages are static and immutable entities thus if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression language learning is simply impossible semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean same thing when using same linguistic expression and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them given a sentence p since fred and mary have each mastered different parts of english language and p is related in different ways to sentences in each part result is that p means one thing for fred and something else for mary moreover if a sentence p derives its meaning from its relations with all of sentences of a language as soon as vocabulary of an individual changes by addition or elimination of a sentence totality of relations changes and therefore also meaning of p as this is a common phenomenon result is that p has two different meanings in two different moments in life of same person consequently if i accept truth of a sentence and then reject it later on meaning of that which i rejected and that which i accepted are completely different and therefore i cannot change my opinions with regard to same sentences fodor j and lepore e

quodlibet macerata 2002 brain in a vat argument has also been subject to criticism steinitz y 1994 brains in a vat different perspectives philosophical quarterly 44 crispin wright argues that putnam s formulation of brain in a vat scenario is too narrow to refute global skepticism possibility that one is a recently disembodied brain in a vat is not undermined by semantic externalism if a person has lived her entire life outside vat speaking english language and interacting normally with outside world prior to her envatment by a mad scientist when she wakes up inside vat her words and thoughts e g tree and grass will still refer to objects or events in external world that they referred to before her envatment in another scenario a brain in a vat may be hooked up to a supercomputer that randomly generates perceptual experiences in this case one s words and thoughts would not refer to anything and would therefore be devoid of content semantics would no longer exist and argument would be meaningless brueckner a 1986 brains in a vat journal of philosophy 83 in philosophy of mathematics stephen yablo has argued that quine putnam indispensability thesis does not demonstrate that mathematical entities are truly indispensable argumentation is sophisticated but upshot is that one can achieve same logical results by simply adding to any statement about an abstract object assumption so and so is assumed or hypothesized to exist for example one can take argument for indispensability described above and adjust it as follows 1 one must have ontological commitments to all and only abstract entities for which under assumption that they exist their existence is indispensable to best scientific theories 2 under assumption that they exist existence of mathematical entities is indispensable to best scientific theories therefore 3 under assumption that mathematical entities exist one must have ontological commitments to existence of mathematical entities finally putnam s internal realism has been accused by curtis brown of being a disguised form of subjective idealism if this is case it is subject to traditional arguments against that position in particular it falls into trap of solipsism that is if existence depends on experience as subjective idealism maintains and if one s consciousness were to stop existing then rest of universe would stop existing as well
