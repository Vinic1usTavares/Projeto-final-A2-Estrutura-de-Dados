following years discussions with soviets were conducted under matlock s four part agenda including human rights regional issues arms control and bilateral issues on november 25 1983 soviet leader yuri andropov announced resumption of nuclear missile deployment in western u s s r a sign of increased tension in relationship thaw in relations can be taken to begin with ronald reagan s january 16 1984 speech declaring that u s and u s s r had common interests and foremost among them is to avoid war and reduce level of arms in which he added that i support a zero option for all nuclear arms while speech was commonly seen as propaganda lawrence s wittner professor of history at state university of new york albany says of it that a number of officials including its writer jack matlock jr have contended that it was meant to be taken seriously by soviet leaders on june 30 1984 soviets offered to start negotiations on nuclear and space based weapons gorbachev period mikhail gorbachev came to power in soviet union on march 11 1985 and next day negotiations on nuclear and space based weapons began in geneva a few weeks later he proposed a moratorium on development of nuclear and space

told crowd that united states did not recognize incorporation of baltic states into soviet union his remarks are credited by leader of popular front of latvia with galvanizing independence movement in latvia u s soviet relations took a turn for worse with soviet s arrest of u s reporter nicholas daniloff evidently for use as a bargaining chip in response to august 30 1986 arrest of suspected kgb agent zakharov since daniloff was not engaged in espionage matlock advised taking a hard line with soviets while charges against daniloff were dropped a diplomatic row ensued leading by end of october

appointed matlock as ambassador to soviet union conditions at embassy were tense as marine sergeant clayton lonetree had been found to have compromised embassy security within a few months of lonetree scandal all u s intelligence assets in soviet union had been exposed americans suspected that security breach had meant that embassy code room was no longer secure and worked frantically to determine how it was not until 1994 that aldrich ames a mole within cia was caught another mole robert hanssen this time within fbi was caught only in 2001 during 1987 relations improved steadily with u s military inspectors present at soviet military manoeuvres an agreement to establish centers on reducing nuclear threat and a first round of negotiations aimed at banning nuclear tests thaw in relations was reflected in cultural sphere matlock s invitation to ballerina maya plisetskaya to attend a reception at house provided a way for matlock to judge gorbachev s intentions as earlier soviet leaders would have considered it a provocation a second embassy fire in february 1988 damaged several floors of chancery improvements in relations continued during year with two summit meetings first in moscow and second on governor s island in new york an earthquake struck armenia during second summit cutting it short however a u s offer of assistance to victims was accepted by gorbachev and became first official assistance by u s since world war ii berlin wall fell on november 9 1989 and on november 15 u s and u s s r submitted a joint resolution to united nations on consolidation of international peace security and cooperation first such joint initiative a december meeting in malta brought gorbachev and george h w bush together for their first summit june 1990 summit in

cooperation september meeting in helsinki provided a venue for discussion of persian gulf war a third fire in embassy occurred in april 1991 and this time kgb may have managed to send in agents disguised as firefighters in june 1991 matlock received word of a coup planned against gorbachev and warned him it was to no avail shortly after his july summit with bush and 8 days after end of matlock s term gorbachev was briefly removed from power by august 1991 coup soviet union collapsed by end of 1991 just a few months after matlock having fulfilled his ambition when he joined foreign service retired from a diplomatic career spanning 35 years end of soviet union and cold war after retirement from foreign service matlock began work on his magnum opus autopsy on an empire american ambassador s account of collapse of soviet union this 836 page book details final years of soviet union and is considered by many to be definitive insider s guide to subject a subsequent book reagan and gorbachev how cold war ended describes relationship of two men and their efforts to reach agreement on arms reductions between superpowers matlock takes position that military build up by ronald reagan in early 1980s has contributed to inaccurate characterization of reagan as a war hawk quote atop first page of reagan and gorbachev is by ronald reagan speaking in 1981 during beginnings of a one trillion dollar defense spending surge that states i ve always recognized that ultimately there s got to be a settlement a solution reagan according to matlock never altered from his goals as at his first press conference as president when he stated that appearances to contrary he was in favor of an actual reduction in numbers of nuclear weapons this would contradict claims of reagan victory school proponents such as peter schweitzer his third book superpower illusions how myths and false ideologies led america astray and how to return to reality published in 2010 provides an analysis of post cold war period along with his policy prescriptions teaching diplomacy thumb matlock speaking at ucla in november 2007 matlock has taught diplomacy at princeton university columbia university and hamilton college in a 1997 interview matlock offers some advice to prospective diplomats have an optimistic nature get a liberal education do not expect to change world know country know your own country faithfully represent your government find mutual interests and remember that timing is everything matlock also gives his views on one of basic distinctions in politics i don t see much difference between a communist regime and a fascist regime in fact i think one of greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is whole right and left thing fascists are on right communists are on left nonsense they come together and overlap and we re seeing this in russia today where allies are nationalistic chauvinists and communists they are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature and more than authoritarians they tend to be which means that they tend to destroy all of elements of civil society to me that s much more important than whether you re philosophically right or left you know are you willing to create and live in a civil society in an open society or not that to me is basic issue u s policy and politics since leaving government service matlock has occasionally joined with other experts to criticize u s foreign policy on june 26 1997 he signed an open letter to president bill clinton criticizing plans for nato expansion his reason for opposition as given in testimony before senate foreign relations committee was his belief that nato expansion would preclude significant nuclear arms reduction with russia and consequently increase risk of a nuclear attack by terrorists matlock drew ire of many republicans during 2004 presidential election campaign when he signed official statement of diplomats and military commanders for change which criticized policies of president george w bush and endorsed senator john kerry for president on jan 4 2007 matlock joined with george shultz william perry henry kissinger and sam nunn to advocate a goal of a world free of nuclear weapons on 23 september 2008 after a two day conference at carnegie endowment for international peace he joined several other former ambassadors to issue a joint statement on how russia and united states might move forward in their relations he has endorsed global zero initiative a plan to eliminate all nuclear weapons by 2030 matlock has also signed an open letter of may 13 2011 asking implementors of new start treaty between u s russia to make public locations and aggregate numbers of nuclear weapons in order to promote transparency and reduce mistrust on jan 18 2011 he co signed an open letter to president obama urging a united nations resolution condemning israeli settlements in occupied territory published works function of governing
