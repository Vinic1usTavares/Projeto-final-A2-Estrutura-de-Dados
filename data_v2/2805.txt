boyce dawkins mcdaniel june 11 1917 may 8 2002 was an american nuclear physicist who worked on manhattan project and later directed cornell university laboratory of nuclear studies lns mcdaniel was skilled in constructing atom smashing devices to study fundamental structure of matter and helped to build most powerful particle accelerators of his time together with his graduate student he invented pair spectrometer during world war ii mcdaniel used his electronics expertise to help develop cyclotrons used to separate uranium isotopes mcdaniel is also noted as having performed final check on first atomic bomb prior to its detonation in trinity test biography born in brevard north carolina mcdaniel attended high school in ohio after graduating in 1933 he attended ohio wesleyan university from which he graduated in 1938 with a bachelor of science his initial postgraduate studies took place at case school of applied science graduating with a master s degree in 1940 mcdaniel continued postgraduate studies when he moved to cornell university and in 1943 he completed his doctoral thesis examining absorption rates of neutrons in indium research was not classified but mcdaniel and robert bacher his adviser at cornell marked it as secret on their own initiative from cornell mcdaniel moved to mit where he held a postdoctoral position studying rapidly evolving field of fast electronics which he applied to research in particle physics after outbreak of world war ii mcdaniel joined bacher in los alamos new mexico to work for manhattan project where he became a part of robert r wilson s cyclotron research team mcdaniel was to have a crucial role in helping to identify amount of uranium 235 needed to detonate world s first nuclear bomb mcdaniel is also noted as having performed final check on first atomic bomb prior to its detonation in trinity test mcdaniel was one of many project researchers to join cornell faculty after war he became an assistant professor in 1946 and became a full professor in 1955 with his ph d student robert walker he invented pair spectrometer a device that measures gamma ray energies he was a co founder of cornell s laboratory for nuclear studies lns and had helped create 300 megavolt mev electron synchrotron one of first such accelerators in world he and wilson who was mcdaniel s predecessor as director of lns built three more electron synchrotrons of 1 gev 2 gev and 10 gev each of which enabled physicists to study phenomena in a new energy range mcdaniel quickly earned a reputation as a hands on designer as indicated by this episode in construction of 300 mev synchrotron magnet coil was wound incorrectly a fatal flaw to get it repaired by manufacturer could take months mac made a toy model of coil studied it carefully for an evening and discovered an ingenious but simple way to repair it which he did in about a day and defused crisis he was a fulbright research fellow in 1953 at australian national university and a guggenheim fellow in 1959 at university of rome in 1967 mcdaniel became director of lns and served until he retired from cornell faculty in 1985 he research included important measurements with each of series of lns accelerators including studies lambda meson photo production k meson production and measurements of neutron electromagnetic form factors accelerators that mcdaniel helped mev gev gev gev gev effective gev and mcdaniel continued to collaborate at cornell until wilson left to head fermilab in batavia illinois in 1967 in 1972 wilson invited mcdaniel to serve as acting head of accelerator section at fermilab and took a one year leave of absence from cornell though fermilab accelerator had been placed into operation it suffered from frequent component failures when mcdaniel left eight months later he led effort which increased power of fermilab s accelerator from 20 gev to 300 gev and its beam density by a factor of 1000 of mcdaniel s contribution to fermilab wilson said this bravura performance demonstrated mac s skill for leadership as well as his celebrated sixth sense for finding sources of trouble and fixing them upon returning to cornell in 1974 mcdaniel proposed upgrading then existing 10 gev synchrotron with an 8 gev electron positron storage ring which would greatly increase energy of particle collisions when particles in storage ring hit particles traveling in opposite direction in synchrotron when constructed in 1979 cornell electron storage ring became world s primary source of information about one of fundamental building blocks of matter b quark after end of particle physics experiments 20 years later is now used as a test facility of damping rings for a future international linear collider in 1981 mcdaniel developed a proposal for a new mile diameter electron positron collider called ii but could not obtain necessary 200 million in funding for it in 1988 mcdaniel was visiting distinguished professor at arizona state university thumb tower used to hold trinity test device for detonation when interviewed in 1973 about his feelings on his work resulting in dropping of atomic bombs on japanese cities mcdaniel said it s so difficult to assess these things today i would have preferred to see a demonstration and am rather sad that it didn t work out that way but i don t know if it would have worked out as a useful venture i have no idea what japanese would have done sexual harassment incident in 1975 mcdaniel would be made subject to one of very first and most popular public testimonies concerning sexual harassment in workplace when his former administrative assistant carmita dickerson wood whom mcdaniel sexually harassed brought her case to lin farley and working women united organization which farley chaired cornell failed carmita wood and mcdaniel completely got away with his behaviour honors mcdaniel was elected to national academy of sciences in 1981 he was a governing board member of fermilab a trustee of associated universities a member of department of energy high energy advisory panel a trustee of universities research association and a board member of brookhaven national laboratory in 1993 mcdaniels donated a farm to cornell plantations which named 60 6 acre property jane mcdaniel preserve mcdaniel died of a heart attack in ithaca new york at age
