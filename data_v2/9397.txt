that published a total of seven issues in 1941 and 1942 both cosmic and stirring were edited by donald a wollheim and launched by same publisher appearing in alternate months wollheim had no budget at all for fiction so he solicited stories from his friends among futurians a group of young science fiction fans including james blish and c m kornbluth isaac asimov contributed a story but later insisted on payment after hearing that f orlin tremaine editor of competing science fiction magazine comet was irate at idea of a magazine that might siphon readership from magazines that paid and thought that authors who contributed should be blacklisted kornbluth was most prolific contributor under several pseudonyms one of his stories thirteen o clock published under pseudonym cecil corwin

many other magazines of era had wollheim been able to achieve it in event he was able to start paying small amounts to his authors after first couple of issues c m kornbluth was paid for several of his later stories for two magazines though rates were well below half a cent per word rich 2010 pp 89 91 contents and reception thumb first issue of stirring science stories cover art by leo morey stirring science stories was presented by wollheim as if it were two separate magazines bound together first half of magazine was titled stirring science fiction and second half stirring fantasy fiction an editorial and letters section titled vortex separated two wollheim described his approach in first issue saying stirring science stories isn t really one magazine but two a sort of siamese twin embracing within its covers for first time in publishing history a science fiction magazine and a weird fantasy magazine rich 2010 pp 78 79 wollheim was a member of futurians a group of new york science fiction fans many of whom were also starting to be published writers some including isaac asimov frederik pohl c m kornbluth and james blish were later to become very successful in field knight 1977 p vii robert a w lowndes another took on task of finding free material for wollheim to fill first two issues two of futurians lowndes and pohl were already working as editors of recently launched sf magazines and there were many other paying markets for science fiction at that time but futurians were so prolific that wollheim was able to obtain much of his material from them wollheim also published some of his own stories in two magazines ashley 2000 pp 161 163 kornbluth provided wollheim with more stories than anyone else using several aliases including cecil corwin s d gottesman and kenneth falconer other futurians who contributed material included blish lowndes walter david kyle and john b michel stories often collaborations between two or more of futurians were published under a variety of pseudonyms damon knight s first story resilience appeared in february 1941 issue of stirring with an unfortunate printer s error in first sentence of story that rendered plot incomprehensible knight would later become a member of futurians but he was still living in oregon at time story appeared in print knight 1977 pp 60 63 thirteen o clock by kornbluth is generally regarded as best story in first issue of stirring knight describes it as a delightful screwball fantasy and adds that it made kornbluth s reputation other stories from later issues that have been well received include long wall by lowndes city in sofa what sorghum says golden road and words of guru all by kornbluth real thrill by blish and goblins will get you by michel thumb april 1941 issue of stirring science stories cover art by hannes bok left isaac asimov contributed a story secret sense which appeared in march 1941 issue of cosmic after wollheim acquired story asimov met with f orlin tremaine editor of comet a competing science fiction magazine and discovered that tremaine was irate at idea of a magazine that might siphon readership from magazines that paid by taking stories without paying authors tremaine felt that any author who contributed a story to these magazines should be blacklisted asimov acknowledged that a story of his would be appearing in cosmic but told tremaine that he had been paid for it in asimov s autobiographical anthology early asimov he recalls that after hearing tremaine s comments he requested a token payment of 5 from wollheim in asimov s autobiography in memory yet green sequence of events is given slightly differently with asimov asking wollheim for payment or else for story to be published under a pseudonym before story was published this was requested on grounds that even though story might be worth nothing my name was worth something wollheim reluctantly agreed to a payment of 5 commenting that it was an effective word rate of 2 50 per word since he was paying only for use of asimov s name asimov 1979 pp 284 285 wollheim later commented that because of payment he could sue asimov for royalties whenever latter s name appeared in print in contrast to tremaine s attitude john w campbell editor of leading science fiction magazine astounding science fiction was not concerned by albing s policy campbell felt that any story that an author was willing to give away would be so poor that new magazines would not be competitive although campbell was correct that magazine was unable to compete with paying magazines wollheim managed to produce in damon knight s words a rather surprising level of quality as well as stories from futurians wollheim was able to obtain some material from established names in field including david h keller and clark ashton smith keller occasionally gave material to fan magazines and wollheim would have been aware of this when he began looking for free stories wollheim was fortunate in obtaining a good deal of artwork from hannes bok later to become a popular artist in field bok was enthusiastic enough about kornbluth s thirteen o clock to produce more interior drawings than wollheim had room for in that issue they were eventually used to advertise magazine in later issues rich 2010 p 84 for february 1941 issue of stirring science stories 15 art budget went to leo morey an established artist morey s cover was undistinguished damon knight commented later that door to airlock in picture evidently did not fit and that at 15 morey was overpaid wollheim also obtained free art from roy hunt an artist based in denver cover for july 1941 issue of cosmic stories was by elliott dold dold was at one time regarded as one of most important sf artists but this was last work he did in science fiction field weinberg 1988 pp 94 95 cover has been described by sf historian mark rich as excellent it accurately illustrates a scene from interference a story by
