leo ornstein born lev lev c december 11 s exact date of birth is ambiguous with various sources stating dates in 1892 1893 or 1895 but official documents from 1917 1920 and 1942 suggest a december 11 1895 birthdate february 24 2002 was a leading american experimental composer and pianist of early twentieth century his performances of works by avant garde composers and his own innovative and even shocking pieces made him a cause celebre on both sides of atlantic ornstein was first important composer to make extensive use of tone cluster as a pianist he was considered a world class talent in addition to citations below see also e g broyles and von glahn 2007 p 9 a pianist of extraordinary skill rumson 2002 p 352 enormous pianistic skills perlis 1983 p 104 recognized as a world famous concert pianist according to oja 2000 he was single most important figure on american modern music scene in 1910s p 15 by mid 1920s he had walked away from his fame and soon disappeared from popular memory though he gave his last public concert before age of forty he continued writing music for another half century and beyond largely forgotten for decades he was rediscovered in mid 1970s ornstein completed his eighth and final piano sonata in september 1990 at age of ninety four making him oldest published composer in history a mark since passed by elliott carter early life ornstein was born in kremenchuk a large town in ukrainian province of poltava then under imperial russian rule he grew up in a musical environment his father was a jewish cantor while a violinist uncle encouraged young boy s studies ornstein was recognized early on as a prodigy on piano in 1902 when celebrated polish pianist josef hofmann visited kremenchuk he heard six year old ornstein perform hofmann gave him a letter of recommendation to highly regarded st petersburg conservatory soon after ornstein was accepted as a pupil at imperial school of music in kiev then headed by vladimir a death in family forced ornstein s return home in 1903 ossip heard him play and recommended him to moscow conservatory in 1904 nine year old ornstein auditioned for and was accepted by st petersburg school martens 1975 pp 10 11 note that martens like many others has incorrect year of ornstein s birth and thus his age wrong martens says he was eight when he entered school anderson 2002a for example says he was twelve part of confusion is based in fact that ornstein was under age limit when he entered conservatory so a false date of birth was given to school identifying him as older than he was see e g anderson 2002a on other occasions family apparently understated boy s age to make him appear that much more of a prodigy see e g postlude vivian perlis remembers leo ornstein newmusicbox april 1 2002 web magazine of american music center retrieved 1 31 07 aside from this issue martens s dating of ornstein s encounters with famous pianists and sequence of educational opportunities appears to be most authoritative there he studied composition with alexander glazunov and piano with anna by age of eleven ornstein was earning his way by coaching opera singers broyles 2004 p 73 to escape pogroms incited by nationalist and antisemitic organisation union of russian people family emigrated to united states on february 24 1906 exactly ninety six years before his death broyles and von glahn 2007 p 3 they settled in new york s lower east side and ornstein enrolled in institute of musical art predecessor to juilliard school where he studied piano with bertha tapper in 1911 he made a well received new york debut with pieces by bach beethoven chopin and schumann recordings two years later of works by chopin grieg and demonstrate according to music historian michael broyles a pianist of sensitivity prodigious technical ability and artistic maturity broyles 2004 p 75 fame and futurism thumb upright 1 1 violent tone clusters of wild men s dance ca 1913 14 poon hill press severo ornstein ornstein soon moved in a very different direction he began imagining and then writing works with new sounds dissonant and startling ornstein himself was unsettled by earliest of these compositions i really doubted my sanity at first i simply said what is that it was so completely removed from any experience i ever had quoted in broyles and von glahn 2007 p 4 on march 27 1914 in london he gave his first public performance of works then called futurist now known as modernist though today term futurist is closely associated with art movement that emerged in italy late in first decade of 1900s it was often used more broadly in early part of century to refer to avant garde art now commonly referred to as modernist in addition to a busoni arrangement of three bach choral preludes and several pieces by schoenberg ornstein played a number of his own compositions concert caused a major stir one newspaper described ornstein s work as sum of schoenberg and squared quoted in broyles 2004 p 78 others were less analytical we have never suffered from such insufferable hideousness expressed in terms of so called music ornstein s follow up performance provoked a near riot at my second concert devoted to my own compositions i might have played anything i couldn t hear piano myself crowd whistled and howled and even threw handy missiles on stage reaction however was by no means universally negative musical standard called him one of most remarkable composers of day with that germ of realism and humanity which is indicative of genius quoted in broyles 2004 pp 78 79 by next year he was talk of american music scene for his performances of cutting edge works by schoenberg scriabin bartok debussy kodaly ravel and stravinsky many of them u s premieres as well as his own even more radical compositions broyles 2004 p 72 martens 1975 p 29 between 1915 and early 1920s when he virtually ceased performing in public ornstein was one of best known by some lights notorious figures in american classical music in description of broyles and denise von glahn his draw was immense he constantly performed before packed halls often more than two thousand in many places largest audience of season broyles and von glahn 2007 p 4 his solo piano pieces such as wild men s dance aka danse sauvage ca 1913 14 and impressions of thames ca 1913 14 pioneered integrated use of tone cluster in classical music composition which henry cowell three years ornstein s junior would do even more to popularize in description of scholar gordon rumson wild men s dance is a work of vehement unruly rhythm compounded of dense chord clusters and brutal accents complex rhythms and gigantic crashing chords traverse whole range of piano this remains a work for a great virtuoso able to imbue it with a burning ferocious energy rumson 2002 p 352 aaron copland recalled a performance of it as most controversial moment of his later teen years crunden 2000 p 213 in 2002 a new york times reviewer declared that it remains a shocker tommasini 2002 according to critic kyle gann impressions of thames if in its textures used more prickly chords than debussy ever dared and also clusters in treble range and a low pounding that foreshadowed charlemagne palestine yet modulated with a compelling sense of unity gann 2000 as an example of what ornstein described as abstract music his sonata for violin and piano 1915 not 1913 as is often erroneously given see e g ornstein 2002 be aware that these notes also incorrectly claim that ornstein never again played in public after mid 1920s went even further to brink as he put it i would say that sonata had brought music just to very edge i just simply drew back and said beyond that lies complete chaos quoted in broyles 2004 p 80 in 1916 critic herbert f peyser declared that world has indeed moved between epoch of beethoven and of leo ornstein quoted in broyles and von glahn 2007 p 2 that spring ornstein gave a series of recitals in new york home of one of his advocates these concerts were crucial precedents for composer societies around which modern music scene would thrive in 1920s oja 2000 p 216 crunden 2000 p 3 ornstein also traveled to new orleans in 1916 where he discovered jazz see broyles and von glahn 2007 p 9 following year critic james wrote thumb upright 1 left cover of leo ornstein man his ideas his work 1918 by frederick h martens i never thought i should live to hear arnold schoenberg sound tame yet tame he sounds almost timid and halting after ornstein who is most emphatically only true blue genuine futurist composer alive quoted in anderson 2002a in addition to futurist ornstein was also sometimes labeled along with cowell and others in their circle an ultra modernist an article in baltimore evening sun referred to him as intransigent pianist who has set entire musical world by ears and who is probably most discussed figure on concert stage quoted in broyles 2004 p 342 n 3 in musical quarterly he was described as most salient musical phenomenon of our time swiss born composer ernest bloch declared him single composer in america who displays positive signs of genius quoted in crunden 2000 pp 4 5 by 1918 ornstein was sufficiently renowned that a full length biography of him was published book by frederick h martens suggests not only level of ornstein s fame at age twenty four but also his divisive effect on cultural scene leo ornstein to many represents an evil musical genius wandering without utmost pale of tonal orthodoxy in a weird no man s land haunted with tortuous sound with wails of futuristic despair with cubist shrieks and post impressionist cries and crashes he is great anarch iconoclast martens 1975 p 9 cowell who had encountered ornstein while studying in new york would pursue a similarly radical style as part of a grand intellectual and cultural mission which also involved ambitious writings on music theory and publishing and promotional efforts in support of avant garde ornstein vanguard iconoclast of american classical music followed a much more idiosyncratic muse i m guided entirely by just my musical instinct as to what i feel is consequential or inconsequential quoted in rumson 2002 pp 353 54 evidence of that is fact that even at height of his ultra modernist notoriety he also wrote several lyrical tonal works such as first sonata for cello and piano broyles and von glahn 2007 date piece 1915 p 5 anderson 2002a and detailed website maintained by composer s son severo date it 1918 retrieved 1 31 07 it was written in less than a week under a compulsion that was not to be resisted ornstein later said why i should have heard this romantic piece at same period that i was involved in primitivism of other works is beyond my understanding quoted in broyles and von glahn 2007 p 6 commenting on piece after ornstein s death approximately three quarters of a century later critic martin anderson wrote that it rivals rachmaninov s cello sonata in gorgeous tunes anderson 2002a before turn of decade probably in 1918 or 1919 ornstein produced one of his most distinctive works involving tone clusters suicide in an airplane see anderson 2002b on question of dating its score calls for a high speed bass ostinato pattern meant to simulate sound of engines and capture sensation of flight levi 2000 p 331 levi declares ornstein s brief flirtation with futurism appears superficial and sensationalist despite facts that a in immediately preceding paragraph he observes that composer appears to have had no contact with italian futurists hardly a flirtation and b ornstein wrote significant works in a futurist style for over half a decade hardly brief piece would serve as an inspiration for airplane sonata 1923 of george antheil who reflected ornstein s influence in other works such as sonata sauvage 1923 see rumson 2002 p 353 writing in 2000 pianist and historian joseph smith cited suicide in an airplane among those pieces of ornstein s that represented and may still represent ne plus ultra of pianistic violence smith 2001 p vi transition in 1920s ornstein burned out effectively gave up his celebrated performance career in early 1920s broyles 2004 p 80 his music was soon forgotten writes scholar erik levi leaving him an essentially peripheral figure in american musical life levi 2000 p 331 as described by broyles ornstein had mostly retired by time new music organizations of 1920s appeared too early and too independent ornstein had little desire to participate in modernist movement by time it caught hold in united states he seemed little bothered by publicity or lack of it he listened only to his own voice broyles 2004 p 81 ornstein s primary compositional style was changing as well as described by latter day critic gordon rumson his musical language organised itself into a shimmering luminous gradation between simplicity and harshness melodies have a hebraic tint and ornstein does not shy from placing dissonant and tonal music side by side this shifting of style is just one of ornstein s creative tools more importantly there is a directness of emotion that makes music genuinely appealing it should also be noted that his music is ideally written for piano and is clearly work of a master pianist this transformation contributed to ornstein s fade into obscurity those whom he had inspired now rejected him almost as vehemently as critics he had shocked a decade earlier h e had been radical modernism s poster boy throughout 1910s and when he abandoned that style for one more expressive reacted as a lover scorned according to broyles not even cowell known for his accepting temperament could forgive ornstein broyles 2004 p 150 having abandoned not only concert stage but also income that went with it ornstein signed an exclusive contract with ampico label to make piano rolls perlis 1983 p 104 note that perlis imprecisely states n o recordings of ornstein s music or his performances existed prior to 1976 in fact as noted above and described by broyles 2004 ornstein did record work of others for columbia records in 1913 he made over two dozen rolls for ampico mostly of a repertoire composers he performed most often were chopin schumann and liszt two rolls contained his own compositions berceuse cradle song ca 1920 21 and prelude tragique 1924 see part of reproducing piano roll foundation ornstein never recorded in any format even a single example of his futurist pieces which had brought him fame in mid 1920s ornstein left new york to accept a teaching post at philadelphia musical academy later part of university of arts broyles 2004 says this took place in 1924 pp 80 81 broyles again with von glahn 2007 says 1925 p 4 during this period he wrote some of his most important work including piano concerto commissioned by philadelphia orchestra in 1925 two years later he produced his piano quintet an epic tonal work marked by an adventurous use of dissonance and complex rhythmic arrangements it is recognized as a masterpiece of genre see e g anderson 2002a later life in early 1930s ornstein gave his last public performance pollack 2000 confirms ornstein performed at a 1930 copland sessions concert p 44 stepner 1997 in his well sourced notes gives 1933 as date of ornstein s last public concert though he does give incorrect 1913 for suicide in an airplane a few years later he and his wife former pauline cosio mallet prevost 1892 1985 also a pianist founded ornstein school of music in philadelphia broyles 2004 writes that school was founded in 1934 p 81 broyles and von glahn 2007 indicate that it was 1935 p 4 anderson 2002a says it was 1940 among students there john coltrane and jimmy smith would go on to major careers in jazz porter

magazine of american music center retrieved 1 30 07 ornstein had continued to compose music equipped with a powerful memory he was not diligent about writing it all down and had not sought to publicize it for decades though his style had tempered greatly since 1910s it retained its unique character and with his rediscovery came a new burst of productivity in gann s description piano works composed by ornstein in his eighties such as solitude and rendezvous at lake featured melodies that sprang through endless ornate curlicues that brought no other composer to mind in 1988 ninety two year old ornstein wrote his seventh piano sonata with this composition ornstein became by a couple of years oldest published composer until elliott carter ever to produce a substantial new work
