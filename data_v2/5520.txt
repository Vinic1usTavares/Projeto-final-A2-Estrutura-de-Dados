continued to move further away from their earlier krautrock style of improvised instrumental music refining their work more into format of melodic electronic songs during tour for radio activity band began to make performance rules such as not to be drunk on stage or at parties karl bartos wrote that about these rules stating that it s not easy to turn knobs on a synthesizer if you are drunk or full of drugs we always tried to keep very aware of what we were doing while acting in public during this tour early melodies that would later evolve into song showroom dummies were being performed in mid 1976 kraftwerk began to work on album which was then called europe endless paul alessandrini suggested that kraftwerk write a song about trans europ express to reflect their electronic music style

stated kraftwerk were influenced by music of weimar germany era we were children who were born straight after world war two we had no musical or pop culture of our own there was war and before war we had only german folk music in 1920s or 1930s melodies were developed and these became culture that we worked from karl bartos also spoke of post war influence as group thought that they had this development in 1920s which was very very strong and was audio visual we had bauhaus school before war and then after war we had tremendous people like karlheinz stockhausen and development of classical and electronic classical this was very strong and it all happened very close to dusseldorf in cologne and all great composers at that time came there paul alessandrini is credited for helping contribute to album s concept alessandrini told hutter and schneider that with kind of music you do which is kind of like an electronic blues railway stations and trains are very important in your universe you should do a song about trans europe express kraftwerk believed critics in united kingdom and united states associated them with nazi germany with tracks such as autobahn inextricably linked with nazis who built high speed roads in 1930s and 1940s at same time band were keen to move away from their german heritage towards a new sense of european identity and felt that trans europ express could be used to symbolize this allmusic referred to trans europe express as a concept album with two different themes first being disparities between reality and image represented by songs hall of mirrors and showroom dummies and others about glorification of europe slant magazine described album as a sonic poem to europe musical style of trans europe express was described by allmusic as melodic themes which are repeated often and occasionally interwoven over deliberate chugging beats sometimes with manipulated vocals and minimalism mechanized rhythms and crafted catchy melodies hutter has commented on minimalist nature of album stating that if we can convey an idea with one or two notes it is better than to play a hundred or so notes first side of trans europe express has three songs song hall of mirrors has been described as containing deadpan vocals with lyrics that speculate how stars look at themselves in a looking glass hutter and schneider have described song as autobiographical third track showroom dummies was described by allmusic as melodic in a way that most of trans europe express isn t and with lyrics which are slightly paranoid idea for song came from flur and bartos being compared to showroom dummies in a british concert review some versions of song contain a spoken introduction starting with a count in of eins zwei drei vier as a parody of band ramones who started some songs with a quick count in of one two three four second side of trans europe express is a suite with trans europe express continuing through to metal on metal and franz schubert before closing with a brief reiteration of main theme from europe endless allmusic described musical elements of suite as having a haunting theme with deadpan chanting of title phrase which is slowly layered over that rhythmic base in much same way that earlier autobahn was constructed song s lyrics reference album station to station and meeting with musicians iggy pop and david bowie hutter and schneider had previously met up with bowie in germany and were flattered by attention they received from him ralf hutter was interested in bowie s work as he had been working with iggy pop who was former lead singer of stooges one of hutter s favorite groups release trans europe express was originally released in march 1977 with help of gunther frohling kraftwerk made a promotional

express is all at once antique timeless retro and contemporary its status as modern electronic music s birth certificate is well earned but its hallowed reputation should never be allowed to disguise

kraftwerk by singer ian curtis who insisted we play trans europe express before we went on stage every time tape was played at venue over pa system to be heard by everyone first time was pips a manchester club well known for its bowie room ian got thrown out for kicking glass around dance floor in time to track it took us ages of pleading to get him back in drummer stephen morris also confirmed that joy division used to play trans europe express before we went on stage to get us into zone it worked because it gets up a lot of momentum trans europe express just seemed to express an optimism even if people see it as machine music morris also said it reminds me of cabaret film with all of 1920s singing when you get that marriage between humans and machines and you get it right it
