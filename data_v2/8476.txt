carbon monoxide poisoning typically occurs from breathing in carbon monoxide co at excessive levels symptoms are often described as flu like and commonly include headache dizziness weakness vomiting chest pain and confusion large exposures can result in loss of consciousness arrhythmias seizures or death classically described cherry red skin rarely occurs long term complications may include feeling tired trouble with memory and movement problems in those exposed to smoke cyanide toxicity should also be considered carbon monoxide poisoning can occur accidentally as an attempt to end one s own life or as an attempt to end another s life co is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non irritating it is produced during incomplete burning of organic matter this can occur from motor vehicles heaters or cooking equipment that run on carbon based fuels it can also occur from exposure to methylene chloride carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin hbco preventing blood from carrying oxygen additionally myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase are affected diagnosis is based on a hbco level of more than 3 among nonsmokers and more than 10 among smokers efforts to prevent poisoning include carbon monoxide detectors proper venting of gas appliances keeping chimneys clean and keeping exhaust systems of vehicles in good repair treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving 100 oxygen along with supportive care this should generally be carried out until symptoms are no longer present and hbco level is less than 10 while hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used for severe poisonings benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30 carbon monoxide poisoning is relatively common resulting in more than 20 000 emergency department visits a year in united states it is most common type of fatal poisoning in many countries in united states non fire related cases results in more than 400 deaths a year poisonings occur more often in winter particularly from use of portable generators during power outages toxic effects of co have been known since ancient history realization that hemoglobin was affected by co was determined in 1857 signs and symptoms carbon monoxide is not toxic to all forms of life its harmful effects are due to binding with hemoglobin so its danger to organisms that do not use this compound is doubtful it thus has no effect on plants it is easily absorbed through lungs inhaling gas can lead to hypoxic injury nervous system damage and even death different people and populations may have different carbon monoxide tolerance levels on average exposures at 100 ppm or greater is dangerous to human health in united states osha limits long term workplace exposure levels to less than 50 ppm averaged over an 8 hour period in addition employees are to be removed from any confined space if an upper limit ceiling of 100 ppm is reached carbon monoxide exposure may lead to a significantly shorter life span due to heart damage carbon monoxide tolerance level for any person is altered by several factors including activity level rate of ventilation a pre existing cerebral or cardiovascular disease cardiac output anemia sickle cell disease and other hematological disorders barometric pressure and

use central nervous system and heart initial symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include headache nausea malaise and fatigue these symptoms are often mistaken for a virus such as influenza or other illnesses such as food poisoning or gastroenteritis headache is most common symptom of acute carbon monoxide poisoning it is often described as dull frontal and continuous increasing exposure produces cardiac abnormalities including fast heart rate low blood pressure and cardiac arrhythmia central nervous system symptoms include delirium hallucinations dizziness unsteady gait confusion seizures central nervous system depression unconsciousness respiratory arrest and death less common symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include myocardial ischemia atrial fibrillation pneumonia pulmonary edema high blood sugar lactic acidosis muscle necrosis acute kidney failure skin lesions and visual and auditory problems one of major concerns following acute carbon monoxide poisoning is severe delayed neurological manifestations that may occur problems may include difficulty with higher intellectual functions short term memory loss dementia amnesia psychosis irritability a strange gait speech disturbances parkinson s disease like syndromes cortical blindness and a depressed mood depression may occur in those who did not have pre existing depression these delayed neurological sequelae may occur in up to 50 of poisoned people after 2 to 40 days it is difficult to predict who will develop delayed sequelae however advanced age loss of consciousness while poisoned and initial neurological abnormalities may increase chance of developing delayed symptoms one classic sign of carbon monoxide poisoning is more often seen in dead rather than living people have been described as looking red cheeked and healthy see below however since this cherry red appearance is more common in dead it is not considered a useful diagnostic sign in clinical medicine in autopsy examinations ruddy appearance of carbon monoxide poisoning is notable because dead persons are normally bluish and pale whereas dead carbon monoxide poisoned people may appear unusually lifelike in coloration colorant effect of carbon monoxide in such postmortem circumstances is thus analogous to its use as a red colorant in commercial meat packing industry chronic poisoning chronic exposure to relatively low levels of carbon monoxide may cause persistent headaches lightheadedness depression confusion memory loss nausea hearing disorders and vomiting it is unknown whether low level chronic exposure may cause permanent neurological damage typically upon removal from exposure to carbon monoxide symptoms usually resolve themselves unless there has been an episode of severe acute poisoning however one case noted permanent memory loss and learning problems after a three year exposure to relatively low levels of carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace chronic exposure may worsen cardiovascular symptoms in some people chronic carbon monoxide exposure might increase risk of developing atherosclerosis long term exposures to carbon monoxide present greatest risk to persons with coronary heart disease and in females who are pregnant in experimental animals carbon monoxide appears to worsen noise induced hearing loss at noise exposure conditions that would have limited effects on hearing otherwise in humans hearing loss has been reported following carbon monoxide poisoning unlike findings in animal studies noise exposure was not a necessary factor for auditory problems to

exhaust without a catalytic 000 following an explosion in a coal mine carbon monoxide is a product of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide co2 sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke house fires faulty furnaces heaters wood burning stoves internal combustion vehicle exhaust electrical generators propane fueled equipment such as portable stoves and gasoline powered tools such as leaf blowers lawn mowers high pressure washers concrete cutting saws power trowels and welders exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi enclosed spaces riding in back of pickup trucks has led to poisoning in children idling automobiles with exhaust pipe blocked by snow has led to poisoning of car occupants any perforation between exhaust manifold and shroud can result in exhaust gases reaching cabin generators and propulsion engines on boats especially houseboats has resulted in fatal carbon monoxide exposures poisoning may also occur following use of a self contained underwater breathing apparatus scuba due to faulty diving air compressors in caves carbon monoxide can build up in enclosed chambers due to presence of decomposing organic matter in coal mines incomplete combustion may occur during explosions resulting in production of afterdamp gas is up to 3 co and may be fatal after just a single breath following an explosion in a colliery adjacent interconnected mines may become dangerous due to afterdamp leaking from mine to mine such an incident followed grange explosion which killed men in mine another source of poisoning is exposure to organic solvent dichloromethane found in some paint strippers as metabolism of dichloromethane produces carbon monoxide pathophysiology precise mechanisms by which effects of carbon monoxide are induced upon bodily systems are complex and not yet fully understood known mechanisms include carbon monoxide binding to hemoglobin myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase and restricting oxygen supply and carbon monoxide causing brain lipid peroxidation hemoglobin thumb carbon monoxide shifts oxygen dissociation curve to left carbon monoxide has a higher diffusion coefficient compared to oxygen and only enzyme in human body that produces carbon monoxide is heme which is located in all cells and breaks down heme under normal conditions carbon monoxide levels in plasma are approximately 0 mmhg because it has a higher diffusion coefficient and body easily gets rid of any co made when co is not ventilated it binds to hemoglobin which is principal oxygen carrying compound in blood this produces a compound known as carboxyhemoglobin traditional understanding is that carbon monoxide toxicity arises from formation of carboxyhemoglobin which decreases oxygen carrying capacity of blood and inhibits transport delivery and utilization of oxygen by body affinity between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide is approximately 230 times stronger than affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen so hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen hemoglobin is a tetramer with four oxygen binding sites binding of carbon monoxide at one of these sites increases oxygen affinity of remaining three sites which causes hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to tissue this situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting oxygen dissociation curve to left because of increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning little oxygen will actually be released in tissues this causes hypoxic tissue injury hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue myoglobin carbon monoxide also binds to myoglobin it has a high affinity for myoglobin about 60 times greater than that of oxygen carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen this causes reduced cardiac output and hypotension which may result in brain ischemia a delayed return of symptoms have been reported this results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin which subsequently binds to hemoglobin cytochrome oxidase another mechanism involves effects on mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain that is responsible for effective tissue utilization of oxygen carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding this binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient adenosine triphosphate synthesis cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism causing anoxia lactic acidosis and eventual cell death rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism central nervous system effects mechanism that is thought to have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators which cause brain lipid peroxidation degradation of unsaturated fatty acids carbon monoxide causes endothelial cell and platelet release of nitric oxide and formation of oxygen free radicals including peroxynitrite in brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction capillary leakage leukocyte sequestration and apoptosis result of these effects is lipid peroxidation which causes delayed reversible of white matter in central nervous system known as which can lead to edema and necrosis within brain this brain damage occurs mainly during recovery period this may result in cognitive defects especially affecting memory and learning and movement disorders these disorders are typically related to damage to cerebral white matter and basal ganglia hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of white matter globus pallidus cerebellum hippocampus and cerebral cortex pregnancy carbon monoxide poisoning in pregnant women may cause severe adverse fetal effects poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing release of maternal oxygen to fetus carbon monoxide also crosses placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia additionally fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15 higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin causing more severe poisoning in fetus than in adult elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in fetus leading to an accumulation of toxic chemical level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur diagnosis thumb finger tip carboxyhemoglobin saturation monitor note this is not same as a pulse oximeter although some models such as this one do measure both oxygen and carbon monoxide saturation thumb breath co monitor displaying carbon monoxide concentration of an exhaled breath sample in ppm with its corresponding percent concentration of carboxyhemoglobin as many symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections such as flu diagnosis is often difficult a history of potential carbon monoxide exposure such as being exposed to a residential fire may suggest poisoning but diagnosis is confirmed by measuring levels of carbon monoxide in blood this can be determined by measuring amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared to amount of hemoglobin in blood ratio of carboxyhemoglobin to hemoglobin molecules in an average person may be up to 5 although cigarette smokers who smoke two packs per day may have levels up to 9 in symptomatic poisoned people they are often in 10 30 range while persons who die may have postmortem blood levels of 30

carboxyhemoglobin concentration has returned to normal presenting to examination with a normal carboxyhemoglobin level which may happen in late states of poisoning does not rule out poisoning measuring carbon monoxide may be in blood using methods or chromatographic techniques in order to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in a person or to assist in forensic investigation of a case of fatal exposure a co oximeter can be used to determine carboxyhemoglobin levels pulse co oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter these devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through fingertip and measuring light absorption of different types of hemoglobin in capillaries use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter this is due to carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as breath co monitoring offers an alternative to pulse co carboxyhemoglobin levels have been shown to have a strong correlation with breath co concentration however many of these devices require user to inhale deeply and hold their breath to allow co in blood to escape into lung before measurement can be made as this is not possible in people who are unresponsive these devices may not appropriate for use in on scene emergency care detection of co poisoning differential diagnosis there are many conditions to be considered in differential diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning earliest symptoms especially from low level exposures are often non specific and readily confused with other illnesses typically flu like viral syndromes depression chronic fatigue syndrome chest pain and migraine or other headaches carbon monoxide has been called a great due to presentation of poisoning being diverse and nonspecific other conditions included in differential diagnosis include acute respiratory distress syndrome altitude sickness lactic acidosis diabetic ketoacidosis meningitis or opioid or toxic alcohol poisoning prevention thumb carbon monoxide detector connected to a north american power outlet detectors thumb a carbon monoxide monitor clipped to uniform of a paramedic prevention remains a vital public health issue requiring public education on safe operation of appliances heaters fireplaces and internal combustion engines as well as increased emphasis on installation of carbon monoxide detectors carbon monoxide is tasteless odourless and colourless and therefore can not be detected by visual cues or smell united states consumer product safety commission has stated carbon monoxide detectors are as important to home safety as smoke detectors are and recommends each home have at least one carbon monoxide detector and preferably one on each level of building these devices which are relatively inexpensive and widely available are either battery or ac powered with or without battery backup in buildings carbon monoxide detectors are usually installed around heaters and other equipment if a relatively high level of carbon monoxide is detected device sounds an alarm giving people chance to evacuate and ventilate building unlike smoke detectors carbon monoxide detectors do not need to be placed near ceiling level use of carbon monoxide detectors has been standardized in many areas in us nfpa 720 2009 carbon monoxide detector guidelines published by national fire protection association mandates placement of carbon monoxide detectors alarms on every level of residence including basement in addition to outside sleeping areas in new homes ac powered detectors must have battery backup and be interconnected to ensure early warning of occupants at all levels nfpa 720 2009 is first national carbon monoxide standard to address devices in non residential buildings these guidelines which now pertain to schools healthcare centers nursing homes and other non residential buildings include three main points 1 a secondary power supply battery backup must operate all carbon monoxide notification appliances for at least 12 hours 2 detectors must be on ceiling in same room as permanently installed fuel burning appliances and 3 detectors must be located on every habitable level and in every hvac zone of building gas organizations will often recommend to get gas appliances serviced at least once a year legal requirements nfpa standard is not necessarily enforced by law as of april 2006 us state of massachusetts requires detectors to be present in all residences with potential co sources regardless of building age and whether they are owner occupied or rented this is enforced by municipal inspectors and was inspired by death of 7 year old nicole garofalo in 2005 due to snow blocking a home heating vent other jurisdictions may have no requirement or only mandate detectors for new construction or at time of sale despite similar deaths in vehicles with clogged exhaust pipes for example in northeastern united states blizzard of 1978 and february 2013 nor easter and commercial availability of equipment there is no legal requirement for automotive co detectors world health organization recommendations following guideline values ppm values rounded and periods of time weighted average exposures have been determined in such a way that carboxyhaemoglobin cohb level of 2 5 is not exceeded even when a normal subject engages in light or moderate exercise 100 mg m3 87 ppm for 15 min 60 mg m3 52 ppm for 30 min 30 mg m3 26 ppm for 1 h 10

for carbon monoxide poisoning is to immediately remove person from exposure without endangering further people those who are unconscious may require cpr on site administering oxygen via non rebreather mask shortens half life of carbon monoxide from 320 minutes when breathing normal air to only 80 minutes oxygen hastens dissociation of carbon monoxide from carboxyhemoglobin thus turning it back into hemoglobin due to possible severe effects in baby pregnant women are treated with oxygen for longer periods of time than non pregnant people hyperbaric oxygen thumb upright 1 2 a person within a hyperbaric oxygen chamber hyperbaric oxygen is also used in treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning as it may hasten dissociation of co from carboxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase to a greater extent than normal oxygen hyperbaric oxygen at three times atmospheric pressure reduces half life of carbon monoxide to 23 80 3 minutes minutes compared to 80 minutes for oxygen at regular atmospheric pressure it may also enhance oxygen transport to tissues by plasma partially bypassing normal transfer through hemoglobin however it is controversial whether hyperbaric oxygen actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow oxygen in terms of increased survival or improved long term outcomes there have been randomized controlled trials in which two treatment options have been compared of six performed four found hyperbaric oxygen improved outcome and two found no benefit for hyperbaric oxygen some of these trials have been criticized for apparent flaws in their implementation a review of all literature concluded that role of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear and available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit authors suggested a large well designed externally audited multicentre trial to compare normal oxygen with hyperbaric oxygen other further treatment for other complications such as seizure hypotension cardiac abnormalities pulmonary edema and acidosis may be required increased muscle activity and seizures should be treated with dantrolene or diazepam diazepam should only be given with appropriate respiratory support hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids vasopressors may be required to treat myocardial depression cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols if severe metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment is one of most serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning brain damage is confirmed following mri or cat scans extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage outcomes are often difficult to predict following poisoning especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest coma metabolic acidosis or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels one study reported that approximately 30 of people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning will have a fatal outcome it has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy ect may increase likelihood of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae dns after carbon monoxide co poisoning a device that also provides some carbon dioxide to stimulate faster breathing sold under brand name may also be used epidemiology true number of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning is unknown since many non lethal exposures go undetected from available data carbon monoxide poisoning is most common cause of injury and death due to poisoning worldwide poisoning is typically more common during winter months this is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces gas or kerosene space heaters and kitchen stoves during winter months which if faulty and or used without adequate ventilation may produce excessive carbon monoxide carbon monoxide detection and poisoning also increases during power outages when electric heating and cooking appliances become inoperative and residents may temporarily resort to fuel burning space heaters stoves and grills some of which are safe only for outdoor use but nonetheless are burned indoors it has been estimated that more than 40 000 people per year seek medical attention for carbon monoxide poisoning in united states 95 of carbon monoxide poisoning deaths in united states are due to gas space heaters in many industrialized countries carbon monoxide is cause of more than 50 of fatal poisonings in united states approximately 200 people die each year from carbon monoxide poisoning associated with home fuel burning heating equipment carbon monoxide poisoning contributes to approximately 5613 smoke inhalation deaths each year in united states cdc reports each year more than 500 americans die from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning and more than 2 000 commit suicide by intentionally poisoning themselves for 10 year period from 1979 to 1988 56 133 deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning occurred in united states with 25 889 of those being suicides leaving 30 244 unintentional deaths a report from new zealand showed that 206 people died from carbon monoxide poisoning in years of 2001 and 2002 in total carbon monoxide poisoning was responsible for 43 9 of deaths by poisoning in that country in south korea 1 950 people had been poisoned by carbon monoxide with 254 deaths from 2001 through 2003 a report from jerusalem showed 3 53 per 100 000 people were poisoned annually from 2001 through 2006 in hubei china 218 deaths from poisoning were reported over a 10 year period with 16 5 being from carbon monoxide exposure history earliest description of carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 bc by aristotle documented cases of carbon monoxide being used as a method of suicide date to at least 100 bc in ancient rome in ad 350s roman emperor julian suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in paris and later described it in his work misopogon though winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity even so i did not allow my servants to heat house because i was afraid of drawing out dampness in walls but i ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in room a very moderate number of hot coals but coals though there were not very many of them brought out from walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep and since my head was filled with fumes i was almost choked then i was carried outside julian misopogon d this misunderstanding of causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused death of julian s successor jovian john scott haldane identified carbon monoxide as lethal constituent of afterdamp gas created by combustion after examining many bodies of miners killed in pit explosions their skin was coloured cherry pink from carboxyhaemoglobin stable compound formed in blood by reaction with gas as a result of his research he was able to design respirators for rescue workers he tested effect of carbon monoxide on his own body in a closed chamber describing results of his slow poisoning in late 1890s he introduced use of small animals for miners to detect dangerous levels of carbon monoxide underground either white mice or canaries with a faster metabolism they showed effects of poisoning before gas levels became critical for workers and so gave an early warning of problem canary in british pits was replaced in 1986 by electronic gas detector as part of holocaust during world war ii german nazis used gas vans at chelmno extermination camp and elsewhere to kill an estimated over 700 000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning this method was also used in gas chambers of several death camps such as treblinka and belzec gassing with carbon monoxide started in action t4 programme developed by nazis in germany to murder mentally ill and disabled people before war started in earnest gas was supplied by ig farben in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into gas chambers built at various mental hospitals such as euthanasia centre many key personnel were recruited from t4 programme to murder much larger numbers of people in gas vans and special gas chambers used in death camps such as treblinka exhaust fumes from tank engines for example were used to supply gas to chambers worst accidental mass poisoning from carbon monoxide occurred on 3 march 1944 in italy when a freight train with many illegal passengers stalled in a tunnel leading to death of over 500 people use of oxygen as treatment began in 1868 use of hyperbaric oxygen in rats following poisoning was studied by haldane in 1895 while its use in humans began in 1960s research carbon monoxide is produced naturally by body as a byproduct of converting protoporphyrin into bilirubin this carbon monoxide also combines with hemoglobin to make carboxyhemoglobin but not at toxic levels small amounts of co are beneficial and enzymes exist that produce it at times of oxidative stress drugs are being developed to introduce small amounts of co during certain kinds of surgery these drugs are called
