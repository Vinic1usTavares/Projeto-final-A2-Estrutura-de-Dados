stephen rippy composed music for spinoff game halo wars davidge is best known for his work as a co writer and producer for massive attack and has also composed scores for a number of films halo 4 audio director sotaro tojima began looking for game s composer in 2010 i had a vision for overall halo 4 music production that i think of as digital and organic he wrote something very much inspired by game script this vision led him to explore electronica and dance music to find his chosen sound tojima decided on davidge after a year s search 343 industries officially named davidge as halo 4s main composer on april 11 2012 by that point name of halo 4s composer had been kept a secret for fifteen months davidge is a longtime halo fan he would play combat evolved during downtime while producing massive attack albums in 2001 davidge credits games with providing a heroic story that reminded him of his youth reading comic books i d love to be able to inspire people like halo does he said davidge flew to seattle washington in december 2010 to meet 343 industries personnel afterwards he began writing concept and prototype music for project before being officially engaged in july or august 2011 davidge initially thought that scoring video game would be similar to process for a film pretty soon i discovered similarities were few he later told rolling stone since music for game had to dynamically change its length and composition depending on player actions much of halo 4s music was written on guitar or piano at home davidge would sometimes sing melodies into a dictaphone for later transcription while composing he viewed slideshow images and visual material to influence his work davidge played through unfinished portions of game for inspiration he ended up using game s development concept art as inspiration for his music while davidge professed himself as a huge fan of o donnell s work he felt music needed to change to fit new trilogy phrase that kept going around was evolution not revolution of score he said they wanted a more electronic slightly more beat driven direction which is one reason why they came to me they wanted to flesh out sonically a new universe one that they could expand on in subsequent sequels recording thumb right parts of halo 4s score were recorded at abbey road studios recording of much of soundtrack took place at abbey road
