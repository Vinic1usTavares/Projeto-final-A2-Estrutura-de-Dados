hurricane alice was second strongest atlantic hurricane to make landfall in month of june since reliable records began in 1850s while not a major hurricane storm was linked to catastrophic flooding in southern texas and northern mexico especially along rio grande and its tributaries third tropical cyclone and first hurricane of 1954 atlantic hurricane season alice was one of two storms to receive same name that year other being an unusual post season hurricane that persisted into new year of 1955 becoming one of only two january hurricanes on record other having formed in 1938 first alice developed rather suddenly on june 24 over bay of campeche though it may well have formed earlier but went undetected due to limited surface weather observations moving northwestward alice strengthened rapidly as it neared mexican coastline becoming a hurricane early next day by midday on june 25 hurricane reached peak winds of before moving inland well south of u s mexico border storm struck an area with few inhabitants and caused relatively minimal impacts from wind near point of landfall and in southern texas as it moved inland however alice produced prolific rains along and near rio grande resulting in some of worst flooding ever seen in parts of northern mexico and southern texas in some areas flooding amounted to a one in 1 000 year event pecos river crested at which joined with rio grande to produce significant flooding floods destroyed bridges and dikes and flooded many cities along inner reaches of river which reached its highest water levels since 1865 as river overflowed its banks floods breached dikes at piedras negras coahuila destroying large sections of town other communities in mexico reported significant flood damage in united states damage was heaviest in ozona texas where floods killed 15 people and caused 2 million in damage 1954 usd rainfall peaked at over most of which fell in a 24 hour period in all flooding from hurricane alice killed at least 55 people including 17 in u s and 38 in mexico though many deaths in rural mexico may have gone unreported total death toll could have exceeded 150 meteorological history at 12 00 utc on june 24 1954 a moderate tropical storm formed about east of tampico tamaulipas with winds of in 2015 noaa researchers working on reanalysis with hurricane research division examined observations to determine whether alice formed earlier but were unsuccessful due to sparse surface weather observations over bay of campeche first observation of gale force winds occurred at 18 00 utc on june 24 when a ship reported winds and an atmospheric pressure of indicating a well developed cyclone in area based on these data scientists concluded that alice likely formed earlier than indicated but went undetected until that day regardless alice steadily intensified almost immediately upon detection as it headed northwestward strengthening into equivalent of a category 1 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale by 00 00 utc on june 25 early on that day a ship calibrated rapid strengthening of storm measuring winds of at 08 17 utc as alice neared coast of mexico reconnaissance aircraft known as hurricane hunters began tracking eye of hurricane but apparently did not penetrate center of storm they did however provide information about position of storm storm continued to intensify rapidly as it approached coastline south of united states mexico border based on aircraft observations research suggests that alice made landfall about south of matamoros tamaulipas at 14 00 utc on june 25 storm affected a thinly populated segment of mexican coastline and few observations were available to determine strength of hurricane one report taken about south of brownsville texas suggested top winds of at least prior to scientific reexamination hurdat official database containing tracks and intensities of cyclones in north atlantic and eastern north pacific regions listed top winds of at landfall in mexico however a launched from brownsville in time for 12 00 utc observation recorded winds of from southeast at in elevation based on this measurement which may have represented winds in eyewall researchers determined that hurricane alice was likely significantly stronger at landfall than previously assessed they analyzed alice as having struck mexico with winds of while noting great uncertainty and possibility that storm may have even been much stronger than this central pressure in eye was probably or lower as corroborated by observations well inland in texas therefore alice was at least equivalent to a high end category 2 hurricane at landfall and conceivably could have attained major hurricane status after landing hurricane alice gradually weakened as it approximately followed rio grande crossing into southern texas near la grulla just before 00 00 utc on june 26 storm by then had weakened back to a moderate tropical storm with winds of but it still produced gale force winds in several communities across southern texas a few areas in texas may have even experienced hurricane force winds for brief periods before storm entered state but there are no observations to confirm such winds storm likely caused winds of at least in southern texas as it crossed into texas tropical storm alice curved more to north northwest early on june 26 before assuming a sharp bend back westward later in day storm degenerated into a tropical depression by 18 00 utc and dissipated early on june 27 near big bend national park in texas impact thumb right storm total rainfall from hurricane alice in united states before alice moved ashore about 50 girl scouts at a camp were evacuated to a center in brownsville texas residents of padre island were also evacuated residents in storm s path were unprepared due to storm forming suddenly united states coast guard spread word about storm by traversing coast and advising residents to seek shelter officials at u s weather bureau posted northwest storm warnings for brownsville area recommending that small boats to stay at harbor damages along coastline at point of landfall were relatively light winds in brownsville reached which created flying debris that injured one man moderate to strong gales affected rio grande valley inland over southern texas across border minor damage was reported in matamoros tamaulipas and one person there was killed by a fallen power line a few shrimp fishing boats were driven ashore by heavy winds although later there was severe flooding further inland a dam along rio grande prevented significant flooding in brownsville area most of damage resulting from alice was caused by heavy rain in inland areas of texas tamaulipas and coahuila damage was exacerbated in these areas by drought conditions that rendered soil especially vulnerable to erosion estimates of peak rainfall within 12 hours vary from 22 inches 56 cm to 26 inches 132 cm and a total of 35 inches 89 cm of rain fell in 24 hours approaching world record that had been set by an unnamed hurricane in texas in 1921 however a 2010 report on storm s rainfall indicated a maximum of near pandale of which fell in a 24 hour period peak rainfall occurred in a small area centered near pecos river a location along johnson draw reported of rainfall after receiving minimal precipitation in previous three years in addition some locals in western texas experienced rainfall from alice that exceed yearly averages this contributed to significant flooding along pecos river reaching a flood stage of in pandale flooding swept away a group of fishermen in sheffield as well as at a location 10 mi 16 km north of pandale killing four downstream river crested at which washed out a highway and three railroad bridges a temporary bridge was built between eagle pass and piedro negro by july 10 or two weeks after storm destroyed rail lines stranded a sunset limited train which prompted passengers to evacuate to nearby langtry flooding also stranded a southern pacific train whose occupants were later evacuated by helicopters peak river crest corresponded to a discharge rate of 948 000 ft3 s 26 800 m3 s which international boundary and water commission remarked was probably greatest rate of runoff for a watershed of that size in united states heavy rain fell across all of southern texas and northern mexico as a result of alice causing flash floods in inland areas ozona texas was town most affected by floods sustaining 2 million in damage 1954 usd as well as 15 deaths early on morning of june 25 a wall of water as high as 30 feet 9 2 m poured out of a dry gully and overwhelmed most of town roughly a third of ozona had to be evacuated and many livestock there were killed about 500 families were left homeless in town united states military helicopters worked to rescue people trapped by floodwaters in all at least seven towns experienced flooding from storm on either side of border including and laredo texas which were badly damaged by flash floods rio grande rose well above flood level at cities of eagle pass texas and piedras negras coahuila while city of eagle pass was evacuated piedras negras was not both cities were completely flooded and dike intended to protect piedras negras from floods was washed away at least 38 people some sources say 39 were killed in piedras negras after dike collapsed in eagle pass commercial sector was flooded by over of waters which let heavy losses before storm began producing heavy rainfall officials anticipated moderate river flooding that would peak at less than flood of 1948 river crested at laredo texas where waters reached a peak of 62 2 feet 19 m at least 10 feet 3 m above previous record flood high waters caused water treatment plants to fail there which prevented safe delivery of fresh water until july 1 international bridge connecting laredo and nuevo laredo was swept away although severe damage occurred in latter city no deaths were recorded in either city due to evacuations flooding along rio grande was highest since 1865 and was considered a 1 in 2000 year event about 12 000 people were evacuated from nearby ciudad acuna following flood there floods left heavy damage estimates for total death toll range from 55 to 153 death toll estimates for texas range from 17 to 38 though official records indicate that 38 deaths occurred in mexico rather than texas estimates of deaths in mexico where records are less complete vary more widely several of deaths in texas were homeless people attempting to enter united states and as a result their deaths were not counted monetary damage figures are not available but it is known that flooding from alice caused considerable damage to crops primarily cotton aftermath and records while alice left almost unprecedented flooding in its wake storm itself was not an unheard of occurrence a similar storm in 1921 which followed a comparative track caused significant flooding in texas as well albeit not in same areas affected by floods of 1954 following devastation left by alice members of u s air force navy and army flew 21 helicopters with over 81 tons of relief supplies to affected people of mexico and texas including food water medicine and clothing disastrous flooding caused by hurricane alice along rio grande accelerated joint us mexico amistad dam project a series of flood control dams designed to prevent similar catastrophes in future project in planning stages for decades before storm was finally begun in 1960 leftover waters from storm led to an increase in mosquitoes in texas which prompted a widespread application of via airplane on july 1 flood areas of southern texas were declared a major disaster area this followed a delivery of 2 flood specialists 20 laborers 2 portable water treatment plants 7 trucks and a quantity of insecticides and water treatment tablets residents in laredo texas provided citizens of its neighboring city nuevo laredo mexico with food and water mexican government provided temporary homes for affected citizens of flood american officials distributed typhoid vaccinations water purification tablets and insecticides to american cities along rio grande safe water was eventually restored to laredo texas on july 12 all emergency work related to disaster was finished by september 3 besides flooding hurricane alice was also notable for another reason it made landfall with some of strongest winds in a june hurricane on record with top winds of cyclone was second strongest atlantic hurricane to make landfall in month of june behind only hurricane audrey in 1957 which made landfall in louisiana with winds of storm was somewhat analogous to hurricane alex which also affected same region in 2010 with winds of though alex made landfall in early july see also other storms of same name hurricane alex 2010 references alice june 1954 alice june 1954 alice june 1954 category 1954 natural
