performers from folies bergere cabaret and other venues with two cameo appearances from melies himself melies working in collaboration with stage director victor de cottens designed an adventurous automobile trip as an innovative folies bergere act combining stage performance and film with a live prologue and epilogue used to frame filmed sequence after this version premiered on 31 december 1904 melies adapted film to be a standalone release for general distribution in 1905 lavish film available in both black and white and hand colored versions was a popular and critical success both in france and in america however film s high production values made it too expensive for many exhibitors one of several factors that sent melies s career into decline plot king leopold on holiday in paris wants to visit monte carlo but does not have time for seventeen hour express train ride between two cities he happens upon an automobile maker who claims his car can make distance in just two hours king agrees and sets off in car with auto maker acting as chauffeur a large crowd sees them off from outside paris opera house including many celebrities from paris theatre world after stopping to fill car with gas king starts it and from inexperience accidentally runs it backward over a policeman who is squashed flat as a pancake king starts inflating him with a pump and then to save time lets other onlookers finish job while he drives off onlookers set to work with gusto so much so that overinflated policeman ends up exploding car speeds over french countryside and into alps leaping between mountains and knocking over a postman as it goes at gates of dijon town officials try to stop car to enforce octroi tax but car keeps its course and runs headlong into one of officials who explodes in his turn car wends its way across mediterranean coast overturning a fruit stand crashing through a greenhouse colliding with a tar wagon with another explosion ensuing and finally arriving at grandstand of spectators awaiting them at monte carlo car is now going at such speed that rather than stopping in front of grandstand it somersaults up stairs and crashes to earth king and chauffeur unharmed by their adventurous race are greeted warmly production thumb 300px frame from a hand colored print of film for 1904 folies bergere cabaret revue director victor de cottens approached melies then at height of his fame as a filmmaker with idea of combining theatre and cinema by presenting a short film as one of fourteen segments of stage production two directors worked out a scenario that would parody motoring adventures of king leopold ii of belgium who was famous for driving and often crashing fast cars in stage screen amalgamation devised by melies and de cottens segment began as a sketch with live performers before continuing as a film at end of film actor playing king as well as other actors playing cheering spectators returned to stage to finish sketch live

in melies s films impossible voyage tunnelling english channel and conquest of pole played plump lady in dijon scene and folies bergere entertainers blondet and also made appearances melies himself plays two roles in film a mailman who gets knocked over by car and octroi official who explodes melies also cast more extras in film than was usual for him sometimes staging them in layered arrangements for visual clarity and sometimes letting them move at whim to create more disorganized naturalistic groupings in addition to parody of king leopold ii melies s scenario for film features another topical element scene with tar wagon is based on experiments of ernest who spread tar over a small part of gravel road to monaco this experiment widely reported by press successfully eliminated dust clouds kicked up by cars on gravel and sand roads film s special effects were created using stage machinery miniature models pyrotechnics and editing technique known as substitution splice long shots showing car were filmed with a miniature car and a landscape rolling past it creating a multiplane effect most scenes including detailed and faithful recreation of place de l opera outside opera house were painted studio sets as was melies s custom however last scene showing arrival at monte carlo was filmed not in studio but outdoors in melies s garden release and reception thumb upright left new amsterdam theater in 1905 year an adventurous automobile trip was shown there an adventurous automobile trip premiered at gala opening night of folies bergere revue on 31 december 1904 it ran for six months at folies bergere lasting more than 300 performances melies also intended for film to be shown by exhibitors elsewhere outside context of revue thus after its folies bergere run it was released as a standalone item by melies s star film company and numbered 740 749 in its catalogues where it is advertised as a grande course fantastique as with at least four percent of melies s output film was available both in black and white and in individually hand colored prints sold at a higher price film was also released in united states by new york branch of melies s company during summer of 1905 erlanger showed it at aerial gardens on rooftop of new amsterdam theatre in american release scenes were slightly rearranged first and second scenes were switched in order as were sixth and seventh in addition because of a renumbering ten tableaux were advertised instead of french catalogue s twelve although no scenes were removed two prints of film surviving in melies family s archive cinematheque melies use french ordering of scenes another discrepancy between french and american catalogues occurs for political reasons american catalog specifies that protagonist is king leopold but french one keeps identity anonymous so as not to offend belgian audiences similarly alps in film are named as such in american catalog but are unnamed in french one thumb upright georges melies an adventurous automobile trip was one of melies s most successful films and ran to acclaim at folies bergere for six months a notice in new york clipper said that film is very clever and keeps audience in continuous good humor morning telegraph concurred reporting that film scored an instant success nothing funnier has been seen here in many a day thing is a scream however venture was not as profitable as melies had expected high costs of lavish hand colored film put it out of reach of many fairground exhibitors these financial difficulties which continued with melies s similarly spectacular film merry frolics of satan following year helped hasten decline of melies s career portions of at least three prints of film survive a complete nitrate print with car sometimes painted red given to melies s granddaughter madeleine malthete melies by an american collector an incomplete hand colored nitrate print bought by malthete melies from a belgian collector and some fragments at academy of motion picture arts and sciences in his book length study of melies film historian john frazer spoke highly of film noting its careful use of continuity of direction and comparing it to mack sennett s slapstick comedies and to 1968 automobile film chitty chitty bang bang melies made another film in a similar vein le raid new york paris en
