acid tongue is second studio album by american singer songwriter jenny lewis released in september 2008 through warner bros and rough trade records inspired by jam sessions album was recorded in january 2008 in van nuys california with intent of capturing a more live feeling than 2006 s rabbit fur coat lewis worked with a number of guest musicians and wrote album with boyfriend johnathan rice lewis rice jason lader and dave scher produced album acid tongue features musical styles ranging from indie rock to alternative country and americana acid tongue was released to generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics receiving praise for lewis lyrics and vocals however some reviewers criticized numerous collaborations and felt sound overwhelmed lewis album charted at number twenty two in united states and number fifty five in united kingdom influences and recording lewis first began work on acid tongue after writing title track on her rabbit fur coat tour she attempted to work out an arrangement for rilo kiley s under blacklight it didn t work so lewis recorded it for a second solo album according to los angeles times lewis was inspired by house parties at jonathan wilson s laurel canyon home we d go to these jams in canyon they re fantastic jonathan invites older session musicians from real laurel canyon era and younger people who are just starting their bands who happen to live in canyon and we all get together and sing grateful dead covers and j j cale songs lewis herself has said that it rocks a little harder in contrast to rabbit fur coats folk rock influences lewis also used rilo kiley s under blacklight which was notably polished compared to band s earlier work as a reference point to go in complete opposite direction she explained that every song she writes is a response to thing that i ve written before it s even as simple as ok i ve written a ballad now i want to push myself to write something that s up tempo if i m writing about myself well that subject can be tiresome so then i focus on character driven songs so i m always doing this back and forth just to keep myself interested album was recorded in just three weeks at sound city studios in van nuys california album was co produced by lewis s boyfriend johnathan rice former beachwood sparks and all night radio member dave scher and under blacklight producer jason lader lewis attempted to record as many of songs live as possible we did it in studio for my 32nd birthday according to lewis and we had a great time collaborating with a bunch of friends it was definitely a lot less focused than rabbit fur coat with that record i had a very specific vision but with this record it was really more about vibe songs and collaborations a source quoted by entertainment weekly said that album all sounds super natural nice and simple like it doesn t belong in any decade it s just timeless album was inspired by a variety of musical styles including alternative country americana indie rock and soul talking to nashville scene lewis said that songs weren t written off cuff but they were definitely recorded not carelessly but with a real effort to capture a live feeling particularly with vocals lewis continued to me it s a big step in a different direction and to be able to sink into vocal take while band was playing was a very liberating experience for me lewis told a v club we played them on road 100 times so we knew that we could walk into studio and record them same way it wasn t really a studio record but more of a live record in some ways it was about getting band together and creating an atmosphere that lent itself to good chemistry between band members and trying to capture as much of record live as we could as a child of digital generation lewis had generally worked with pro tools but wanted to capture not perfect sound of some of her favorite records musicians were split into two separate bands band a setup jason boesel davey faragher johnathan rice and blake mills would generally play more rock and roll songs while band b would play ballads composition album s title track was described by lewis as her thinly veiled way of getting out of writing a strictly confessional song lewis told greg kot of chicago tribune i may be a liar or i may not be one song also referenced a childhood experience of lewis in which she experienced lsd at age of 14 next messiah a nine minute ode to barbra streisand and devil was tracked completely live with all transitions and it s most exciting thing i ve ever been involved with in studio i wish rest of record had been more like that song is actually three different songs that johnathan rice and myself wrote together according to lewis i happen to be a barbra streisand fan and barbra streisand fancies a medley so we discussed stringing three songs together album features a duet with elvis costello carpetbaggers song was written by lewis boyfriend johnathan rice to be performed on rabbit fur coat tour because they were lacking uptempo songs lewis wanted to make it less country and a little more pop so i emailed elvis he mentioned he had two new songs and would we be open to recording them these songs became part of costello s she him s zooey deschanel provides backing vocals on a number of songs while her bandmate m ward plays a moody guitar part on pretty bird ward said that acid tongue is greatest record jenny has ever made there are a number of other collaborations on acid tongue fellow rilo kiley member jason boesel davey faragher of costello s band imposters benji hughes ana and paz lenchantin chris robinson of black crowes and jonathan wilson all make contributions album features production credits from lewis boyfriend johnathan rice farmer dave scher and rilo kiley producer jason lader lewis s sister leslie lewis provides backing vocals on two tracks while her father eddie gordon plays bass harp and harmonica he was ill last year so we started speaking to one another lewis told independent there were no hard feelings he just wasn t around every couple of years i d get a postcard from road a picture of him standing next to a giant ice sculpture of a crab in alaska he was a very mysterious character but i thought this was right time to bring him in next messiah was influenced by her father when someone isn t around you create what you imagine your father might be a race car driver a four leaf clover lewis explained lewis has said that a lot of her inspiration for both acid tongue and previous work comes from her parents lewis also told independent i just don t know them very well and i m still trying to understand what happened with divorce and why it s this blank slate i can t even remember what happened but for some reason these two people are so incredibly strange and funny and beautiful and messed up that i want to keep writing about them and maybe figure out who i am in process release entertainment weekly announced that lewis had been working on album in february 2008 prior to acid tongue s release lewis allowed listeners to hear title track by calling toll free telephone number 1 888 717 acid song was later replaced by a recording announcing two secret performances in september including a password and website to obtain tickets additionally several videos were put up on lewis official youtube page videos show lewis or band mates at home being visited by ben gibbard of death cab for cutie and postal service who has arrived with balloons to listen to new album ben is told that album isn t out yet

page though not technically downloadable it was quickly accessed through other means and made available through file sharing album was released in both cd and lp formats in a number of territories throughout late september select independent record stores also gave away a 7 single of next messiah split between two sides of record lewis toured in support of album s release including an appearance at austin city limits festival and opening for conor oberst critical tongue has received generally favorable reviews scoring a 75 on review aggregator metacritic creative loafing said that while rabbit fur coat glided through an appalachian dream world lewis stomps her boots while exploring similar terrain on acid tongue review continued that while album includes plenty of quirky meditations on lost love that recall her previous adventures well placed jolts give acid tongue greater balance a component that s lacking on rabbit fur coat according to sunday times results are magnificent but occasionally they are a shaky misstep chicago sun times writer jim derogatis called acid tongue sensual and entrancing daily trojan labeled tracks as psychedelic occasionally sexy but always timeless although noting that album lacks a thematic focus that can be found on every other album lewis has released filter referred to album s title track as simply beautiful causing goosebumps to arms of even toughest man it s rather deep despite its simplicity a difficult task to say least it has also been called a prime example of lewis simplistic genius times said verses in title track tickle and tease so that you are practically for chorus it was also noted that lewis delicately seductive vocals are more versatile with detroit free press stating that her voice smoothly mixes classic country with pop and indie rock lewis is as adept on ballads as she is on rave ups times considered lewis songwriting leagues ahead of anything that she has done in past and her vocals sound as though she means it derogatis pointed out that lewis impressive strength as both a singer and a songwriter is that she makes every listener feel as if her music was crafted just for them however angela zimmerman of crawdaddy felt that lewis often used a pervasive soprano that she can t quite execute on tracks like black sand pretty bird trying my best to love you and jack killed mom pitchfork said that while acid tongue is immediately pleasurable album s downfall is that lewis does such a good job of nailing choice sounds and styles from pop s past that you can t help getting reeled in right away only upon later reflection do you realize that much of her success lies in evoking something else great rather than achieving a greatness more uniquely her own review continued in these straitjacketed settings lewis considerable strengths as a lyricist and performer just aren t given sufficient room to fully emerge time noted that acid tongue sprawl with misplaced ambition and that only title track sticks another review observed lewis seems to be on her way to a more definitive musical existence but she doesn t quite seem to know yet acid tongue was also slated for its hip hop like roster of unnecessary cameos zooey deschanel and m ward of she and him make sense but elvis costello sounds intrusive during his duet on carpetbaggers while black crowes chris robinson is just superfluous crawdaddy s zimmerman said that while these appearances help flavor record i miss watson twins album was made number 14 in blenders 33 best albums of 2008 list and number 46 in qs 50
