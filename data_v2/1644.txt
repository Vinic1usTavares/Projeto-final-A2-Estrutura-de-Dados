hurricane hernan was second of three category 5 hurricanes during 2002 pacific hurricane season twelfth tropical cyclone tenth named storm and sixth hurricane of season hernan originated from a tropical wave that formed in atlantic ocean and crossed to pacific ocean wave spawned a low pressure system which organized into a tropical depression on august 30 a tropical storm on august 31 and a hurricane later that day hernan rapidly intensified and reached peak intensity as a category 5 storm on saffir simpson hurricane scale proceeding northwest it maintained this strength for eight hours but on september 2 it entered cooler waters and began to weaken by september 6 it had degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure hernan was second most intense hurricane of season and it maintained category 5 status for second longest time of season behind hurricane kenna although hernan remained far from land swells of caused minor beach erosion along coast of mexico in addition an associated remnant plume of moisture generated light shower activity in southern california as it tracked just offshore meteorological history on august 16 a tropical wave left coast of africa it traveled westward across atlantic ocean crossing over central america and emerging in eastern pacific where it merged with a pre existing intertropical convergence zone disturbance system gradually developed moderate convection and on august 30 it had developed sufficient convection to be designated tropical depression 10 e depression produced persistent strong thunderstorms primarily in two areas of deep convection located to northeast and west of center of circulation although center was elongated wind shear over system remained light and outflow was good which led forecasters to predict modest intensification on afternoon of august 30 banding features became evident and depression was upgraded to tropical storm hernan with sustained winds of 45 mph 72 km h further organization occurred and center of circulation became encircled by convective thunderstorms on august 31 storm was upgraded to hurricane hernan as it moved northwestward about 400 miles 634 km southwest of acapulco right thumb trmm overpass image of hernan s rainfall distribution after peak intensity light wind shear and favorable ocean temperatures led to steady intensification of storm and satellite images indicated that an eye had developed late on august 31 storm quickly reached category 3 on saffir simpson scale as it continued strengthening its eye became ragged while its lateral movement to northwest rose to 17 mph around southern periphery of a strong deep layer ridge over united states by september 1 hurricane reached its peak intensity as a category 5 hurricane with winds of 160 mph 260 km h and a minimum pressure of 921 mb hpa on september 2 hernan began weakening after its cloud tops had warmed slightly soon after an eyewall replacement cycle began causing storm to be downgraded to category 3 just before it turned slightly to west later in day storm underwent another eyewall replacement cycle as winds decreased further as storm entered cooler waters it quickly weakened below major hurricane intensity soon hernan was downgraded to category 1 and its eye became cloud filled on september 5 hernan was downgraded to a tropical storm as storm rapidly decayed despite developing a new band of convection later in day system was downgraded to a tropical depression as it began to lose its tropical characteristics strong wind shear developed weakening depression further on september 6 system degenerated into a remnant low pressure system which spawned a remnant plume of moisture that meandered off coast of california producing light showers impact hurricane hernan remained far from shore and caused little damage to land it brought light wind to socorro island off coast of mexico rough surf caused minor impact in open waters near center of hernan waves generated by storm were unofficially estimated to exceed 70 feet 21 meters however official buoys reported swells of 57 feet 17 meters along coast of mexico waves reached causing minor beach erosion a portion of hernan s remnant moisture off southern california coast produced light rainfall and slippery roads see also other tropical cyclones named hernan list of category 5 pacific hurricanes list of california hurricanes references external links tropical cyclone report storm path category 2002 pacific hurricane season category category 5 pacific hurricanes category pacific hurricanes in mexico
