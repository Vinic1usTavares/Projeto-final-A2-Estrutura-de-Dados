battle of elephant point was an airborne operation conducted by a composite gurkha airborne battalion that took place on 1 may 1945 in march 1945 plans were made for an assault on rangoon capital of burma as a stepping stone on way to recapturing malaya and singapore initial plans for assault on city had called for a purely land based approach by british fourteenth army but concerns about heavy japanese resistance led to this being modified with addition of a joint amphibious airborne assault this assault led by 26th indian division would sail up rangoon river but before it could do so river would have to be cleared of japanese and british mines in order to achieve this coastal defences along river would have to be neutralized including a battery at elephant point this task was given to 44th indian airborne division but division was in middle of a reorganization and as such a composite battalion was formed from two gurkha parachute battalions battalion assembled and then trained throughout april and then early in morning of 1 may was dropped near elephant point as it advanced towards battery one of battalion s companies was attacked by american bombers causing a number of casualties despite this and torrential rain battalion successfully assaulted elephant point and neutralized battery there after a fierce firefight it remained around elephant point until 2 may when 26th indian division conducted its amphibious assault and secured rangoon background on 22 march as joint battles of meiktila and mandalay were drawing to a close a conference was held at monywa in burma attended by senior allied military figures including admiral lord mountbatten commander in chief of allied south east asia command and general william slim commander of fourteenth army object of conference was to discuss future allied strategy in south east asia in aftermath of meiktila and mandalay including reconquest of burma and retaking of malaya and then singapore in order to secure these objectives however rangoon capital of burma would have to be captured before onset of monsoon rains which would impede any allied advance over land allied chiefs of staff worked on assumption that this would occur before june allen p 459 after rangoon had fallen a force of between four and five divisions would be landed in western malaya in an operation code named zipper which would itself be followed by capture of singapore allen p 460 to accommodate all of these goals mountbatten insisted that rangoon be taken by may slim had initially planned to take city in a pincer movement with xxxiii corps advancing towards city down east bank of irrawaddy river via and iv corps taking a shorter route along river valley to east slim believed that japanese had insufficient forces to block both thrusts and one of corps would therefore be able to capture rangoon however mountbatten was unsure that a purely overland advance would be successful and that a joint airborne amphibious assault would therefore be better option slim and others such as slim s superior general oliver leese commander of allied land forces south east asia initially opposed such an operation fearing that it would divert vital resources from fourteenth army by time of meeting at monywa however slim had come around to mountbatten s way of thinking fearing that a purely overland advance would meet fierce japanese resistance as it had at meiktila and be delayed at end of an overextended supply line as such a combined airborne and amphibious assault would be ideal as fourteenth army neared rangoon slim arguing that it would be a hammering at back door while i burst in at front allen p 461 on 2 april orders were issued for operation to go ahead with proviso that rangoon be in allied hands by 5 may at latest latimer pp 407 409 planning joint operation was christened dracula and its schedule was decided by royal navy under command of admiral arthur power who was responsible for amphibious portion of assault on rangoon several problems had to be overcome during planning for operation first and least likely was that amphibious assault would be intercepted by elements of imperial japanese navy as it neared rangoon allen p 467 to ensure that amphibious elements would remain unmolested 21 carrier squadron commanded by commodore g n oliver was attached to provide fight cover for landings squadron consisted of four escort carriers two cruisers and four destroyers operating further out would be 3rd battle squadron commanded by vice admiral walker which was formed of two battleships and free french battleship richelieu as well another two escort carriers four cruisers and six destroyers two days prior to dracula taking place this massive naval screen bombed several ports and airfields and also engaged a japanese troop convoy transporting more than one thousand japanese troops to nearby moulmein sinking all vessels royal air force would provide support in form of two raf long range fighter wings and united states army air forces with eight b 24 liberator and four b 25 mitchell bomber squadrons more of a concern to dracula s planners however were land based threats to landing craft carrying assault troops of 26th indian division air support was deemed to be vital to operation s success and a number of japanese airfields around toungoo were captured in days leading up to dracula allen p 468 there was also problem of defences in and around river rangoon up which landing craft were to sail river itself was heavily mined a result of japanese defensive measures as well as raf offensive operations earlier in conflict and it would have to be swept and cleared of mines before any amphibious assault could take place before this could occur however coastal defences along banks of river would have to be neutralized a particular worry was presence of an artillery battery at elephant point on west bank of river geography of area ensured that battery could not be destroyed through artillery bombardment or airstrikes and weather conditions precluded an early amphibious assault tugwell p 284 as such it was decided that a day before dracula began on 2 may a parachute battalion would be dropped near elephant point with task of assaulting and destroying battery harclerode p 639 task was given to 44th indian airborne division but this presented several problems division was in middle of a reorganization and many of its officers were on leave as were two gurkha airborne battalions another 3rd gurkha parachute battalion was about to transfer to 77th indian parachute brigade with no one unit available a composite force was put together for operation headquarters company was formed of men from 2nd and 3rd gurkha parachute battalions and each battalion provided a further two companies a and b from 2nd gurkha parachute battalion and c and d from 3rd gurkha parachute battalion a mortar platoon and machine gun platoon augmented ad hoc formation harclerode pp 639 640 battalion was formed in early april and came under command of major jack newland after its initial formation it transferred to where its strength was augmented by field ambulance and indian engineers sections and it undertook training for operation when was this was completed it was transported to midnapore where for ten days it assembled its equipment and conducted a rehearsal exercise finally on 29 april it was flown to on burmese coast approximately 200 miles north of rangoon and was soon joined by a 200 strong reserve force formed of men from both gurkha battalions and 152nd indian parachute battalion harclerode p 640 battalion would be transported in 40 c 47 skytrain transport aircraft belonging to 1st and 2nd united states air commando group battle right thumb men of 15th indian corps land near elephant point at beginning of operation dracula 2 may 1945 at 02 30 on 1 may a c 47 of 317 tactical control squadron usaaf departed for rangoon carrying a twenty man pathfinder team followed by a ccg plane carrying a pair of vcp to mark and defend landing zone at rest of composite battalion boarded thirty eight dakotas and took off thirty minutes later and at 05 45 jumped over drop zone there were only a few casualties one being a medical officer attached to battalion it encountered no japanese opposition and after it had rallied advanced towards elephant point and artillery battery it halted 3 000 yards in front of battery to allow b 24 liberators from usaaf to carry out a preliminary bombing attack on battery unfortunately despite officers and other ranks wearing yellow recognition panels and carrying orange umbrellas to identify themselves c company was bombed and strafed by bombers causing a number of casualties sources disagree on exact number of casualties allen p 479 states that over thirty casualties were caused whilst both tugwell p 284 and latimer p 414 give figure of forty casualties harclerode p 640 provides exact figures of fifteen killed and thirty wounded as a result a forward air controller attached to battalion ordered a halt to all further bombing runs on battery after moving through torrential rain allen p 479 battalion reached elephant point at 16 00 and close quarters fighting then took place with flame throwers being used against several japanese bunkers guarding battery tugwell p 285 about forty japanese soldiers and gunners were killed during assault and battalion also sustained several casualties once again figures given for japanese casualties and prisoners vary tugwell p 285 states that forty three japanese soldiers were killed while harclerode p 461 states thirty seven allen p 479 gives figure of thirty seven but says that thirty six were killed and one taken prisoner british casualties are also varied tugwell p 285 gives figure of seven casualties during assault and harclerode p 461 a total of forty one during entire action including casualties caused by friendly fire after battery had been secured battalion dug in around elephant point and awaited arrival of relief force which landed at at 15 30 with a supply drop following it several minutes later as it neared position of battalion surgical team accompanying relief force was accidentally fired upon by gurkhas causing four members of team to be wounded battalion remained where it was through night although high tides submerged a number of trenches and forced battalion to higher ground by dawn of 2 may after it had cleared a number of nearby bunkers battalion was able to watch as minesweepers cleared rangoon river for columns of landing craft following behind them aftermath operation dracula was a complete success as japanese forces had actually vacated rangoon several days prior to amphibious landing 36th indian infantry brigade was able to occupy city without encountering any japanese opposition harclerode p 641 shortly after rangoon s occupation japanese forces called for a cease fire and plans for amphibious landing in western malaya and an advance into singapore were cancelled instead british and commonwealth forces landed unopposed and liberated those areas and also temporarily occupied thailand on 3 may composite battalion moved to and two days later leaving one company behind it was transferred to rangoon where it conducted anti looting operations and also searched for japanese stragglers remaining in city it left city on 16 may and travelled to india by ship where it rejoined 44th indian airborne division it had been division s first major airborne operation 2nd air commando group s c 47s which had transported parachute battalion returned to kalaikunda and then moved to comilla 317th tactical control squadron spent next two weeks supplying xv corps who were engaged with japanese forces northeast of rangoon and returned to kalaikunda on 19 may group s fighter squadrons provided air cover for rangoon until 9 may when they too returned to home station y
