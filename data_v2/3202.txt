bockscar sometimes called bock s car is name of united states army air forces b 29 bomber that dropped a fat man nuclear weapon over japanese city of nagasaki during world war ii in second and last nuclear attack in history one of 15 silverplate b 29s used by 509th bockscar was built at glenn l martin aircraft plant at bellevue nebraska at what is now offutt air force base and delivered to united states army air forces on 19 march 1945 it was assigned to 393d bombardment squadron 509th composite group to wendover army air field utah in april bockscar was used in 13 training and practice missions from tinian and three combat missions in which it dropped pumpkin bombs on industrial targets in japan on 9 august 1945 bockscar piloted by 393d bombardment squadron s commander major charles w sweeney dropped a fat man nuclear bomb with a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of tnt over city of nagasaki about 44 of city was destroyed 35 000 people were killed and 60 000 injured after war bockscar returned to united states in november 1945 in september 1946 it was given to national museum of united states air force at wright patterson air force base ohio aircraft was flown to museum on 26 september 1961 and its original markings were restored nose art was added after mission official usaaf photo dated 11 august 1945 two days after mission shows aircraft with no nose art see at bockscar is now on permanent display at national museum of united states air force dayton ohio next to a replica of a fat man airplane history thumb 300px right bockscar at dayton before it was moved

day of its atomic bombing mission bockscar b 29 36 mo 44 victor number 77 was one of 15 silverplate b 29s used by 393d bombardment squadron of 509th composite group bockscar was built at glenn l martin aircraft plant at bellevue nebraska at what is now offutt air force base as a block 35 aircraft it was one of 10 modified as a silverplate and re designated block 36 silverplate involved extensive modifications to b 29 to carry nuclear weapons bomb bay doors and fuselage section between bomb bays were removed to create a single bomb bay british suspensions and bracing were attached for both shape types with gun type suspension anchored in aft bomb bay and implosion type mounted in forward bay weight reduction was also accomplished by removal of gun turrets and armor plating these b 29s also had an improved engine r 3350 41 silverplate aircraft represented a significant increase in performance over standard variants delivered to united states army air forces on 19 march 1945 bockscar was assigned to captain frederick c bock and crew c 13 and flown to wendover army air field utah in april name chosen for aircraft and painted on it after mission was a pun on name of aircraft commander it left wendover on 11 june 1945 for tinian where it arrived 16 june it was originally given victor unit assigned identification number 7 but on 1 august was given triangle n tail markings of 444th bombardment group as a security measure and had its victor changed to 77 to avoid misidentification with an actual 444th aircraft bockscar was used in 13 training and practice missions from tinian and three combat missions in which it dropped pumpkin bombs on industrial targets in japan in which bock s crew bombed and musashino and first lieutenant charles donald albury and crew c 15 bombed atomic bomb mission mission and crew bockscar was flown on 9 august 1945 by crew of another b 29 great artiste and piloted by major charles w sweeney commander of 393d bombardment squadron plane was co piloted by first lieutenant charles donald albury normal aircraft commander of crew c 15 great artiste was designated as observation instrumentation support plane for second mission and another b 29 big stink flown by group operations officer major james i hopkins jr as photographic aircraft mission had as its primary target city of kokura where kokura arsenal was located its secondary target was nagasaki where two large mitsubishi armament plants were located bockscar had been flown by sweeney and crew c 15 in three test drop rehearsals of inert fat man assemblies in eight days leading up to second mission including final rehearsal day before great artiste which was assigned aircraft of crew with whom sweeney most often flew had been designated in preliminary planning to drop second bomb but aircraft had been fitted with observation instruments for hiroshima mission moving instrumentation from great artiste to bockscar would have been a complex and time consuming process and when second atomic bomb mission was moved up from 11 august to 9 august because of adverse weather forecasts crews of great artiste and bockscar instead exchanged aircraft result was that bomb was carried by bockscar but flown by crew c 15 of great artiste kokura and nagasaki during pre flight inspection of bockscar flight engineer notified sweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump made it impossible to use of fuel carried in a reserve tank this fuel would still have to be carried all way to japan and back consuming still more fuel replacing pump would take hours moving fat man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well as bomb was live group commander colonel paul tibbets and sweeney therefore elected to have bockscar continue mission thumb right preserved tinian bomb pit 2 where fat man was loaded aboard bockscar bockscar took off from tinian s north field at 03 49 mission profile directed b 29s to fly individually to rendezvous point changed because of bad weather from iwo jima to yakushima island and at cruising altitude instead of customary increasing fuel consumption bockscar began its climb to bombing altitude a half hour before rendezvous before mission tibbets had warned sweeney to take no more than fifteen minutes at rendezvous before proceeding to target bockscar reached rendezvous point and assembled with great artiste but after circling for some time big stink failed to appear as they orbited yakushima weather planes enola gay and laggin dragon reported both kokura and nagasaki within accepted parameters for required visual attack though ordered not to circle longer than fifteen minutes sweeney continued to wait for big stink at urging of commander frederick ashworth plane s weaponeer who was in command of mission after exceeding original departure time limit by a half hour bockscar accompanied by great artiste proceeded to kokura thirty minutes away delay at rendezvous had resulted in clouds and drifting smoke from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 b 29s on nearby yahata previous untold story of how japanese steel workers saved their city from atomic bomb covering 70 of area over kokura obscuring aiming point three bomb runs were made over next 50 minutes burning fuel and exposing aircraft repeatedly to heavy defenses of yahata but bombardier was unable to drop visually by time of third bomb run japanese anti aircraft fire was getting close and second lieutenant jacob beser who was monitoring japanese communications reported activity on japanese fighter direction radio bands thumb left mushroom cloud as seen from one of b 29s on mission increasingly critical fuel shortage resulted in decision by sweeney and ashworth to reduce power to conserve fuel and divert to secondary target nagasaki approach to nagasaki twenty minutes later indicated that heart of city s downtown was also covered by dense cloud ashworth decided to bomb nagasaki using radar but according to bockscar s bombardier captain kermit beahan a small opening in clouds at end of three minute bomb run permitted him to identify target features bockscar visually dropped fat man at 10 58 local time it exploded 43 seconds later with a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of tnt at an altitude of approximately northwest of planned aiming point resulting in destruction of 44 of city failure to drop fat man at precise bomb aim point caused atomic blast to be confined to urakami valley as a consequence a major portion of city was protected by intervening hills but even so bomb was dropped over city s industrial valley midway between mitsubishi steel and arms works in south and mitsubishi urakami ordnance works in north an estimated 35 000 people were killed and 60 000 injured during bombing at nagasaki of those killed 23 200 28 200 were japanese munitions workers 2 000 were korean slave laborers and 150 were japanese soldiers landing and debriefing because of delays in mission and inoperative fuel transfer pump b 29 did not have sufficient fuel to reach emergency landing field at iwo jima so sweeney flew aircraft to okinawa arriving there he circled for 20 minutes trying to contact control tower for landing clearance finally concluding that his radio was faulty critically low on fuel bockscar barely made it to runway at yontan airfield on okinawa with only enough fuel for one landing attempt sweeney and albury brought bockscar in at instead of normal firing distress flares to alert field of uncleared landing number two engine died from fuel starvation as bockscar began its final approach touching runway hard heavy b 29 slewed left and towards a row of parked b 24 bombers before pilots managed to regain control b 29 s reversible propellers were insufficient to slow aircraft adequately and with both pilots standing on brakes bockscar made a swerving 90 degree turn at end of runway to avoid running off runway a second engine died from fuel exhaustion by time plane came to a stop flight engineer later measured fuel in tanks and concluded that less than five minutes total remained following mission there was confusion over identification of plane first eyewitness account by war correspondent william l laurence of new york times who accompanied mission aboard aircraft piloted by bock reported that sweeney was leading mission in great artiste however he also noted its victor number as 77 which was that of bockscar writing that several personnel commented that 77 was also jersey number of football player red grange laurence had interviewed sweeney and his crew in depth and was aware that they referred to their airplane as great artiste except for enola gay none of 393d s b 29s had yet had names painted on noses a fact which laurence himself noted in his account and unaware of switch in aircraft laurence assumed victor 77 was great artiste in fact great artiste was victor 89 current status right thumb engine controls after war bockscar returned to united states in november 1945 and served with 509th at roswell army air field new mexico it was nominally assigned to operation crossroads task force but there are no records indicating that it deployed for tests in august 1946 it was assigned to army air force unit at davis monthan army air field arizona for storage at davis monthan it was placed on display as aircraft that bombed nagasaki but in markings of great artiste in september 1946 title was passed to air force museum now national museum of united states air force at wright patterson air force base ohio aircraft was flown to museum on 26 september 1961 and its original markings were restored bockscar is now on permanent display at national museum of united states air force dayton ohio this display a primary exhibit in museum s air power gallery includes a replica of a fat man bomb and signage that states that it was aircraft that ended wwii in 2005 a short documentary was made about
