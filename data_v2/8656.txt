cerro blanco is a caldera in andes of catamarca province in argentina part of central volcanic zone of andes it is a volcano collapse structure located at an altitude of in a depression caldera is associated with a less well defined caldera to south and several lava domes caldera has been active for last eight million years and eruptions have created several ignimbrites a recent eruption occurred 73 000 years ago and formed campo de la piedra pomez ignimbrite layer about 2 300 160 bce largest volcanic eruption of central andes with a vei 7 occurred at cerro blanco forming most recent caldera as well as thick ignimbrite layers over of tephra were erupted then volcano is dormant since then with some deformation and geothermal activity a major future eruption would put local communities to south at risk volcano is also known for giant ripple marks that have formed on its ignimbrite fields persistent wind action on ground has shifted gravel and sand forming wave like structures these ripple marks have heights up to and are separated by distances up to unlike dunes they do not migrate with wind and are stationary these ripple marks are among most extreme on earth and have been compared to martian ripple marks by geologists geography and geology regional setting central volcanic zone of andes is an area between 14 28deg southern latitude where volcanic activity dates to eocene activity has occurred over whole area particularly north of 25deg southern latitude where altiplano puna volcanic complex is situated ignimbrites are primarily rhyolite and rhyodacite and subordinate shoshonite more southern ignimbrites are felsic and have a low crystal content with exception of caldera and cerro galan most volcanism south of 25deg southern latitude is of low volume after a phase of pyroclastic activity in area during eocene a number of volcanoes formed from calc alkaline magmas during miocene changes in subduction geometry including removal of continental crust from boundary 8 3 mya have caused a thickening of crust as well as an eastward shift of volcanic front huaynaputina volcano in peru is part of central volcanic zone and had a major eruption in 1600 most ignimbrites of southern sector have volumes of or less and are associated with stratovolcanoes and small calderas they are derived from fractional crystallization of andesitic magmas with variable crustal input local setting cerro blanco is part of central volcanic zone and is located at southern limit of puna it forms a volcanic unit together with aguada alumbrera ignimbrite at eastern edge of cordillera de san buenaventura rocks beneath this unit include dacitic trachyandesitic volcanites 9 7 mya old and an igneous metamorphic granitic basement containing quartz of neoproterozoic early paleozoic age containing paleozoic mafic to ultramafic volcanic inclusions cordillera de san buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of upper miocene quaternary age during miocene pleistocene isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water poor and unoxidized this finding is consistent with a hot mantle forming after of crust and migration of arc nevado tres cruces lies to west and nevado ojos del salado lies to southwest of cerro blanco centre east northeast running fault systems are controlled by local tectonics and may be responsible for formation of cordillera de san buenaventura 4 3 7 mya laguna west of cerro blanco erupted rhyolites unlike cerro blanco s ignimbrites better known cerro galan caldera lies northeast of cerro blanco it forms a southwest northeast volcanic line with cerro blanco and this line was active less than 2 5 mya ago another trend is defined by line running from sierra nevada over cerro condor and cerro peinado to blanco other volcanic centres in region are miocene pliocene ignimbrites las juntas and las papas minor bimodal mafic volcanic centres during pleistocene holocene include volcanoes in ventura salar de carachi pampa and volcan negro peinado felsic centres include chascon and cueros de purulla cerro purulla lies north northwest of cerro blanco and la hoyada volcanic complex lies directly west cueros de purulla and chascon are major sources of obsidian in puna of catamarca region cerro blanco complex is formed from pyroclastic flows extending from nested calderas robledo caldera is heavily eroded and has assumed a semicircular shape rim of cerro blanco caldera proper is well preserved with ash and block flows filling interior another theory holds that northern cerro blanco and southern robledo calderas are part of one caldera with a minimum subsidence of and a dimension of cerro blanco caldera is wide on its southern rim surrounded by ashfall deposits lies holocene cerro blanco del robledo lava dome some sources call whole volcano robledo and use cerro blanco to refer to lava dome a third caldera north of cerro blanco is known as el nino caldera whole volcanic complex is formed from lava domes ignimbrites ash and block flows and unconsolidated deposits cerro blanco is largest lava dome and has a debris collapse deposit on its northern side a hydrothermally altered area in middle of caldera has been linked to phreatomagmatic activity el escondido crater northeast of caldera is wide and deep it shows a dark colour and shape in satellite images and has been interpreted as a phreatic crater other such craters are located within caldera aside from craters and calderas there are about seven lava domes west of caldera which are sources of block and ash flows and pyroclastic material some of these predate calderas others formed after caldera formation and in some relationship to calderas is not clear complex is located at southwest end of a volcano tectonic depression formed by local fault systems these fault systems channel magma during eruptions usually no eruption column is formed formation of depression may be influenced by emptying of magma chambers associated with volcano complex is located on thick crust aside from volcanic rocks crust at cerro blanco also includes metamorphic rocks of neoproterozoic to ordovician age a crustal low seismic velocity anomaly is located beneath cerro blanco called southern puna magma body petrology of lava domes has been studied they are rhyolites that define a calc alkaline suite and contain phenocrysts of biotite plagioclase quartz and sanidine fields thumbnail campo de piedra pomez megaripples mega ripple marks formed by gravel are also found in cerro blanco area and are among most extreme on earth these are formed from wind driven processes acting on local ignimbrites including saltation of fine grains and sand during wind ripples have amplitudes varying and wavelengths of coarse gravel is found at their top and more fine silt in their lower parts pumice blocks are found in lee surfaces of ripples with areas relatively flat unlike dunes these structures do not migrate once stably formed material these structures is formed from includes lithic clasts with densities and pumices with densities formation of ripples is associated with bedrock ridges these ripple marks have been compared to martian ripple fields largest field is named campo piedra pomez centered and covers a surface area of descending from at la hoyada in south to carachipampa volcano in north megaripples in this field are dark formed from older ignimbrites and lavas of 70 000 year old piedra pomez ignimbrite northwest of cerro blanco caldera and towards laguna purulla lies another field centered with a surface area of it has a dark colour from andesitic lava and falls down from altitude at la hoyada to at laguna purulla reddish brown rosada ignimbrites and white basement material are also components of this field other fields are campo purulla centered field downslope of cerro purulla with a distinct albedo from 13 000 years old purulla ignimbrite and salar de incahuasi centered field from piedra pomez ignimbrite of a brown colour climate puna climate in area is a high desert climate with high insolation and long term aridity desert environment of puna results in low levels of erosion plant growth is minor wind speeds of are regularly found and may play a role in formation of megaripples while there are no meteorological data for piedra pomez area a similar climate is found in salar del rincon where in 2014 temperatures were recorded recorded precipitation amounted to with evaporation rates of a weather station was run from march to november 2013 in salar de incahuasi at altitude winds recorded there are mostly northwestern and southwestern and have gusts of every month stronger average winds are found during spring eruptive history human research in san buenaventura area goes back to 1885 mineral focused research in 1895 and 1920 la hoyada formation was identified 1963 and reinterpreted as la hoyada volcanic complex in 2000 general geological research in region occurred 1988 2000 and 2006 and research focused on cerro blanco was done by et al 2005 and 2008 activity of cerro blanco goes back 8 mya when belt in west was active volcano is responsible for a large holocene eruption with a volcano explosivity index 7 largest in andean central volcanic zone for 5000 years it is comparable to santorini and tambora s large eruptions pre holocene aguada alumbrera ignimbrite is a white rosa ignimbrite composed from two units 7 14 mya and 13 57 mya blanquecina unit is of white to white rosa colour and contains amphibole biotite and quartz crystals it contains lithic fragments of dacitic composition groundmass of ignimbrite is grey in colour and contains glass and phenocrysts next to laguna aguada alumbrera it is thick ignimbrite is unconformably overlaid by ignimbrites from la hoyada volcano and overlies basement there are fluvial deposits contained within blanquecina ignimbrite suggesting that sedimentation occurred between eruptions other subunit is of white colour and is rich in biotite and quartz it is mostly buried by other deposits south of aguada alumbrera principal deposit is thick this ignimbrite crops out south of cerro blanco rosada ignimbrite is located next to cueros de purulla and has a rosa colour due to fiamme formed from welded pumice pumice contains biotite hornblende and quartz it also contains lithic fragments from basement and from vulcanites two dates of 6 3 and 7 3 mya have been obtained younger age is likely result from argon loss and less accurate it and aguada alumbrera ignimbrites are coeval but different compositions indicate that they derive from separate eruptions rosada ignimbrite s main minerals are biotite quartz plagioclase and sanidine it has a volume of a lava dome formed 7 3 0 5 mya and red ignimbrite 8 1 0 5 mya 2 3 1 3 mya an east northeast chain of andesitic lava domes was formed with youngest dome being 1 3 0 4 mya old and located next to cerro blanco 0 8 mya mafic andesite was erupted south and west of carachipampa and laguna de purulla cueros de purulla obsidian lava dome formed 0 4 0 1 mya barranca blanca and carachi ignimbrites are covered by lavas from volcan carachipampa and are thus older than 0 75 mya they contain pumices of various colours and lithic fragments including and schist barranca blanca ignimbrite is white in colour and contains rhyodacitic white pumice with subordinate amounts of grey trachyandesitic pumice carachi ignimbrite overlies barranca blanca ignimbrite it is weakly welded and contains white pumice and crystals with fiamme both of these are pyroclastic density currents that were still hot at time of deposition campo de la piedra pomez ignimbrites have a surface area of they have a volume of and are separated in two layers which form one cooling unit despite their different colour and mineral composition they both contain pumice and lithic fragments and are poor in crystals both have a pyroclastic texture with pumices bearing a porphyritic texture dating techniques yield different ages most reliable one argon argon dating on sanidine indicates that these ignimbrites were erupted 73 000 23 200 years ago other proposed dates go as far back as 0 555 0 11 mya they do not cross topographic surfaces and were generated by tranquil release from ground rather than through collapse of an eruption column surface has been exposed to wind erosion forming and ripple marks source of this eruption is unknown robledo caldera may be origin of this eruption but this is controversial ignimbrites of piedra pomez are covered with a desert varnish similar coating some bearing signs of endolithic lifeforms holocene 2 300 160 bce a large plinian eruption occurred at cerro blanco rhyolites with a volume of generated ashfalls and ignimbrites forming largest known eruption in central andes during holocene and one of largest in world during holocene ash from this eruption covered an area of or over these purulla el medano ignimbrites cover an area of with a volume of volcanic material and are dated to have occurred less than 12 200 years ago on basis of radiocarbon analysis of organic material contained between various ignimbrite layers one layer in la hoyada is dated between 8 830 and 5 480 bp other data attribute purulla ignimbrites to 22 000 years ago date of major holocene eruption is constrained to between 5 500 and 4 000 years ago based on stratigraphic relationships cerro blanco caldera formed during this eruption location of vent did not change during course of eruption indicating that annular fractures around caldera were possibly uninvolved in process ash falls occurred at distances of over and valleys were filled by pyroclastic flows as far as from vent low population density in fiambala valley south of volcano during 10 000 3 000 b p interval is ascribed to this eruption which affected valley with ignimbrites and pyroclastic fallout climate in entire southern hemisphere may have been affected ignimbrites from caldera forming eruption have a volume of and cover a surface area of south north and east of caldera they are partly welded and contain fiamme and lithic fragments material is vitreous and may have been fluid at time of deposition breccia derived from column collapse are also found deposits are with much glass a few kilometres from calderas they abruptly turn into medium sized pumice deposits some ignimbrites from this stage are derived from lava domes placed within small depressions largest of which is wide aeolian erosion has reworked ashes generated by eruption generating dunes which occur as far south as bolson de fiambala cerro blanco eruption pyroclastics are a major source of dust in northwestern argentina in 2015 an episode of strong wind blew enough volcanic dust into air that resulting dust cloud was mistaken for a renewed volcanic eruption of ojos del salado volcano a major volcanic edifice in region purulla el medano ignimbrites have a lower layer that various methods have dated 20 000 to 5 000 years ago this stage was effusive and accompanied by emplacement of lava domes a stage is represented by lava domes on southeast edge of caldera as well as block and ash flows inside caldera these are rhyolitic in composition their age is unknown but postdates caldera formation recent unrest and threats there are no reports of historical activity a small geothermal field is associated with volcanic complex consisting of fumaroles mud volcanoes and thermal anomalies and activity has left clay and sinter deposits vegetation is concentrated around vapour leaks in caldera temperatures in fumaroles amount to and whole system appears to belong to a high temperature geothermal field that appears to extend southwest of volcano where additional geothermal features are found cerro blanco has been prospected for possibility of obtaining geothermal power at volcano caldera floor has been subsiding in 1990s according to satellite images diameter of deformation region is less than and deformation occurs at depths of less than deflation speed has been decreasing from more than between 1992 and 1997 over between 1996 and 2000 and between 2003 and 2007 to between 2005 and 2010 this deformation is centered between robledo and cerro blanco calderas and is accompanied by an uplift to northwest deflation has been interpreted to depend on a magma chamber with a diameter of but is unlikely to be caused by magma withdrawal or tectonic expansion it may be linked to hydrothermal effects however a seismic swarm was noted at depth in 2007 and 2009 evidence indicates that such calderas can fill in within a timespan of hundreds to thousands of years two possible scenarios of an eruption are formation of plinian eruption columns or more tranquil subhorizontal eruption of pyroclastic flows from vents given low population density of 0 06 people per impact of eruption on local population will be small westerly winds may cause larger impact west of centre with air travel particularly affected community of bolson de fiambala south of caldera is beneath level of cerro blanco and connected to it by valleys in a future eruption pyroclastic currents and less dense clouds associated with them from cerro blanco might reach community see also altiplano puna volcanic complex notes references external links category vei 7 volcanoes category volcanoes of catamarca province category pleistocene volcanoes
