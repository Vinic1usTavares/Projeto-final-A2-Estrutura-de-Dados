iarc began in 1991 on campus of georgia institute of technology and is longest running university based robotics competition in world since 1991 collegiate teams with backing of industry and government have fielded autonomous flying robots in an attempt to perform missions requiring robotic behaviors never before exhibited by a flying machine in 1990 term aerial robotics was coined by competition creator robert michelson to describe a new class of small highly intelligent flying machines successive years of competition saw these aerial robots grow in their capabilities from vehicles that could at first barely maintain themselves in air to most recent automatons which are self stable self navigating and able to interact with their environment especially objects on ground primary goal of competition has been to provide a reason for state of art in aerial robotics to move forward challenges set before international collegiate community have been geared towards producing advances in state of art at an increasingly aggressive pace from 1991 through 2009 a total of six missions have been proposed each of them involved fully autonomous robotic behavior that was at time and impossible for any robotic system fielded anywhere in world even by most sophisticated military robots belonging to super powers in october 2013 a new seventh mission was proposed as with previous missions mission 7 involves totally autonomous flying robots but this is first iarc mission to involve interaction between multiple ground robots and even simultaneous competition between two aerial robots working against each other and against clock to influence behavior and trajectory of up to ten autonomous ground robots in 2016 international aerial robotics competition and its creator were officially recognized during georgia legislative session in form of senate resolution 1255 which recognized it as longest running aerial robotics competition in world and for having been responsible for moving forward state of art in aerial robotics on several occasions during past quarter century history first mission thumb right 200px third mission southern polytechnic state university helicopter based aerial robot flying near fire hazard initial mission to move a metallic disc from one side of an arena to another with a completely autonomous flying robot was seen by many as almost impossible college teams continued to improve their entries over next two years when competition saw its first autonomous takeoff flight and landing by a team from georgia institute of technology three years later in 1995 a team from stanford university was able to acquire a single disk and move it from one side of arena to other in a fully autonomous flight half a decade earlier than some pundits had predicted second mission competition mission was then toughened and made a bit less abstract by requiring teams to search for a toxic waste dump map location of partially buried randomly oriented toxic waste drums identify contents of each drum from hazard labels found somewhere on outside of each drum and bring a sample back from one of drums all without any human intervention whatsoever in 1996 a team from massachusetts institute of technology and boston university with backing from draper labs created a small fully autonomous flying robot that repeatedly and correctly mapped location of all five of toxic waste drums and correctly identified contents of two from air thereby completing approximately seventy five percent of mission following year an aerial robot developed by a team from carnegie mellon university completed entire mission third mission thumb right 200px third mission autonomous pneumatic animatron designed by prof michelson thumb right 200px tu berlin helicopter based aerial robot winner of third mission in 2000 third mission was begun in 1998 it was a search and rescue mission requiring fully autonomous robots to take off fly to a disaster area and search for survivors and dead amid raging fires broken water mains clouds of toxic gas and rubble from destroyed buildings scenario was recreated at u s department of energy s hazardous material management and emergency response hammer training facility where above hazards could be recreated because of realism of scenario were used instead of human actors to simulate survivors incapable of extracting themselves from disaster area an aerial robot from germany s technische universitat berlin was able to detect and avoid all of obstacles many of which could have destroyed robot itself identify all dead on ground and survivors distinguishing between two based on movement and relay pictures of survivors along with their locations back to first responders who would attempt a rescue this mission was completed in 2000 fourth mission fourth mission was initiated in 2001 this fully autonomous mission involved three scenarios requiring same autonomous behavior first scenario was a hostage rescue mission where a submarine 3 kilometers off coast of a third world nation must send in an aerial robot to find a coastal city identify embassy where hostages are being held locate valid openings in embassy building enter or send in a sensor probe subvehicle and relay pictures of hostages back 3 km to submarine prior to mounting an amphibious assault on embassy to free hostages second scenario revolved around discovery of an ancient mausoleum by archaeologists an ancient virus contained in mausoleum has quickly killed all archaeological team but prior to their death they radioed that a very important and undocumented tapestry is hanging inside local government is planning to cleanse area with a fuel air explosion in 15 minutes so scientists will send in an autonomous aerial robot to find mausoleum enter it or send in a sensor probe subvehicle and relay pictures of tapestry back prior to destruction of mausoleum and its contents third scenario involved an explosion at a nuclear reactor facility which shuts down two of three reactors everyone is killed in disaster and scientists must send in an aerial robot to find operating reactor building enter building or send in a sensor probe subvehicle and relay pictures of control panels to determine if a melt down is imminent scientists are forced to maintain a 3 kilometer stand off distance due to extreme radiation hazard all three missions involve same elements rapid ingress over a 3 km path location of a building complex location of a specific building within complex identification of valid openings in that building entry into building by aerial robot or a sensor carrying subvehicle relay of pictures from within back to launch point 3 km away mission completion within 15 minutes full autonomy throughout all aspects of mission this fourth iarc mission was conducted at u s army s fort benning soldier battle lab using mckenna mout military operations on urban terrain site which replicates a complete german village created for war gaming when main cold war threat was perceived to come through fulda gap into germany fourth mission was completed in 2008 with various teams having already demonstrated all of required aerial robotic behaviors mandated by fourth mission rules except being able to demonstrate these behaviors seamlessly in under 15 minutes a feat considered by organizer and judges to be inevitable given a bit more time and therefore no longer a significant challenge thus fourth mission was terminated 80 000 in awards distributed and fifth mission established a virtual representation of mckenna mout site was developed by army research laboratory in 2002 for soldier training and experimentation fifth mission thumb right 200px fourth fifth mission nuclear reactor complex explosion scenario fifth mission picked up where fourth mission left off by demonstrating fully autonomous aerial robotic behaviors necessary to rapidly negotiate confined internal spaces of a structure once it has been penetrated by an air vehicle nuclear reactor complex explosion scenario of fourth mission was used as backdrop for fifth mission fifth mission required a fully autonomous aerial vehicle presupposed to have been launched from a mothership just outside structure as demonstrated during fourth mission to penetrate structure and negotiate more complex interior space containing hallways small rooms obstacles and dead ends in order to search for a designated target without aid of global positioning navigational aids and relay pictures back to a monitoring station some distance from structure first symposium on indoor flight issues was held in conjunction with this 2009 iarc event sixth mission sixth mission began in 2010 as an extension of fifth mission theme of autonomous indoor flight behavior however sixth mission demanded more advanced behaviors than were currently possible by any aerial robot extant in 2010 this espionage mission involved covertly stealing a flash drive from a particular room in a building for which there was no a priori knowledge of floor plan and depositing an identical drive to avoid detection of theft 2010 symposium on indoor flight issues was held concurrently at university of puerto rico mayaguez during 20th anniversary competition official rules for 6th mission are available at competition web site seventh mission thumb right 200px university of michigan mission 7a aerial robot at 2014 american venue seventh mission began in 2014 demanding more advanced behaviors than were currently possible by any aerial robot extant in 2014 mission involves autonomous aerial robots controlling autonomous ground robots mission is divided into mission 7a and 7b mission 7a requires a single autonomous aerial robot to herd as many of 10 autonomous ground robot targets as possible across green boundary line in under 10 minutes arena is 20m x 20m 65 62 feet x 65 62 feet and has a green boundary line at one end a red boundary line at opposite end and white sidelines pattern on floor of arena is unknown to aerial robot designers a priori however it is known that there is a 1m x 1m 3 28 feet x 3 28 feet white square grid pattern overlaid upon arena other than what is seen on arena floor there are neither walls for slam mapping nor gps availability techniques such as optical flow or optical are possible solutions to navigation within arena in addition to 10 ground robot targets there are 4 tall robot obstacles as much as 2m 6 56 feet in height which circulate within arena collisions with obstacle ground robots ends run with no score non obstacle ground robot targets automatically reverse direction every 20 seconds and have up to 20deg of noise applied to their trajectories at 5 second intervals if an aerial robot touches ground robot on top with a magnet ground robot will turn clockwise 45deg if aerial robot blocks its forward motion by landing in front of it ground robot targets will reverse direction ground robot targets that feely escape arena count against aerial robot s team score autonomous aerial robots must decide which ground robots are in imminent danger of crossing any boundary but green one and redirect them toward green boundary five of 10 ground robot targets are green and 5 are red mission 7b pits best teams from 7a against each other one on one to get as many of its own green ground robots across green boundary while misdirecting opponent s red ground robots similarly opponent is trying to get as many of its red ground robots across red boundary while misdirecting opponent s green ground robots official rules for current 7th mission are available at competition web site in addition a video derived from august 2014 events held at american venue georgia institute of technology s mcamish pavilion and asia pacific venue yantai china explains details of mission 7 graphically on 28 september 2018 overall winner of mission 7 was announced as zhejiang university details can be found at official iarc website along with a video of winning flight by zhejiang university and in beihang university press release in all 52 teams from 12 nations were entered as competitors for mission 7 eighth mission thumb right 200px iarc mission 8 scenario in 2018 27th year of international aerial robotics competition 8th mission was announced official rules for 8th mission are available at competition web site along with a video summarizing 8th mission mission 8 focuses on non electronic human machine interaction for first time with four aerial robots assisting humans to complete tasks that one person cannot independently accomplish gist of mission 8 involves a swarm of autonomous aerial robots working with a human to achieve a task in presence of hostile sentry aerial robots which are autonomously trying to impede human sentry robots carry lasers similar to those used in laser tag which will disable human and end run after a specified number of hits task is structured so that it can not be achieved by human without assistance of swarm of aerial helpers that are directed only by human s gestures and voice commands in 2018 inaugural year of mission 8 american venue was held on campus of georgia institute of technology in atlanta georgia and asia pacific venue was conducted at beihang university in beijing china participants collegiate teams participating in iarc have come primarily from united states and people s republic of china but also from germany england switzerland spain canada chile qatar iran and india teams range in size from several students up to twenty or more both undergraduate and graduate students populate teams but some teams have been composed entirely of undergraduates or postgraduates industry is not permitted to enter but it may assist student teams with funding and equipment aerial robots thumb right 200px unconventional aerial robotic flying machine from university of british columbia aerial robots vary in design from fixed wing airplanes to conventional helicopters to ducted fans to airships and beyond to bizarre hybrid creations because competition focuses on fully autonomous behavior air vehicle itself is of less importance teams choosing to develop new air vehicle types have never won as they are disadvantaged in comparison to those which adapt existing working air vehicles and can therefore concentrate on performing mission rather than developing something that will fly at all as a result adaptations of conventional rotary wing and fixed wing entries have always been overall winners with airships and ducted fans a close second aerial robots must be unmanned and autonomous and must compete based on their ability to sense semi structured environment of competition arena they may be intelligent or preprogrammed but they must not be controlled by a remote human operator computational power need not be carried on air vehicle itself computers operating from standard commercial power may be set up outside competition arena boundary and uni or bi directional data may be transmitted to from vehicles in arena size or weight constraints are normally placed on aerial robots which must be equipped with a method of manually activated remote override of primary propulsion system venues international aerial robotics competition was first held on campus of georgia institute of technology first mission 1991 1995 walt disney world s epcot center asked that competition move to its location for second mission where it was held at entrance to park during 1996 and 1997 u s department of energy s hazardous material management and emergency response hammer training facility then brought iarc to richland wa from 1998 to 2000 for conduct of third mission fourth mission began in 2001 at u s navy s webster field in maryland but was moved to canada olympic village calgary canada following year because webster field was unsuitable weather difficulty in airspace management and extreme electromagnetic interference drove iarc to an ideal venue where these issues could be managed u s army s fort benning soldier battle lab mckenna mout site for fourth mission scenarios existence of uninhabited mckenna village provides perfect venue due to nature of challenge fifth mission took place in an indoor location at university of puerto rico at mayaguez sixth mission was initiated in coliseum on campus of university of puerto rico at mayaguez during august 2010 however sixth mission was moved to grand forks north dakota beginning in 2011 a second venue was established in beijing china beginning in 2012 this asia pacific venue serves asian and australian continents while american venue serves american european and african continents teams are free to enter competition at either venue beginning in august 2012 two venues conducted sixth mission under same set of rules seventh mission was begun at mcamish pavilion on campus of georgia institute of technology american venue and in yantai shandong province china asia pacific venue during august 2014 8th mission american venue is being held on campus of georgia institute of technology in atlanta georgia and asia pacific venue is being conducted at beihang university in beijing china beginning in august of 2018 thumb right 200px fourth mission mckenna mout site with specific buildings designated prizes iarc prizes have traditionally been winner take all although during competition s early years monetary progress awards were given to further development of best performers with fourth mission it was realized that there would be no quick winners and that several years of development would be required by each of teams therefore an incremental growing prize pot was established to which association for unmanned vehicle systems international foundation adds another us 10 000 each year 2008 prize level was set at a total of 80 000 any team completing fourth mission in under 15 minutes would receive entire 80 000 prize otherwise prize would be distributed based on 2008 competitor performance most closely approaching 15 minute mission goal by 2008 levels 1 through 3 of fourth mission had been demonstrated proving that all required aerial robotic behaviors were possible but by end of 2008 event no single team was able to sequentially and seamlessly demonstrate all behaviors in under 15 minutes 80 000 was therefore divided between ten finalists georgia institute of technology received 27 700 virginia polytechnic institute state university 17 700 and embry riddle devry calgary 12 200 with remainder shared between other finalists based on merit 10 000 was awarded to a team from massachusetts institute of technology in 2009 which in addition to receiving auvsi sponsored prize award also received their 1 000 application fee back under incentive program outlined in official iarc rules for 2009 which stated that any team completing fifth mission during first year of mission would receive a full rebate of their application fee in august 2013 a team from tsinghua university completed entire sixth mission thereby winning 40 000 thumb right 200px fourth mission 27 700 prize recipient gtmax aerial robot carrying sub vehicle deployment boom inset and gtmax approaching mckenna mout site with 90

money for logistics and a grand prize that was backed by association after initial success and tremendous media attention garnered by iarc auvsi launched intelligent ground vehicle competition a few years later in detroit mi this was organized by auvsi board member jerry lane who worked at u s army tank automotive command at time in 1998 underwater community was represented when auvsi and u s office of naval research teamed up to offer first international autonomous underwater vehicle competition which is held annually in u s all of these competitions land sea and air have at their core
