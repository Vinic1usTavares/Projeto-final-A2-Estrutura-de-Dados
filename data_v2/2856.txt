in 1842 as charles darwin s first monograph and set out his theory of formation of coral reefs and atolls he conceived of idea during voyage of beagle while still in south america before he had seen a coral island and wrote it out as hms beagle crossed pacific ocean completing his draft by november 1835 at time there was great scientific interest in way that coral reefs formed and captain robert fitzroy s orders from admiralty included investigation of an atoll as an important scientific aim of voyage fitzroy chose to survey keeling islands in indian ocean results supported darwin s theory that various types of coral reefs and atolls could be explained by uplift and subsidence of vast areas of earth s crust under oceans book was first volume of three darwin wrote about geology he had investigated during voyage and was widely recognised as a major scientific work that presented his deductions from all available observations on this large subject in 1853 darwin was awarded royal society s royal medal for monograph and for his work on barnacles darwin s theory that coral reefs formed as islands and surrounding areas of crust subsided has been supported by modern investigations

atolls was a scientific puzzle advance notice of her sailing given in athenaeum of 24 december described investigation of this topic as most interesting part of beagle s survey with prospect of many points for investigation of a scientific nature beyond mere occupation of surveyor in 1824 and 1825 french naturalists quoy and gaimard had observed that coral organisms lived at relatively shallow depths but islands appeared in deep oceans in books that were taken on beagle as references henry de la beche frederick william beechey and charles lyell had published opinion that coral had grown on underwater mountains or volcanoes with atolls taking shape of underlying volcanic craters admiralty instructions for voyage stated as a student at university of edinburgh in 1827 darwin learnt about marine invertebrates while assisting investigations of anatomist robert edmond grant and during his last year at university of cambridge in 1831 he had studied geology under adam sedgwick so when he was unexpectedly offered a place on beagle expedition as a gentleman naturalist he was well suited to fitzroy s aim of having a companion able to examine geology on land while ship s complement carried out its hydrographic survey fitzroy gave darwin first volume of lyell s principles of geology before they left on their first stop ashore at st jago island in january 1832 darwin saw geological formations which he explained using lyell s concept that forces still in operation made land slowly rise or fall over immense periods of time and thought that he could write his own book on geology lyell s first volume included a brief outline of idea that atolls were based on volcanic craters and second volume which was sent to darwin during voyage gave more detail darwin received it in november 1832 while beagle surveyed coasts of south america from february 1832 to september 1835 darwin made several trips inland and found extensive evidence that continent was gradually rising after witnessing an erupting volcano from ship he experienced 1835 concepcion earthquake in following months he speculated that as land was uplifted large areas of ocean bed subsided it struck him that this could explain formation of atolls darwin s theory followed from his understanding that coral polyps thrive in clean seas of tropics where water is agitated but can only live within a limited depth of water starting just below low tide where level of underlying land stays same corals grow around coast to form what he called fringing reefs and can eventually grow out from shore to become a barrier reef where land is rising fringing reefs can grow around coast but coral raised above sea level dies and becomes white limestone if land subsides slowly fringing reefs keep pace by growing upwards on a base of dead coral and form a barrier reef enclosing a lagoon between reef and land a barrier reef can encircle an island and once island sinks below sea level a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues to keep up with sea level forming a central lagoon should land subside too quickly or sea level rise too fast coral dies as it is below its habitable depth darwin s investigations to test his theory thumb right alt hills sloping down to a lagoon with boats at anchor lagoon is sheltered by a wide shallow coral reef from breaking waves of ocean darwin saw coral reef and lagoon around tahiti by time that beagle set out for galapagos islands on 7 september 1835 darwin had thought out essentials of his theory of atoll formation while he no longer favoured concept that atolls formed on submerged volcanos he noted some points on these islands which supported that idea 16 volcanic craters resembled atolls in being raised slightly more on one side and five hills appeared roughly equal in height he then considered a topic which was compatible with either theory lack of coral reefs around galapagos islands one possibility was a lack of calcareous matter around islands but his main proposal which fitzroy had suggested to him was that seas were too cold as they sailed on darwin took note of records of sea temperature kept in ship s weather journal he had his first glimpse of coral atolls as they passed honden island on 9 november and sailed on through low or dangerous archipelago tuamotus arriving at tahiti on 15 november darwin saw it encircled by a coral reef separated from shore by channels basins of still water he climbed hills of tahiti and was strongly impressed by sight across to island of where mountains abruptly rise out of a glassy lake which is separated on all sides by a narrow defined line of breakers from open sea remove central group of mountains there remains a lagoon isd rather than recording his findings about coral reefs in his notes about island he wrote them up as first full draft of his theory an essay titled coral islands dated 1835 they left tahiti on 3 december and darwin probably wrote his essay as they sailed towards new zealand where they arrived on 21 december he described polyp species building coral on barrier wall flourishing in heavy surf of breaking waves particularly on windward side and speculated on reasons that corals in calm lagoon did not grow so high he concluded with a remark that general horizontal uplifting which i have proved has is now raising upwards greater part of s america as it would appear likewise of n america would of necessity be compensated by an equal subsidence in some other part of world keeling islands thumb alt a map of a roughly circular atoll with two large openings to north

investigate how coral reefs formed particularly if they rose from bottom of sea or from summits of extinct volcanoes and to assess effects of tides by measurement with specially constructed gauges fitzroy chose keeling islands in indian ocean and on arrival there on 1 april 1836 entire crew set to work first erecting fitzroy s new design of a tide gauge that allowed readings to be taken from shore boats were sent all around island to carry out survey and despite being impeded by strong winds they took numerous soundings to establish depths around atoll and in lagoon fitzroy noted smooth and solid rock like outer wall of atoll with most life thriving where surf was most violent he had great difficulty in establishing depth reached by living coral as pieces were hard to break off and small anchors hooks grappling irons and chains they used were all snapped off by swell as soon as they tried to pull them up he had more success using a sounding line with a bell shaped lead weight armed with tallow hardened with lime this would be indented by any shape that it struck to give an exact impression of bottom it would also collect any fragments of coral or grains of sand these soundings were taken personally by fitzroy and tallow from each sounding was cut off and taken on board to be examined by darwin impressions taken on steep outside slope of reef were marked with shapes of living corals and otherwise were clean down to about 10 fathoms 18 m then at increasing depths tallow showed fewer such impressions and collected more grains of sand until it was evident that there were no living corals below about 20 30 fathoms 36 55 m darwin carefully noted location of different types of coral around reef and in lagoon in his diary he described examining very interesting yet simple structure origin of these islands water being unusually smooth i waded in as far as living mounds of coral on which swell of open sea breaks in some of gullies hollows there were beautiful green other colored fishes forms tints of many of were admirable it is excusable to grow enthusiastic over infinite numbers of organic beings with which sea of tropics so prodigal of life teems though he cautioned against rather exuberant language used by some naturalists as they left islands after eleven days darwin wrote out a summary of his theory in his diary publication of theory when beagle returned on 2 october 1836 darwin was already a celebrity in scientific circles as in december 1835 university of cambridge professor of botany john stevens henslow had fostered his former pupil s reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of darwin s geological letters charles lyell eagerly met darwin for first time on 29 october enthusiastic about support this gave to his uniformitarianism and in may wrote to john herschel that he was very full of darwin s new theory of coral islands and have urged whewell to make him read it at our next meeting i must give up my volcanic crater theory for ever though it cost me a pang at first for it accounted for so much whole theory is knocked on head and annular shape and central lagoon have nothing to do with volcanoes nor even with a crateriform bottom coral islands are last efforts of drowning continents to lift their heads above water regions of elevation and subsidence in ocean may be traced by state of coral reefs darwin presented his findings and theory in a paper which he read to geological society of london on 31 may 1837 darwin s first literary project was his journal and remarks on natural history of expedition now known as voyage of beagle in it he expanded his diary notes into a section on this theory emphasising how presence or absence of coral reefs and atolls can show whether ocean bed is elevating or subsiding at same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species and taking on other projects he finished writing out his journal around end of september but then had work of correcting proofs his tasks included finding experts to examine and report on his collections from voyage darwin proposed to edit these reports writing his own forewords and notes and used his contacts to lobby for government sponsorship of publication of these findings as a large book when a treasury grant of ps1 000 was allocated at end of august 1837 darwin stretched project to include geology book that he had conceived in april 1832 at first landfall in voyage he selected smith elder co as publisher and gave them unrealistic commitments on timing of providing text and illustrations he assured treasury that work would be good value as publisher would only require a small commission profit and he himself would have no profit from october he planned what became multi volume zoology of voyage of h m s beagle on his collections and began writing about geology of volcanic islands in january 1838 smith elder co advertised first part of darwin s geology book geological observations on volcanic islands and coral formations as a single octavo volume to be published that year by end of month darwin thought that his geology was covering so much paper will take so much time that it could be split into separate volumes eventually coral reefs was published first followed by volcanic islands in 1844 and south america in 1846 he also doubted that treasury funds could cover all geological writings first part of zoology was published in february 1838 but darwin found it a struggle to get experts to produce their reports on his collections and overwork led to illness after a break to visit scotland he wrote up a major paper on geological roads of glen roy on 5 october 1838 he noted in his diary began coral paper requires much reading in november 1838 darwin proposed to his cousin emma and they married in january 1839 as well as his other projects he continued to work on his ideas of evolution as his prime hobby but repeated delays were caused by his illness he sporadically restarted work on coral reefs and on 9 may 1842 wrote to emma telling her he was publication and subsequent structure and distribution of coral reefs was published in may 1842 priced at 15 shillings and was well received a second edition was published in 1874 extensively revised and rewritten to take into account james dwight dana s 1872 publication corals and coral islands and work by joseph jukes thumb 800px center structure of book book has a tightly logical structure and presents a bold argument illustrations are used as an integral part of argument with numerous detailed charts and one large world map marked in colour showing all reefs known at that time a brief introduction sets out aims of book thumb alt underwater view of fish swimming around diverse corals first chapters of book describe kinds of corals forming each part of various types of reef first three chapters describe various types of coral reef each chapter starting with a section giving a detailed description of reef darwin had most information about which he presents as a typical example of type subsequent sections in each chapter then describe other reefs in comparison with typical example in first chapter darwin describes atolls and lagoon islands taking as his typical example his own detailed findings and beagle survey findings on keeling islands second chapter similarly describes a typical barrier reef then compares it to others and third chapter gives a similar description of what darwin called fringing or shore reefs having described principal kinds of reef in detail his finding was that actual surface of reef did not differ much an atoll differs from an encircling barrier reef only in lacking central island and a barrier reef differs from a fringing reef only in its distance from land and in enclosing a lagoon fourth chapter on distribution and growth of coral reefs examines conditions in which they flourish their rate of growth and depths at which reef building polyps can live showing that they can only flourish at a very limited depth in fifth chapter he sets out his theory as a unified explanation for findings of previous chapters overcoming difficulties of treating various kinds of reef as separate and problem of reliance on improbable assumption that underwater mountains just happened to be at exact depth below sea level by showing how barrier reefs and then atolls form as land subsides and fringing reefs are found along with evidence that land is being elevated this chapter ends with a summary of his theory illustrated with two woodcuts each showing two different stages of reef formation in relation to sea level in sixth chapter he examines geographical distribution of types of reef and its geological implications using large coloured map of world to show vast areas of atolls and barrier reefs where ocean bed was subsiding with no active volcanos and vast areas with fringing reefs and volcanic outbursts where land was rising this chapter ends with a recapitulation which summarises findings of each chapter and concludes by describing global image as a magnificent and harmonious picture of movements which crust of earth has within a late period undergone a large appendix gives a detailed and exhaustive description of all information he had been able to obtain on reefs of world this logical structure can be seen as a prototype for organisation of on origin of species presenting detail of various aspects of problem then setting out a theory explaining phenomena followed by a demonstration of wider explanatory power of theory unlike origin which was hurriedly put together as an abstract of his planned big book coral reefs is fully supported by citations and material gathered together in appendix coral reefs is arguably first volume of darwin s huge treatise on his philosophy of nature like his succeeding works showing how slow gradual change can account for history of life in presenting types of reef as an evolutionary series it demonstrated a rigorous methodology for historical sciences interpreting patterns visible in present as results of history in one passage he presents a particularly malthusian view of a struggle for survival in an old standing reef corals which are so different in kind on different parts of it are probably all adapted to stations they occupy and hold their places like other organic beings by a struggle one with another and with external nature hence we may infer that their growth would generally be slow except under peculiarly favourable circumstances reception having successfully completed and published other books on geology and zoology of voyage darwin spent eight years on a major study of barnacles two volumes on lepadidae goose barnacles were published in 1851 while he was still working on two volumes on remaining barnacles darwin learnt to his delight in 1853 that royal society had awarded him royal medal for natural science joseph dalton hooker wrote telling him that proposed you for coral islands lepadidae bell followed seconding on lepadidae alone then followed such a shout of paeans for barnacles that you would have smiled to hear late 19th century controversy and tests of theory a major scientific controversy over origin of coral reefs took place in late 19th century between supporters of darwin s theory such as american geologist james dwight dana who early in his career had seen coral reefs in hawaii and fiji during 1838 42 united states exploring expedition and those who supported a rival theory put forward by scottish oceanographer john murray who participated in 1872 76 challenger expedition murray s theory challenged darwin s notion of subsidence proposing instead that coral reefs formed when accumulating mounds of calcareous marine sediments reached shallow depths that could support growth of corals amongst murray s supporters was independently wealthy american scientist alexander agassiz who financed and undertook several expeditions to caribbean pacific and indian ocean regions to examine coral reefs in search of evidence to support murray s theory and to discredit darwin dobbs d 2005 reef madness charles darwin alexander agassiz and meaning of coral pantheon books new york a series of expeditions to test darwin s theory by drilling on funafuti atoll in ellice

exploratory drilling through of coral to underlying basalt finally vindicated darwin s theory however geologic history of atolls is more complex than darwin 1842 and davis 1920 1928 envisioned darwin s findings and later views darwin s interest on biology of reef organisms was focussed on aspects related to his geological idea of subsidence in particular he was looking for confirmation that reef building organisms could only live at shallow depths fitzroy s soundings at keeling islands gave a depth limit for live coral of about 20 fathoms 37 m and taking into account numerous observations by others darwin worked with a probable limit of 30 fathoms 55 m later findings suggest a limit of around 100 m still a small fraction of depth of ocean floor at 3000 5000 m darwin recognised importance of red algae and he reviewed other organisms that could have helped to build reefs he thought they lived at similarly shallow depths but banks formed at greater depths were found in 1880s darwin reviewed distribution of different species of coral across a reef he thought that seaward reefs most exposed to wind and waves were formed by massive corals and red algae this would be most active area of reef growth and so would cause a tendency for reefs to grow outwards once they reach sea level he believed that higher temperatures and calmer water of lagoons favoured greatest coral diversity these ecological ideas are still current and research on details continues thumb left alt a large bright blue fish with its scales and tailfin outlined in red swimming above intricate corals darwin s investigations showed how coral eating organisms such as parrotfish controlled growth of coral and formed in assessing geology of reef darwin showed his remarkable ability to collect facts and find patterns to reconstruct geological history on basis of very limited evidence available he gave attention to smallest detail having heard that parrotfish browsed on living coral he dissected specimens to find finely ground coral in their intestines he concluded that such fish and coral eating invertebrates such as could account for banks of fine grained mud he found at keeling islands it showed also that there are living checks to growth of coral reefs and that almost universal law of consume and be consumed holds good even with forming those massive bulwarks which are able to withstand force of open ocean his observations on part played by organisms in formation of various features of reefs anticipated later studies to establish thickness of coral barrier reefs he relied on old nautical rule of thumb to project slope of land to that below sea level and then applied his idea that coral reef would slope much more steeply than underlying land he was fortunate to guess that maximum depth of coral would be around 5 000 ft 1 500 m as first test bores conducted by united states atomic energy commission on enewetak atoll in 1952 drilled down through ft 1 405 m of coral before reaching volcanic foundations in darwin s time no comparable thickness of fossil coral had been found on continents and when this was raised as a criticism of his theory neither he nor lyell could find a satisfactory explanation it is now thought that fossil reefs are usually broken up by tectonic movements but at least two continental fossil reef complexes have been discovered to be about 3 000 ft 1 000 m thick while these findings have confirmed his argument that islands were subsiding his other attempts to show evidence of subsidence have been superseded by discovery that glacial effects can cause changes in sea level in darwin s global hypothesis vast areas where seabed was being elevated were marked by fringing reefs sometimes around active volcanoes and similarly huge areas where ocean floor was subsiding were indicated by barrier reefs or atolls based on inactive volcanoes these views received general support from deep sea drilling results in 1980s his idea that rising land would be balanced by subsidence in ocean areas has been superseded by plate tectonics which he did not anticipate see also formation of coral reefs darwin s paradox list of reefs
