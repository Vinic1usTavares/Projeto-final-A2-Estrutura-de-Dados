this feature was retained or ignored as plot demands in last of time lords 2007 master s laser screwdriver is isomorphic production writing writer steven moffat who was also head writer and executive producer of series wanted to make special really because previous christmas special end of time had been darker than usual as it led to tenth doctor s david tennant regeneration he stated that he had never been so excited about writing anything i was laughing madly as i typed along to christmas songs in april moffat stated that a christmas carol was probably his favourite christmas story and that it lent itself to doctor who as there was an aspect similar to time travel in story he also pointed out that doctor intentionally based his reform of kazran on charles dickens story dickens exists as a character in doctor who universe having appeared in 2005 episode unquiet dead concept of sky shark was based on moffat s childhood fear of sharks which had evolved to swim outside water moffat noted that kazran was unlike other villains found in doctor who as he was not completely wicked instead he was more of a damaged character doctor recognises this when kazran demonstrates his inability to hit a little boy due to it reminding him of when his father beat him this allowed doctor to want to change his past and defrost his soul phrase halfway out of dark is used in episode a reference to fact that hard winter is almost over as well as a metaphor for kazran casting 200px thumb left welsh singer katherine jenkins makes her acting debut in episode starting with this episode arthur

gambon accepted role matt smith doctor karen gillan amy pond and darvill were very honoured to work with him moffat stated michael gambon is as distinguished an actor as i can imagine and fact that he was dumbledore means that he is already known to millions of children kazran was played as a boy by laurence belcher and as a young adult by danny horn director toby haynes said that acting came naturally to belcher and he captured story and drew audience in episode also features acting debut of welsh singer katherine jenkins shortly before her 30th birthday in june 2010 jenkins was asked about part and she accepted moffat was unaware that jenkins had no former acting experience jenkins originally was not interested in acting but thought that she would like to try doctor who as it was such an iconic show producer sanne wohlenberg believed that jenkins was a perfect fit for role though she was nervous jenkins found doctor who team encouraging and supportive and believed she would act again if right thing came along filming and effects thumb right controls in kazran s study on display at a doctor who exhibition a read through took place in cardiff on thursday 8 july and production started on 12 july 2010 and lasted into august 2010 episode marked debut of michael pickwood as new set designer pickwood and haynes worked together to create town incorporating elements that would be needed in a society that shared its daily life with fish nearly all windows in town are round reminiscent of submarines structures were made out of metal filmed at a local steel works kazran s study was designed to be very large as kazran spent several scenes in there alone and would feel dwarfed by it walls were intended to look like copper that had turned green which when combined with red drapes created christmas colours of red and green painting of kazran s father was created by taking a picture of gambon lightly printing it on a canvas and painting in details kazran s controls were inspired by a church organ doctor s first scene in episode is falling down chimney and presenting himself to kazran smith was pleased with entrance of his character noting similarities between doctor and santa claus however a stuntman performed scene for scene in which a sky fish nibbles on sonic screwdriver screwdriver was dangled in front of a greenscreen and tapped with a pen to create effect of fish nudging it to maintain secrecy of episode s plot model shark was given codename clive scenes in which characters ride through air in a sleigh pulled by one of flying sharks was filmed in front of a greenscreen sleigh was in fact a rickshaw which crew members rocked back and forth as a wind machine created effect of flying through air as it was impossible to film underneath rickshaw a miniature model of sleigh was used for shots underneath sleigh rather than computer generated effects music episode features a song specifically written for jenkins titled abigail s song in script it was written that song was unique and specific to doctor who and composer murray gold was contacted to write song jenkins did a demo and then sang song while filming actual scene as she thought it would look more natural afterwards she sang final version and a new lighter arrangement was composed by national orchestra of wales selected pieces of music from this special as composed by

martin of guardian described episode as a sumptuous triumph website den of geek s simon brew applauded moffat for not taking easy way out with adaptation saying it was really quite mad undoubtedly festive and it treats dickens source material with respect however he also wondered if young children would have enjoyed a christmas carol quite as much as adults keith phipps of a v club gave special an a naming it best doctor who christmas special he had seen he praised gambon smith both actors playing younger kazran and thought gillan and darvill made most of what they re given though he commented that katherine jenkins is more an ethereal presence with a lovely voice than an actress dave golder of sfx gave episode four and a half out of five stars explaining that although there were creaky moments it was most adult christmas special we ve yet been given with some complex story telling techniques a plot driven by characters and some quite mind bending concepts he praised jenkins debut and smith whom he described as a force of nature unleashed on screen ign s cindy white rated episode 8 out of 10 describing it as a clever remix of a christmas carol and praising smith gambon and jenkins brad trechak writing for tv squad praised moffat s expertly woven story mtv s rick marshall called it easily one of best episodes of series modern era populated with just right amount of humor drama scares and sentimental reverence for classic story that inspired its narrative sam mcpherson of zap2it said that he enjoyed a christmas carol more than i have almost any other special that has aired since series restarted in 2005 but thought that some parts were absolutely silly and others were absolutely incoherent due to frantic pace while he considered amy and rory criminally underused they were responsible for heavy laughs and left doctor to be delight of episode daily telegraph chris harvey was less enthusiastic about episode saying that it started nicely but that by time she was singing to shark i d had enough while thinking that it s not really for old like me who got more of a kick out of michael gambon s miserly kazran sardick when he was sneering and snarling at beginning of episode than when he had been thoroughly by end a christmas carol was nominated for 2011 hugo award for best dramatic presentation short form but lost to preceding series finale
