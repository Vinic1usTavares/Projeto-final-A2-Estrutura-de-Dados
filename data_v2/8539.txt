teenager he worked for his local constabulary as a clerk bored with civilian life braham joined raf on a five year short service commission in december 1937 he began basic training in march 1938 and then advanced training from august to december upon completion of flight training he was posted to no 29 squadron raf based at raf debden where he learned to fly hawker hurricane and bristol blenheim in 1939 squadron began to organise itself as a specialised night fighter unit by august 1940 battle of britain was underway he gained his first victory on 24 august which remained his only success in battle in september 1940 no 29 squadron was re equipped with bristol beaufighter braham continued operations during blitz claiming destruction of two more enemy aircraft by end of 1940 he had been awarded distinguished flying cross dfc braham continued to operate as an anti intruder pilot after blitz ended in may 1941 he became an ace in september 1941 having achieved five victories and was awarded a bar to his dfc in november 1941 in june 1942 he was promoted to squadron leader by october 1942 braham had claimed 12 enemy aircraft destroyed and he was awarded distinguished service order dso braham also flew missions with raf coastal command during this time and claimed a u boat damaged and an e boat destroyed he was then promoted to wing commander and given command of no 141 squadron raf braham undertook more intruder sorties into german occupied europe at this point and received a second bar to his dfc in june 1943 and by september 1943 had gained seven more victories including three possibly four german night fighter aces consequently he was awarded a bar to his dso squadron soon converted to de havilland mosquito and in february 1944 braham was transferred to operations staff at no 2 group raf but was permitted to fly one operation per week he achieved nine victories in mosquito and in june 1944 was awarded a second bar to his dso braham s war came to an end on 24 june 1944 when he was shot down by a pair of single engine german focke wulf fw 190 fighters braham was captured and spent rest of war as a prisoner he was liberated in may 1945 braham was most highly decorated airman in raf fighter command he claimed destruction of 29 enemy aircraft in addition he claimed a further six damaged and four probable victories one of these probable victories can be confirmed through german records making an unofficial total of 30 enemy aircraft destroyed nineteen were achieved at night he was most successful british pilot on twin engine aircraft 19 victories claimed at night rivalled john cats eyes cunningham s tally and was bettered only by night fighter pilot after war he was offered a permanent commission which he initially accepted having resigned his commission in march 1946 he re enlisted briefly after struggling to find a career that would support his family braham emigrated to canada with his family and enlisted in royal canadian air force rcaf in 1952 having held office at supreme headquarters allied powers europe braham retired from military life and began working as a civilian for department of indian affairs and northern development he continued to work there until his death from an undiagnosed brain tumor in 1974 aged 53 early life john braham was born on 6 april 1920 in holcombe somerset his father ernest goodall braham was a methodist minister who earned his qualifications at bristol and liverpool university reverend braham then became a doctor of theology after studying at king s college london in 1935 ernest had served as a pilot in royal flying corps rfc in first world war braham was educated at preparatory school at belmont from 1930 and then moved to public school in taunton in somerset he attended schools in southern england as brahams moved across country to london braham was powerfully built by age of 15 he was and weighed around and used his natural gifts to become a successful boxer at 15 years and eight months he passed his school certificate his further education at queen elizabeth s grammar school blackburn lancashire did not go well he was frequently absent owing to his father s ministerial appointments which forced family to continually relocate and consequently his concentration and grades declined he left grammar school at age of 16 after only a few months and did not return braham struggled to find work in era of great depression he considered moving abroad to join colonial police in british overseas territories and briefly entertained training as a sailor in merchant navy to gain experience he worked as a clerk in wigan for greater manchester police by 1937 tiring of life as an administrative clerk braham turned to british armed forces for a more fulfilling career raf training aged 17 braham applied for a short service commission in raf a course that lasted for five years commission was designed to find young aviation enthusiasts with right physical and academic qualities to become flying officers to braham s surprise his application was accepted his commission was dated 7 march 1937 his service number was commission enabled braham to enter at rank of pilot officer his training mainly consisted of an introduction to flying by civilian organisations contracted to do so by raf successful candidates advanced to military training in december 1937 he began flight training at no 7 elementary flying school efs at raf it was normal for pilots to undertake solo flights after eight to eleven hours dual instruction with their flight instructor for braham progress was slow and he made his first solo flight after 14 hours of dual instruction on 9 march 1938 braham flew solo for first time in a tiger moth braham 1961 p 35 in may 1938 braham began officer instruction at raf uxbridge after completion of this course he was moved to raf shawbury to begin training on military aircraft now assigned to no 11 efs he elected to become a fighter pilot and began training on hawker hart he completed his advanced flight training on 20 august 1938 and began final phase of training in hawker fury he completed his training in formation flying aerobatics and gunnery practice over next four months graduating in december 1938 his first squadron was no 29 squadron raf based at raf west malling flying two seater hawker demon in february 1939 no 29 squadron re equipped with bristol blenheim braham was disappointed at not being trained on hawker hurricane and his reaction to this news was request a transfer which was refused squadron spent three months converting onto blenheim in august 1939 no 29 did convert to hurricane but upon outbreak of war squadron was reverted to blenheim as part of its reorientation to night fighter rather than daylight fighter operations braham soon earned nickname bob which stayed with him throughout his service career he had chosen this christian name as his radio call sign to distinguish himself from multitude of other johns in unit braham 1961 p 41 second world war some raf squadrons were beginning to equip with airborne radar devices this was a pioneering technology known as airborne interception or ai it is unknown when if or how many of no 29 squadron s blenheim aircraft were fitted with them in 1940 as squadron continued to practice and struggle with adapting to night fighter tactics a great many pilots relied on basic non ai tactics which usually meant co operating with search lights and using aircrew s eyesight to seek out intruders by time braham and his squadron were called upon to defend britain from air attacks in august 1940 after collapse of netherlands belgium and france in may june 1940 british night fighter defences were very weak difficulties of night fighting was evident in performance of night fighter squadrons one fairey battle was shot down in error by a blenheim which could not correctly identify aircraft some other blenheims crashed after being caught in glare of search lights at low level and return fire from german bombers had inflicted at least one loss whilst 29 squadron succeeded on bring down only one german aircraft while identification friend or foe iff devices had been fitted to some british aircraft they were not always switched on braham also experienced technical malfunctions in blenheims which prompted him to call into question their reliability on one occasion hydraulic pipe fractured in blenheim he was flying which caused landing gear to fail and prompted braham to force land at this time he was joined by his gunner observer bill gregory with whom he was to fly frequently home defence by august 1940 battle of britain was intensifying most of battles thus far were in daylight leaving night fighter crews frustrated now based at raf digby in lincolnshire and operating from satellite airfield at unit formed part of no 12 group raf defending british air space north of london on night of 24 august 1940 braham took off and patrolled humberside area blenheim was piloted by braham and contained air gunner sergeant and aircraftman and trained radar operator n jacobson braham was directed to an aircraft held in searchlights but he closed too fast and overshot his gunner succeeded in damaging aircraft sufficiently and a searchlight crew saw it crash into sea it was identified as a heinkel he 111 braham s only other interaction with enemy occurred at ternhill when a junkers ju 88 dropped bombs on airfield destroying 13 avro ansons and damaged 20 more braham survived attack uninjured in september 1940 29 squadron began to convert to bristol beaufighter a rugged and heavily armed twin engine aircraft equipped with airborne interception radar in shape of ai mk iv radar sets just as luftwaffe began its campaign against british industrial cities known as blitz by 29 november squadron had become an all beaufighter unit braham was among first to fly beaufighter and did so in september he would however spend nearly entire month hospitalised after a serious car accident he flew his first wartime operation in a beaufighter on 17 november 1940 squadron leader guy gibson led mission braham flew nine operations in this month and enhanced his skills by completing a blind flying course which taught pilots to fly in low visibility conditions for his service he was awarded distinguished flying cross dfc on 17 january 1941 thumb right 200px beaufighter night fighter vif of no 255 squadron raf running up its engines c 1943 radar antennas are visible combination of these developments eventually culminated in success on 13 march 1941 braham achieved a surprise attack on a dornier do 17 knocking out one of its engines before cannons jammed his radar operator sergeant ross eventually three of guns braham s second burst blew bomber up at a range of 60 yards and beaufighter narrowly avoided colliding with debris engagement lasted 13 minutes two aircrew achieved another success on 9 may approaching from slightly below their target braham followed his radar operator s instructions until a visual sighting had been made identifying an aircraft through a patch of eclipsed stars he could then position himself to attack attacking two he 111s he downed one with two close range and short bursts of cannon fire victory was confirmed he 111 had crashed in neighbouring richmond london dead pilot s iron cross was sent to braham and a souvenir along with two luftwaffe lifejackets which he preferred to bulkier british design he wore lifejacket until he was shot down blitz ended as luftwaffe moved its forces to support operation barbarossa and invasion of soviet union in june 1941 and air raids slackened during second half of 1941 small numbers of german aircraft made pinpoint attacks across britain and german night fighters attempted intercept operations over england to disrupt raf bomber commands bombing of germany on 23 june braham claimed a probable against a he 111 which royal observer corps personnel saw crash but since he had lost contact with ground control having wandered out of no 29s area of operations and fearing being lost or pursuing he 111 too low into barrage balloons braham ended chase and claimed a probable records show only one claim was made that night by an raf fighter other than braham and german records list two bombers failing to return bill gregory became braham s regular radar operator on 6 july 1941 he gained another victory next day on 7 july 1941 with destruction of a ju 88 and became an ace on 12 september shooting down a he 111 for his fifth victory a do 17 was claimed on 19 october followed by another he 111 on 24 october by 25 november 1941 he had claimed 7 enemy aircraft and was awarded a bar to his dfc he was then promoted to flight lieutenant braham 1961 p 107 after having little leave in 1941 braham was rested to prevent exhaustion he was posted to no 51 otu operational training unit at raf cranfield on 28 january 1942 before he left for cranfield braham was involved in another car accident which removed him from duty he was injured when austin 7 in which he was travelling left road at speed he had been on a night out celebrating his success five passengers three officers and two girls were all hurt but one of women later died in hospital once recovered bob survived two scares on duty at cranfield on 13 march a beaufighter s engines cut out forcing him to make an emergency landing and on same day his second flight ended with aircraft s engines catching fire braham managed to conduct a safe landing during this time braham and gregory frequently visited 29 squadron at west malling by now germans were sending small scale formations to bomb selected targets in britain in what became known as baedeker blitz operating on night of 6 7 june 1942 in a borrowed beaufighter they destroyed a dornier 217 raiding canterbury and soon after braham was posted back to no 29 squadron from 51 otu on 24 july 1942 as acting squadron leader and flight commander of unit after damaging a ju 88 on 24 august he destroyed another on 28th using mark vii ai victory was witnessed by united states army air force personnel on a visit to a radar station near coast on 29 august he attacked and destroyed a ju 88 flying at 150 ft above english channel skilfully hugging waves ju 88 pilot succeeded in making violent evasive manoeuvres although german aircraft was damaged momentarily beaufighter passed over ju 88 and was hit by a volley of defensive fire that caused port engine to catch fire forcing a crash landing near beachy head neither he nor his operator on that flight harry jacobs were injured though a bullet was found to have passed through braham s seat missing him by inches he was awarded his dso on 9 october 1942 with his tally standing at 10 enemy aircraft destroyed braham 1961 p 125 after receiving award braham was out celebrating at a pub he attempted to drive home whilst intoxicated and crashed into a traffic island although drinking and driving was not a criminal offence police charged him with damaging public property and fined him ps5 equivalent of a weeks wages it was his third car crash his success did not abate a ju 88 and do 217 were claimed off english coast on nights of 26 and 31 october 1942 night intruder braham had destroyed 12 enemy aircraft with one probable and four damaged and was one of most successful raf night fighter pilots in recognition of his experience he was then given command of no 141 squadron raf at raf ford on 23 december 1942 as a 22 year old wing commander with him went his ai operator gregory now a flying officer with dfc and distinguished flying medal three weeks later on 20 january 1943 braham claimed a do 217 braham 1961 pp 133 136 no 141 squadron s beaufighter mk if s moved to cornwall in february 1943 to carry out night patrols over brittany and france and daylight patrols over bay of biscay and atlantic approaches to protect raf coastal command aircraft on 20 march 1943 he claimed a locomotive destroyed and soon afterwards was promoted to acting wing commander in april braham attacked a german e boat firing 500 rounds of 20mm cannon at target causing a large fire on other operations braham damaged three e boats while also strafing and damaging a u boat in may 1943 no 141 squadron moved to raf wittering it had been chosen to be first purpose built night fighter squadron to operate over germany and occupied europe in bomber support role beaufighters were equipped with new serrate radar detector which picked up radar impulses given out by german night fighter s lichtenstein radar a number of beaufighters were also equipped with mk iv radar but not more effective and recently introduced mark vii serrate operations started in june 1943 and were given greater impetus as battle of ruhr was intensifying and bomber command s losses to german night fighters increased braham had immediate success destroying a messerschmitt bf 110 over netherlands on 14 june and another nine days later a claim was also made for a damaged ju 88 after braham s guns had jammed in between these two successes braham was awarded a second bar to his dfc on 15 june 1943 throughout june 141 squadron claimed five enemy fighters destroyed and two damaged for loss of one beaufighter braham noted continuous operations were tiring gregory and he arranged for him to be rested as squadron operational planning officer his replacement was flight lieutenant harry jacko jacobs thumb left a messerschmitt bf 110 beaufighter s contemporary braham accounted for 6 of them in 1943 his most successful intruder operation took place on night of 17 18 august 1943 when he participated in 100 group s support of raf bomber command s operation hydra braham had decided that it was best to employ british night fighters in a freelance role instead of operating over known german airfields he elected to interpose beaufighters between outward bomber stream and german airfields in netherlands germany and belgium he hoped that echoes made by beaufighters on german lichtenstein radar would attract enemy aircraft and divert them from bombers braham flew in first wave as braham s wave reached leeuwarden in netherlands and while four of five raf fighters made no contact braham attracted two enemy night fighters messerschmitt bf 110s were from iv nachtjagdgeschwader 1 njg 1 1st night fighter wing five had taken off under command of heinz wolfgang schnaufer who finished war as most successful night fighter of all time with 121 air victories schnaufer led his flight out toward echo but turned back himself after engine trouble using his serrate radar detector braham and his radar operator picked up emissions made by german fighters lichtenstein radar he gained on and shot down feldwebel georg kraft an experten with 15 air victories from 4 njg 1 kraft was killed another bf 110 had witnessed action and attempted to engage braham but was outmanoeuvred and dispatched also its pilot feldwebel heinz vinke was only member of his crew to survive braham considered shooting at one crew member likely vinke who he had seen parachute out of aircraft but bill gregory persuaded him not to air pictorial 1991 volume 53 p 88 braham s beaufighter was nearly struck by debris from last victim braham had a habit of opening fire at very close range and resulting disintegration of messerschmitt hurled debris at closely following beaufighter one reason for firing at close range was braham s high state of fatigue in such a state braham could barely keep his eyes open whenever he peered ahead they smarted and misted braham was not satisfied with his current score rate and lack of action in september 1943 consequently he flew a number of missions against ground targets successful night fighter pilots were ordered not to engage in such activities that exposed them to excessive risk on one particular mission he decided to hunt enemy rail transport after failing to find enemy aircraft on dieppe to paris line he intercepted a locomotive which exploded after being hit he attacked another but struck some trees which damaged underside of fuselage braham maintained control and flew home it was not unusual for him to return with strange defections caused by collisions with objects after one sortie against shipping armourers were drenched in salt water and seaweed when they opened panel housing cannons with intention of replacing spent ammunition braham was awarded first bar to his dso on 24 september 1943 four nights later on 28 29 september whilst carrying out an intruder operation between celle and hanover braham encountered what he identified to be a do 217 which engaged him in a dogfight he downed enemy aircraft which hit ground and exploded he then gained another contact on an enemy aircraft but could not quite catch it then witnessed a crash or explosion nearby one source suggests victim of crash was german ace hans dieter frank 55 victories flying a heinkel he 219 who collided with another german fighter while trying to evade braham very next night he claimed a bf 110 his victim was identified as german ace august geiger of iv njg 1 53 victories geiger parachuted out of his fighter but drowned within minutes braham fired on a ju 88 which he claimed as damaged air pictorial 1991 volume 53 p 89 frank vinke and geiger were 17th 18th and 19th most successful night fighter aces of second world war and aerial warfare against his wishes braham was rested from operations and posted from no 141 squadron on 1 october 1943 to attend a staff officer course at camberley braham resisted move as much as he could he complained directly to air marshal roderick hill commanding fighter command at that time hill refused to countenance braham s request and denied his plea for one last operation within days braham was posted to no 9 group raf daylight intruder for three months braham remained inactive in february 1944 he was posted to no 2 group raf as wing commander night operations attached to 2nd light bomber group raf second tactical air force although a staff officer at hq braham was able with persistence to persuade his commanding officer air vice marshal basil embry to allow him to free lance intruder operations using a de havilland mosquito loaned from one of various squadrons in group on proviso he asked his permission beforehand braham also had his former radar operators transferred to group s headquarters so he could fly with them he frequently borrowed aircraft from no 613 squadron raf on 28 february 1944 he took off and claimed a german lorry destroyed south of paris in a daylight sortie mosquitoes did not carry radar but were fitted with gee navigational aids it allowed for accurate navigation but night sorties would not be fruitful since location of enemy aircraft would be exceptionally difficult for braham hunting in daylight was a strange experience on 5 march 1944 he flew with bill gregory on a 900 mile trip around northern france weather impeded his attempts to shoot up airfields at orleans and bourges so he proceeded to aerodrome at chateaudun he spotted a heinkel he 177 flying in landing circuit at 800 feet he closed rapidly and dispatched it for his 20th air victory braham was denied chance to operate as a night fighter pilot at this time when there was intense activity in january 1944 luftwaffe initiated operation steinbock a series of strikes against british cities in response to british offensive over germany german air arm met with severe losses during operation thumb right 300px mosquito fighter braham would have used these types in ranger operations on 12 march braham and gregory were returning from a 1000 mile trip and were hit by ground fire over bayeux they nursed mosquito back to england on one engine other having burned out just two days later he attended buckingham palace where he was awarded a second bar to his dfc from george vi both braham s wife joan and his father attended ten days later he received permission for another daylight sortie squadron leader robertson joined him on this occasion as his flight engineer he flew to to pick up a mosquito his target on this occasion would be denmark luftwaffe kept a number of operational units in region so he flew to coltishall in norfolk to be nearer his destination and conserve fuel during sortie near aalborg he sighted two aircraft so far away from battle zones germans did not expect to be attacked by enemy neither made much attempt to defend themselves first a junkers w 34 transport was shot down and second a junkers ju 52 tried a crash landing only to nose over and crumple wings braham strafed it to ensure destruction his gun cameras filmed action during which he fired 320 rounds on 4 april he returned to france lacking radar braham sought out large airfields to be sure of intercepting an enemy aircraft he flew to bordeaux looking for he 177s that intelligence suggested were operating against atlantic convoys from bordeaux braham only encountered a bucker bu 131 which fell victim after a brief burst of fire nine days later braham returned to denmark on this occasion a no 305 squadron raf mosquito was borrowed from polish on mission he encountered a he 111 near esjberg it was circling a lighthouse at 300 feet braham fired a three second fusillade of fire he 111 caught fire and nose dived into sea exploding on impact a focke wulf fw 58 trainer followed as his second victory on this mission meanwhile germans had tracked mosquito by radar two messerschmitt bf 109s appeared on scene soon afterwards cloud base was only at 1 000 feet and he effected his escape by hiding in its folds one of bf 109s fired some ineffectual bursts of fire at braham and he also encountered some light ground fire he few directly to group hq at benson he returned mosquito following day some days later braham returned to 305 to pick up a mosquito and joined no 107 squadron raf in a raid against paris even though he had no formal bomber pilot training nine days later near poitiers braham was engaged in a ground attack mission he spotted a focke wulf fw 190 carrying a drop tank and under wing rockets at low level he fired at 600 yards as enemy accelerated to escape his fire slowed fw 190 catching up with it fw 190 was hit again and crashed its wreckage strewn over three fields focke wulf was his 27th victory there was evidence that braham s judgement was becoming impaired he had not taken much leave since war began in 1939 and he admitted to becoming short tempered with his family and those around him he had spent much of previous two years leading from front and flying long and hazardous operations over enemy territory on 7 may 1944 he collected navigator flight lieutenant donald walsh from group headquarters he borrowed a mosquito from 21 squadron at gravesend he flew to norfolk to refuel and spent time with his old unit 141 squadron and spent night at west raynham over roskilde denmark he caught a ju 88 after a 10 minute chase and shot it down his 28th victory on 12 may braham repeated operation this time he took bill gregory with him operating over aalborg copenhagen line he spotted a fw 190 near giving chase braham found himself under attack by a bf 109 his presence clearly detected by german radar his mosquito was hit in port wing and fuel line were ruptured bf 109 then disappeared ignoring damage he closed on fw 190 at zero feet his mosquito bounced off a mound but he managed to hit enemy aircraft which burst into flames stalled and crashed near aalborg range was so close around 100 yards focke wulf nearly collided with braham loss of fuel from chase and damage coupled with his damaged propellers upon his collision with ground meant that chances of reaching england were slim he climbed to high altitude 70 miles from coast and broadcast an emergency message which was received he ditched mosquito which broke in half they took dingy and watched tail and wings remain afloat he was retrieved with gregory by air sea rescue royal navy trawlers sank sections of aircraft remaining afloat regardless of venture on 13 june 1944 he received his final award a second bar to his dso braham 1961 pp 234 239 braham was summoned to see basil embry commanding officer made braham wait until he had cleaned himself up and was properly dressed embry gave braham a stern rebuke for risking himself in such a fashion he had not given his agreement to operation and braham had taken off before he could give a definitive answer nevertheless his 29th victory eased tension and embry invited him to bar for a conciliatory beer bill gregory did not fly with bob braham again his dfc and bar with dfm reflected his contribution to braham s success he may also have taken events of 12 may 1944 as a warning for braham thrill of ranger operations was addictive on 25 may 1944 he attempted another but turned back because of poor weather his last operations were flown with both embry and walsh on 6 june 1944 during normandy landings western front dormant since 1940 was now re activated braham flew over normandy several times with mosquito bomber groups in june 1944 these counted as his last successful operations prisoner of war unlike gregory braham was unperturbed by events of 12 may 1944 braham believed that while war continued a trained combat pilot must engage enemy at all costs his experience allowed him a greater chance to survive odds than a new pilot but he acknowledged his fortune could not last forever braham continued to fly operations deep into enemy airspace over denmark alone and in daylight on 25 june 1944 he collected a mosquito from 21 squadron and australian navigator don walsh and then flew to norfolk to refuel at west raynham they took off and headed to danish coast out to sea he spotted and was likely seen by german coastal ships as they neared land braham and walsh noticed a slight whine in aircraft s radio speakers meaning mosquito was being tracked by radar to make it difficult for enemy to track him he changed course frequently ranger operations depended on surprise but it had clearly been lost clouds were thinning out and visibility was improving braham decided it was now a folly to continue and decided to head for home while flying over funen island he spotted a building with a big swastika flag draped from a pole a car was parked outside entrance believing it might contain someone of importance he dived to attack strafing building and destroyed car after departing area he reached west coast but braham had loitered for too long he spotted two fw 190s approaching fast from east braham had shot down two of these machines in a mosquito but he was uncertain of how experienced these pilots had been there was no cloud cover and mosquito could not outrun faster and more agile single engine fighters for long he decided to turn and fight while he still could in a head on attack first fw 190 pilot missed but second struck port wing and engine with cannon fire causing a large fire instrument panel and cockpit window was shot through missing both walsh and braham by inches braham dived to sea levelling out below 100 feet he tried to use fire extinguisher to stop fire german pilot shared braham s philosophy of ensuring a kill by shooting at an enemy aircraft until it came down mosquito was hit again and braham crash landed his aircraft onto a beach at 150 miles per hour thumb left a model of stalag luft iii 1945 braham and walsh scrambled free of mosquito and hid behind a sand dune as they did so aircraft s fuel tanks exploded fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet and for a moment they believed he was going to fire upon them to their relief he waved and flew by they contemplated escape but instantly german soldiers were running towards them they had crash landed near to a radar station and enemy soldiers were at crash site very quickly germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them they were captured and searched germans found a mauser pistol which braham had taken from a crashed german bomber it was not well received by his captors braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing gun fighting it out with german guards finding a friendly dane and making it to sweden somehow tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic german coffee soon a pair of luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near esjberg braham and walsh were taken across border by train to germany and sent to luftwaffe interrogation centre at oberursel near frankfurt along journey train stopped because of air raids throughout day and night german guards made it clear they had disdain for british airmen when civilians saw them in carriages and stations insults and death threats were shouted at them joseph goebbels reich propaganda minister had painted all british and allied airmen as terror flyers and his message resonated with civilians at one point a group of drunk german soldiers threatened them with bayonets and tried forcing their way into carriage of over crowded train braham feared for his life but situation was restored when a young ss officer shouted an order and put a stop to it at interrogation centre he was poorly fed and physically weakened it was part of german technique for weakening resistance to interrogation germans had prepared a file on all famous raf personnel based on information from british newspapers they knew most of what had happened in his career and private life while there he was interrogated by aide of hermann goring german questioned him about british defences and supermarine spitfires as he was about to resume operations on ju 88s jokingly braham advised him to steer clear of spitfires while at oberursel pilot who had shot him down leutnant robert spreckels of jagdgeschwader 1 jg 1 1st fighter wing arrived to meet him braham was one of his 12 air victories a figure of 45 is often misquoted an interpreter was provided braham promised to buy him a whisky when allies won war statement came as a shock to spreckels who believed firmly in a german victory braham came to respect spreckels their differences aside he learned that spreckels had lost his parents in a british air attack and was surprised when german dismissed fact with words it is war both fighter pilots dissociated themselves with bomber war they shook hands and parted airmen were sent to stalag luft iii a luftwaffe prisoner of war camp near sagan in germany near polish border they remained there until 27 january 1945 when advance of red army forced them to march across germany they were fed by red cross parcels and civilian population who were also fleeing soviets near village of a panzer division recently out of action shared their rations with them they reached spremberg on 2 february 1945 where they received food and hot water from depot of 8th panzer division they reached bremen on 5 february 1945 success of british army in north western europe necessitated their evacuation to lubeck on 10 april they were liberated by elements of british army on 2 may 1945 postwar career braham s return to britain was not a welcome one his family found him exceptionally difficult to live with his short temper and aggression manifested themselves when journalists came to family s home in leicestershire searching for a war story to print braham who despised publicity physically ejected them from his property his decision to shut media out of his life likely explains why even as one of most successful aces he was virtually unknown in britain outside raf braham had also become despondent about political climate in a country that reduced winston churchill to leader of opposition where black market was rife and rationing was set to become an indefinite feature of post war britain into 1950s braham stayed in raf and joined night fighter development wing of central fighter establishment where he tested and developed existing and new night fighting equipment massive disarmament and reduction of raf mimicking that of early 1920s disillusioned braham even more flying was reduced to save costs and removed one activity that had drawn him into raf in 1937 initially he still managed regular flights to belgium where raf retained large bases while there he was awarded order of crown and croix de guerre with palm for his wartime work
