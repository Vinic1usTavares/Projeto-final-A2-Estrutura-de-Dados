although he had not asked for a rest newspaper questioned why he had then been left out of team for test match and reported speculation that his omission was for political reasons to discredit leadership of george dewhurst trinidad and tobago captain in second game it suggested that given his ability with bat and ball st hill was worth a net 100 runs to any team in which he played quoted in having been omitted from second test which west indies lost st hill played in third in british guiana west indies won game st hill batted at number eleven in batting order in his first innings at number five in second and scored three runs in each innings with ball he took only one wicket and did not play another test a review of series in barbados advocate suggested that st hill bowled steadily during both his test appearances but that his economical bowling figures in british guiana were slightly unrepresentative as english batsmen had been concentrating entirely on defence quoted in article stated that st hill was more effective on matting pitches than on turf but that he had many supporters in trinidad and tobago it believed he warranted a place on forthcoming west indian tour of australia but that he needed to work on his fielding which was weak in august 1930 st hill signed a contract to play professional cricket in lancashire league in england which meant that he was no longer eligible to play cricket for shannon or trinidad and tobago at time competition rules barred professional cricketers from taking part consequently first class matches he played in

81 but his highest score in eight innings was 9 a summary of tour printed in sporting chronicle of trinidad and tobago suggested that st hill had bowled well during his limited opportunities but success and form of other three fast bowlers in team meant that he had little chance to reach test team or to distinguish himself reprinted in a later article in daily gleaner of jamaica suggested

bowling averages for club with 477 runs at 20 73 and 77 wickets at 13 87 however report stated that his bowling had been inconsistent and that it was surprising that he ended with such a good average

style and technique st hill s bowling style led critics to name him maurice tate of west indies tate was a leading english bowler of period who took 155 test match wickets in late 1920s st hill was judged to be a cricketer of potential at time a critic in barbados rated him medium to fast but noted that he was not as effective on turf pitches as he was on matting and his fielding was weak an article in trinidad sporting chronicle from same period named him as best fast medium bowler in west indies it noted that he was capable of bowling to slow scoring of runs or to attempt to dismiss batsmen a good fielder and a fast scoring batsman it called him a real test match cricketer and a player whose accuracy of length swerve and pace makes him an asset to any team and equal of constantine and griffith at their best at time he joined lowerhouse a profile in a burnley newspaper stated that he was a steady bowler who kept to a consistent good length additionally he was a good although impetuous batsman more recent writers have judged him by his mediocre test and first class statistical record cricket writer martin williamson writing on espncricinfo website believes his two test match performances to have been unimpressive and judges in fairness he was no more than a moderate late order batsman and regulation medium pacer tony barker in his history of bradford league calls st hill moderately talented and suggests that his success for spen victoria shows that standard of play in league at time was poor in her book on west indian test cricketers bridgette lawrence describes him as a capable all rounder who performed modestly in his only test series lawrence and goble p 133 notes references bibliography category 1904 births category 1957 deaths category west
