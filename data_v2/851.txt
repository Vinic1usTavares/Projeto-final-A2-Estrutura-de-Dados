kind of blue is a studio album by american jazz trumpeter miles davis it was recorded on march 2 and april 22 1959 at columbia s 30th street studio in new york city and released on august 17 of that year by columbia records album features davis s ensemble sextet consisting of saxophonists john coltrane and julian cannonball adderley pianist bill evans bassist paul chambers and drummer jimmy cobb with new band pianist wynton kelly appearing on one track in place of evans in part owing to evans joining sextet during 1958 davis followed up on modal experimentation of milestones by basing kind of blue entirely on modality departing further from his earlier work s hard bop style of jazz kind of blue has been regarded by many critics as greatest jazz record davis s masterpiece and one of best albums of all time its influence on music including jazz rock and classical genres has led writers to also deem it one of most influential albums ever recorded album was one of fifty recordings chosen in 2002 by library of congress to be added to national recording registry and in 2003 it was ranked number 12 on rolling stone magazine s list of 500 greatest albums of all time it was voted number 14 in colin larkin s all time top 1000 albums 3rd edition 2000 though precise figures have been disputed kind of blue is often cited as best selling jazz record of all time in 2019 it was certified quintuple platinum by recording industry association of america riaa for shipments of over five million copies background by late 1958 davis employed one of most acclaimed and profitable working bands pursuing hard bop style long serving bassist chambers had been with band from its beginning in 1955 alto saxophonist adderley had joined in fall of 1957 with tenor saxophonist coltrane returning at beginning of 1958 pianist evans had replaced red garland in april 1958 but quit in november to be replaced in turn by kelly and drummer cobb had been hired in may 1958 davis band played a mixture of pop standards and bebop originals by charlie parker thelonious monk dizzy gillespie and tadd dameron as with all bebop based jazz davis s groups improvised on chord changes of a given song kahn pp 86 87 davis was one of many jazz musicians growing dissatisfied with bebop however and saw its increasingly complex chord changes as hindering creativity in 1953 pianist george russell published his lydian chromatic concept of tonal organization russell george lydian chromatic concept of tonal organization new york russ hix music pub co library of congress catalog record available loc gov lydian chromatic concept of tonal organization website located atwww com author george russell s website located atwww com which offered an alternative to practice of improvisation based on chords and chord changes abandoning traditional major and minor key relationships lydian chromatic concept introduced idea of chord scale unity and was first theory to explore vertical relationship between chords and scales as well as only original theory to come from jazz these insights helped lead way to modal approach in jazz influenced by russell s ideas davis implemented his first modal composition with title track of his studio album milestones 1958 satisfied with results davis prepared an entire album based on modality pianist evans who had studied with russell but had departed from davis group to pursue his own career was drafted back into new recording project sessions that would become kind of blue recording kind of blue was recorded on three track tape in two sessions at columbia records 30th street studio in new york city on march 2 1959 tracks so what freddie freeloader and blue in green were recorded for side one of original lp and on april 22 tracks all blues and flamenco sketches were recorded making up side two as was davis s penchant he called for almost no rehearsal and musicians had little idea what they were to record as described in original liner notes by pianist bill evans davis had only given band sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise once musicians were assembled davis gave brief instructions for each piece and then set to taping sextet in studio while results were impressive with so little preparation persistent legend that entire album was recorded in one pass is untrue only flamenco sketches yielded a complete take on first try that take not master was issued in 1997 as a bonus alternate take five master takes issued however were only other complete takes an insert for ending to freddie freeloader was recorded but was not used for

see man he replaced bill evans back in his old seat perhaps to assuage pianist s feelings davis had kelly play instead of evans on album s most blues oriented number freddie freeloader live album miles davis at newport 1958 documents this band however newport jazz festival recording on july 3 1958 reflects band in its hard bop conception presence of bill evans only six weeks into his brief tenure in davis band notwithstanding rather than modal approach of kind of blue blumenthal bob liner notes miles davis at newport 1958 columbia legacy 2001 p 4 production credit kind of blue was produced by columbia staff producer irving townsend however over years there has been confusion with davis s subsequent producer teo macero getting partial or full credit in case of kind of blue there were two producers teo macero and irving townsend said jazz historian eric nisenson macero s role however was clearly that of an apprentice and observer recording session was also cited by nisenson as macero s first experience with highs and lows of working with miles from macero s own recollection his involvement in recording included box ing everyone in so that there would be a physical closeness among musicians not like today when musicians are spread all over place according to high fidelity though his role in kind of blue has been disputed recording was made under auspices of macero however it is townsend s voice heard on session tapes who became davis s producer after departures of george avakian and cal lampley macero did not produce davis until after townsend took over west coast production duties for columbia records when macero took his place macero s first davis production was his next record sketches of spain original lp did not credit a producer kind of blue columbia lp cl 1355 1959 first release with a producer credit was 1987 cd which credited only macero kind of blue columbia cd ck 40579 1987 however this was in error macero only produced that reissue not sessions

only townsend composition kind of blue is based entirely on modality in contrast to davis s earlier work with hard bop style of jazz and its complex chord progression and improvisation entire album was composed as a series of modal sketches in which each performer was given a set of scales that defined parameters of their improvisation and style this style was in contrast to more typical means of composing such as providing musicians with a complete score or as was more common for improvisational jazz providing musicians with a chord progression or series of harmonies modal jazz of this type was not unique to this album davis himself had previously used same method on his 1958 milestones album 58 sessions and porgy and bess 1958 on which he used modal influences for collaborator gil evans s third stream compositions modal composition with its reliance on scales and modes represented as davis called it a return to melody in a 1958 interview with nat hentoff of jazz review davis elaborated on this form of composition in contrast to chord progression predominant in bebop stating no chords gives you a lot more freedom and space to hear things when you go this way you can go on forever you don t have to worry about changes and you can do more with melody line it becomes a challenge to see how melodically innovative you can be when you re based on chords you know at end of 32 bars that chords have run out and there s nothing to do but repeat what you ve just done with variations i think a movement in jazz is beginning away from conventional string of chords there will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them as noted by bill evans in lp liner notes miles conceived these settings only hours before recording dates palmer 1997 pp 4 7 evans continued with an introduction concerning modes used in each composition on album so what consists of two modes sixteen measures of first followed by eight measures of second and then eight again of first freddie freeloader is a standard twelve bar blues form blue in green consists of a ten measure cycle following a short four measure introduction all blues is a twelve bar blues form in time flamenco sketches consists of five scales which are each played as long as soloist wishes until he has completed series liner notes list davis as writer of all compositions but many scholars and fans believe that bill evans wrote part or whole of blue in green and flamenco sketches kahn p bill evans assumed co credit with davis for blue in green when recording it on his portrait in jazz album and davis estate acknowledged evans authorship in 2002 kahn p practice of a band leader s appropriating authorship of a song written by a sideman occurred frequently in jazz world for example legendary saxophonist charlie parker took a songwriting credit for tune donna lee written by davis while he was working in charlie parker s quintet in late 1940s miles davis with quincy troupe miles autobiography simon and schuster 2001 pp 103 104 composition later became a popular jazz standard another example is introduction to so what attributed to gil evans which is closely based on opening measures of french composer claude debussy s 1910 second prelude from his first collection of preludes kahn p 178 reception and legacy since its release on august 17 1959 kind of blue has been

irritated davis greatly kahn p 183 though davis and coleman both offered alternatives to rigid rules of bebop davis would never reconcile himself to coleman s free jazz innovations although he would
