tropical storm trudy was a short lived tropical cyclone in october 2014 that caused significant flooding in southern mexico storm originated from an area of low pressure associated with a monsoon trough near central america in early october a slow moving system low eventually consolidated into a tropical depression on october 17 near mexican coastline favorable environmental conditions aided rapid development of trudy within 15 hours of its designation an eye formed over storm s center trudy ultimately achieved its peak as a strong tropical storm with 65 mph 100 km h winds as it made landfall just southeast of marquelia mexico region s mountainous terrain quickly weakened trudy and cyclone dissipated early on october 19 though cyclone dissipated its remnant energy later contributed to formation of tropical storm hanna in atlantic prior to trudy s landfall government of mexico issued multiple watches and warnings for threatened region forecasters highlighted threat of heavy rains and mudslides guerrero experienced greatest effects from trudy with landslides and flooding claiming eight lives in state over 4 000 people were evacuated in region a ninth fatality took place in campeche meteorological history on october 8 a weak area of low pressure developed within a monsoon trough over extreme eastern edge of pacific basin environmental conditions ahead of system were forecast to become gradually favorable for tropical cyclogenesis situated near costa rica scattered convection accompanied well defined system this low became less defined over following days while remaining in same general area national hurricane center nhc began monitoring system for long term cyclogenesis on october 13 at which time low was situated 150 mi 240 km south of guatemala organization was prolonged and slow however convergence of a kelvin wave and a gulf of tehuantepec gap wind event on october 15 spurred a significant increase in convection marked structural improvements took place on october 17 and nhc assessed a high probability of system becoming a tropical cyclone within 48 hours that evening corroborating data from ships satellite imagery and scatterometer estimates indicated formation of a tropical depression by 12 00 utc with cyclone located over warm waters of 86 degf 30 degc and within a very moist region with low wind shear intensification was a certainty as depression approached mexico uncertainties existed as to how fast system would move some forecast models depicting system as stalling just offshore for several days though forecasters indicated that a steady northward movement would lead to dissipation within 48 hours owing to aforementioned environmental conditions depression intensified to a tropical storm by 18 00 utc on october 17 it was subsequently assigned name trudy by nhc very deep convection blossomed over both center and accompanying banding features during morning of october 18 a central dense overcast became increasingly defined microwave satellite imagery and coastal radars depicted formation of a 12 to 17 mi 19 to 27 km wide eye by 03 00 utc it is estimated that trudy reached its peak intensity around 09 15 utc on october 18 with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph 100 km h and a barometric pressure of 998 mbar hpa 29 47 inhg simultaneously storm made landfall just southeast of marquelia or roughly 70 mi 110 km east of acapulco interaction with mountainous terrain of mexico quickly took its toll on trudy with system degrading to a tropical depression by 18 00 utc low level circulation of depression dissipated early on october 19 with its mid level remnants continuing northeastward over mexico remnant system emerged over bay of campeche on october 20 and subsequently developed into atlantic tropical depression nine which later became tropical storm hanna on october 22 due to dissipation of its surface low trudy and hanna are considered separate tropical cyclones by nhc preparations and impact thumb 300px microwave satellite and radar imagery of tropical storm trudy on october 18 as it made landfall in mexico depicting its well developed inner core and eye upon designation of tropical depression twenty e on october 17 a tropical storm warning was issued for coastal areas of mexico between tecpan de galeana and lagunas de chacahua forecasters at nhc noted that greatest threat from system would be torrential rains across guerrero and oaxaca that could trigger life threatening flash floods and mudslides rapid organization of system prompted a hurricane watch to be issued by 09 00 utc on october 18 for areas between acapulco and lagunas de chacahua this watch was soon discontinued as trudy failed to reach hurricane intensity before moving inland over mexico tropical storm warning was subsequently allowed to expire by 21 00 utc as trudy weakened to a depression in addition to above watches and warnings a yellow alert was activated for guerrero on october 17 upon abruptly intensifying prior to landfall a red alert was activated for southeastern guerrero and southwestern oaxaca while rest of guerrero and oaxaca were placed under an orange alert a total of 35 shelters were opened across eastern areas of guerrero heavy rains across guerrero wreaked havoc causing widespread flooding and damage a total of 4 075 people were evacuated from most at risk areas in state a further 300 residents were urged to leave as a river threatened to over top its banks wall collapses attributed to storm resulted in four deaths three in and one in el grande a landslide in killed two people while flooding elsewhere killed two people road access to 16 towns was cut off and main road to acapulco was damaged by landslides and flooding approximately 5 000 homes were affected by storm with 218 damaged by flooding and 6 destroyed more than 20 000 households lost power due to storm though vast majority was restored within a day a state of emergency was later declared for 35 towns in guerrero oaxaca experienced similar impacts to guerrero with flooding and landslides mostly causing damage to road infrastructure notably a bridge in san martin collapsed leaving several villages isolated at least of mexican federal highway 125 was washed away requiring a repair bill of 8 million pesos us 592 000 an emergency declaration was made for 100 municipalities in oaxaca insurance claims in state were topped at 158 million pesos us 11 7 million trudy was also blamed for one death in campeche see also other storms of same name hurricane barbara
