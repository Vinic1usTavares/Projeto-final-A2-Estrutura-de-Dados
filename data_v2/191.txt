charisma but through fear and domination women are a mixture of old and young and have similar twisted features all but one are nervous and goya s use of tone to create atmosphere is reminiscent of

historian fred licht notes that goya s brushwork appears clumsy ponderous and rough and lacking finish compared to his earlier work licht believes this was a deliberate ploy to physically convey

considerable mental and physical pain poseq 30 and withdrew from public life witches sabbath is believed to be a rather bitter but silent protest against royalists and clergy who had retaken control of spain after peninsular war of 1807 14 advocates of enlightenment had sought to redistribute land to peasants to educate women publish a vernacular bible and by replacing superstition with reason put an end to inquisition witch hunting seen during logrono inquisition was an appalling regression to liberals such as goya as court painter goya was a part of established order surviving evidence indicates he was acquiesced to wishes of his patrons yet numerous paintings and etchings have emerged since suggesting he had convictions favouring liberalism enlightenment and reason he seems to have kept such beliefs private only expressing them in his private art his more sensitive works were not published at time probably for fear of reprisal or persecution in witches sabbath goya mocks and ridicules superstition fear and irrationality of ignorant placing their faith in ghouls quack doctors and tyrants goya had used witchcraft imagery in his 1797 98 caprichos print series boime 260 and in his similarly titled 1789 painting witches sabbath in both 1789 and 1822 sabbath pictures devil is presented as a goat surrounded by a ring of terrified women nilsson 27 38 earlier painting uses witchcraft imagery in a manner that inverts order of traditional christian iconography goat extends his left rather than right hoof towards child quarter moon faces out at left hand corner of canvas hughes 153 these inversions may be metaphor for irrational undermining of liberals who argued for scientific religious and social progress many of scientific bodies then active were condemned as subversive and their members accused as agents of devil describing techniques employed in black paintings particularly visible black ground paint art historian barbara stafford said that by brusquely spots of light with prevailing darkness goya s aquatinted and painted visions demonstrated powerlessness of unmoored intellect to unify a monstrously hybrid experience according to its own a priori

of balance young woman was no longer near middle of composition thus reducing both her prominence and possibility that she is seen to be focus of work thumb left dog c 1819 1823 museo del prado some art historians have speculated that area removed was beyond restoration since it is unlikely that such a large section of painting by an artist of goya s stature would be lightly discarded still removal may have been for aesthetic reasons with empty space on right viewed as unnecessary its removal intended to bring balance to a canvas perceived as overlong havard 65 if this was cubells reasoning it was misguided he was not an accomplished painter and lacked insight into goya s intentions goya had often used empty space to dramatic and evocative effect hagen hagen 89 this can be seen in both dog from same series and his print unfortunate events in front seats of ring of madrid and death of mayor of torrejon where he left large empty areas this seems to have been a reaction against contemporary conventions of balance and harmony and was a precursor to works by modern artists such as francis bacon who greatly admired goya s depiction of what bacon described as void gale stephens 264 condition painting is in poor condition time and a complicated transfer which involved mounting crumbling plaster onto canvas have caused extensive damage and significant paint loss work seems to have been seriously damaged even before its removal from walls of goya s home base of dry plaster may have contributed to its early deterioration frescos completed on dry rather than wet plaster
