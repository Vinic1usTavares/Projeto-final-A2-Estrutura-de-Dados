episode has been analyzed for its themes of disease suffering healing salvation and resurrection mulder seemingly rising from dead has been seen as an allusion to resurrection of jesus plot background in seventh season finale requiem fbi special agent fox mulder david duchovny was abducted by aliens shapiro 2000 pp 266 277 in eighth season premiere within john doggett robert patrick took his place on x files and worked with dana scully gillian anderson to find mulder in this is not happening scully doggett and fbi assistant director walter skinner mitch pileggi discovered several returned

their compound only to discover mulder s deceased body in woods events three months after mulder s funeral doggett is offered a transfer from x files he realizes that if he leaves office will be closed as scully will soon be on maternity leave meanwhile a fishing trawler finds decomposing body of billy miles zachary ansley an alien abductee who was taken at same time as mulder when miles revives on autopsy table skinner despite doggett s objections orders that mulder s body be exhumed and brought to a hospital fearing that he may have been buried alive when casket is opened a decomposing mulder contrary to all scientific expectations shows weak vital signs meanwhile scully notices that miles now on life support has two heartbeats at fbi deputy director alvin kersh unsuccessfully tries to convince doggett to stop investigating mulder s apparent death a short while later as skinner walks down a hallway alex krycek nicholas lea activates nanobots that he had previously placed in skinner s bloodstream as blackmail skinner stumbles in pain and in an elevator krycek reveals himself and explains that he has a vaccine which could save mulder s life however he will only give it if skinner can ensure that scully does not give birth to her baby for reasons that he does not disclose later alone in his hospital bed miles regains consciousness and goes to take a shower while doing so his decaying flesh falls away revealing a healthy body beneath he tries to persuade scully and doggett that aliens who abducted him are trying to save humanity scully however gets a lab report which reveals that miles s dna has substantially changed he is now a new being skinner later tells scully that there is a cure for mulder s disease but does not explain krycek s demands from her medical findings scully discovers that an alien virus is keeping abductees alive long enough to cause a radical genetic transformation to take place similar to one that miles experienced after scully tells doggett about transformation he visits absalom who believes that abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer earth skinner torn by his decision decides to euthanize mulder by pulling him off life support so that krycek does not get his way doggett however catches skinner in his attempt skinner explains krycek s demands but doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either scully s child will die or mulder will succumb to virus doggett tries to locate krycek in parking lot of fbi headquarters but krycek nearly runs him down with a car and destroys vaccine before escaping dejected doggett returns to hospital and tells skinner he was right not to trust krycek he finds scully preparing mulder for now destroyed

combination of antiviral drugs to kill virus if they can get him and his temperature to stabilize later scully is sitting by mulder s bedside when he regains consciousness he stares blankly at scully and asks who are you at first scully thinks that mulder does not remember her however she quickly realizes that he is actually playing a practical joke they laugh and mulder asks did anybody miss me

closure if show was cancelled x files creator chris carter brought back several characters from series pilot for season finale requiem this included most notably billy miles played by zachary ansley after an eighth season of show was confirmed mythology of ongoing alien story arc for series changed for both practical and artistic reasons former series lead david duchovny left full time participation in series after a lengthy lawsuit during previous season kessenich 2002 p 80 to replace him show s producers hired robert patrick although duchovny eventually agreed to return for half of season eight s episodes as such deadalive was one of first episodes that duchovny participated in full time kessenich 2002 p 145 further frank spotnitz executive producer and co writer of deadalive noted that original mythology of show had been wrapped up much earlier in one son and closure spotnitz 2005 33 36 34 02 to create a new chapter in mythology and to work around duchovny s absence storyline for eighth season focused largely on search for mulder in first half and introduction of super soldiers in second spotnitz 2005 8 42 10 47 due to change in style and actors carter felt that eighth season of x files was end of mulder scully era spotnitz wanted deadalive to open in a way that would shock viewers and make them watch entire episode he concluded that best way to do this was to show mulder s funeral he felt that death of hero of series was shocking enough but that no one expected deadalive to blatantly open with a funeral spotnitz 2005 0 27 0 47 he elaborated but here we are actually burying man just pushing something as far as you possibly can because audience can t quite believe you re doing it spotnitz 2005 0 47 0 55 funeral was expensive to film several actors such as sheila larken who played scully s mother needed to be flown in specifically for scene spotnitz later said it s a lot of money to spend but you know you just couldn t really do mulder s funeral without having them there so we did all that spotnitz 2005 1 21 1 40 despite fact that show was filmed in california and under huge financial pressure real snow was used for foreground 2005 0 59 1 09 and background was painted white in post production spotnitz 2005 1 09 1 16 spotnitz later called sequence a fun scene to write and stage and a great tease spotnitz 2005 0 20 026 spotnitz 2005 1 50 1

spotnitz 2005 30 57 31 08 in end spotnitz called effects of his actions particularly aftermath of taking mulder off life support a nice sort of unexpected turn spotnitz 2005 39 33 39 43 scully s role in deadalive was partly based on 1954 film magnificent obsession in which a young man s behavior causes him to accidentally blind a woman to atone for this turn of events he becomes a doctor to cure her spotnitz noted that movie was on my mind and not in a good way when we were imagining scully in this operating room where mulder was being worked on spotnitz 2005 38 45 39 19 filming and effects deadalive was second episode directed by tony wharmby after spotnitz penned via negativa spotnitz later praised directing of deadalive as fantastic spotnitz 2005 7 06 7 08 majority of episode like others from seasons six to nine was filmed in and around los angeles area fraga 2010 spotnitz managed to secure sufficient funds to enable fishing trawler scene to be filmed off los angeles coast a situation with which he was very pleased spotnitz 2005 6 43 6 45 he also said that after series move from vancouver following fifth season j edgar hoover building set became more important to show than before for this reason scene in which skinner collapses was filmed almost entirely on an fbi hallway set this sequence recalls sixth season episode s r 819 which featured skinner being poisoned with nanobots by krycek spotnitz 2005 18 27 19 02 200px thumb right strawberry jam among other things was used to create effect of shedding flesh alt image is of red strawberry jelly make up effects artist matthew mungle was responsible for portraying decomposition of mulder s and miles s bodies spotnitz was particularly impressed with miles s autopsy scene calling it something new to do in late stage of game spotnitz 2005 7 38 7 45 since human bodies which have decomposed in water become grotesque ly disfigured miles s body was a toned down version of what reality would be spotnitz 2005 8 17 8 19 to create scene plaster bandages were used to create a cast of front and back of ansley s body these in turn were used to create a fiberglass cast this was sculpted over with water clay to create appearance of a bloated body afterwards a mold of clay was made and a body suit created with latex as project proceeded mungle sent photos to carter who gave final approval in miles s shower scene a mix of red goo which included strawberry jam was placed on ansley s skin fake skin created from thin pieces of urethane was then placed on top of this mixture and warm water was pumped through to create illusion of shedding flesh mungle reportedly had only six days to complete prosthetics for episode mungle later noted that after being told what scene would entail he asked if we can figure something out could we show it on tv while studio approved footage spotnitz later called sequence awfully graphic he was surprised sequence got past censors since it would be difficult to show in a pg rated film spotnitz 2005 22 24 22 26 due to duchovny s contract he was available for shooting only on certain days spotnitz commented on irony of paying all this money to get duchovny s services for a limited time only to have him spend most of episode in a hospital bed semi dead spotnitz 2005 2 24 2 30 he later lamented limited access to duchovny as it prevented most satisfying use of actor or character spotnitz 2005 2 38 2 42 some scenes featuring mulder were filmed using different people for instance scene in which mulder is exhumed was filmed with a double who wore a mask of duchovny s face head make up artist cheri montesanto medcalf later said it was brilliant because nobody knew that hurwitz and knowles 2008 p 192 for shots of stunt double as well as of duchovny later in episode she used egg whites and a facial mask to give mulder s skin a really cool old dried up cracked skin effect themes mulder s revival has been compared to jesus christ s resurrection 200px thumb right alt image is a painting of resurrection of jesus deadalive along with other eighth season episodes explores themes of human resurrection and salvation disease suffering and healing these emerged in season s premiere within when scully is shown mulder s tombstone arc would continue in gift which explored implications of mulder s inoperable brain tumor and featured resurrection of a temporarily deceased john doggett in deadalive theme of resurrection reappears in full force billy miles is found dead but revives likewise mulder is buried for three months but is brought back to life this sub theme would continue into ninth season in episodes such as audrey kellner 2003 p 155 episode is one of many to feature mulder as a christlike figure in we want to believe amy donaldson writes that episode is most dramatic of mulder s multiple resurrections she compares his resurrection to jesus s who mulder outdo es by staying in grave for three months instead of simply three days donaldson 2011 p 11 during mulder s funeral minister reads john 11 25 26 whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die according to scripture jesus spoke these words when he raised lazarus of bethany from dead and many biblical scholars note that verse foreshadows his own resurrection previously in seventh season s millennium verse was used by a necromancer but for wrong reason necromancer wanted to raise dead by reciting verse but only their bodies returned as zombies in deadalive mulder returns from dead in both mind and body donaldson 2011 pp 210 211 donaldson also draws parallels between eighth season of show and gospels and between ninth season and acts of apostles in gospels jesus is brought back to life but then leaves his followers allowing them to spread his message this is recorded in acts fifth book of new testament in x files mulder follows a similar course after returning to life in deadalive he investigates several cases before disappearing at beginning of season nine in nothing important happened today during ninth season his quest is continued by scully doggett and monica reyes reception ratings and release deadalive premiered on american television on april

included on x files mythology volume 4 super soldiers a dvd collection of episodes in super soldiers story arc reviews many critics were happy with return of david duchovny as fox mulder 175px thumb right alt a man with dark brown hair is smirking and looking near camera episode received mixed reviews many critics praised return of fox mulder although others felt that episode had various plot holes and was overcomplicated robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to x files millennium lone gunmen gave deadalive a full five stars and called its humor and simplistic plot icing on cake they praised its stylistic difference from preceding episode this is not happening which they described as atmospheric and doom laden two called deadalive a slice of sci fi hokum with action scenes bits of grisly horror and a reexamination of show s mythology shearman and pearson 2010 p 243 jessica morgan from television without pity gave episode an a and wrote never go away again david i take back everything bad i ever said about you i love you as much as ever likewise george avalos and michael liedtke of contra costa times praised on screen return of characters such as mulder and krycek they felt so many eighth season episodes worked well because chris carter seems to be taking an even more active role in series that is most closely identified with him zack handlen of a v club awarded episode a b and wrote that it s a measure of a show s effectiveness to see how convincingly writers can threaten a major character and have that character s subsequent survival not be a cheat in regards to mulder s resurrection he applauded fact that episode is suspenseful even though ending has a certain inevitability handlen also positively commented on both anderson s performance although pointing out that she is largely pushed to side for majority of episode and lea s reappearance noting that it s always fun to see krycek however he argued that conclusion makes less sense more you think about it but that final scene with mulder and scully makes up for contrivance not all reviews were positive paula vitaris from cfq gave episode one and a half stars out of four she criticized its storyline noting a number of plot holes such as mulder s survival for three months without food or water and fact that his body was neither autopsied nor embalmed tom kessenich in examination an unauthorized look at seasons 6 9 of x files called plot wooden and convoluted and felt that it set stage for countdown toward end of fox mulder s time on x files however he complimented anderson on her effective performance kessenich 2002 pp 163 165 sfx magazine ranked episode as sixth top 10 resurrections reasoning that it allowed mulder to be around for series finale a year later however magazine felt his return made poor robert patrick s agent doggett a bit superfluous and that plot was rather complicated in a list comparing fringe episodes with those of x files ugo networks writer alex zalben named deadalive as best resurrection story beating out fringes unearthed zalben cited emotional reunion at end as deciding factor though both episodes
