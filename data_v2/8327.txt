1701 first transportation routes through what became state of michigan were lakes rivers and indian trails one of these indian trails saginaw trail followed a path from detroit area north to saginaw this trail ran along what is now dixie highway from pontiac northwards telegraph lines were first installed from detroit area south to monroe area in mid 19th century with additional lines north to pontiac completed around 1868 as these communication lines were installed roadways were added as needed to provide access for maintenance parallel road from dearborn south was named for these lines becoming telegraph road when state initially signposted its state highways in 1919 telegraph road from ohio state line north to dearborn was assigned original m 10 designation same year dixie highway an auto trail that ran south from detroit to miami florida was extended through pontiac northward to straits of mackinac numerical highway designation was changed to us 24 when united states numbered highway system was inaugurated on november 11 1926 highway traffic coming north from toledo was forced to pass through detroit to get to points north at time to ease congestion downtown a westerly bypass was constructed in 1920s between flat rock and dearborn upgraded highway was opened in 1922 with an extension to stoney creek following year new road was built north from michigan avenue to grand river avenue in 1924 extension to state line was finished in 1925 and remainder to dixie highway north of pontiac was done in 1930 at time us 24 was extended north to corner of telegraph and square lake roads with m 58 routed along western pontiac bypass highway was widened into a multi lane highway starting in 1936 by 1945 a divided highway designated alternate us 24 alt us 24 was opened from state line north to erie this divided highway now named detroit toledo expressway was extended in 1956 to gibraltar and alt us 24 designation was continued north to connect back to mainline near woodhaven former connection near erie became a connector route now part of conn us 24 and conn m 125 additional segments of freeway were opened through 1958 and i 75 designation was applied to freeway following year becoming first segment of interstate highway so signed in michigan between 1960 and 1963 four lane undivided highway was turned into a seven and eight lane divided highway in wayne county at this time michigan state highway department predecessor to mdot added median crossovers along telegraph road these additions were used to eliminate left turns at intersections and shift traffic less than away from intersection distance complicated traffic flow later this concept was refined and used at intersection of 8 mile road and livernois avenue becoming first michigan left intersection in state in 1970 us 10 was moved from its routing along woodward avenue between detroit and pontiac to follow lodge freeway from northern end of lodge to square lake road near pontiac us 10 and us 24 were run concurrently along telegraph road north of square lake road us 10 continued along telegraph back to dixie highway as before in 1986 us 10 was truncated to end at bay city instead of continuing on to detroit in process telegraph road lost its us 10 co designation us 24 was extended to its current northern terminus near clarkston and existing bus us 10 in pontiac was redesignated to become a bus us 24 instead interchange with i 94 had only two bridges and left hand exits were used throughout this interchange was reconfigured in 2005 to a spui design that was
