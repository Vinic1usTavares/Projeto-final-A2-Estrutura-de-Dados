myself tonight but it was really really fun to take what i learned from movie she further elaborated a lot of that video was based on my visual inspiration i took hype into my salon area in my home it s like my creative den he took ideas and then took other ideas and related to ideas and it just was really iconic imagery video itself features a strong sexual theme with scenes of s m and bondage as

madonna beyonce gwen stefani girls from robert palmer s simply irresistible video and michelle pfeiffer s s m inspired catwoman from batman returns despite video s attempt to shock it s unlikely
