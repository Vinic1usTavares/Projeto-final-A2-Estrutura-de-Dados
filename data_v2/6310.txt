big butte creek is a tributary of rogue river in u s state of oregon it drains approximately of jackson county its two forks north fork and south fork both begin high in cascade range near mount mcloughlin flowing predominantly west they meet near city of butte falls main stem flows generally northwest until it empties into rogue falls was incorporated in 1911 and remains only incorporated town within watershed s boundaries big butte creek s watershed was originally settled over 8 000 years ago by klamath upper umpqua and takelma tribes of native americans in rogue river wars of 1850s most of native americans were either killed or forced onto indian reservations first non indigenous settlers arrived in 1860s naming creek after snowy butte an early name for mount mcloughlin in late 19th century watershed was primarily used for agriculture and logging small city of butte falls was incorporated in 1911 and remains only incorporated town within watershed s boundaries big butte springs located in watershed provides clean drinking water to more than 115 000 residents of rogue valley it emits over of water per day water from big butte creek is also diverted for irrigation at several other locations water quality of big butte creek watershed is generally high and it supports several species of trout and salmon watershed is also home to more than 152 species of birds 63 species of mammals 19 species of reptiles and numerous plants poverty flats region was designated an area of critical environmental concern by bureau of land management in 1995 to protect several rare species of plants course big butte creek begins in cascade range near butte falls it flows generally northwest over approximately to its confluence with rogue river two main forks of big butte creek north fork and south fork merge at above sea level while creek s mouth is located at an elevation of north fork s headwaters are located on slopes of rustler peak it flows southwest receiving many small tributaries such as jackass eighty acre and friese creeks turning west it flows just north of butte falls before merging with south fork south fork begins at confluence of two of its tributaries twincheria and rancheria creeks it flows southwest receiving fourbit creek on left fourbit creek begins near mount mcloughlin where massive faults may allow water to seep into it from nearby fourmile lake in klamath river watershed south fork turns west and receives willow creek on left big butte springs are located on willow creek and medford aqueduct which carries drinking water to cities in rogue valley parallels south fork from there all way to butte falls south fork flows over butte falls nearby city s namesake and merges with north fork about downstream big butte creek travels northwest gathering mcneil creek on left and clark creek on right along with many other minor tributaries this region contains many class ii and iii rapids as rated on international scale of river difficulty stream is crossed by road at river mile rm 9 5 or river kilometer rk 15 and netherlands road at rm 3 rk 4 8 about before its mouth big butte creek cascades over crowfoot falls and is crossed by crowfoot road it then flows into rogue river from its mouth at pacific ocean big butte creek s mouth is about one mile southwest of william l jess dam and oregon route 62 passes just north of it discharge united states geological survey monitors flow of big butte creek at three different stream gauges two on south fork and one on main stem both south fork gauges were shut down in 1991 but gauge located near mouth of big butte creek continues to operate main stem often discharges less water than south fork alone in summer months because of numerous diversions discharge stream

west gathering many small tributaries south fork begins at confluence of rancheria and twincheria creeks flowing generally west one of its main tributaries is willow creek whose headwaters are on mount mcloughlin it is impounded by willow dam creating willow lake big butte springs is also located on willow creek two forks merge at butte falls big butte creek flows northwest until it enters rogue river near lost creek lake big butte creek watershed is located almost entirely within jackson county with a small eastern portion in klamath county a map of big butte creek watershed big butte creek drains approximately of southern oregon elevations range from at creek s mouth to at summit of mount mcloughlin with an average of about 56 percent is federally owned by bureau of land management and united states forest service 44 percent is privately owned and a small fraction belongs to city of medford big butte creek watershed experiences a mediterranean climate temperatures range from in winter to in summer precipitation averages between annually most precipitation occurs between november and march nine percent of watershed s surface runoff is collected from rain 35 percent from rain on snow and 56 percent from snow watershed contains largest groundwater source in entire rogue river basin one major outlet is at big butte springs watershed is split into two geographic regions high cascades and western cascades both volcanic in origin western cascades compose western two thirds of watershed this region is highly eroded being between 17 and 38 million years old its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock due to rock s high ability to absorb moisture earthflows are common high cascades are much younger around three to seven million years old mount mcloughlin is most prominent high cascade volcano in watershed last erupting between 20 000 and 15 000 years ago basalt and andesite are most common rock types in this region nearby watersheds include little butte creek to south small klamath river tributaries such as fourmile creek to east south fork rogue river to east and north and minor tributaries of rogue river including reese and indian creeks to west flora and fauna thumb upright left northern spotted owl a rare species that inhabits watershed alt a midsized bird perched on a moss covered limb it has brown feathers covered with white to tan spots its eyes are round and black and its beak is short and curved downward some of most common trees that grow in big butte creek watershed include four species of fir two species of pine incense cedar and western hemlock understory contains plants such as pacific yew pacific madrone chinquapin and vine maple several invasive species have been reported in big butte creek watershed such as kentucky bluegrass common bent drooping brome and redtop spread of these species is most likely due to overgrazing sensitive species that grow in watershed include howell s yampah egg lake monkeyflower clustered lady s slipper green flowered ginger mount mazama and detling s mallow and popcorn flower have also been discovered in riparian zones poverty flats area of critical environmental concern acec is home to several rare species of plants including bellinger s meadowfoam howell s yampah and rocky mountain over 152 species of birds are known or suspected to live in big butte creek watershed including northern goshawk and northern spotted owl a vulnerable species bald eagles nest around willow lake amphibians such as vulnerable oregon spotted frog and near threatened cascades frog inhabit some regions of watershed black tailed deer roosevelt elk cougars and black bears are most common of 63 species of mammals found in watershed fishers and american martens have also been spotted gray wolf and vulnerable grizzly bear once lived in watershed but are now considered extirpated nineteen species of reptiles live in area other sensitive species include wolverine western pond turtle sandhill crane and townsend s big eared bat rainbow trout chinook and coho salmon and pacific lamprey are most common anadromous fish that inhabit big butte creek they travel as far as butte falls sometimes passing over it during high flows because of cold sterile conditions of water and difficulty of jumping over butte creek waterfall streams above butte falls have very low populations of anadromous fish native resident fish in this area include coastal cutthroat and rainbow trout willow lake contains largemouth bass and rainbow cutthroat and brook trout overall number of fish in big butte creek watershed has declined in recent years possibly due to clearing of riparian zones and rising water temperatures history thumb right butte falls located on south fork of big butte creek alt a short wide moderate sized waterfall surrounded by vegetation humans have lived in big butte creek area for at least 8 000 years klamath upper umpqua takelma and latgawa tribes of native americans inhabited watershed until they were driven out in rogue river wars of 1850s on christmas eve december 24 1855 captain e a rice along with 34 other men attacked a native american encampment near creek s mouth eighteen native american men were killed all women and children were captured and camp was burned to ground most were relocated to indian reservations non indigenous settlers first arrived in early 1860s and agriculture ranching and logging industries quickly developed big butte creek was named by early settlers for its close proximity to mount mcloughlin also known as snowy butte as was nearby little butte creek in 1904 a water powered sawmill was constructed at butte falls town of butte falls was established in 1906 and incorporated in 1911 pacific and eastern railway was constructed to butte falls in 1910 butte falls also received water rights to ginger springs providing high quality drinking water for town cat hill burn destroyed of forest on rustler peak in 1910 in 1915 eagle point irrigation canal was constructed diverting approximately of water for irrigation in little butte creek watershed canal begins just below butte falls butte falls fish hatchery was also constructed in 1915 originally hatchery impounded water from ginger creek however in 1923 a canal was built transferring of water from south fork of big butte creek medford aqueduct a pipeline was constructed in 1927 it delivers about of drinking water from big butte springs south to bear creek watershed in 1951 a second pipeline was added and willow dam was constructed creating willow lake springs serve over 115 000 customers throughout rogue valley loggers felled massive amounts of forest in 1920s and 1930s reforestation efforts began in 1940s because natural regeneration could not keep pace with rate of logging in 1962 columbus day storm knocked many more large trees to ground today old growth forest covers only about five percent of watershed in 1995 poverty flats region was designated an area of critical environmental concern acec by bureau of land management located about west of butte falls acec is home to several rare species of plants it was fenced off in 1996 to protect area from roaming cattle butte falls fish hatchery was scheduled to be closed by oregon department of fish and wildlife in july 2009 as part of a statewide effort to decrease department s budget but on july 3 it was announced that hatchery would continue to operate with only one employee however hatchery was closed permanently in october 2010 a portion of eagle point irrigation canal failed on october 2 2011 sending of muddy water down a hillside across a road and into lower big butte creek a vital salmon spawning area a stream gauge on rogue river about downstream reported turbidity levels twenty times higher than before breach canal was repaired by october 28 pollution oregon department of environmental quality deq has monitored big butte creek for eight different parameters that affect water quality temperature oxygen saturation ph nutrients bacteria chemical contaminants such as pesticides and metals turbidity and alkalinity streams that exceed standard level are placed on deq 303d list in accordance with clean water act about of streams in big butte creek watershed were listed on 2004 2006 deq 303d list entire main stem exceeded standard level for temperature oxygen saturation and e coli a type of bacteria lower of north fork were listed for high temperature along with many other minor tributaries south fork was not listed although some of its tributaries were thumb right 300px alt loop shaped somewhat like a figure eight begins in town of butte falls it travels east passing butte falls fish hatchery then turns northeast near mount mcloughlin third and fourth stops are whiskey springs interpretive site and logging arch loop passes cat hill burn site and then has scenic views of mount mcloughlin it turns southeast to lower south fork trailhead then northwest imnaha guard station trail loops around to travel southeast passing giant sugar pine and south fork bridge it turns southwest passing lodgepole kiosk and finally returning to butte falls a map of butte falls discovery loop tour which passes through scenic areas of rogue river siskiyou national forest overall water quality in big butte creek watershed is generally high however road construction and logging can cause severe erosion leading to high levels of sedimentation and turbidity willow creek region often experiences high turbidity but willow lake traps sediment before it can travel downstream big butte springs provides clean water that requires minimal treatment to meet water quality standards water from springs has very little chemical pollution low turbidity and temperatures averaging between recreation popular recreational activities in big butte creek watershed include hunting camping hiking and horseback riding many tourists also come to sight see most heavily used trail in area is blue canyon trail leading to sky lakes wilderness and ultimately larger pacific crest trail city of butte falls has organized butte falls discovery loop tour a half day long drive through rogue river siskiyou national forest loop starts in butte falls and has several stops for hiking and viewing landscape including mount mcloughlin water recreation on willow lake includes boating swimming fishing and waterskiing fishing is also popular in other streams especially fourbit creek cross country skiing and snowmobiling are
