which is viewed from a top down perspective consists of two dimensional planes stacked vertically upon each other a blurred version of layer below appears in background of each plane planes contain organisms of varying sizes player s creature automatically attempts to consume them when they are nearby majority of these creatures are non confrontational and are composed of cells that increase number of segments in player s creature when eaten all planes except for highest and lowest contain two specially colored organisms that move player s creature up or down one plane when touched certain planes feature aggressive multi segmented creatures that perish when all their segments are eaten by player s creature however they can eat segments of player s creature to regrow their own these creatures release many cells upon death which can restore health of player s creature temporarily increase size of its mouth or cause it to sprout decorative protrusions players are not required to eat these or any other organisms they may travel to higher or lower planes at any time being defeated by aggressive creatures does not result in death but causes player s creature to float to a higher plane in flash version player can replay game with a jellyfish like organism by defeating an aggressive creature on bottom plane if player reaches bottom again creature there is their original worm like creature and defeating it starts game over as that organism playstation versions playstation 3 version of flow features enhanced visuals and three additional playable organisms one that can

thumb upright designer jenova chen in 2007 right alt black and white photo of an asian man seated at a desk holding his fist to his chin flow was originally developed as part of jenova chen s master s thesis for interactive media program at university of southern california s school of cinematic arts his thesis was on concept of dynamic difficulty adjustment dda wherein a game adjusts its reactions to a player based on past and present actions of that player he illustrated his ideas with flow which he created in collaboration with nicholas clark chen implemented dda by causing player to change game s difficulty subconsciously he allowed players to dive between planes at will and provided option of eating or not eating any creature players may decide to rush downwards or to grow stronger before attacking powerful opponents chen described flow as a simple game it s simplest test of active dda another influence on game was psychologist mihaly csikszentmihalyi s work on flow wherein a person fully immerses themselves in an activity and gains a feeling of energized focus to achieve this state person or player must have control over activity chen believed that his dda theory gave players control necessary to achieve flow while playing game was released in march 2006 after two months of development during which chen and clark taught themselves flash programming game s source code was later released in 2009 game s score was composed by austin wintory a playstation 3 version was announced for playstation store in may of that year and was released in february 2007 chen had graduated by that point and had founded thatgamecompany which handled conversion to playstation 3 nicholas clark was one of employees and served as game version s designer impressed by flow sony provided thatgamecompany with finances supplies and additional staff and offered them a three game contract playstation 3 version of flow was first of these chen originally believed conversion could be completed in four months and that it would be ready for november 2006 launch of playstation network however when it was finally released in february 2007 it did not include half of original design a version for playstation portable developed by supervillain studios was released in march 2008 company coded it from scratch as playstation 3 version s code and art were too platform specific to reuse add on pack for playstation 3 version was also developed by supervillain thatgamecompany was not involved in development of either project beyond a design influence and art direction role as they were creating their next title flower sony santa monica created ports of playstation 3 game for playstation 4 and playstation vita which were published in november 2013 to correspond with release

of 80 games showcased in a 2012 exhibit at smithsonian american art museum titled art of video games flow received mixed reviews from critics who focused on game s playstation versions visuals and presentation were among its most praised elements with ign s chris roper calling them one of flows greatest strengths alex navarro of gamespot agreed saying that it was hard to argue with those aesthetics he lauded use of color designs of creatures and dynamic soundtrack will freeman of videogamer com called it attractive and stylish which made game immensely satisfying to toy with richard leadbetter of eurogamer claimed that game s main purpose was to look pretty and sound cool reviewers were mixed in their opinions on gameplay roper said that simply see ing what s next was enjoyable but acknowledged that game s activities were limited beyond this aspect leadbetter went further saying flow feels like a tech demo in many ways and that its small amount of gameplay existed primarily to act as a tour guide through visuals and audio freeman said that it would not be unfair to describe flow as empty and without substance navarro concluded that flow was enjoyable for few hours needed to complete it but it lacked a lasting gameplay experience he attributed this to game s heavy emphasis on aesthetics over gameplay luke mitchell of palgn however felt that anything more complicated would take away from friendly nature of an experience of this type reviewers found game to be largely unchallenging roper stated that there really isn t any sort of a challenge here particularly due to player character s inability to die leadbetter summed up game s difficulty as negligible however when reviewing playstation portable version of game justin calvart of gamespot took view that game s difficulty masterfully scales to match your skill level so it does not become overly frantic or frustrating reviewers were universally dismissive of multiplayer mode with calvart saying that whatever it is it s not good leadbetter called playstation 3 version s multiplayer little more than an afterthought while navarro said it doesn t add a lick of depth to experience overall reviewers saw flow as being more akin to an art piece than a game navarro called it an arty piece of gaming and said that it had vibe of an art school project leadbetter believed that it was more of an experiment than a traditional game and described it as a trippy ornament freeman called it playstation 3 s first art house title roper summarized flow as not so much a game as it is an experience and mitchell claimed that it tries to do something entirely unique and experimental and on that level it succeeds see also fat worm blows a sparky references external links playable flow flash game jenova chen s official
