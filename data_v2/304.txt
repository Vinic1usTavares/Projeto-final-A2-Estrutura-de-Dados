hercules in disney s hercules 1997 a role for which he was ultimately turned down by directors because they felt that he sounded too old disney eventually cast osmond as singing voice of shang because his singing voice is similar to wong s speaking voice an up tempo military style song that incorporates both eastern and western musical styles i ll make a man out of you is performed by shang during a rigorous training montage in which his young inexperienced soldiers attempt to justify their worth song s title is considered ironic because mulan who relies on intelligence ultimately proves more competent than her male comrades including captain li shang who takes a liking to her while its lyrics explore hyper masculinity contradicted with mulan s gender i ll make a man out of you has received mostly positive reviews from film and music critics some of whom dubbed it film s best song while praising osmond s performance critics have also drawn comparisons between song and disney s hercules while likening mulan s role and transformation to actress demi moore s performance as lieutenant jordan o neil in film g i jane 1997 song has since appeared on several best of disney songs lists including those of total film and new york post discussed by film critics film historians academic journalists and feminists song has gone on to be recorded and covered in several different languages namely mandarin cantonese and spanish by entertainers jackie chan and cristian castro respectively writing and recording i ll make a man out of you was written by composer matthew wilder and lyricist david zippel who were hired to write mulan s songs because disney was interested in recruiting songwriters that would give kind of different sound to each of songs while zippel a broadway lyricist was recruited because directors were impressed with his work on disney s hercules 1997 at time wilder a pop singer had been best known for his song break my stride bancroft believes that although songwriters had two different sensibilities blend of their styles worked well together especially on i ll make a man out of you thumb 288x288px directors cast american singer donny osmond as singing voice of shang because he and bd wong share similar voices osmond had auditioned for role of hercules in disney s hercules for which he was turned down because he sounded too old songwriter stephen schwartz was originally slated to write lyrics for mulan until he was replaced by zippel at last moment schwartz had written a song called we ll make a man of you for scene in which mulan is training to be soldier song was ultimately replaced with wilder and zippel s i ll make a man out of you when schwartz was forced to resign from mulan by disney executives peter schneider and michael eisner because songwriter had also agreed to score rival studio dreamworks animated film prince of egypt 1998 wilder and zippel first conceived song s title which then inspired them to write its lyrics and music zippel identified determining song s ironic title as moment he knew he d hit on something great by contrasting mulan s gender with concept of what it means to be a man songwriters were hoping to create an original version of a training montage that was funny without being obvious while remaining in character at all times in an unlikely situation filmmakers universally enjoyed song from its very first draft wilder described himself as using an an everything and kitchen sink approach to composing its music explaining i knew i wanted it to sound large and i knew what tempo and cadence of piece was combining eastern and western styles wilder borrowed drum cadences from traditional chinese drums and then marrying that with military snares upon which he continued building until it became this cacophonous effect of a chinese marching american band wilder and zippel decided to incorporate drums into track to demonstrate a sense of masculinity and musculature identifying song as very odd in structure but appropriate for its lyrics zippel s incorporation of naturalistic descriptions of masculinity into song s lyrics raging fire coursing river great typhoon was used in an attempt to get inside shang s head space elaborating i was just trying to be in character for captain and how an asian captain would lead his group differently than how a western captain would call his troops identifying as an opportunity to put some specificity into it wilder recorded song s demo himself which was arranged into a composition featuring a 100 piece orchestra and mail choir conducted by musician paul buckmaster before mulan american singer donny osmond had auditioned for lead role in hercules a role for which he was ultimately not cast because directors felt that his voice sounded too old and too deep for character osmond later revealed in an interview with people that he was so embarrassed by his hercules audition that he had nearly considered ending his singing career prematurely a few months later disney contacted osmond with interest in casting him as singing voice of shang after comparing his audition tapes to bd wong and determining that both actors have very similar voices in one scene osmond s character shang is hit in stomach while singing i ll make a man out of you in order to sound as realistic as possible osmond punched himself in stomach
