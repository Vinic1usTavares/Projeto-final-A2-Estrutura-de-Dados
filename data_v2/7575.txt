around this time waits began working as a doorman at a san diego california club heritage which was a coffee house by day in november 1970 waits performed his first paid show at heritage earning 25 for his performance humphries p 40 at a troubadour performance in summer 1971 herb cohen inadvertently spotted waits and became his manager through cohen s contacts waits recorded demos in los angeles in late summer 1971 with producer robert duffey later released as early years in two volumes against waits wishes in order to focus on his career waits relocated from san diego to los angeles in early 1972 and performed more frequently at troubadour where david geffen discovered him performing grapefruit moon hoskyns p 76 performance which floored geffen humphries p 45 led geffen to negotiate with

recorded a pre production tape in yester s residence hosykyns p 82 instrumentation recording arrangements and musicians were also discussed during this session with waits making it absolutely clear he wanted a standup bass player hosykyns p 83 drummer john seiter guitarist peter klimes trumpeter tony terran and additional guitarist shep cooke were recruited through yester and through seiter jazz bassist bill plummer was hired main recording sessions for closing time took place at sunset sound recorders in hollywood california where buffalo springfield joni mitchell neil young and doors had previously recorded during spring 1972 yester fronted production and sessions were held almost immediately after waits record deal and were described quick and efficient humphries p 49 waits was nervous but confident enough in his own material during beginning of sessions however as sessions progressed waits and yester were pulling against each other over direction which album would take with waits wanting a jazz laden record and yester more focused on producing a folk based album despite this waits was absolutely communicative hoskyns p 84 with his fellow musicians articulating his direction and using metaphors to describe how he wanted songs to sound sessions took a total of ten days with first two days focusing on getting used to studio humphries p 50 both waits and yester wanted to record during evening but as no slots were available it was recorded through morning and afternoon from ten to five every day during recording of ol 55 seiter contributed backing vocals and came up with a perfect harmony line that started faintly before chorus even began sessions concluded with a total of nine songs completed though unsatisfied with number of songs a second recording session was arranged following week in united western recorders final session for closing time began following sunday with guest musicians arni egilsson replacing plummer and jesse erlich performing cello hoskyns p 86 title track closing time was only song recorded in full and yester later described session as most magical session i ve ever been involved with at end of it no one spoke for what felt like five minutes either in booth or out in room no one nobody wanted moment to end string overdubs were later cut for martha and grapefruit moon following day final recordings were mixed and mastered at wally heider studios in san francisco composition closing time features an eclectic mix of musical styles songs such as ol 55 with its gentle piano chords and old shoes a country rock waltz that picked up feel of ol 55 are usually considered folk like other songs such as virginia avenue midnight lullaby whose outro features an instrumental segment of nursery rhyme hush little baby and grapefruit moon reveal a quieter more jazz like temperament ice cream man is often noted as being most up tempo song of album whereas lonely is toned down and slow paced sophisticated piano melodies are often accompanied by trumpets typical of jazz sound that waits originally designated for album noticeable string arrangements are also featured on album on martha and final song closing time latter being purely instrumental songs on closing time are often noted for their lyrical content and vary in form ol 55 narrates story of a man riding lickety in a car and is often seen as a song about escapism like his near contemporary bruce springsteen humphries p 51 this theme is also present in old shoes which narrates another story about a footloose young stud hitting road and semi sneering hoskyns p 85 particularly in lyrics such as your tears cannot bind me anymore and my heart was not born to be tamed other lyrics on album are described as melancholic particularly lonely i hope that i don t fall in love with you and grapefruit moon which are both self conscious and lacklustre intro to midnight lullaby borrows lyrics from english nursery rhyme sing a song of sixpence this form of song writing became a lifelong habit of waits following writing of midnight lullaby in which he assembled lyrics from fragments of oral tradition packaging closing times art was designed by cal schenkel schenkel s front cover art was inspired by waits own idea of how album should sound it depicts waits leaning against a bar room piano which is furnished with a shot of rye a bottle of beer cigarettes an ashtray and a small candle with a blue pool table lamp above waits head back cover art is minimal and only features a photograph of waits staring directly into camera reputedly taken after one of waits performance at troubadour both photographs were taken by ed caraeff release closing time was released worldwide by asylum in march 1973 album s lead single ol 55 was released

received positively by american music press although coverage was limited in rolling stone album was referred to as a remarkable debut album compared to randy newman and was branded a earthier version of same and delights in rummaging through attics of nostalgia persona that emerges from this remarkable debut album is waits s own at once sardonic vulnerable and emotionally charged while village voice critic robert christgau noted that with his jazz schooled piano and drawling delivery waits exploits an honest sentimentality which he undercuts just enough to be credible in 2000 it was voted number 880 in colin larkin s all time top 1000 albums album received little coverage united kingdom and elsewhere internationally with its promotion being little more than a featured advert in nme closing time did not chart upon its release although in 2000 album peaked at number 28 in irish albums chart album was certified silver in united kingdom in 2004 with shipments of over 60 000 copies and was later certified gold in 2012 with shipments of over 100 000 copies legacy alt buckley seated onstage playing guitar thumb tim buckley covered martha same year it was released william ruhlmann in a retrospective allmusic review holds album in high regard describing his lovelorn lyrics as being sentimental without being penetrating but he also has a gift for gently rolling pop melodies and his self conscious melancholy can be surprisingly moving closing time reached a wider audience through cover versions of its songs by more successful artists and have since continued to have been
