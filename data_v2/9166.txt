dominated brazilian politics for many years as emperor physically matured and became more politically astute he purged everyone linked to group aureliano coutinho as leader was completely excluded from political life result of an implicit if unspoken ban imposed by pedro ii monarch made it clear that he would no longer tolerate being influenced by political factions from february 1844 through may 1848 each of four cabinets were entirely composed of liberal party members internal divisions within liberal party impeded projects designed to modernize brazil including education reform construction of railroads and telegraph lines after resignation of last liberal cabinet pedro ii invited rival conservative party to form a new cabinet with his party no longer in control paranhos lost much of his influence liberal party was not willing to accept its loss of power most radical faction of liberals in province of pernambuco known as partido da praia party of beach openly advocated a rebellion nominally liberal praieiros were associated with courtier faction proposed rebellion would be an attempt of this branch of courtier faction to regain control of government praieiros had little support and public opinion was also against them group was unable to convince vast majority of population that a revolt would bring them any benefits on 2 february 1849 limited uprising of praieiros was completely defeated after attacking recife capital of pernambuco even though paranhos had condemned it rebellion combined with of his patron and liberal party made a

an absent friend column dealt with subjects that included politics brazilian society and day to day life in brazilian capital paranhos s articles soon began to focus on brazil s foreign policy especially argentina and uruguay s civil war don juan manuel de rosas dictator of argentina had assisted separatist rebels in brazilian province of rio grande do sul during 1830s and continued to attempt its annexation in addition to threat to brazil s territorial integrity rosas had ambitions to conquer paraguay uruguay and bolivia brazil s conservative cabinet decided to form military alliances with countries threatened by dictator on 4 september 1851 brazil s army commanded by luis alves de lima e silva then count of caxias crossed border into uruguay paranhos began to write articles in support of brazil s proactive foreign policy which brought him close to ruling conservative party minister of foreign affairs paulino soares de sousa later viscount of uruguai appointed conservative party s main leader honorio hermeto carneiro leao later marquis of parana as a special plenipotentiary diplomat for platine region unexpectedly carneiro leao decided to take paranhos as his secretary passing over more experienced members of brazil s diplomatic corps on 23 october 1851 both departed for montevideo uruguayan capital carneiro leao had a keen eye for spotting potential and paranhos who had revealed himself a very capable man during his tenure as a liberal politician in rio de janeiro province had talents which could be put to use as carneiro leao told paranhos when justifying his choice of young and inexperienced journalist i consulted no one about appointing you what influenced my mind was your merit which i prize i hope sir that you will prove i got it right paranhos was a handsome and charming man tall at with blue eyes and golden hair historian jeffrey d needell remarked that in paranhos carneiro leao had a man with marked literary skill with a military background and unusually fine technical knowledge with political instincts and proven political courage and with a clear need for a new patron with aureliano coutinho s recent eclipse that along with cool headedness outstanding oratory skills inexhaustible energy and a gifted and cultured mind made him seem ideal person for post two men arrived in montevideo for negotiations on 2 november on 21st

only intelligence and verbal ability expected but a surprisingly rapid grasp of issues and actors handling complications with elan showing a flair for decision a capacity for work an eye for details and an instinct for imposing himself that won honorio hermeto s decided approval and after some hesitation allegedly because paranhos was a novice to paulino soares s way of thinking support of

carneiro leao returned to brazil having been named brazil s diplomatic minister to uruguay paranhos time in uruguay allowed him to acquire an understanding of dynamics characterizing hispanic american nations of period intermittent crises leading to and resulting from coups government by dictators political factionalism and civil wars were commonplace among these countries a penchant for and skill in diplomacy became evident during his stay as a pleased viscount of uruguai still minister of foreign affairs noted in february 1853 in a general manner i approve of what our diplomatic representatives do however it almost always seems to me that were i in their places i would have done better but with dr paranhos that thought does not occur to me every time i read his communiques i tell myself this is precisely what i would have done or said on 6 september 1853 carneiro leao was appointed president of council of ministers and charged with organizing a new cabinet emperor pedro ii wished to advance an ambitious plan which became known as conciliation goal of conciliation was to put an end to periodic eruption of armed conflicts between political factions such as had occurred in praieira rebellion it had become usual for parties which had lost power in elections to seize back control using force conciliation aimed to strengthen role of parliament in settling country s political disputes both parties would be required to agree to rise above partisan politics and instead devote themselves to common good of nation new president invited several liberals to join conservative ranks and went so far as to name some as ministers one of these was paranhos who took foreign affairs portfolio he was still in montevideo when he learned that carneiro leao had succeeded in having him elected a general deputy in 1853 new cabinet albeit highly successful was plagued from beginning by strong opposition from conservative party members who repudiated new recruits from liberal side believing that these did not truly share party s ideals and were mainly interested in gaining public offices see despite mistrust carneiro leao demonstrated great resilience in fending off threats and overcoming obstacles and setbacks after sudden and unexpected death of carneiro leao in september 1856 his cabinet only managed to survive him by a few months emperor although critical of way conciliation had been implemented had learned to appreciate its merits and was eager that it continue pedro ii s support gave conciliation another chance and allowed paranhos to return to government once more as foreign minister on 12 december 1858 most pressing issue facing paranhos was paraguayan government s persistent refusal to allow brazilian ships access to mato grosso province at that time best and fastest way to reach that distant brazilian province was to travel via atlantic and from there up rivers which flow between nations south of brazil one of reasons for brazil s war against argentina in 1851 was to assure free passage of its ships crisis between brazil and paraguay had dragged on since paranhos s tenure as foreign minister in carneiro leao s cabinet on 12 february 1858 paranhos signed a treaty with paraguay which allowed brazilian ships unrestricted navigation of paraguayan rivers this prevented outbreak of war or at least deferred conflict until 1864

paranhos around age of 39 c 1858 ultraconservatives who opposed conciliation policy were led by viscount of itaborai eusebio de queiros and viscount of uruguai these elder statesmen were of same generation as late carneiro leao and had taken leadership of conservative party after his death although conservative in name they had repeatedly proven more progressive in many areas than their rivals liberals viscount of uruguai had been paranhos s protector since 1851 diplomatic mission and greatly influenced his protege who stood by ultraconservatives paranhos managed to persuade luis alves de lima e silva who had been commander in chief during platine war his colleague as war minister in conciliation cabinet and later duke of caxias to stay on side of conservative party s old guard during years following 1857 none of cabinets survived long they quickly collapsed due to lack of a majority in chamber of deputies conservative party had split down middle on one side were ultraconservatives and on other moderate conservatives in wake of carneiro leao s cabinet a new generation of politicians had emerged eager to acquire more power inside conservative party paranhos belonged to this younger age group these men saw their path to top ranks as being blocked by conservative elders who would not easily relinquish control remaining members of liberal party which had languished since praieira rebellion in 1849 took advantage of conservative party s apparently impending dissolution to return to national politics with renewed strength they delivered a powerful blow to government when they managed to win several seats in chamber of deputies in 1860 emperor asked marquis later duke of caxias to head a new cabinet on 2 march 1861 caxias chose paranhos as his minister of finance and interim minister of foreign affairs and he soon became marquis s right hand his influence became so great that ministry became known as caxias paranhos cabinet new government was faced with a major challenge chamber of deputies was divided into three groups ultraconservatives moderates and liberals paranhos and caxias named men who were either ultraconservatives or moderates to remaining portfolios in an attempt to weaken reinvigorated liberal opposition and consolidate a workable governing majority despite successfully recruiting enough supporters from outside party to form a government cabinet was hobbled from outset by its lack of internal unity it was doomed when paranhos s friend and former colleague in conciliation cabinet jose tomas nabuco de araujo delivered a speech advocating a merger of moderate conservatives and liberals into a truly new political party so enthusiastically well received was this speech that both groups voted together as a single cohesive faction leaving government without a majority cabinet requested that emperor dissolve chamber and call for new elections but he refused with no remaining alternative ministers resigned and on 24 may 1862 pedro ii named a member of moderate liberal coalition to form a new cabinet new political party of which majority of members were former conservatives was called progressive league new cabinet marked end of 14 years of conservative dominance in national politics defeat was not a total loss for paranhos since he was named lifetime senator for mato grosso province by emperor in november 1862 after having garnered most votes in provincial election he took office as senator on 5 march 1863 diplomat mission to paraguay in january 1858 paranhos was sent to asuncion to procure paraguayan compliance with an 1856 treaty which was supposed to give brazil right to navigate river paraguay in order to access her province of mato grosso government of paraguay had been obstructing

diplomat s uniform which he used on all occasions shone brightly with gold brocade and included a high collar with white gloves even in tropical heat such fashion was calculated to give him a larger than life presence symbolic of enormous empire he represented paraguayans were sensitive to subtleties in appearance and they understood such an image in appearance he suggested a modern european statesman a man who combined shrewdness and easy familiarity with power empire was willing paranhos stated bluntly to go to war to enforce 1856 treaty francisco solano lopez representing paraguayan

uruguay which pitted its political parties against one another see internal conflict led to murder of brazilians and looting of their uruguayan properties brazil s progressive cabinet decided to intervene and dispatched an army which invaded uruguay in december 1864 beginning brief uruguayan war see dictator of paraguay francisco solano lopez took advantage of uruguayan situation during late 1864 to establish his nation as a regional power on 11 november of that year he ordered a brazilian civilian steamship seized triggering paraguayan war then in december paraguayan army invaded brazilian province of mato grosso currently state of mato grosso do sul four months later paraguayan troops invaded argentine territory as a prelude to an attack upon brazilian province of rio grande do sul what had seemed a simple military intervention of short duration led to a full scale war in south america s southeast progressive cabinet named paranhos plenipotentiary minister his mission was to end conflict with uruguay so that brazil could focus on far more serious threat posed by paraguay he arrived in argentine capital buenos aires on 2 december 1864 paranhos signed a peace treaty with uruguayan government on 20 february 1865 ending war paranhos not only managed to bring about peace but he concurrently forged an alliance between brazil argentina and uruguayan rebels who formed uruguay s postwar government against paraguay pact would later be officially signed as treaty of triple alliance commander in chief of brazilian forces admiral joaquim marques lisboa then baron and later marquis of tamandare himself a progressive complained to brazilian cabinet of outcome engineered by paranhos by time peace treaty was concluded uruguayan capital was under siege by brazilian troops and under blockade by brazilian fleet admiral and cabinet were eager for an end to conflict which would have resulted in a conquest of enemy capital and a consequent boost in popularity of brazilian government paranhos however had preempted such an outcome as retaliation for bloodless conclusion he was fired from his post returning to brazil he defended himself in senate say whatever you want about diplomatic act of 20 february you will not be able to take away from me this grateful conviction that through that solution i saved life of 2 000 fellow compatriots and avoided destruction of an important capital nonetheless he received accolades in uruguay brazil and even argentina for his accomplishment in engineering both an end to war and formation of alliance paraguayan

conservatives and historicals former liberals all of cabinets formed by league after 1862 were short lived paraguayan invasion in 1864 led to a conflict far longer than expected increasing tensions within party by 1868 a rift had opened between marquis of caxias then commander in chief of brazilian forces in war and progressive cabinet with its credibility for prosecuting war now vanished cabinet resigned and emperor called conservatives back into power on 16 july 1868 once again paranhos who was extraordinary member of council of state since 18 august 1866 became minister of foreign affairs rise of conservative party impelled progressives and historicals to unify something they had not been able to achieve while in power progressive historical coalition was rechristened as liberal party third bloc bearing this name in brazil s history its most radical wing would declare itself republican in 1870 an ominous signal to monarchy paraguay s capital asuncion was occupied on 1 january 1869 and there was a widespread belief that war was nearing an end on 1 february 1869 paranhos departed for asuncion as plenipotentiary minister with goal of concluding a peace treaty paranhos brought along his eldest son one of nine jose maria da silva paranhos junior later baron of rio branco as his secretary their relationship would later break down due to an affair between son and a belgian actress which produced several children although couple eventually resided together they never married and no formal acknowledgement was ever made of her existence or that of his children paranhos strongly disapproved of his son s personal life which was considered scandalous by 19th century brazilian society long after his father s death and after brazil had become a republic junior paranhos would go on to a distinguished career as minister of foreign affairs he has come to be regarded as one of nation s greatest heroes due to his pivotal role in securing country s international boundaries and has been officially designated as patrono a type of patron saint of brazilian diplomacy diplomatic mission arrived in asuncion on 20 february 1869 asuncion was then a small town of unpaved streets and many buildings constructed of little more than straw with paraguayan dictator francisco solano lopez on run country lacked a government paranhos had to create a provisional government which could sign a peace accord and recognize border claimed by brazil between two nations even with paraguay devastated power vacuum resulting from lopez s overthrow was quickly filled by emerging domestic factions which paranhos had to accommodate according to historian francisco doratioto paranhos then greatest brazilian specialist on platine affairs had a decisive role in creating a democratic paraguayan government paraguay thus survived as an independent nation later on 20 june 1870 preliminary peace protocols were signed final peace treaty accepting brazilian claims was signed

him office of president of council of ministers prime minister pedro ii was maneuvering to pass a controversial bill which would immediately declare children born to slave women as free empire which rio branco was asked to govern had undergone great changes since he had begun his career in politics decades of internal peace political stability and economic prosperity had brought about a situation where everything seemed set fair for future although time would prove otherwise end of war against paraguay ushered in what is considered golden age and apogee of brazilian empire brazil s international reputation for political steadiness progressiveness and investment potential greatly improved and with exception of united states was unequalled by any other american nation economy began undergoing rapid growth and immigration flourished railroad shipping and other modernization projects were adopted with an end to slavery on horizon and other reforms projected prospects for moral and material advances seemed vast pedro ii planned a trip to europe which would result in his absence for almost a year in his place his daughter and heir isabel became regent since she was young and inexperienced rio branco could not rely on imperial intervention to help push through passage of emperor s anti slavery legislation by this time conservative elders were no more and he had risen to lead conservative party rio branco formed his cabinet on 7 march 1871 and it would last until 25 june 1875 second longest in empire s history rio branco became longest serving prime minister

about one third of deputies and which sought to organize public opinion against measure according to historian jose murilo de carvalho rio branco had to use all his extraordinary energy and leadership skills to convince deputies as there was opposition from influential members of both conservatives and liberals he delivered 21 speeches in both chamber of deputies and senate advocating approval of legislation abolition of slavery was strongly opposed by ruling circles even rio branco had earlier opposed proposal fearing its impact on national stability though after 1867 he became convinced measure was necessary legislation was only forced through chamber of deputies by repeated use of cloture to move process forward only in late august was bill finalized and forwarded to senate for consideration senate finally passed measure on 27 september 1871 isabel signed legislation on following day and it became known as law of free birth according to historian lidia besouchet at that moment no one had more popularity than rio branco anywhere in brazil articles praising him and telling story of his life and career appeared in newspapers in united states argentina united kingdom france italy portugal spain and other foreign nations to besouchet its passage was apogee of rio branco s career despite accolades law s passage had seriously damaged long term prospects of empire it split conservatives down middle one party faction backed reforms of rio branco cabinet while second known as were unrelenting in their opposition latter were ultraconservatives led by paulino jose soares de sousa jr 2nd viscount of uruguai legislation and pedro ii s support for it resulted in these ultraconservatives no longer being unconditionally loyal to monarchy conservative party had previously experienced serious division during 1850s when emperor s complete support for conciliation policy gave rise to progressives difference then was that ultraconservatives who opposed conciliation led by eusebio uruguai and itaborai perceived emperor as being indispensable to functioning of political system an ultimate and impartial arbiter when deadlock threatened this new generation of ultraconservatives unlike their predecessors had no experience of regency and early years of pedro ii s reign when external and internal dangers threatened nation s existence they had only known a stable administration and prosperity young politicians saw no reason to uphold and defend imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to nation unbeknownst to rio branco and pedro ii both had prepared path to empire s later downfall reaching beyond slavery issue cabinet advanced several measures to address calls for political and administrative reform however all of these including law of free birth were only partially effective due to various loopholes although declared freeborn children born to slave mothers were kept even after law s enactment under control of slaveowners until age twenty one it is true that unable to reproduce itself slavery would eventually disappear but status quo was preserved for at least two decades in effect as historian roderick j barman summarized it law changed everything and it changed nothing other reforms also had shortcomings police reform legislation of 1871 theoretically limited police s powers to imprison arbitrarily

majesty took opportunity to enforce advantages and excellence of a good meanwhile government had to deal with a serious and protracted crisis involving catholic church catholicism was state religion in brazil and there was a great degree of state control which had been inherited from portuguese rule this included appointment of clergy this situation led to a state of affairs where catholic clergy were seen as being understaffed undisciplined and poorly educated leading to a loss of moral authority and popular respect for church there had been a series of measures aiming to weaken authority of papacy over brazilian church including suspension of acceptance of novices into monasteries in 1856 and introduction of a right of appeal to crown over most church affairs in 1857 neither of which were accepted by rome imperial government wanted to reform church and appointed a series of well educated reforming bishops although these bishops agreed with government on need to reform they did not share pedro ii s views on subservience of church to government and tended to be influenced by which emphasised loyalty to papacy over loyalty to civil powers one of new generation of bishops was

against church ordering dom vital to rescind interdict which he refused this refusal led to bishops being tried before supreme court of justice of empire where in 1874 they were convicted and sentenced to four years of hard labor which was commuted to imprisonment without hard labor see rio branco explained in a letter written in august 1873 that he believed government could not compromise in affair since it involved principles essential to social order and to national sovereignty these actions aligned with his own views but his convictions were bolstered by emperor s identical conclusions pedro ii regarded rio branco as his favorite politician and a second in command on whom he could rely emperor played a decisive role by unequivocally backing government s actions in moving against bishops see lack of independence shown by rio branco in relation to pedro ii was strongly criticized by historian roderick j barman who believed that prime minister only enforced policies that did not displease emperor or which had his full support trial and imprisonment of two bishops was very unpopular imposition of metric system resulted in demonstrations in northeast during 1874 metric weights and measures were destroyed by peasants and land and tax records were burned movement was called quebra quilo smash kilos and did not have any lasting impact although it illustrated popular dissatisfaction and was an embarrassment to government quebra quilo riots were suspected of being condoned by priests and together with arrest of bishops drew attention to imperial government having

of a full amnesty to bishops historian heitor lyra blamed rio branco and his cabinet both bishops and primarily pedro ii for ordeal all parties involved revealed a lack of tact and their intransigence

rio branco s death was met with consternation throughout nation pedro ii considered it in his words a great loss to brazil day after his death more than 20 000 gathered in streets of rio de janeiro to witness grandiose funeral procession he was honored with eulogies and gun salutes abrupt abolition of slavery which rio branco had warned against eventually occurred eight years later this resulted in alienation of second viscount of uruguai s ultraconservative faction and powerful political interests these formed a subversive alliance with republicans and discontented military officers which led to overthrow of empire on 15 november 1889 writing at end of 19th century brazilian abolitionist leader joaquim nabuco said that rio branco was of all politicians who held office during pedro ii s reign most fitted to post of president of council of ministers nabuco considered him one of greatest statesmen of empire however he also argued that as a leader a lawmaker and a creator of doctrines there were many other politicians far better than rio branco but unlike all others who were brilliantly accomplished in one or a few skills but lacking in many others rio branco was good though unexceptional in all in other words he was a competent generalist nabuco s view was that due to rio branco s lack of first rate abilities he would not have been best leader in troubled times such as anarchy which existed during pedro ii s minority or at end of a period of chaos when strong action was needed to rebuild rio branco was however perfect choice in a time of peace and stability where his multiple skills could shine his ability exactly fit situation in brazil when he became president of council of ministers in 1871 according to historian heitor lyra rio branco was greatest politician of his time with only other at his level being marquis of parana historian jose murilo de carvalho said that he was without a doubt most complete statesman of that time ronaldo vainfas wrote that rio branco was typical modernizing conservative who implemented reforms preached by liberals thus emptying political platform of opposition historian lidia besouchet believed that he was one of monarchy s main supports and with his death along with deaths of other veteran politicians empire began to collapse a view shared by other historians see historian helio vianna considered him one of most notable statesmen of empire historian roderick j barman had a far less laudatory view toward him saying that although he had success as a minister and a diplomat and as prime minister and during pedro ii s absence rio branco had more than proved his capacities in that he did not possess as had marquis of parana character and political standing to act independently of emperor he was
