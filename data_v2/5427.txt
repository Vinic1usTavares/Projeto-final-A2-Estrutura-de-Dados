barn owl tyto alba is most widely distributed species of owl and one of most widespread of all birds it is also referred to as common barn owl to distinguish it from other species in its family tytonidae which forms one of two main lineages of living owls other being typical owls strigidae barn owl is found almost everywhere in world except polar and desert regions in asia north of himalaya most of indonesia and some pacific islands bruce 1999 pp 34 75 phylogenetic evidence shows that there are at least three major lineages of barn owl one in europe western asia and africa one in southeast asia and australasia and one in americas and some highly divergent taxa on islands accordingly some authorities split group into western barn owl for group in europe western asia and africa american barn owl for group in americas and eastern barn owl for group in southeast asia and australasia some taxonomic authorities further split group recognising up to five species and further research needs to be done to clarify position there is a considerable variation between sizes and colour of approximately 28 subspecies but most are between in length with wingspans ranging from plumage on head and back is a mottled shade of grey or brown underparts vary from white to brown and are sometimes speckled with dark markings face is characteristically heart shaped and is white in most subspecies this owl does not hoot but utters an eerie drawn out shriek barn owl is nocturnal over most of its range but in britain and some pacific islands it also hunts by day barn owls specialise in hunting animals on ground and nearly all of their food consists of small mammals which they locate by sound their hearing being very acute they usually mate for life unless one of pair is killed when a new pair bond may be formed breeding takes place at varying times of year according to locality with a clutch averaging about four eggs being laid in a nest in a hollow tree old building or fissure in a cliff female does all incubation and she and young chicks are reliant on male for food when large numbers of small prey are readily available barn owl populations can expand rapidly and globally bird is considered to be of least conservation concern some subspecies with restricted ranges are more threatened taxonomy and etymology thumb left male tyto alba alba left and

scopoli in his anni historico naturales he gave it scientific name strix alba as more species of owl were described genus name strix came to be used solely for wood owls in typical owl family strigidae and barn owl became tyto alba in barn owl family tytonidae name literally means white owl from onomatopoeic ancient greek tyto tuto for an owl compare english hooter and latin alba white

doubts about this and states that split of tyto delicatula from t alba may need to be revisited some island subspecies are occasionally treated as distinct species a move which should await further research into barn owl phylogeography according to bruce in handbook of birds of world volume 5 barn owls to hummingbirds a review of whole group is long overdue molecular analysis of mitochondrial

than any other species of owl many subspecies have been proposed over years but several are generally considered to be intergrades between more distinct populations twenty to thirty are usually recognised varying mainly in body proportions size and colour island forms are mostly smaller than mainland ones and those inhabiting forests have darker plumage and shorter wings than those occurring

range from crc handbook of avian body masses 2nd edition by john b dunning jr editor crc press 2008 in general owls living on small islands are smaller and lighter perhaps because they have a higher dependence on insect prey and need to be more manoeuvrable taylor 2004 pp 19 22 however largest bodied race of barn owl t a furcata from cuba and jamaica is also an island race albeit being found on more sizeable islands with larger prey and few larger owls competing for dietary resources shape of tail is a means of distinguishing barn owl from typical owls when seen in air other distinguishing features are undulating flight pattern and dangling feathered legs pale face with its heart shape and black eyes give flying bird a distinctive appearance like a flat mask with oversized oblique black eye slits ridge of feathers above beak somewhat resembling a nose bruce 1999 pp 34 75 svensson et al 1999 pp 212 213 bird s head and upper body typically vary between pale brown and some shade of grey especially on forehead and back in most subspecies some are purer richer brown instead and all have fine black and white speckles except on remiges and rectrices main wing and tail feathers which are light brown with darker bands heart shaped face is usually bright white but in some subspecies it is brown left ear is slightly above eyes on vertical plane whereas right ear is slightly below eyes orientation of ear coverts in relation to face also differs between ears with a difference of about 15deg underparts including lower leg feathers vary from white to reddish buff among subspecies and are either mostly unpatterned or bear a varying number of tiny blackish brown speckles it has been found that at least in continental european populations females with more spotting are healthier than plainer birds this does not hold true for european males by contrast where spotting varies according to subspecies beak varies from pale horn to dark buff corresponding to general plumage hue and iris is blackish brown feet like beak vary in colour ranging from pink to dark pinkish grey and talons are black alt barn owl in flight left thumb barn owl in flight on average within any one population males tend to have fewer spots on underside and are paler in colour than females latter are also larger with a strong female t alba of a large subspecies weighing over 550 g 19 4 oz while males are typically about 10 lighter nestlings are covered in white down but heart shaped facial disk becomes visible soon after hatching taylor 2004 p 169 contrary to popular belief barn owl does not hoot such calls are made by typical owls like tawny owl or other members of genus strix it instead produces characteristic shree scream painful to human hearing at close range in an eerie long drawn out shriek males in courtship give a shrill twitter both young and old animals produce a snake like hiss defense when disturbed other sounds produced include a purring chirrup denoting pleasure and a kee yak which resembles one of vocalisations of tawny owl when captured or cornered barn owl throws itself on its back and flails with sharp taloned feet making for an effective defence in such situations it may emit rasping sounds or clicking snaps produced probably by beak but possibly by tongue distribution barn owl is most widespread species in world occurring in every continent except antarctica its range includes all of europe except fennoscandia and malta most of africa apart from sahara indian subcontinent southeast asia australia many pacific islands and north central and south america shawyer 1994 p 10 in general it is considered to be sedentary and indeed many individuals having taken up residence in a particular location remain there even when better foraging areas nearby become vacant in british isles young seem largely to disperse along river corridors and distance travelled from their natal site averages about shawyer 1994 p 91 thumb barn owl canada with detail of wings and tail feathers in continental europe distance travelled is greater commonly somewhere between but exceptionally with ringed birds from netherlands ending up in spain and in ukraine in united states dispersal is typically over distances of with most travelled individuals ending up some from point of origin movements in african continent include from senegambia to sierra leone and up to within south africa in australia there is some migration as birds move towards northern coast in dry season and southward in wet and also nomadic movements in association with rodent plagues occasionally some of these birds turn up on norfolk island lord howe island or new zealand showing that crossing ocean is not beyond their capabilities in 2008 barn owls were recorded for first time breeding in new zealand barn owl has been successfully introduced into hawaiian island of kauai in an attempt to control rodents however it has been found to also feed on native birds behaviour and ecology thumb right upright a barn owl s talon like most owls barn owl is nocturnal relying on its acute sense of hearing when hunting in complete darkness it often becomes active shortly before dusk and can sometimes be seen during day when relocating from one roosting site to another in britain on various pacific islands and perhaps elsewhere it sometimes hunts by day this practice may depend on whether owl is mobbed by other birds if it emerges in daylight however in britain some birds continue to hunt by day even when mobbed by such birds as magpies rooks and black headed gulls such diurnal activity possibly occurring when previous night has been wet making hunting difficult by contrast in southern europe and tropics birds seem to be almost exclusively nocturnal with few birds that hunt by day being severely mobbed barn owls are not particularly territorial but have a home range inside which they forage for males in scotland this has a radius of about from nest site and an average size of about 300 hectares female home ranges largely coincide with that of their mates outside breeding season males and females usually roost separately each one having about three favoured sites in which to conceal themselves by day and which are also visited for short periods during night roosting sites include holes in trees fissures in cliffs disused buildings chimneys and and are often small in comparison to nesting sites as breeding season approaches birds move back to vicinity of chosen nest to roost taylor 2004 pp 96 107 thumb left being mobbed by brewer s blackbird in california barn owl is a bird of open country such as farmland or grassland with some interspersed woodland usually at altitudes below but occasionally as high as in tropics such as in ethiopia s degua tembien mountain range this owl prefers to hunt along edges of woods or in rough grass strips adjoining pasture it has an effortless wavering flight as it quarters ground alert to sounds made by potential prey like most owls barn owl flies silently tiny serrations on leading edges of its flight feathers and a hairlike fringe to trailing edges help to break up flow of air over wings thereby reducing turbulence and noise that accompanies it hairlike extensions to barbules of its feathers which give plumage a soft feel also minimise noise produced during wingbeats taylor 2004 pp 47 61 behaviour and ecological preferences may differ slightly even among neighbouring subspecies as shown in case of european t a guttata and t a alba that probably evolved respectively in allopatric glacial refugia in southeastern europe and in iberia or southern france ehrlich et al 1994 pp 250 254 diet and feeding thumb right skull showing powerful beak diet of barn owl has been much studied items consumed can be ascertained from identifying prey fragments in pellets of indigestible matter that bird regurgitates studies of diet have been made in most parts of bird s range and in moist temperate areas over 90 of prey tends to be small mammals whereas in hot dry unproductive areas proportion is lower and a great variety of other creatures are eaten depending on local abundance most prey is terrestrial but bats and birds are also taken as well as lizards amphibians and insects even when they are plentiful and other prey scarce earthworms do not seem to be consumed taylor 2004 pp 29 46 in north america and most of europe voles predominate in diet and shrews are second most common food choice mice and rats form main foodstuffs in mediterranean region tropics sub tropics and australia barn owls are usually more specialist feeders in productive areas and generalists in drier areas on cape verde islands geckos are mainstay of diet supplemented by birds such as plovers godwits turnstones weavers and and on a rocky islet off coast of california a clutch of four young were being reared on a diet of leach s storm petrel in ireland accidental introduction of bank vole in 1950s led to a major shift in barn owl s diet where their ranges overlap vole is now by far largest prey item locally rodent species in weight class of several grams per individual usually make up single largest proportion of prey in united states rodents and other small mammals usually make up ninety five percent of diet and worldwide over ninety percent of prey caught taylor 2004 p 29 barn owl hunts by flying slowly quartering ground and hovering over spots that may conceal prey it may also use branches fence posts or other lookouts to scan its surroundings and this is main means of prey location in oil palm plantations of malaysia bird has long broad wings enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly its legs and toes are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath snow and gives it a wide spread of talons when attacking prey studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles or their equivalent per night equivalent to about twenty three percent of bird s bodyweight excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce taylor 2004 pp 91 95 small prey is usually torn into chunks and eaten completely including bones and fur while prey larger than about 100 g 4 oz such as baby rabbits or vlei rats is usually dismembered and inedible parts discarded contrary to what is sometimes assumed barn owl does not eat domestic animals of any sort on a regular basis regionally non rodent foods are used as per availability on bird rich islands a barn owl might include some fifteen to twenty percent of birds in its diet while in grassland it will gorge itself on swarming termites or on orthoptera such as katydids jerusalem crickets or true crickets bats and even frogs lizards and snakes may make a minor but significant contribution to diet small soricomorpha like shrews may be a secondary prey of major importance barn owl has acute hearing with ears placed asymmetrically this improves detection of sound position and distance and bird does not require sight to hunt facial disc plays a part in this process as is shown by fact that with ruff feathers removed bird can still locate source in azimuth but fails to do so in elevation hunting nocturnally or this bird can target its prey and dive to ground penetrating its talons through snow grass or brush to seize small creatures with deadly accuracy compared to other owls of similar size barn owl has a much higher metabolic rate requiring relatively more food weight for weight barn owls consume more rodents often regarded as pests by humans than possibly any other creature this makes barn owl one of most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture farmers often find these owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests and they can encourage barn owl habitation by providing nest sites breeding left thumb egg collection museum wiesbaden germany barn owls living in tropical regions can breed at any time of year but some seasonality in nesting is still evident where there are distinct wet and dry seasons egg laying usually takes place during dry season with increased rodent prey becoming available to birds as vegetation dies off in arid regions such as parts of australia breeding may be irregular and may happen in wet periods triggered by temporary increases in populations of small mammals in temperate climates nesting seasons become more distinct and there are some seasons of year when no egg laying takes place in europe and north america most nesting takes place between march and june when temperatures are increasing actual dates of egg laying vary by year and by location being correlated with amount of prey rich foraging habitat around nest site and often with phase of rodent abundance cycle taylor 2004 pp 121 135 an increase in rodent populations will usually stimulate local barn owls to begin nesting thus even in cooler parts of its range two broods are often raised in a good year females are ready to breed at ten to eleven months of age although males sometimes wait till following year barn owls are usually monogamous sticking to one partner for life unless one of pair dies during non breeding season they may roost separately but as breeding season approaches they return to their established nesting site showing considerable site fidelity in colder climates in harsh weather and where winter food supplies may be scarce they may roost in farm buildings and in barns between hay bales but they then run risk that their selected nesting hole may be taken over by some other earlier nesting species single males may establish feeding territories patrolling hunting areas occasionally stopping to hover and perching on lofty eminences where they screech to attract a mate where a female has lost her mate but maintained her breeding site she usually seems to manage to attract a new spouse shawyer 1994 pp 67 87 once a pair bond has been formed male will make short flights at dusk around nesting and roosting sites and then longer circuits to establish a home range when he is later joined by female there is much chasing turning and twisting in flight and frequent screeches male s being high pitched and tremulous and female s lower and harsher at later stages of courtship male emerges at dusk climbs high into sky and then swoops back to vicinity of female at speed he then sets off to forage female meanwhile sits in an eminent position and preens returning to nest a minute or two before male arrives with food for her such feeding behaviour of female by male is common helps build pair bond and increases female s fitness before egg laying commences thumb right an owl hole in northern germany lets barn owls access attic for nesting thumb right clutch of eggs barn owls are cavity nesters they choose holes in trees fissures in cliff faces large nests of other birds such as hamerkop scopus and particularly in europe and north america old buildings such as farm sheds and church towers buildings are preferred to trees in wetter climates in british isles and provide better protection for fledglings from inclement weather trees tend to be in open habitats rather than in middle of woodland and nest holes tend to be higher in north america than in europe because of possible predation by raccoons procyon lotor no nesting material is used as such but as female sits incubating eggs she draws in dry furry material of which her regurgitated pellets are composed so that by time chicks are hatched they are surrounded by a carpet of shredded pellets oftentimes other birds such as jackdaws corvus monedula nest in same hollow tree or building and seem to live harmoniously with owls taylor 2004 pp 136 148 before commencing laying female spends much time near nest and is entirely provisioned by male meanwhile male roosts nearby and may cache any prey that is surplus to their requirements when female has reached peak weight male provides a ritual presentation of food and copulation occurs at nest female lays eggs on alternate days and clutch size averages about five eggs range two to nine eggs are chalky white somewhat elliptical and about size of bantam s eggs and incubation begins as soon as first egg is laid while she is sitting on nest male is constantly bringing more provisions and they may pile up beside female incubation period is about thirty days hatching takes place over a prolonged period and youngest chick may be several weeks younger than its oldest sibling in years with plentiful supplies of food there may be a hatching success rate of about 75 male continues to copulate with female when he brings food which makes newly hatched chicks vulnerable to injury thumb right brood prior to fledging beginning to shed their nestling down chicks are at first covered with greyish white down and develop rapidly within a week they can hold their heads up and shuffle around in nest female tears up food brought by male and distributes it to chicks initially these make a sound but this soon changes into a food demanding snore by two weeks old they are already half their adult weight and look naked as amount of down is insufficient to cover their growing bodies by three weeks old quills are starting to push through skin and chicks stand making snoring noises with wings raised and tail stumps waggling begging for food items which are now given whole male is main provider of food until all chicks are at least four weeks old at which time female begins to leave nest and starts to roost elsewhere by sixth week chicks are as big as adults but have slimmed down somewhat by ninth week when they are fully fledged and start leaving nest briefly themselves they are still dependent on parent birds until about thirteen weeks and receive training from female in finding and eventually catching prey moulting feathers become abraded over time and all birds need to replace them at intervals barn owls are particularly dependent on their ability to fly quietly and manoeuvre efficiently and in temperate areas their prolonged moult lasts through three phases over a period of two years female starts to moult while incubating eggs and brooding chicks a time when male feeds her so she does not need to fly much first primary feather to be shed is central one number 6 and it has regrown completely by time female resumes hunting feathers 4 5 7 and 8 are dropped at a similar time following year and feathers 1 2 3 9 and 10 in bird s third year of adulthood secondary and tail feathers are lost and replaced over a similar timescale again starting while incubation is taking place in case of tail two outermost tail feathers are first shed followed by two central ones other tail feathers being moulted following year shawyer 1994 pp 88 90 in temperate areas male owl moults rather later in year than female at a time when there is an abundance of food female has recommenced hunting and demands of chicks are lessening unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in year moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of female and first sign that male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at roost a consequence of moulting is loss of thermal insulation this is of little importance in tropics and barn owls here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually hot climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside breeding season taylor 2004

lice and feather mites which chew barbules of feathers and which are transferred from bird to bird by direct contact blood sucking flies such as are often present moving about among plumage internal parasites include fluke tape worm several species of parasitic round worm and spiny headed worms in genus these gut parasites are acquired when birds feed on infected prey which provide intermediate hosts for parasites there is some indication that female birds with more and larger spots have a greater resistance to external parasites this is correlated with smaller of fabricius glands associated with antibody production and a lower fecundity of blood sucking fly that attacks nestlings lifespan thumb left alt captive bird landing landing on a handler s gloved hand captive birds often live longer than wild ones unusually for such a medium sized carnivorous animal barn owl exhibits r selection producing large number of offspring with a high growth rate many of which have a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood while wild barn owls are thus decidedly short lived actual longevity of species is much higher captive individuals may reach twenty years of age or more but occasionally a wild bird reaches an advanced age american record age for a wild barn owl is eleven and a half years while a dutch bird was noted to have reached an age of seventeen years ten months another captive barn owl in england lived to be over twenty five years old taking into account such extremely long lived individuals average lifespan of barn owl is about four years and statistically two thirds to three quarters of all adults survive from one year to next however mortality is not evenly distributed throughout bird s life and only one young in three manages to live to its first breeding attempt most significant cause of death in temperate areas is likely to be starvation particularly over autumn and winter period when first year birds are still perfecting their hunting skills in northern and upland areas there is some correlation between mortality in older birds and adverse weather deep lying snow and prolonged low temperatures collision with road vehicles is another cause of mortality and may result when birds forage on mown verges some of these birds are in poor condition and may have been less able to evade oncoming vehicles than fit individuals would have been in some locations road mortality rates can be particularly high with collision rates being influenced by higher commercial average annual daily traffic roadside verges that are grass rather than shrubs and where small mammal abundance is high historically many deaths were caused by use of pesticides and this may still be case in some parts of world collisions with power lines kill some birds and shooting accounts for others especially in mediterranean regions taylor 2004 pp 203 215 status and conservation thumb left upright barn owl on lithuanian silver coin of 5 litas 2002 barn

islands which are usually assigned to nominate subspecies have declined much and here wanton destruction seems still to be significant on tenerife they seem relatively numerous but on other islands situation looks about as bleak as on fuerteventura due to their assignment to nominate subspecies which is common in mainland spain western canary islands population is not classified as threatened canary barn owl is particularly at risk and as late as 1975 hunting by fearful locals was limiting population on fuerteventura where only a few dozen pairs remain in some areas it may be an insufficiency of suitable nesting sites that is factor limiting barn owl numbers nest boxes are popular among conservationists who motivate farmers and land owners to install them for use as natural

populations suffer declines although these have many causes among them are availability of natural sites early successes among conservationists have led to widespread application of this method which has become most used form of population management barn owl accepts provided nest boxes and sometimes prefers them to natural sites when these are available surveillance a nest box can also be regarded as an animal surveillance device surveilling animals can lead to discovery of new scientific and industrial fields for example biologists and engineers can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices while social scientists document practices that cause humans to observe an animal while diet of barn owl has been studied other areas like breeding success are not well known nest boxes provide direct physical access to breeding location in switzerland a research group aims to install rfid tag readers on entrance of nest boxes thus allowing tracking of barn owl movements from nest box to nest box information about behavior of owls prior to breeding could be obtained using surveillance in united kingdom barn owl nest box scheme is promoted by world owl trust and has

conservation venture called project barn owl other research tools include using gps trackers fitted onto barn owl allowing precise location tracking of owl alternative rodent control technique in some projects use of rodenticides for biological pest control was replaced by installation of nest boxes it has been shown that use of nest boxes is less costly than traditional control with rodenticides in israel a first use for pest control was in 1983 at kibbutz sde eliyahu where pesticides were becoming a health hazard to local residents a local farmer sought after an alternative which he found in installing nest boxes in malaysia large areas of rainforest were felled to make way for oil palm plantations and with few tree cavities for breeding barn owl population with its ability to control rodent pests diminished provision of two hundred nest boxes in a trial saw almost one hundred percent occupancy and as programme expanded plantations supported one of densest barn owl populations in world similarly providing nesting boxes has increased number of barn owls in rice growing areas of malaysia where rodents do much damage to crop however although barn owl numbers have increased in both these instances it is unclear as to how effective this biological control of rats is as compared to trapping and baiting that occurred previously references bibliography further reading external
