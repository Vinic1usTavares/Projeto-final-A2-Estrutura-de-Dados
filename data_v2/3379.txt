that it was as washington post jen chaney put it heavy on holiday music and exceedingly light on plot raymund flandez of wall street journal called it a jumbled mess and buddytv john kubicek a total mess though latter also characterized it as absurdly entertaining kevin p sullivan of mtv said it was one of most confusing episodes of glee ever tv guide reviewing team of denise martin and kate stanhope described it as oddly mesmerizing hilarious and kinda weird even for glee and amy reiter of los angeles times wrote that chipper and sad were in perfect balance and kitsch factor was high several reviewers approved of black and white television special that took up half of episode indeed most of these would rather episode had consisted entirely of special ign s robert canning regretted that good stuff was bookended with inconsequential and awkward real world stories and erica futterman of rolling stone would have preferred whole episode to be show within a show atlantic kevin fallon called middle segments a love letter to judy garland specials it honored and said it was a bold move for a series with mainstream youth appeal and rae votta of billboard thought homage was a shining example of what glee can do when given leeway to be strange and different and was another who wished it could have run entire episode kubicek on other hand was left cold by utterly pointless and plotless christmas special and flandez called acting during it haphazard huffington post crystal bell said it was just as weird as it sounds but she like fallon described special as a bold move emily vanderwerff of a v club pointed out that while it was a pitch perfect parody of judy garland and star wars specials inherent problem is that originals were already pretty awful so that to be an accurate parody glee has to be awful rachel s characterization especially her christmas greed even though she is jewish was singled out for criticism in many reviews vanderwerff wrote that episode rachel being really excited about what she was going to get for christmas even though she s jewish and her end of episode shout of happy hanukah a last minute patch job to stay true to characters as they were at one time sullivan also discussed her characterization and noted that she was a character who makes a point of her jewish heritage often he added she was basically horrible and played against character entire episode so she could eventually realize that she was awful and change her ways bell criticized rachel s list of gifts such as spray tan and teeth whitening as back to square one after her nose job storyline in second season finn s contribution of a charity pig in jewish rachel s honor was deemed wrong on at least two levels by chaney a few reviewers were pleased by new friendship between rory and sam kubicek said it was officially my favorite thing from entire third season of glee and bell approved though she said writers don t know how to use rory and was disappointed that his brotherly relationship with finn had fizzled vanderwerff singled out rory s reading from bible which was as canning phrased it ripped from a charlie brown christmas when linus reads same passage as one that irks him most because it takes a perfectly beautiful little moment from a nearly perfect tv special and makes it a cutaway gag sue s sudden change of behavior in this episode caused kubicek to ask when she had become moral compass on this show and bell wondered how does ryan murphy expect us to like a character that continually changes given that whenever she seems to go in a new direction she heads back to her same glee club hating ways kubicek also made that point that while sam and quinn seemingly did right thing by choosing shelter over special others did eventually show up which muddled message music and performances thumb right upright amber riley pictured as mercedes gave an utterly joyful performance of all i want for christmas is you reviewers generally praised music in episode votta wrote that musically this episode was one of season s overall strongest though flandez made reference to humdrum holiday songs sullivan pointed out that it was about songs and only songs and kubicek felt it was a blatant attempt to sell christmas albums chaney noted that opening number all i want for christmas is you sounded much more vibrant and fresh with mercedes on lead futterman called it utterly joyful and it was favorite song of episode for martin and stanhope votta declared that amber riley shines throughout episode but none more than here where she commands attention and sullivan called it a nice rendition that was nevertheless presented with some incredibly awkward cuts from original song entertainment weekly abby west wrote that rory s crooning take of blue christmas was smooth and lovely and gave it a b and flandez agreed with in show assessment that it was mournfully beautiful futterman said that song perfectly suits his vocals but was unimpressed with rory standing awkwardly through song michael slezak of tvline noted static staging and filming of number and gave it a c and while chaney said he sang it just fine she said he didn t sell it and gave it a c rachel s rendition of river also received divergent assessments chaney and slezak both gave it an a former remarked that she knows how to make emotion in a song soar and latter said damn if she didn t sound amazing though he pointed out incongruity of rachel having just stated after rory s song that uptempo and jolly is way to go only to sing this song which is anything but vanderwerff agreed that there was no good reason for rachel to sing it and flandez called it a forgettable version futterman s conclusion was that it feels a little phoned in and doesn t emotionally connect original song for which episode is named extraordinary merry christmas received mostly decent marks from reviewers slezak gave it a b and called it fun but slight and sullivan said it was okay which is high praise for a glee original bell noted that blaine and rachel sound great together and martin and stanhope also praised their spirited performances though they said song sounded very generic kubicek was harsher and wrote that it was an embarrassingly awful original song but while votta characterized it as a weird techno jumble she also called it undeniably catchy opening number of black and white special let it snow featuring blaine and kurt garnered most praise slezak gave it an a and described it as a jazzy uptempo take on seasonal classic with gorgeous harmonies and retro dancing and said it rivaled their christmas duet from 2010 baby it s cold outside while vicki hyman of star ledger enjoyed number she preferred previous year s offering flandez called let it snow an admirable job futterman characterized it as both effortless and full of seasonal spirit and votta said it was a spot on tribute to male duets of yesteryear with that knowing undercurrent of romance even when it s not explicit chaney gave it an a but she wondered at inclusion of next song my favorite things since it technically isn t a holiday song number was also not as well received as many of others bell described it as taking a turn for worse hyman noted that it didn t do too much for me and kubicek said it seemed to drag on and on and on with no real purpose however west called it a wonderful effort and slezak wrote that a little rodgers and hammerstein is always welcome at any party both reviewers gave performance a b finn and puck s rendition of santa claus is coming to town was received tepidly votta referred to it as mildly rocking and slezak and chaney both gave it a b former said it was fun but not deeply exciting and latter called it competent but unmemorable martin and stanhope wrote that it still packs a cheesy and powerful christmas punch it was their third favorite number their second favorite was next number christmas wrapping sung by brittany which flandez described as quite good and hyman said could only have been improved by a little more mike chang dancing vanderwerff credited morris with being a gifted mimic when singing though he called performance listless and slezak who gave song an a wrote i was just bummed that song got cut short before my favorite line a p has provided me with world s smallest turkey a number of reviewers had a problem with do they know it s christmas being set in a homeless shelter both hyman and west called it an odd choice and slezak said he struggled with location chaney called lyrics condescending and found juxtaposition of singers smiling faces and phrase clanging chimes of doom to be weird song itself was given good marks hyman called it episode s best performance because they each brought something special to it and futterman said that new directions channels emotion of original for a fitting vocal cap to night both slezak and west gave it a b and former declared that they sang bejeezus out of it chart history of eight cover versions and one original song that were released as singles one cover debuted on us and canadian top 100 charts do they know it s christmas
