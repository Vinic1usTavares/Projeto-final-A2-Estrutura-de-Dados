thumb right some traditional tools of botanical science history of botany examines human effort to understand life on earth by tracing historical development of discipline of botany that part of natural science dealing with organisms traditionally treated as plants rudimentary botanical science began with empirically based plant lore passed from generation to generation in oral traditions of paleolithic hunter gatherers first written records of plants were made in neolithic revolution about 10 000 years ago as writing was developed in settled agricultural communities where plants and animals were first domesticated first writings that show human curiosity about plants themselves rather than uses that could be made of them appears in teachings of aristotle s student theophrastus at lyceum in ancient athens in about 350 bc this is considered starting point for modern botany in europe this early botanical science was soon overshadowed by a medieval preoccupation with medicinal properties of plants that lasted more than 1000 years during this time medicinal works of classical antiquity were reproduced in manuscripts and books called herbals in china and arab world greco roman work on medicinal plants was preserved and extended in europe renaissance of 14th 17th centuries heralded a scientific revival during which botany gradually emerged from natural history as an independent science distinct from medicine and agriculture herbals were replaced by floras books that described native plants of local regions invention of microscope stimulated study of plant anatomy and first carefully designed experiments in plant physiology were performed with expansion of trade and exploration beyond europe many new plants being discovered were subjected to an increasingly rigorous process of naming description and classification progressively more sophisticated scientific technology has aided development of contemporary botanical offshoots in plant sciences ranging from applied fields of economic botany notably agriculture horticulture and forestry to detailed examination of structure and function of plants and their interaction with environment over many scales from large scale global significance of vegetation and plant communities biogeography and ecology through to small scale of subjects like cell theory molecular biology and plant biochemistry introduction botany greek grass fodder medieval latin herb plant and zoology are historically core disciplines of biology whose history is closely associated with natural sciences chemistry physics and geology a distinction can be made between botanical science in a pure sense as study of plants themselves and botany as applied science which studies human use of plants early natural history divided pure botany into three main streams morphology classification anatomy and physiology that is external form internal structure and functional operation most obvious topics in applied botany are horticulture forestry and agriculture although there are many others like weed science plant pathology floristry economic botany and ethnobotany which lie outside modern courses in botany since origin of botanical science there has been a progressive increase in scope of subject as technology has opened up new techniques and areas of study modern molecular systematics for example entails principles and techniques of taxonomy molecular biology computer science and more within botany there are a number of sub disciplines that focus on particular plant groups each with their own range of related studies anatomy morphology etc included here are phycology algae ferns mosses and liverworts and fossil plants and their histories are treated elsewhere see side bar to this list can be added mycology study of fungi which were once treated as plants but are now ranked as a unique kingdom ancient knowledge nomadic hunter gatherer societies passed on by oral tradition what they knew their empirical observations about different kinds of plants that they used for food shelter poisons medicines for ceremonies and rituals etc uses of plants by these pre literate societies influenced way plants were named and classified their uses were embedded in folk taxonomies way they were grouped according to use in everyday communication nomadic life style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around world during neolithic revolution which extended from about 10 000 to 2500 years ago depending on region with these communities came development of technology and skills needed for domestication of plants and animals and emergence of written word provided evidence for passing of systematic knowledge and culture from one generation to next plant lore and plant selection thumb left a sumerian harvester s sickle dated to 3000 bc during neolithic revolution plant knowledge increased most obviously through use of plants for food and medicine all of today s staple foods were domesticated in prehistoric times as a gradual process of selection of higher yielding varieties took place possibly unknowingly over hundreds to thousands of years legumes were cultivated on all continents but cereals made up most of regular diet rice in east asia wheat and barley in middle east and maize in central and south america by greco roman times popular food plants of today including grapes apples figs and olives were being listed as named varieties in early manuscripts botanical authority william stearn has observed that cultivated plants are mankind s most vital and precious heritage from remote antiquity it is also from neolithic in about 3000 bc that we glimpse first known illustrations of plants and read descriptions of impressive gardens in egypt however first pre scientific written record of plants did not begin with food it was born out of medicinal literature of egypt china mesopotamia and india botanical historian alan morton notes that agriculture was occupation of poor and uneducated while medicine was realm of socially influential shamans priests apothecaries magicians and physicians who were more likely to record their knowledge for posterity early botany ancient india an early example of ancient indian plant classification is found in rigveda a collection of vedic sanskrit hymns from about 3700 3100 bp plants are divided into trees herbs useful to humans and creepers with further subdivisions sacred hindu text atharvaveda divides plants into eight classes spreading branches leaves with long clusters bushy plants which expands those with growth creeping plants with many stalks and plants with knotty joints taittiriya samhita classifies plant kingdom into and trees shrubs with spreading branches herbs spreading plant climber bushy plant creeper and spreading on ground other examples of early indian taxonomy include law book of hindus which classifies plants into eight major categories elaborate taxonomies also occur in charaka samhita sushruta samhita and ancient china in ancient china lists of different plants and herb concoctions for pharmaceutical purposes date back to at least time of warring states 481 bc 221 bc many chinese writers over centuries contributed to written knowledge of herbal han dynasty 202 bc 220 ad includes notable work of huangdi and famous pharmacologist zhang zhongjing there were also 11th century scientists and statesmen su song and shen kuo who compiled learned treatises on natural history emphasising herbal medicine theophrastus and origin of botanical science thumb left 600px school of athens fresco in apostolic palace rome vatican city by raphael 1509 1510 ancient athens of 6th century bc was busy trade centre at confluence of egyptian mesopotamian and minoan cultures at height of greek colonisation of mediterranean philosophical thought of this period ranged freely through many subjects empedocles 490 430 bc foreshadowed darwinian evolutionary theory in a crude formulation of mutability of species and natural selection physician hippocrates 460 370 bc avoided prevailing superstition of his day and approached healing by close observation and test of experience at this time a genuine non anthropocentric curiosity about plants emerged major works written about plants extended beyond description of their medicinal uses to topics of plant geography morphology physiology nutrition growth and reproduction foremost among scholars studying botany was theophrastus of greek c 371 287 bc who has been frequently referred to as father of botany he was a student and close friend of aristotle 384 322 bc and succeeded him as head of lyceum an educational establishment like a modern university in athens with its tradition of peripatetic philosophy aristotle s special treatise on plants is now lost although there are many botanical observations scattered throughout his other writings these have been assembled by christian wimmer in 1836 but they give little insight into his botanical thinking vines in lyceum prided itself in a tradition of systematic observation of causal connections critical experiment and rational theorizing theophrastus challenged superstitious medicine employed by physicians of his day called and also control over medicine exerted by priestly authority and tradition together with aristotle he had tutored alexander great whose military conquests were carried out with all scientific resources of day lyceum garden probably containing many botanical trophies collected during his campaigns as well as other explorations in distant lands it was in this garden where he gained much of his plant knowledge thumb 150px right statue of theophrastus 371 287 bc father of botany palermo botanic gardens theophrastus s major botanical works were enquiry into plants historia plantarum and causes of plants plantarum which were his lecture notes for lyceum opening sentence of enquiry reads like a botanical manifesto we must consider distinctive characters and general nature of plants from point of view of their morphology their behaviour under external conditions their mode of generation and whole course of their life enquiry is 9 books of applied botany dealing with forms and classification of plants and economic botany examining techniques of agriculture relationship of crops to soil climate water and habitat and horticulture he described some 500 plants in detail often including descriptions of habitat and geographic distribution and he recognised some plant groups that can be recognised as modern day plant families some names he used like crataegus daucus and asparagus have persisted until today his second book causes of plants covers plant growth and reproduction akin to modern physiology like aristotle he grouped plants into trees shrubs and herbs but he also made several other important botanical distinctions and observations he noted that plants could be annuals perennials and biennials they were also either monocotyledons or dicotyledons and he also noticed difference between determinate and indeterminate growth and details of floral structure including degree of fusion of petals position of ovary and more these lecture notes of theophrastus comprise first clear exposition of rudiments of plant anatomy physiology morphology and ecology presented in a way that would not be matched for another eighteen centuries meanwhile study of medicinal plants was not being neglected and a full synthesis of ancient greek pharmacology was compiled in materia medica c 60 ad by pedanius dioscorides c 40 90 ad who was a greek physician with roman army this work proved to be definitive text on medicinal herbs both oriental and occidental for fifteen hundred years until dawn of european renaissance being slavishly copied again and again throughout this period though rich in medicinal information with descriptions of about 600 medicinal herbs botanical content of work was extremely limited ancient rome romans contributed little to foundations of botanical science laid by ancient greeks but made a sound contribution to our knowledge of applied botany as agriculture in works titled four roman writers contributed to a compendium scriptores rei rusticae published from renaissance on which set out principles and practice of agriculture these authors were cato 234 149 bc varro 116 27 bc and in particular columella 4 70 ad and palladius 4th century ad roman encyclopaedist pliny elder 23 79 ad deals with plants in books 12 to 26 of his 37 volume highly influential work in which he frequently quotes theophrastus but with a lack of botanical insight although he does nevertheless draw a distinction between true botany on one hand and farming and medicine on other it is estimated that at time of roman empire between 1300 and 1400 plants had been recorded in west medieval knowledge medicinal plants of early middle ages thumb left 200px an arabic copy of avicenna s canon of medicine dated 1593 in western europe after theophrastus botany passed through a bleak period of 1800 years when little progress was made and indeed many of early insights were lost as europe entered middle ages 5th to 15th centuries a period of disorganised feudalism and indifference to learning china india and arab world enjoyed a golden age chinese philosophy had followed a similar path to that of ancient greeks chinese dictionary encyclopaedia erh ya probably dates from about 300 bc and describes about 334 plants classed as trees or shrubs each with a common name and illustration between 100 and 1700 ad many new works on pharmaceutical botany were produced including encyclopaedic accounts and treatises compiled for chinese imperial court these were free of superstition and myth with carefully researched descriptions and nomenclature they included cultivation information and notes on economic and medicinal uses and even elaborate monographs on ornamental plants but there was no experimental method and no analysis of plant sexual system nutrition or anatomy 400 year period from 9th to 13th centuries ad was islamic renaissance a time when islamic culture and science thrived greco roman texts were preserved copied and extended although new texts always emphasised medicinal aspects of plants kurdish biologist abu ahmad ibn dawud dinawari 828 896 ad is known as founder of arabic botany his kitab al nabat book of plants describes 637 species discussing plant development from germination to senescence and including details of flowers and fruits philosopher and physician ibn sina avicenna c 980 1037 ad was another influential figure his canon of medicine being a landmark in history of medicine treasured until enlightenment in india simple artificial plant classification systems of rigveda atharvaveda and taittiriya samhita became more botanical with work of c 400 c 500 ad author of science of life of trees he made close observations of cells and leaves and divided plants into dicotyledons and monocotyledons dicotyledons were further classified into groupings ganas akin to modern floral families fabaceae cruciferae apocynaceae and asteraceae important medieval indian works of plant physiology include of of dharmottara of and of silk road following fall of constantinople 1453 newly expanded ottoman empire welcomed european embassies in its capital which in turn became sources of plants from those regions to east which traded with empire in following century twenty times as many plants entered europe along silk road as had been transported in previous two thousand years mainly as bulbs others were acquired primarily for their alleged medicinal value initially italy benefited from this new knowledge especially venice which traded extensively with east from there these new plants rapidly spread to rest of western europe by middle of sixteenth century there was already a flourishing export trade of various bulbs from turkey to europe age of herbals thumb 170px right dioscorides de materia medica byzantium 15th century in european middle ages of 15th and 16th centuries lives of european citizens were based around agriculture but when printing arrived with movable type and woodcut illustrations it was not treatises on agriculture that were published but lists of medicinal plants with descriptions of their properties or virtues these first plant books known as herbals showed that botany was still a part of medicine as it had been for most of ancient history authors of herbals were often curators of university gardens and most herbals were derivative compilations of classic texts especially de materia medica however need for accurate and detailed plant descriptions meant that some herbals were more botanical than medicinal german otto s 1464 1534 icones 1530 contained descriptions of about 47 species new to science combined with accurate illustrations his fellow countryman hieronymus bock s 1498 1554 of 1539 described plants he found in nearby woods and fields and these were illustrated in 1546 edition however it was valerius cordus 1515 1544 who pioneered formal botanical description that detailed both flowers and fruits some anatomy including number of chambers in ovary and type of ovule placentation he also made observations on pollen and distinguished between inflorescence types his five volume historia plantarum was published about 18 years after his early death aged 29 in 1561 1563 in holland rembert dodoens 1517 1585 in stirpium historiae 1583 included descriptions of many new species from netherlands in a scientific arrangement and in england william turner 1515 1568 in his libellus de re herbaria novus 1538 published names descriptions and localities of many native british plants herbals contributed to botany by setting in train science of plant description classification and botanical illustration up to 17th century botany and medicine were one and same but those books emphasising medicinal aspects eventually omitted plant lore to become modern pharmacopoeias those that omitted medicine became more botanical and evolved into modern compilations of plant descriptions we call floras these were often backed by specimens deposited in a herbarium which was a collection of dried plants that verified plant descriptions given in floras transition from herbal to flora marked final separation of botany from medicine in renaissance and age of enlightenment 1550 1800 revival of learning during european renaissance renewed interest in plants church feudal aristocracy and an increasingly influential merchant class that supported science and arts now jostled in a world of increasing trade sea voyages of exploration returned botanical treasures to large public private and newly established botanic gardens and introduced an eager population to novel crops drugs and spices from asia east indies and new world number of scientific publications increased in england for example scientific communication and causes were facilitated by learned societies like royal society founded in 1660 and linnaean society founded in 1788 there was also support and activities of botanical institutions like jardin du roi in paris chelsea physic garden royal botanic gardens kew and oxford and cambridge botanic gardens as well as influence of renowned private gardens and wealthy entrepreneurial nurserymen by early 17th century number of plants described in europe had risen to about 6000 18th century enlightenment values of reason and science coupled with new voyages to distant lands instigating another phase of encyclopaedic plant identification nomenclature description and illustration flower painting possibly at its best in this period of history plant trophies from distant lands decorated gardens of europe s powerful and wealthy in a period of enthusiasm for natural history especially botany a preoccupation sometimes referred to as that is never likely to recur often such exotic new plant imports primarily from turkey when they first appeared in print in english lacked common names in language during 18th century botany was one of few sciences considered appropriate for genteel educated women around 1760 with popularization of linnaean system botany became much more widespread among educated women who painted plants attended classes on plant classification and collected herbarium specimens although emphasis was on healing properties of plants rather than plant reproduction which had overtones of sexuality women began publishing on botanical topics and children s books on botany appeared by authors like charlotte turner smith cultural authorities argued that education through botany created culturally and scientifically aware citizens part of thrust for improvement that characterised enlightenment however in early 19th century with recognition of botany as an official science women were again excluded from discipline botanical gardens and herbaria thumb a 16th century print of botanical garden of padova garden of simples oldest academic botanic garden that is still in its original location thumb preparing a herbarium specimen public and private gardens have always been strongly associated with historical unfolding of botanical science early botanical gardens were physic gardens repositories for medicinal plants described in herbals as they were generally associated with universities or other academic institutions plants were also used for study directors of these gardens were eminent physicians with an educational role as scientific gardeners and it was staff of these institutions that produced many of published herbals botanical gardens of modern tradition were established in northern italy first being at pisa 1544 founded by luca ghini 1490 1556 although part of a medical faculty first chair of essentially a chair in botany was established in padua in 1533 then in 1534 ghini became reader in at bologna university where aldrovandi established a similar garden in 1568 see below collections of pressed and dried specimens were called a garden of dry plants and first accumulation of plants in this way including use of a plant press is attributed to ghini buildings called herbaria housed these specimens mounted on card with descriptive labels stored in cupboards in systematic order they could be preserved in perpetuity and easily transferred or exchanged with other institutions a taxonomic procedure that is still used today by 18th century physic gardens had been transformed into order beds that demonstrated classification systems that were being devised by botanists of day but they also had to accommodate influx of curious beautiful and new plants pouring in from voyages of exploration that were associated with european colonial expansion from herbal to flora plant classification systems of 17th and 18th centuries now related plants to one another and not to man marking a return to non anthropocentric botanical science promoted by theophrastus over 1500 years before in england various herbals in either latin or english were mainly compilations and translations of continental european works of limited relevance to british isles this included rather unreliable work of gerard 1597 first systematic attempt to collect information on british plants was that of thomas johnson 1629 who was later to issue his own revision of gerard s work 1633 1636 however johnson was not first apothecary or physician to organise botanical expeditions to their local flora in italy ulysse aldrovandi 1522 1605 organised an expedition to sibylline mountains in umbria in 1557 and compiled a local flora he then began to disseminate his findings amongst other european scholars forming an early network of knowledge sharing molti amici in molti many friends in many places including charles de l clusius 1526 1609 at montpellier and jean de brancion at malines between them they started developing latin names for plants in addition to their common names exchange of information and specimens between scholars was often associated with founding of botanical gardens above and to this end aldrovandi founded one of earliest at his university in bologna orto botanico di bologna in 1568 in france clusius journeyed throughout most of western europe making discoveries in vegetable kingdom along way he compiled flora of spain 1576 and austria and hungary 1583 he was first to propose dividing plants into classes meanwhile in switzerland from 1554 conrad gessner 1516 1565 made regular explorations of swiss alps from his native zurich and discovered many new plants he proposed that there were groups or genera of plants he said that each genus was composed of many species and that these were defined by similar flowers and fruits this principle of organization laid groundwork for future botanists he wrote his important historia plantarum shortly before his death at malines in flanders he established and maintained botanical gardens of jean de brancion from 1568 to 1573 and first encountered tulips this approach coupled with new linnaean system of binomial nomenclature resulted in plant encyclopaedias without medicinal information called floras that meticulously described and illustrated plants growing in particular regions 17th century also marked beginning of experimental botany and application of a rigorous scientific method while improvements in microscope launched new discipline of plant anatomy whose foundations laid by careful observations of englishman nehemiah in and italian marcello malpighi would last for 150 years botanical exploration more new lands were opening up to european colonial powers botanical riches being returned to european botanists for description this was a romantic era of botanical explorers intrepid plant hunters and gardener

exploration was accumulating in gardens and herbaria and it needed to be systematically catalogued this was task of taxonomists plant classifiers plant classifications have changed over time from artificial systems based on general habit and form to pre evolutionary natural systems expressing similarity using one to many characters leading to post evolutionary natural systems that use characters to infer evolutionary relationships italian physician andrea caesalpino 1519 1603 studied medicine and taught botany at university of pisa for about 40 years eventually becoming director of botanic garden of pisa from 1554 to 1558 his sixteen volume de plantis 1583 described 1500 plants and his herbarium of 260 pages and 768 mounted specimens still remains caesalpino proposed classes based largely on detailed structure of flowers and fruit he also applied concept of genus he was first to try and derive principles of natural classification reflecting overall similarities between plants and he produced a classification scheme well in advance of its day gaspard 1560 1624 produced two influential publications 1620 and 1623 these brought order to 6000 species now described and in latter he used binomials and synonyms that may well have influenced linnaeus s thinking he also insisted that taxonomy should be based on natural affinities 150px thumb right cover page of species plantarum of carl linnaeus published in 1753 to sharpen precision of description and classification joachim jung 1587 1657 compiled a much needed botanical terminology which has stood test of time english botanist john ray 1623 1705 built on jung s work to establish most elaborate and insightful classification system of day his observations started with local plants of cambridge where he lived with 1860 which later expanded to his essentially first british flora although his 1682 1688 1704 provided a step towards a world flora as he included more and more plants from his travels first on continent and then beyond he extended caesalpino s natural system with a more precise definition of higher classification levels deriving many modern families in process and asserted that all parts of plants were important in classification he recognised that variation arises from both internal genotypic and external environmental phenotypic causes and that only former was of taxonomic significance he was also among first experimental physiologists can be regarded as first botanical synthesis and textbook for modern botany according to botanical historian alan morton ray influenced both theory and practice of botany more decisively than any other single person in latter half of seventeenth century ray s family system was later extended by pierre magnol 1638 1715 and joseph de tournefort 1656 1708 a student of magnol achieved notoriety for his botanical expeditions his emphasis on floral characters in classification and for reviving idea of genus as basic unit of classification above all it was swedish carl linnaeus 1707 1778 who eased task of plant cataloguing he adopted a sexual system of classification using stamens and pistils as important characters among his most important publications were systema naturae 1735 genera plantarum 1737 and philosophia botanica 1751 but it was in his species plantarum 1753 that he gave every species a binomial thus setting path for future accepted method of designating names of all organisms linnaean thought and books dominated world of taxonomy for nearly a century his sexual system was later elaborated by bernard de jussieu 1699 1777 whose nephew antoine laurent de jussieu 1748 1836 extended it yet again to include about 100 orders present day families frenchman michel adanson 1727 1806 in his 1763 1764 apart from extending current system of family names emphasized that a natural classification must be based on a consideration of all characters even though these may later be given different emphasis according to their diagnostic value for particular plant group adanson s method has in essence been followed to this day 18th century plant taxonomy bequeathed to 19th century a precise binomial nomenclature and botanical terminology a system of classification based on natural affinities and a clear idea of ranks of family genus and species although taxa to be placed within these ranks remains as always subject of taxonomic research anatomy thumb right 125px robert hooke s microscope which he described in 1665 he coined biological use of term cell in first half of 18th century botany was beginning to move beyond descriptive science into experimental science although microscope was invented in 1590 it was only in late 17th century that lens grinding by antony van leeuwenhoek provided resolution needed to make major discoveries important general biological observations were made by robert hooke 1635 1703 but foundations of plant anatomy were laid by italian marcello malpighi 1628 1694 of university of bologna in his 1675 and royal society englishman nehemiah grew 1628 1711 in his anatomy of plants begun 1671 and anatomy of plants 1682 these botanists explored what is now called developmental anatomy and morphology by carefully observing describing and drawing developmental transition from seed to mature plant recording stem and wood formation this work included discovery and naming of parenchyma and stomata physiology in plant physiology research interest was focused on movement of sap and absorption of substances through roots jan helmont 1577 1644 by experimental observation and calculation noted that increase in weight of a growing plant cannot be derived purely from soil and concluded it must relate to water uptake englishman stephen in 1677 1761 established by quantitative experiment that there is uptake of water by plants and a loss of water by transpiration and that this is influenced by environmental conditions he distinguished root pressure leaf suction and and also noted that major direction of sap flow in woody tissue is upward his results were published in vegetable 1727 he also noted that air makes a very considerable part of substance of vegetables english chemist joseph priestley 1733 1804 is noted for his discovery of oxygen as now called and its production by plants later jan 1730 1799 observed that only in sunlight do green parts of plants absorb air and release oxygen this being more rapid in bright sunlight while at night air co2 is released from all parts his results were published in experiments upon vegetables 1779 and with this foundations for 20th century studies of carbon fixation were laid from his observations he sketched cycle of carbon in nature even though composition of carbon dioxide was yet to be resolved studies in plant nutrition had also progressed in 1804 nicolas theodore de saussure s 1767 1845 was an exemplary study of scientific exactitude that demonstrated similarity of respiration in both plants and animals that fixation of carbon dioxide includes water and that just minute amounts of salts and nutrients which he analysed in chemical detail from plant ash have a powerful influence on plant growth plant sexuality thumb 350px left diagram showing sexual parts of a mature flower it was rudolf camerarius 1665 1721 who was first to establish plant sexuality conclusively by experiment he declared in a letter to a colleague dated 1694 and titled that no ovules of plants could ever develop into seeds from female style and ovary without first being prepared by pollen from stamens male sexual organs of plant much was learned about plant sexuality by unravelling reproductive mechanisms of mosses liverworts and algae in his of 1851 wilhelm hofmeister 1824 1877 starting with ferns and bryophytes demonstrated that process of sexual reproduction in plants entails an alternation of generations between sporophytes and gametophytes this initiated new field of comparative morphology which largely through combined work of william farlow 1844 1919 nathanael 1823 1894 frederick bower eduard strasburger and others established that an alternation of generations occurs throughout plant kingdom some time later german academic and natural historian joseph 1733 1806 extended this work by noting function of nectar in attracting pollinators and role of wind and insects in pollination he also produced deliberate hybrids observed microscopic structure of pollen grains and how transfer of matter from pollen to ovary inducing formation of embryo thumb right angiosperm flowering plant life cycle showing alternation of hundred years after camerarius in 1793 christian sprengel 1750 1816 broadened understanding of flowers by describing role of nectar guides in pollination adaptive floral mechanisms used for pollination and prevalence of cross pollination even though male and female parts are usually together on same flower nineteenth century foundations of modern botany in about mid 19th century scientific communication changed until this time ideas were largely exchanged by reading works of authoritative individuals who dominated in their field these were often wealthy and influential gentlemen scientists now research was reported by publication of papers that emanated from research schools that promoted questioning of conventional wisdom this process had started in late 18th century when specialist journals began to appear even so botany was greatly stimulated by appearance of first modern textbook matthias schleiden s 1804 1881 published in english in 1849 as principles of scientific botany by 1850 an invigorated organic chemistry had revealed structure of many plant constituents although great era of plant classification had now passed work of description continued augustin de candolle 1778 1841 succeeded antoine laurent de jussieu in managing botanical project 1824 1841 which involved 35 authors it contained all dicotyledons known in his day some species in 161 families and he doubled number of recognized plant families work being completed by his son alphonse 1806 1893 in years from 1841 to 1873 plant geography and ecology thumb right 140px alexander von humboldt 1769 1859 painted by joseph in 1843 opening of 19th century was marked by an increase in interest in connection between climate and plant distribution carl willdenow 1765 1812 examined connection between seed dispersal and distribution nature of plant associations and impact of geological history he noticed similarities between floras of n america and n asia cape and australia and he explored ideas of centre of diversity and centre of origin german alexander von humboldt 1769 1859 and frenchman aime bonpland 1773 1858 published a massive and highly influential 30 volume work on their travels robert brown 1773 1852 noted similarities between floras of s africa australia and india while joakim 1789 1852 explored more deeply than anyone else influence on plant distribution of temperature soil factors especially soil water and light work that was continued by alphonse de candolle 1806 1893 joseph hooker 1817 1911 pushed boundaries of floristic studies with his work on antarctica india and middle east with special attention to endemism august 1814 1879 in 1872 examined physiognomy in relation to climate and in america geographic studies were pioneered by asa gray 1810 1888 physiological plant geography perhaps more familiarly termed ecology emerged from floristic biogeography in late 19th century as environmental influences on plants received greater recognition early work in this area was synthesised by danish professor eugenius warming 1841 1924 in his book ecology of plants generally taken to mark beginning of modern ecology including new ideas on plant communities their adaptations and environmental influences this was followed by another grand synthesis of andreas schimper 1856 1901 in 1898 published in english in 1903 as plant geography upon a physiological basis translated by w r fischer oxford clarendon press 839 pp anatomy thumb 180px left plant cells with visible chloroplasts during 19th century german scientists led way towards

1812 in which he describes techniques for separating cells from middle lamella he identified vascular and parenchymatous tissues described vascular bundles observed cells in cambium and interpreted tree rings he found that stomata were composed of pairs of cells rather than a single cell with a hole anatomical studies on stele were consolidated by carl 1832 1891 who described secondary tissues and meristem including cambium and its action hugo von mohl 1805 1872 summarized work in anatomy leading up to 1850 in 1851 but this work was later eclipsed by encyclopaedic comparative anatomy of heinrich anton de bary in 1877 an overview of knowledge of stele in root and stem was completed by van 1839 1914 and of meristem by karl nageli 1817 1891 studies had also begun on origins of carpel and flower that continue to present day water relations riddle of water and nutrient transport through plant remained physiologist von mohl explored solute transport and theory of water uptake by roots using concepts of cohesion pull and root pressure german dominance in field of physiology was underlined by publication of definitive textbook on plant physiology synthesising work of this period sach s e of 1882 there were however some advances elsewhere such as early exploration of effect of gravity on growth by englishman thomas knight and discovery and naming of osmosis by frenchman henri 1776 1847 cytology cell nucleus was discovered by robert brown in 1831 demonstration of cellular composition of all organisms with each cell possessing all characteristics of life is attributed to combined efforts of botanist matthias schleiden and zoologist theodor schwann 1810 1882 in early 19th century although moldenhawer had already shown that plants were wholly cellular with each cell having its own wall and julius von sachs had shown continuity protoplasm between cell walls from 1870 to 1880 it became clear that cell nuclei are never formed anew but always derived from substance of another nucleus in 1882 flemming observed longitudinal splitting of chromosomes in dividing nucleus and concluded that each daughter nucleus received half of each of chromosomes of mother nucleus then by early 20th century it was found that number of chromosomes in a given species is constant with genetic continuity confirmed and finding by eduard strasburger that nuclei of reproductive cells in pollen and embryo have a reducing division halving of chromosomes now known as meiosis field of heredity was opened up by 1926 thomas morgan was able to outline a theory of gene and its structure and function form and function of plastids received similar attention association with starch being noted at an early date with observation of cellular structure of all organisms and process of cell division and continuity of genetic material analysis of structure of protoplasm and cell wall as well as that of plastids and vacuoles what is now known as cytology or cell theory became firmly established later cytological basis of gene chromosome theory of heredity extended from about 1900 1944 and was initiated by rediscovery of gregor mendel s 1822 1884 laws of plant heredity first published in 1866 in experiments on plant hybridization and based on cultivated pea pisum sativum this heralded opening up of plant genetics cytological basis for gene chromosome theory was explored through role of polyploidy and hybridization in speciation and it was becoming better understood that interbreeding populations were unit of adaptive change in biology developmental morphology and evolution until 1860s it was believed that species had remained unchanged through time each biological form was result of an independent act of creation and therefore absolutely distinct and immutable but hard reality of geological formations and strange fossils needed scientific explanation charles darwin s origin of species 1859 replaced assumption of constancy with theory of descent with modification phylogeny became a new principle as natural classifications became classifications reflecting not just similarities but evolutionary relationships wilhelm hofmeister established that there was a similar pattern of organization in all plants expressed through alternation of generations and extensive homology of structures polymath german intellect johann goethe 1749 1832 had interests and influence that extended into botany in 1790 he provided a theory of plant morphology he coined word morphology and he included within his concept of metamorphosis modification during evolution thus linking comparative morphology with phylogeny though botanical basis of his work has been challenged there is no doubt that he prompted discussion and research on origin and function of floral parts his theory probably stimulated opposing views of german botanists alexander braun 1805 1877 and matthias schleiden who applied experimental method to principles of growth and form that were later extended by augustin de candolle 1778 1841 carbon fixation photosynthesis thumb right 150px photosynthesis splits water to liberate o2 and fixes co2 into sugar at start of 19th century idea that plants could synthesise almost all their tissues from atmospheric gases had not yet emerged energy component of photosynthesis capture and storage of sun s radiant energy in carbon bonds a process on which all life depends was first elucidated in 1847 by mayer but details of how this was done would take many more years chlorophyll was named in 1818 and its chemistry gradually determined to be finally resolved in early 20th century mechanism of photosynthesis remained a mystery until mid 19th century when sachs in 1862 noted that starch was formed in green cells only in presence of light and in 1882 he confirmed carbohydrates as starting point for all other organic compounds in plants connection between pigment chlorophyll and starch production was finally made in 1864 but tracing precise biochemical pathway of starch formation did not begin until about 1915 nitrogen fixation significant discoveries relating to nitrogen assimilation and metabolism including nitrification and nitrogen fixation uptake of atmospheric nitrogen by symbiotic soil microorganisms had to wait for advances in chemistry and bacteriology in late 19th century and this was followed in early 20th century by elucidation of protein and amino acid synthesis and their role in plant metabolism with this knowledge it was then possible to outline global nitrogen cycle twentieth century right thumb 80px thin layer chromatography is used to separate components of chlorophyll 20th century science grew out of solid foundations laid by breadth of vision and detailed experimental observations of 19th century a vastly increased research force was now rapidly extending horizons of botanical knowledge at all levels of plant organization from molecules to global plant ecology there was now an awareness of unity of biological structure and function at cellular and biochemical levels of organisation botanical advance was closely associated with advances in physics and chemistry with greatest advances in 20th century mainly relating to penetration of molecular organization however at level of plant communities it would take until mid century to consolidate work on ecology and population genetics by 1910 experiments using labelled isotopes were being used to elucidate plant biochemical pathways to open line of research leading to gene technology on a more practical level research funding was now becoming available from agriculture and industry molecules in 1903 a and b were separated by thin layer chromatography then through 1920s and 1930s biochemists notably hans krebs 1900 1981 and carl 1896 1984 and gerty cori 1896 1957 began tracing out central metabolic pathways of life between 1930s and 1950s it was determined that atp located in mitochondria was source of cellular chemical energy and constituent reactions of photosynthesis were progressively revealed then in 1944 dna was extracted for first time along with these revelations there was discovery of plant hormones or growth substances notably auxins 1934 1934 and 1964 and effects of photoperiodism control of plant processes especially flowering by relative lengths of day and night following establishment of mendel s laws gene chromosome theory of heredity was confirmed by work of august weismann who identified chromosomes as hereditary material also in observing halving of chromosome number in germ cells he anticipated work to follow on details of meiosis complex process of redistribution of hereditary material that occurs in germ cells in 1920s and 1930s population genetics combined theory of evolution with mendelian genetics to produce modern synthesis by mid 1960s molecular basis of metabolism and reproduction was firmly established through new discipline of molecular biology genetic engineering insertion of genes into a host cell for cloning began in 1970s with invention of recombinant dna techniques and its commercial applications applied to agricultural crops followed in 1990s there was now potential to identify organisms by molecular fingerprinting and to estimate times in past when critical evolutionary changes had occurred through use of molecular clocks computers electron microscopes and evolution thumb right 125px electron microscope constructed by ernst in 1933 increased experimental precision combined with vastly improved scientific instrumentation was opening up exciting new fields in 1936 alexander 1894 1980 demonstrated a possible mechanism for synthesis of organic matter from inorganic molecules in 1960s it was determined that earth s earliest life forms treated as plants cyanobacteria known as stromatolites dated back some 3 5 billion years mid century transmission and scanning electron microscopy presented another level of resolution to structure of matter taking anatomy into new world of ultrastructure new and revised phylogenetic classification systems of plant kingdom were produced perhaps most notable being that of august eichler 1839 1887 and massive 23 volume of adolf engler 1844 1930 karl 1849 1893 published over period 1887 and 1915 taxonomy based on gross morphology was now being supplemented by using characters revealed by pollen morphology embryology anatomy cytology serology macromolecules and more introduction of computers facilitated rapid analysis of large data sets used for numerical taxonomy also called or emphasis on truly natural phylogenies spawned disciplines of cladistics and phylogenetic systematics grand taxonomic synthesis an integrated system of classification of flowering plants 1981 of american arthur cronquist 1919 1992 was superseded when in 1998 angiosperm phylogeny group published a phylogeny of flowering plants based on analysis of dna sequences using techniques of new molecular systematics which was resolving questions concerning earliest evolutionary branches of angiosperms flowering plants exact relationship of fungi to plants had for some time been uncertain several lines of evidence pointed to fungi being different from plants animals and bacteria indeed more closely related to animals than plants in 1980s 90s molecular analysis revealed an evolutionary divergence of fungi from other organisms about 1 billion years ago sufficient reason to erect a unique kingdom separate from plants biogeography and ecology thumb 350px left map of terrestrial biomes classified by vegetation type publication of alfred wegener s 1880 1930 theory of continental drift 1912 gave additional impetus to comparative physiology and study of biogeography while ecology in 1930s contributed important ideas of plant community succession community change and energy flows from 1940 to 1950 ecology matured to become an independent discipline as eugene odum 1913 2002 formulated many of concepts of ecosystem ecology emphasising relationships between groups of organisms especially material and energy relationships as key factors in field building on extensive earlier work of alphonse de candolle nikolai 1887 1943 from 1914 to 1940 produced accounts of geography centres of origin and evolutionary history of economic plants twenty first century in reviewing sweep of botanical history it is evident that through power of scientific method most of basic questions concerning structure and function of plants have in principle been resolved now distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed but especially at molecular and global levels to improve human custodianship of planet earth most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to role of plants as primary producers in global cycling of life s basic ingredients energy carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen and ways that our plant stewardship can help address global environmental issues of resource management conservation human food security
