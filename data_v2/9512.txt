miami miami marlins had not yet been formed whose mascot is an alligator screenwriter bob gale who co wrote script of back to future part ii originally intended it as a joke saying being a baseball fan i thought ok let s come up with one of most unlikely scenarios we can think of referencing both cubs long championship drought and fact that florida did not have a baseball team in 1989 he also explained october 21 prediction was based on postseason structure at time and thus could have been accurate had mlb not added division series in 1994 but not played until 1995 due to strike and wild card game in 2012 had predicted schedule held chicago would have swept miami team in world series with series starting october 17 in actual 2015 postseason cubs advanced to national league championship series but were eliminated in four games coincidentally final game of nlcs took place on october 21 same date as fictional events of back to future part ii while film s prediction proved to be incorrect cubs did win following year s world series marking an end to team s 108 year championship drought official back to future twitter account acknowledged this also stating reason that cubs had not won in 2015 was due to 1994 strike causing a disruption in space time continuum see also 2015 japan series 2015 korean series references external links 2015 postseason schedule at mlb com
