signed tripartite pact bombing occurred in first days of german led axis invasion of yugoslavia during world war ii royal yugoslav army air force vvkj had only 77 modern fighter aircraft available to defend belgrade against hundreds of german fighters and bombers that struck in first wave early on 6 april three days prior vvkj major vladimir kren had defected to germans disclosing locations of multiple military assets as well as elucidating vvkj s codes three more waves of bombers attacked belgrade on 6 april and more attacks followed in subsequent days attacks resulted in paralysis of yugoslav civilian and military command and control widespread destruction of belgrade s infrastructure and many civilian casualties bombing of belgrade was preceded by commencement of ground invasion a few hours earlier and coincided with air attacks on vvkj airfields and other strategic targets across yugoslavia among non military targets struck during bombing were national library of serbia which burned to ground with loss of hundreds of thousands of books and manuscripts and belgrade zoo royal air force carried out two bombing raids on sofia capital of bulgaria in retaliation for

executed for war crimes in part for his involvement in bombing of belgrade kren was arrested in 1947 on unrelated charges of war crimes stemming from his subsequent service as head of air force of independent state of croatia he was extradited to yugoslavia to face trial found guilty on all counts and executed in 1948 a monument erected in new belgrade in 1997 commemorates yugoslav airmen who were killed in belgrade s defense bombing has been dramatised in literature and film background yugoslav coup d etat following germany s 1938 anschluss of austria yugoslavia shared a border with third reich and came under increasing pro axis political pressure as her neighbours fell into line with axis powers in april 1939 yugoslavia gained a second frontier with italy when that country invaded albania between september and november 1940 hungary joined tripartite pact italy invaded greece and romania also joined pact from that time yugoslavia was almost surrounded by axis powers or their client states and her neutral stance toward war was under tremendous pressure on 14 february 1941 adolf hitler invited prime minister dragisa cvetkovic and foreign minister aleksandar cincar markovic to berchtesgaden and requested that yugoslavia also join pact on 1 march bulgaria joined and next day german troops entered bulgaria from romania closing ring around yugoslavia further pressure was applied by hitler on 4 march 1941 when yugoslav regent prince paul visited berchtesgaden but prince delayed a decision on 6 march royal yugoslav army air force vvkj was secretly mobilised following day british troops began landing in greece to bolster country s defences against italians on 12 march vvkj began dispersing to auxiliary airfields by 20 march vvkj s dispersal had been completed hitler wishing to secure his southern flank in anticipation of germany s impending invasion of soviet union demanded that yugoslavia sign pact on 25 march yugoslav government complied two days later a military coup d etat was carried out by a group of vvkj and yugoslav royal guard officers led by brigadier general mirkovic prince was deposed and replaced by his 17 year old nephew peter who was declared to be of age to accede to throne preparations same day as coup d etat hitler issued directive 25 which stated that coup had changed political situation in balkans he ordered that even if yugoslavia at first should give declarations of loyalty she must be considered as a foe and therefore must be destroyed as quickly as possible german reconnaissance aircraft frequently violated yugoslav airspace in aftermath of coup vvkj fighters were placed on constant alert german incursions demonstrated that yugoslav ground observation post network and supporting radio communications were inadequate hitler decided that belgrade would be bombed as punishment for coup against government that had signed pact under codename operation retribution unternehmen on 27 and 28 march 1941 reichsmarschall hermann goring transferred about 500 fighter and bomber aircraft from france and northern germany to airfields near yugoslav border commander of luftflotte iv generaloberst general alexander lohr allocated these aircraft to attack yugoslav capital in waves by day and night lohr issued his orders for bombing on 31 march but decision to bomb belgrade would not be confirmed by hitler until 5 april although hitler ordered general destruction of belgrade at last minute lohr replaced these general directions with specific military objectives within city on 3 april major vladimir kren defected to germans flying a potez 25 aircraft to graz in austria and disclosed locations of many of yugoslavia s dispersal airfields as well as codes used by vvkj which had to be quickly changed when invasion commenced he also pointed out which locations in belgrade should be targeted on afternoon of 5 april a british colonel visited mirkovic at vvkj base in zemun and informed him that attack on belgrade would commence at 06 30 following morning previous day yugoslav government had declared belgrade an open city in event of hostilities although german embassy had informed its government that belgrade did not contain any anti aircraft defences in an effort to justify attack to public german propaganda branded city fortress belgrade after first bombs were dropped before invasion commenced sources within yugoslav ministry of army and navy advised germans of location of troop mobilisation centres and air raid shelters in belgrade by 6 april vvkj had been almost completely mobilised and consisted of four air brigades with more than 423 aircraft of yugoslav german italian french czech and british design including 107 modern fighters and 100 modern medium

belgrade briefly attempted to meet overwhelming luftwaffe assault but were eliminated as threats during first wave of attack sources vary regarding success achieved by defenders a us army study first published in 1953 states that luftwaffe lost two fighter aircraft downed 20 yugoslav aircraft and destroyed a further 44 on ground military historian daniel l zajac writes that germans lost 40 aircraft during two day air battle another source indicates loss of 14 german aircraft on 6 april dive bombers in subsequent waves were able to operate at rooftop altitude according to historian stevan k pavlowitch bombing of belgrade lasted three days other sources state air battle over belgrade lasted only two days owing to poor flying conditions on 8 april most important cultural institution that was destroyed was national library of serbia which was hit by bombs and gutted by fire hundreds of thousands of rare books maps and medieval manuscripts were destroyed also struck was

bombing of belgrade operating vickers wellington bombers from an airfield in greece squadron conducted raids on 6 7 april and 12 13 april dropping a total of of high explosive bombs on railway targets and nearby residential areas these raids were carried out despite fact that britain was not at war with bulgaria until 12 december 1941 historian herman knell calls retaliatory justification for these raids strange and implausible aviation historians shores cull and malizia indicate that these raids were attacks on lines of communication of german forces attacking greece and yugoslavia and note that raid on 6 7 april targeted an ammunition train and other installations in sofia and raid on 12 13 april bombed railway marshalling yards other similar targets in bulgaria were attacked by raf during balkans campaign aftermath and legacy thumb 200px monument to yugoslav pilots killed during operation retribution located in new belgrade alt rectangular polished dark stone plinth pointing

yugoslav resistance civilian casualties were significant but sources vary widely from 1 500 to 17 000 killed they were worsened by disclosure of air raid shelter locations to germans in days preceding attack official casualty figure released by occupation authorities soon after bombing was 2 271 killed other sources mention 5 000 to 10 000 fatalities and later yugoslav estimates ranged even higher historian jozo tomasevich writes that higher estimates were downgraded following careful postwar investigations and indicates that a figure between 3 000 and 4 000 is more realistic belgrade was occupied on 13 april 1941 and four days later yugoslavia capitulated afterwards luftwaffe engineers conducted a bomb damage assessment in belgrade report stated that of bombs were dropped 10 to 14 percent being incendiaries it listed all targets of bombing including royal palace war ministry military headquarters central post office telegraph office passenger and goods railway stations power stations and barracks it also mentioned that seven aerial mines were dropped and that areas in centre and northwest of city had been destroyed comprising 20 to 25 percent of its total area some aspects of bombing remain unexplained particularly use of aerial mines significant damage was done to belgrade particularly to water and electrical systems pavlowitch states that almost 50 percent of housing in belgrade was destroyed after invasion germans forced between 3 500 and 4 000 jews to collect rubble that was caused by bombing unexploded german bombs continue to be unearthed in 21st
