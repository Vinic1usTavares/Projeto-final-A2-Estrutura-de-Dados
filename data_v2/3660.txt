and copyist he has been compared to other clerks from natural school such as overcoat s although trying to use literature to understand life devushkin does not discuss these topics separately and falsely believes that dobroselova s letters reflect his life taking short stories as realistic works he exhibits typical sentimental characteristics according to robert payne dostoyevsky writes on edge of sentimentality but he is a completely credible and rounded figure devushkin s name derives from meaning maiden or girl possibly symbolizing virginity and innocence although joseph frank remarked it is an incongruent description varvara alekseyevna dobroselova varvara lives in similar conditions as devushkin her decision to live with unscrupulous mr bykov makes her an outsider not typical of sentimental novels unlike heroine in samuel richardson s 1748 novel clarissa she chooses materialistic path and loses her interest in literature her name derives from dobro meaning good symbolizing her good hearted personality mr bykov bykov an old rich brutal widower successfully proposes to dobroselova at end his name derives from meaning bull symbolizing sexual power and lust creation thumb upright dostoyevsky as an engineer dostoevsky showed interest in literature since his childhood his mother s subscription to library of reading enabled family entry into leading contemporary russian and non russian literature gothic tales such as by ann radcliffe was first genre dostoevsky was introduced to other formative influences were works by poets alexander pushkin and vasily zhukovsky heroic epics usually by homer and chivalric novels by cervantes and walter scott dostoevsky initially attended best private school in moscow boarding school founded by a czech immigrant who moved to russia after napoleonic wars it put strong emphasis on literature as school required 800 rubles per year his father had to do additional work and ask his aristocratic relatives for money although dostoevsky settled in well he had to leave after his mother s death on 27 september 1837 led to financial problems for his family he was sent to military engineering technical university he had problems adjusting to life there but nevertheless managed to graduate on 12 august 1843 as a military engineer after his graduation he lived a quite liberal lifestyle attending many plays and ballets of composers ole bull and franz liszt and renting an expensive apartment house for 1 200 rubles even though he was only earning 5 000 rubles per year these events and his introduction to casinos were responsible for his deteriorating financial situation he worked as a translator but translations he completed in 1843 such as balzac s eugenie grandet and sand s la derniere were not very successful his gambling and betting on billiard games were a huge drain on his funds because of his frequent losses as a consequence dostoyevsky was often forced to ask his relatives for money but he felt uncomfortable doing so and decided to write a novel to raise money it s simply a case dostoevsky wrote to his brother mikhail of my novel covering all if i fail in this i ll hang myself dostoevsky began working on poor folk in early 1844 he first mentioned upcoming work in a letter to mikhail on 30 september 1844 i am finishing up a novel of size of eugenie grandet it s a rather original work dostoevsky later wrote to his brother on 23 march 1845 i finished novel in november then rewrote it in december and again in february march i am seriously satisfied with my novel it is a serious and elegant work sometime around april 1845 his friend dmitry grigorovich with whom he had shared an apartment since autumn of 1844 proposed giving manuscript to poet nikolay nekrasov who was planning to issue an anthology in 1846 dostoevsky took manuscript to nekrasov and returned home shortly afterwards doorbell of his house rang and he opened door to excited nekrasov and grigorovich both of whom congratulated him on his debut novel of which they had only read 10 pages they finished full 112 page work during night at dostoevsky s apartment next morning three men went to critic vissarion belinsky nekrasov proclaimed dostoevsky new gogol though belinsky replied sceptically you find springing up like mushrooms dostoevsky himself did not believe his book would receive a positive review from belinsky but when nekrasov visited belinsky in evening latter wanted to meet dostoevsky to congratulate him on his debut dostoevsky proposed to issue poor folk in fatherland notes but it was instead published in almanac st petersburg collection on january 15 1846 themes and style thumb left 200px makar devushkin poor folk explores poverty and relationship between poor and rich common themes of literary naturalism largely influenced by nikolai gogol s overcoat alexander pushkin s stationmaster and letters of abelard and heloise by peter abelard and heloise d argenteuil it is an epistolary novel composed of letters written by varvara and her close friend makar devushkin name of book and main female character were adapted from nikolai karamzin s poor liza additional elements include backgrounds of two protagonists and tragic ending both typical characteristics of a middle class novel belinsky and others saw overcoat as inspiration for novel later critics stated that sentimental humanitarian poor folk contained a great deal of parody and satire of gogol books however there are some dissenters karin jeanette harmon guesses in double parody equals anti parody that dostoyevsky mixes parody of sentimental epistolary novel with parody of naturalistic sketch of clerk robert payne rejects idea of any satiric content he notes that satire began in double a similar view was held by belinsky who also stated that dostoyevsky s talent is not descriptive but to highest degree creative victor terras thought that dostoyevsky did not use satire except in a few cases but instead employed a humor derived from eternal conflict between simple soul of a good man and complex apparatus of soulless institutionalized society run by clever people joseph frank who suggested that whole work is a serious parody recalled that poor folk burlesques high society adventure novel gogolian humorous local color tale and debunking physiological sketch victor terras dubbed it a travesty of sentimental epistolary love story contemporary stated in this work comedy is somehow explored and includes an appreciable tone colour and even language of gogol and kvitka through his tale wrote northern bee dostoyevsky wanted to utilize gogol s humour with naive simplicity of undisturbed pen name of kvitka northern bee in russian 1846 vol 25 another perspective that describes connection between poor folk and overcoat is position that former is considered continuation of latter that dostoevsky picked up where gogol left off in his tale about poor civil servants this view does not imply that dostoevsky did not offer innovations since this novel also distinguished itself by humanizing those that that were in gogol s tale mechanical and lifeless this is aligned with theory that dostoevsky attempted both in poor folk and double to penetrate into psychology of gogol s characters it is claimed that result of dostoevski s unequivocal humanization of gogolian model intensified its effect gogol s debonair portrayal of social psychic frustrations is a case in point dostoevski took a different path by highlighting its tragic aspect according to critic rebecca epstein matveyev pushkin s stationmaster serves as a thematic subtext as a basis for devushkin s literary experiments and as a resource for his epistolary relationship both stationmaster and overcoat are mentioned in letters between dobroselova and devushkin dostoyevsky may have chosen epistolary genre to include his personal critical observations similar to real life letters between writer and addressee according to yakubovich dostoyevsky uses poor folk as his diary however as an external narrator is missing only source for character s motivation and personality is available in letters and dobroselova s diary numerous different voices that is devushkin s quotations from stories his commentaries about these books and his own works is an example of polyphony these effects confuse reader and hide narrator sexual guilt is another recognizable theme in poor folk this is demonstrated for instance in suggestion of something dishonorable in varvara s past as well as fact that she and devushkin are distantly related hinting an incestuous love other sources contributed in this view such as konstantin mochulsky who said that motif of an old man s loving a girl with its vague interweaving of eroticism and paternal affection is one of dostoevsky s favorite themes reception poor folk received nationwide critical acclaim dostoevsky observed that whole of russia is talking about my poor folk as soon as he read manuscript for poor folk belinsky named it russia s first social novel alexander herzen praised book in his essay about progress of revolutionary ideas in russia noting book s socialistic tendencies and animations work was classified by critic pavel as a work of so called natural school newspaper northern bee recorded nikolay in 1861 essay downtrodden people wrote that dostoevsky studies poor reality and expresses humanistic ideas he also praised him for illustrating human nature and taking out souls in centre of depth which are caged after protesting for identity against exterior violent pressure and presents it to our verdict apollon grigoriev wrote in finnish herald dostoevsky starts to play in our literature same role hoffmann played in german literature he became so deeply immersed in life of civil servants that dull and uninteresting everyday life became for him a nightmare close to madness count vladimir also liked novel stating that it was written with force and simplicity by a great talent valerian noted after a number of publications by dostoevsky gogol was usually leading social poet while dostoevsky usually leading psychological poet former is known as representative of contemporary society or contemporary circle for latter society itself becomes interesting through its influence on other people
