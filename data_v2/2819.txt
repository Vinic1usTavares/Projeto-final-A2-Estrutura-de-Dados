north ronaldsay or orkney is a breed of sheep from north ronaldsay northernmost island of orkney off north coast of scotland it belongs to northern european short tailed sheep group of breeds and has evolved without much cross breeding with modern breeds it is a smaller sheep than most with rams males horned and ewes females mostly hornless it was formerly kept primarily for wool but now two largest flocks are feral one on north ronaldsay and another on orkney island of linga holm rare breeds survival trust lists breed as vulnerable with fewer than 600 registered breeding females in united kingdom semi feral flock on north ronaldsay is original flock that evolved to subsist almost entirely on seaweed they are one of few mammals to do this they are confined to shoreline by a 1 8 m 6 ft tall drystane dyke which completely encircles island forcing sheep to evolve this unusual characteristic wall was built as kelping production of soda ash from seaweed on shore became uneconomical sheep were confined to shore to protect fields and crofts inside and afterwards subsisted largely on seaweed this diet has caused a variety of adaptations in sheep s digestive system these sheep have to extract trace element copper far more efficiently than other breeds as their diet has a limited supply of copper this results in them being susceptible to copper toxicity if fed on a grass diet as copper is toxic to sheep in high quantities grazing habits have also changed to suit sheep s environment to reduce chance of being stranded by an incoming tide they graze at low tide and then ruminate at high tide a range of fleece colours are exhibited including grey brown and red meat from north ronaldsay has a distinctive flavour described as intense and gamey due in part to high iodine content in their diet of seaweed meat has protected geographical status in european union law so only meat from north ronaldsay sheep can be marketed as orkney lamb history origin alt a white sheep pictured

short tailed sheep their arrival onto north ronaldsay is not known precisely but it may have been as early as iron age which would make them potentially earliest ovines to arrive in britain because of their isolated location they have evolved without much admixture from imported roman and european breeds they share some characteristics including their colour range and short tails with scandinavian sheep introduced when islands were under norse control between 9th and 15th centuries enclosure in 1832 a drystane dyke was erected on island its construction was part of response to collapse of kelping industry which was production of soda ash by burning of seaweed to provide a livelihood for those previously employed in kelping inland farmlands were reorganized and sheep kept away from fields or crofts since then flocks on island have been feral vorwald dohner encyclopedia pp 96 97 wall also unintentionally reduced chances of crossbreeding which would have diluted gene pool of an already vulnerable breed wall circles entire coast of island 19 km 12 mi and is 1 8 metres 6 ft high making it one of largest dry stone walls in world in 1999 historic scotland described it as a unique and important structure and designated it an a list site requiring conservation this status affords it special protection any development has to be approved with conservation in mind since wall was erected human population of north ronaldsay has fallen from 500 to around 50 and current residents lack skills to maintain wall successive storms most damaging of which was in december 2012 have created large holes in structure and cost of repairs has been estimated at ps3 million in part due to lack of natural material and skilled labour in 1902 it cost only 4 pence per hour to repair wall using stone taken from shoreline stone is now imported for small repairs but it was estimated in september 2015 by historic scotland that of wall s needs repair and that rate of damage is outstripping pace of repair punds alt an area surrounded by dry stone walling with a gate at one end to keep sheep enclosed thumb an example of a pund punds or pounds also listed with historic scotland are nine small enclosures situated across island to contain sheep for shearing counting lambing and slaughtering fenton sheep in north ronaldsay p 210 sheep are herded inside these punds twice a year only time they have access to grass feed even at these times many of them prefer to consume seaweed between february and august sheep are brought into punds once for lambing and once for shearing lambs are born on grass between february and may at this time sheep are counted lambs are given ear tags and records are entered with island s sheep court to record ownership vorwald dohner encyclopedia p 97 shearing takes place in july and august and whole island community is involved in herding and shearing sheep slaughtering takes place only in winter when meat is needed and when animals are fatter and yield more meat since seaweed is more abundant in winter sheep court in 1839 just after wall was erected north ronaldsay sheep court was created a group of eleven appointed islanders were responsible for maintenance of wall health of sheep flock and recording ownership of sheep black land that thyme forgot p 155 today sheep court remains regulatory body responsible for organising ownership of sheep but european union legislation has suggested that it may have to be reorganised into a grazing committee conservation north ronaldsay sheep fellowship is primary organisation concerned with survival of breed they maintain flock book established in 1974 which is breed registry containing all purebred animals this book reports that there are fewer than 600 breeding females and roughly 3700 sheep in total rare breeds survival trust rbst lists north ronaldsay as vulnerable there are only two main populations of breed one is on island of north ronaldsay itself other was established in 1974 when rbst took 178 sheep off island to establish new populations one group of sheep was sent to mainland and 150 were relocated to uninhabited island of linga holm which was purchased by rbst relocation was meant to protect sheep from potential natural disasters such as an oil spill north sea oil extraction was expanding at time modern dna analysis has shown little crossbreeding with other sheep breeds from mainland britain testing carried out under national scrapie plan looked for allele which protects against scrapie disease and is present in modern selectively bred sheep and found it in only 1 3 per cent of north ronaldsay sheep further dna studies comparing bones of north ronaldsay with remains of north european short tailed sheep found on a skara brae site dating from around 3000 bce have shown a very close match suggesting that north ronaldsay has not genetically mixed with other breeds characteristics physical north ronaldsays are very small sheep an adaptation to harsh cold environment rams typically weigh around and ewes rarely exceed both standing around high at withers shoulders alderson sheep p 873 sheep are slow growing and a full size carcass may weigh only north ronaldsay is a descendant of primitive european short tailed sheep breed as name of descent parent would suggest they have naturally short tails their bones are finer than other breeds and their head is dished sloping inwards rams are all horned these horns are typically ridged and spiraled only 20 percent of ewes are horned rest are polled hornless diet north ronaldsay sheep have a highly unusual diet consisting almost solely of seaweed this has evolved due to their unique location confined to shoreline by a 1 8 m 6 ft high dry stone wall leaving only seaweed for food apart from marine iguana native to galapagos islands it is only land animal known to have such a diet studies have shown that due to preference and availability sheep eat mainly brown this discovery led to suggestions that kelp may be of use as an alternative food source for other livestock grazing habits of sheep have also adapted to their unusual diet instead of grazing during day and ruminating digesting at night as other sheep generally do north ronaldsays graze as tide uncovers shore twice in 24 hours ruminating at high water feeding begins around 3 5 hours after high tide as areas of kelp and seaweed are exposed four hours later which is just after low tide feeding ends allowing rumination to begin this cycle reduces chance of sheep becoming stranded at sea by incoming tide national research council managing global genetic resources p 30 unusually for sheep north ronaldsay fattens in winter when storms throw larger amounts of kelp and seaweed onto shore and food is abundant sheep s source of fresh water is limited to few freshwater lakes and ponds along seashore hall some recent observations p 60 this has led them to become very salt tolerant as their diet is salt rich and access to fresh water is limited compared with other breeds of sheep they can far better handle elements present in sea salt these empirical conclusions were drawn in a 1997 study but underlying biological mechanism has yet to be understood alt a large herd of north ronaldsay on beach exhibiting many different coat colours white brown grey and black thumbnail a herd of north ronaldsay sheep on beach scientific analysis sheep have evolved a somewhat different physiology from other sheep due to their unusual diet their digestive system has adapted to extract sugars in seaweeds more efficiently a 2005 study at university of liverpool found that they have a greater susceptibility to copper toxicity when compared with a more traditional breed such as cambridge this is because seaweed has a chemical which inhibits absorption of copper so sheep have to absorb copper more efficiently to obtain required amount levels of copper found in typical sheep feed including grass are toxic for this breed p 265 studies at universities of liverpool and minnesota suggest that they can extract four times more copper from their diet than more traditional breeds accelerator mass spectrometry has shown a higher ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 d13c in this breed than in any breed of grass fed sheep 13 parts per thousand in a 2005 study enamel samples were taken from sheep and analysed for this ratio to determine diet of sheep this study showed that some sheep fed exclusively on seaweed whereas others had a diet half consisting of grass in summer months use meat lamb meat and mutton from sheep have been specially designated by european union meaning that only pure bred lambs can be marketed as orkney lamb meat has a unique rich flavour which has been described as intense and almost gamey and has a darker colour than most mutton due in part to animals iodine rich diet wool alt two black north ronaldsay sheep shown behind a fence with long horns curved behind them and chewing on a carrot thumb an example of face of north ronaldsay sheep despite their slight size north ronaldsay sheep were historically raised for their wool it comes in a variety of colours and is very similar to shetland breed due to their common ancestor more common typical colours are whites and greys but browns reds also called and blacks with coarser hair are all exhibited hall some recent observations p 59 a full fleece weighs about ekarius and robson fleece fiber sourcebook p 176 p 147 north ronaldsay is a double coated breed meaning they have a wool undercoat and overcoat undercoat tends to be finer and soft suitable for garments that would touch skin whereas overcoat is coarser with long hair that protects sheep from cold wet weather of their natural environment this fibre is more durable
