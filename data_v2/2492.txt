severe tropical cyclone joy struck australia in late 1990 causing third highest floods on record in rockhampton queensland this cyclone began as a weak tropical low near solomon islands and initially moved westward on 18 december it was named joy becoming 2nd named storm of 1990 91 australian region cyclone season after turning southwest joy developed a well defined eye and strengthened to maximum sustained winds of while approaching cairns in far north queensland brushing city with strong winds cyclone soon weakened and turned southeast joy later curved back southwest making landfall near townsville queensland on 26 december it dissipated next day remnant moisture continued as torrential rainfall over queensland for two weeks while drifting offshore northeastern australia cyclone produced wind gusts as high as in cairns strong enough to cause power outages in mackay a tornado spawned by joy damaged 40 homes while torrential rainfall just south of city peaked at over most storm associated damage was wrought by severe flooding which persisted for weeks in hardest hit locations rains significantly increased water levels on 10 rivers among them fitzroy river which discharged about of freshwater into keppel bay over 25 days in turn great barrier reef suffered biological damage from coral bleaching and decreased salinity fitzroy river rose to a peak at rockhampton forcing thousands to evacuate homes some stranded individuals could only obtain food by helicopter elsewhere in australia storm moisture alleviated drought conditions and diminished fires near sydney overall joy killed six people and caused 300 million in damage 234 million usd afterwards queensland government issued a disaster declaration for about 30 of state and name joy was retired from list of tropical cyclone names meteorological history in mid december a monsoon trough persisted along west pacific ocean spawning a pair of tropical disturbances both north and south of equator in northwestern pacific ocean system became typhoon russ on 15 december a tropical low formed east of solomon islands during next few days system passed south of country while slowly organizing on 18 december australia bureau of meteorology began tracking it naming system joy after it upgraded low to tropical cyclone status a meteorologist from darwin later apologised that name was used so close to christmas although joy was predetermined by a rotating list of list of tropical cyclone names also on 18 december joint typhoon warning center jtwc began issuing warnings on storm labeling it as tropical cyclone 06p with a ridge to south joy continued generally west southwestward while in its origins joy was experiencing upper level wind shear but as it approached jet stream while turning to southwest conditions became more favourable for intensification storm quickly intensified reaching equivalent of a minimal hurricane on 21 december at 00 00 utc on 23 december bureau estimated joy reached peak 10 minute sustained winds of which made system a category 4 severe tropical cyclone on australian tropical cyclone intensity scale around same time jtwc also estimated same peak winds but sustained over one minute joy developed an eye about in diameter with concentric eyewalls storm began moving slowly off northeast coast of australia passing within of cairns and motion shifted to a southeast drift a building high pressure area to south caused change in movement and there were initial concerns storm would loop to west and affect cairns again drier air caused joy to weaken gradually from its peak to equivalent of a strong tropical storm at 06 00 utc on 26 december after turning back to southwest storm made landfall near townsville queensland with winds estimated at that day jtwc discontinued advisories and on 27 december joy dissipated inland over queensland a remnant system persisted into early january producing continued rainfall across queensland preparations before joy struck australia residents evacuated from resorts on fitzroy and green islands by boat or plane officials set up evacuation centres on mainland and put australian army on standby military evacuated its fleet of blackhawk helicopters inland from raaf base townsville a man required rescue from hope island by helicopter in advance of storm threat of storm caused shopping malls and airport near cairns to close just before christmas several flights were diverted or delayed stranding about 1 000 travellers many of whom spent christmas in airport road travel was banned in some areas of northeastern queensland and residents in port douglas were forced to evacuate flood warning centre in brisbane issued 192 flood warnings related to cyclone joy in december and january beginning on 23 december most of warnings were related to increased water levels along rivers impact right thumb 350px a yacht washed aground at airlie beach queensland in whitsunday region joy passed within of green island off coast of queensland generating a wind gust of heavy damage occurred on other islands and one person drowned while surfing in mackay a boat became disabled during storm forcing its four occupants to ride out storm for four days on cockermouth island until they were rescued by helicopter several boats were damaged in whitsunday islands storm and its remnants dropped heavy rainfall throughout queensland for about two weeks totaling over south of mackay and over between bowen and st lawrence highest daily total was about west of sarina three day rainfall totals around when joy made landfall included in blue mountain and in waitara rainfall continued through region through march 1991 resulting in third largest flood in region in over 100 years overall cyclone joy killed six people including five in river flooding and caused about 300 million in damage 234 million usd while stalling off northeast australia coast joy produced widespread gale force winds with gusts to recorded at cairns after winds knocked over trees causing power and phone outages storm damage cut water supply and briefly isolated cairns due to debris blocking roads an outer rainband struck mackay as storm moved ashore spawning a tornado that damaged 40 houses destroyed two others and damaged a caravan park windstorm was unexpected there and damage in mackay was estimated at 10 million flooding from rainfall affected about 90 of city which restricted train travel causing three trains to be canceled and stranding hundreds of travelers in port douglas joy produced an inconsequential storm surge of in innisfail cyclone ruined 90 of town s crops and over 20 houses sustained wind damage banana farmers in cairns region lost a combined total of 1 2 million bunches of fruit collectively crop damage totalled over 70 million mostly to sugar cane and banana about 30 000 head of livestock were killed in region left thumb weakening cyclone joy near landfall rain from cyclone joy caused rampant flooding across region significantly raising water levels along 10 rivers fitzroy river alone swelled to inundate about of terrain heightened discharge caused extensive erosion along river channels that removed about of soil and vegetation in late december pioneer river at mackay peaked at safely within confines of its levee system town of endured flooding of streets and houses which would reoccur several times through february high water levels along tully river flooded a portion of bruce highway in second week of january herbert river peaked at causing residential flooding in ingham elsewhere in australia moisture from storm eased ongoing bushfires near sydney at rockhampton fitzroy river rose to an initial peak of temporarily dropped and rose to a final peak of in early january 1991 third highest since records began in 1860 after floods in 1918 and 1954 inflow from several tributaries ensured fitzroy river near rockhampton remained over for 13 days river entered 350 houses in what was city s most damaging flood since 1954 town was isolated for about three weeks after flooding covered roads railways and airport before worst of flooding acting premier tom burns declared a state of disaster for rockhampton giving local police authority to force individuals living in flood zones to leave their homes ultimately over 1 000 people sought higher ground staying mainly at houses of friends or relatives or at nearby schools in an attempt to mitigate damage 150 volunteers filled 43 000 sandbags to protect properties nearby residents rescued about 100 dogs from an affected kennel storm related flooding damaged portions of great barrier reef through coral bleaching over 25 days fitzroy river discharged about of water into keppel bay reaching great barrier reef in early january and causing a drop in salinity levels on great keppel island about 85 of shallow water reefs died reef damage also occurred in whitsunday islands discharge from fitzroy river affected various islands and coral groups depending on offshore wind direction and ocean current water flow washed a group of freshwater turtles from mainland to north west island though they were later returned to their native habitat influx of freshwater reduced commercial fishing productivity by 30 aftermath workers in cairns had restored power and water supplies within a few days of joy s passage after initial flooding from joy ended there was additional rainfall in february 1991 that caused flooding across region residual flooding cost coal industry about 60 million due to loss of production and hindered exporting while rockhampton was still isolated by flooding a helicopter airdropped food to hundreds of stranded families after town experienced food and water shortages transportation to rockhampton was not normalised until 20 january when airport and incoming roads were reopened city of rockhampton later created a flood plain management policy as a result of effects from joy floods helped fill drainage basin of peter faust dam within a few weeks speeding up a process which would have otherwise taken several years months after storm queensland national parks and wildlife service collected reports on environmental impacts from flooding they included some beneficial aspects such as new locations for animal breeding and alleviation of drought conditions queensland government upgraded a portion of bruce highway near rockhampton to reduce flooding in similar storms officials declared about a third of state of queensland as a disaster area following cyclone joy directing state funds toward recovery efforts queensland government provided monetary assistance to eligible families in disaster zone and offered special loans to farmers affected by storm federal government agreed to contribute 75 of overall relief costs following cyclone s impacts in australia name joy was later retired by world meteorological organization see also list of retired australian cyclone
