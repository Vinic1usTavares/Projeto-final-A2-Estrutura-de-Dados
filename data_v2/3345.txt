very peaceful hall opined that when people hear christmas carols they often don t hear their true message hall intended album to help people rediscover worshipful nature behind carols as an example of a message he wanted people to hear he gave i heard bells on christmas day a song written by henry wadsworth longfellow about his rediscovery of hope amidst several personal tragedies hall felt that song s message of hope was one that his kids and their generation needed to hear as a co producer on album hall wanted to introduce aspects and ideas that band had not done before and he felt album offered a chance to branch out he wanted band s female members megan garrett and melodee devevo to play a more prominent role in part to show people gifts they have composition peace on earth does not contain material relating to secular christmas traditions like santa claus or jack frost instead featuring a mix of traditional christmas carols and original songs i heard bells on christmas day

an example of mark hall s bold poignant songwriting tony cummings of cross rhythms gave album a perfect 10 out of 10 stars saying that it bucks all trends in that it doesn t contain saccharine sleigh bell drenched arrangements nor those ghastly songs about santa and chestnuts roasting in an open fire and praising it as an inventive and on occasions brilliant exploration of wonders of incarnation justin of jesus freak hideout gave album 3 out of 5 stars praising traditional christmas songs on album but criticizing original songs as having a forced feel to them almost like casting crowns wanted
