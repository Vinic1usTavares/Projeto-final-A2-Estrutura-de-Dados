about 2i s coffee bar in london s soho where several singers had been discovered she decided to open club which was located in her cellar on 29 august 1959 for her sons their friends and young people to meet and listen to popular music of day unlike cavern club which had a jazz only policy at that time mona charged half a crown annually for membership to keep out rough elements and served soft drinks snacks cakes and coffee from an espresso machine which no other club had at that time records were played on a small dansette record player which amplified them through a 3 speaker mona had booked les stewart quartet to play opening night with harrison on guitar but they cancelled booking after stewart and ken brown had a quarrel stewart was angry that brown had missed a rehearsal because brown was helping mona to decorate club as 300 membership cards had already been sold harrison said that he had two friends in a band called quarrymen who would play instead lennon mccartney and harrison went to club to arrange booking to which mona agreed but said she needed to finish painting club first all four took up brushes and helped mona to finish painting walls with spiders dragons rainbows and stars but as lennon was short sighted he mistook gloss for emulsion paint which took a long time to dry in dark damp cellar cynthia powell later wife of lennon painted a silhouette of him on wall which is also still there quarrymen played a series of seven saturday night concerts in casbah for 15 shillings each starting on 29 august to october 1959 featuring lennon mccartney harrison and brown but without a drummer and only one microphone connected to club s small pa system opening night concert was attended by about 300 local teenagers but as cellar had no air conditioning and people were dancing temperature rose until it became hard to breathe after success of first night mona gave quarrymen a residency and paid whole group ps3 a night every saturday thereafter queues lengthened onto street which was financially good for mona as she charged one shilling admission on top of annual membership fee as there was no amplification lennon later persuaded mona to hire a young amateur guitar player called harry to play a short set before quarrymen but this was only so they could use his 40 watt amplifier best was studying at collegiate grammar school when he decided he wanted to be in a music group so mona bought him a drum kit from blackler s music store and best formed his own band black jacks who later played in casbah chas newby joined group as did ken brown but only after he had left quarrymen reason for brown s exit from group was that he turned up on seventh saturday night of quarrymen residency at casbah with flu so mona ordered him upstairs to best s living room to rest this caused a massive quarrel with rest of group when mona came to pay them as they wanted brown s money to be shared amongst three of them as brown had not played mona refused so quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out colin manley from remo four was also given a booking to play in club which was only venue that young amateur bands could play at time other artists and groups like cilla black rory storm and hurricanes searchers and gerry pacemakers later played in club black jacks became resident group at casbah although quarrymen occasionally played there again and often visited it was in casbah club that lennon and mccartney persuaded stuart sutcliffe to buy a hofner 500 5 model known in europe as a president bass
