right thumb 250px a male xylocopa eastern carpenter bee on redbud canadensis bees can suffer serious effects from toxic chemicals in their environments these include various synthetic chemicals particularly insecticides as well as a variety of naturally occurring chemicals from plants such as ethanol resulting from fermentation of organic materials bee intoxication can result from exposure to ethanol from fermented nectar ripe fruits and manmade and natural chemicals in environment of course other creatures are not immune to effects of alcohol many of us have noticed that bees or yellow jackets cannot fly well after having drunk juice of overripe fruits or berries bears have been seen to stagger and fall down after eating fermented honey and birds often crash or fly haphazardly while intoxicated on ethanol that occurs naturally as free floating microorganisms convert vegetable carbohydrates to alcohol fruit flies and other insects also exhibit symptoms of ethanol intoxication effects of alcohol on bees are sufficiently similar to effects of alcohol on humans that honey bees have been used as models of human ethanol intoxication latest buzz in research intoxicated honey bees may clue scientists into drunken human behavior ohio state research news research communications columbus oh october 23 2004 metabolism of bees and humans is sufficiently different that bees can safely collect nectars from plants that contain compounds toxic to humans honey produced by bees from these toxic nectars can be poisonous if consumed by humans many humans have eaten toxic honey and become seriously ill as a result natural processes can also introduce toxic substances into nontoxic honey produced from nontoxic nectar microorganisms in honey can convert some of sugars in honey to ethanol this process of ethanol fermentation is intentionally harnessed to produce alcoholic beverage called mead from fermented honey ethanol effects of intoxication left thumb 200px bee showing its proboscis or tongue introduction of certain chemical substances such as ethanol or pesticides or defensive toxic biochemicals produced by plants to a bee s environment can cause bee to display abnormal or unusual behavior and disorientation in sufficient quantities such chemicals can poison and even kill bee effects of alcohol on bees have long been recognized for example john cumming described effect in an 1864 publication on beekeeping when bees become intoxicated from ethanol consumption or poisoned with other chemicals their balance is affected and they are wobbly when they walk charles abramson s group at oklahoma state university has put inebriated bees on running wheels where they exhibit locomotion difficulties they also put honey bees in shuttle boxes that used a stimulus to encourage bees to move and found that they were less mobile as they became more intoxicated a bee is more likely to stick out its tongue or proboscis inebriated bees spend more time flying if a bee is sufficiently intoxicated it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to hive and will die as a result et al 2006 found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol exposure to alcohol can have a prolonged effect on bees lasting as long as 48 hours happy hour bees mythology and mead carolyn voice of women 2007 describes a prolonged effect from ethanol consumption by honey bees as similar to a hangover this phenomenon is also observed in fruit s group at university of california san francisco has used fruit flies as models of human inebriation and even identified genes that seem to be responsible for alcohol tolerance accumulation believed to be associated with or hangover and produced genetically engineered strains that do not develop alcohol flies what our insect relatives can teach us about alcohol tolerance ruth williams naked scientist hangover gene is key to alcohol tolerance gaia vince newscientist com news service 22 august 2005 accessed july 17 2009 and is connected to neurotransmitter octopamine in fruit flies which is also present in bees bees as ethanol inebriation models in 1999 research by david sandeman led to realization that bee inebriation models are potentially valuable for understanding vertebrate and even human ethanol intoxication advances over past three decades in our understanding of nervous systems are impressive and come from a multifaceted approach to study of both vertebrate and invertebrate animals an almost unexpected by product of parallel investigation of vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems that is explored in this article is emergent view of an intricate web of evolutionary homology and convergence exhibited in structure and function of nervous systems of these two large paraphyletic groups of animals behavior of honey bees intoxicated by ethanol is being studied by scientists at ohio state university oklahoma state university university of ljubljana in slovenia and other sites as a potential model of effects of alcohol on humans at oklahoma state university for example abramson s research found significant correlations between reactions of bees and other vertebrates to ethanol exposure purpose of this experiment was to test feasibility of creating an animal model of ethanol consumption using social insects experiments on consumption locomotion and learning suggest that exposure to ethanol influences behavior of honey bees similarly to that observed in experiments with analogous vertebrates it has thus been found that honey bee nervous system is similar to that of vertebrates entomology postdoctoral researcher dr geraldine wright ohio state university blockquote these similarities are pronounced enough to even make it possible to derive information on functioning of human brains from how bees react to certain chemicals julie mustard a researcher at ohio state explained that on molecular level brains of honey bees and humans work same knowing how chronic alcohol use affects genes and proteins in honey bee brain may help us eventually understand how alcoholism affects memory and behavior in humans as well as molecular basis of addiction entomology postdoctoral researcher dr julie mustard ohio state university evaluation of a bee model for ethanol of vertebrates has just begun but appears to be promising bees are fed ethanol solutions and their behavior observed researchers place bees in tiny harnesses and feed them varying concentrations of alcohol introduced into sugar solutions intoxicated honey bees may clue scientists into drunken human behavior science daily october 25 2004 tests of locomotion foraging social interaction and aggressiveness are performed mustard has noted that alcohol affects bees and humans in similar ways it impairs motor functioning along with learning and memory processing blockquote interaction of bees with antabuse a common medication administered as a treatment for alcoholism has been tested as well bee exposure to other toxic and inebriating chemicals synthetic chemicals bees can be severely and even fatally affected by pesticides fertilizers and other chemicals that man has introduced into environment they can appear inebriated and dizzy and even die this is serious because it has substantial economic consequences for agriculture right thumb 200px bumblebee this problem has been object of growing concern for example researchers at university of hohenheim are studying how bees can be poisoned by exposure to seed disinfectants honey bee intoxication caused by seed disinfectants dr sc agr klaus wallner university of hohenheim accessed on july 17 2009 in france ministry of agriculture commissioned an expert group scientific and technical committee for multifactorial study on bees cst to study intoxicating and sometimes fatal effects of chemicals used in agriculture on bees recent issues related to bee troubles in france j n report to international apis health assessment committee bologna italy may 6 2004 this report included results of a study of toxic effects on bees of seed dressings imidacloprid and fipronil researchers at bee research institute and department of food chemistry and analysis in czech republic have pondered intoxicating effects of various chemicals used to treat winter rapeseed crops romania suffered a severe case of widespread bee intoxication and extensive bee mortality from deltamethrin in 2002 united states environmental protection

natural compounds bees and other hymenoptera can also be substantially affected by natural compounds in environment besides ethanol for example dariusz l of department of plant taxonomy and nature conservation gdansk university observed wasps in poland acting in a very sleepy possibly inebriated manner after eating nectar derived from north american orchid and wink 1993 published an extensive review of 63 types of plant allelochemicals alkaloids glycosides etc and their effects on bees when consumed it was found that 39 chemical compounds repelled bees primarily alkaloids coumarins and saponins and three compounds attracted bees they report that 17 out of 29 allelochemicals are toxic at some levels especially alkaloids saponins cardiac glycosides and cyanogenic glycosides various plants are known to have pollen which is toxic to honey bees in some cases killing adults e g in other cases creating a problem only when passed to brood e g heliconia other plants which have toxic pollen are and lagopus both pollen and nectar of california buckeye aesculus californica are toxic to honeybees and it is thought that other members of buckeye family are also bee inebriation in pollination thumb 200px right bucket orchid some plants reportedly rely on using intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees and use this inebriation as part of their reproductive strategy one plant that some claim uses this mechanism is south american bucket orchid sp an epiphyte bucket orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its scent derived from a variety of aromatic compounds bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs as they appear to use scent or derivatives thereof in order to attract females flower is constructed in such a way as to make surface almost impossible to cling to with smooth downward pointing hairs bees commonly slip and fall into fluid in bucket and only navigable route out is a narrow constricting passage that either glues a pollinium a pollen sack on their body if flower has not yet been visited or removes any pollinium that is there if flower has already been visited passageway constricts after a bee has entered and holds it there for a few minutes allowing glue to dry and securing pollinium it has been suggested that this process involves inebriation of bees bumblebee org article on hymenoptera but this effect has never been confirmed in this way bucket orchid passes its pollen from flower to flower this mechanism is almost but not quite species specific as it is possible for a few closely related bees to pollinate any given species of orchid as long as bees are similar in size and are attracted by same compounds pollination by euglossine bees robert l dressler evolution vol 22 no 1 mar 1968 pp 202 210 van der pijl and dodson 1966 observed that bees of genera and xylocopa exhibit symptoms of inebriation after consuming nectar from orchids sobralia violacea and sobralia rosea gongora orchid was suspected by 1992 of producing pheromones like a female euglossine bee speculated that chemicals produced by bucket orchid mimic bee pheromones and even somewhat resembles a female euglossine bee shape using these characteristics to spread its pollen a hapless male bee blind drunk with flower s overpowering pheromones might well mistake a toadstool for a suitable mate but flower has made at least a modest attempt at recreating a gestalt this seems unlikely given that no one has ever documented that female euglossines produce pheromones male euglossines produce pheromones using chemicals they collect from orchids and these pheromones attract females rather than converse as 2004 suggests toxic honey some substances which are toxic to humans have no effect on bees if bees obtain their nectar from certain flowers resulting honey can be psychoactive or even toxic to humans but innocuous to bees and their larvae poisoning from this honey is called mad honey disease even when honey is not produced from nectar of toxic plants it can still ferment to produce ethanol animals such as birds that have consumed honey fermented in sun can be found incapable of flight or other normal movement sometimes honey is fermented intentionally to produce mead an alcoholic beverage made of honey water and yeast word for drunk in classical greek is even translated as honey

tradition of hazardous cliff climbing to wrest precious commodity from nests of apis giant himalayan honeybee honey thus collected by gurung owes its inebriating properties to nectar which giant bees
