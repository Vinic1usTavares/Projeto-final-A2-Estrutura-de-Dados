norton priory is a historic site in norton runcorn cheshire england comprising remains of an abbey complex dating from 12th to 16th centuries and an 18th century country house it is now a museum remains are a scheduled ancient monument and are recorded in national heritage list for england as a designated grade i listed building they are considered to be most important monastic remains in cheshire priory was established as an augustinian foundation in 12th century and was raised to status of an abbey in 1391 abbey was closed in 1536 as part of dissolution of monasteries nine years later surviving structures together with manor of norton were purchased by sir richard brooke who built a tudor house on site incorporating part of abbey this was replaced in 18th century by a georgian house brooke family left house in 1921 and it was partially demolished in 1928 in 1966 site was given in trust for use of general public excavation of site began in 1971 and became largest to be carried out by modern methods on any european monastic site it revealed foundations and lower parts of walls of monastery buildings and abbey church important finds included a norman doorway a finely carved arcade a floor of mosaic tiles largest floor area of this type to be found in any modern excavation remains of kiln where tiles were fired a bell casting pit used for casting bell and a large medieval statue of saint christopher site was opened to public in 1970s it includes a museum excavated ruins and surrounding garden and woodland in 1984 separate walled garden was redesigned and opened to public norton priory is now a visitor attraction and museum trust organises a programme of events exhibitions educational courses and outreach projects in august 2016 a larger and much extended museum opened history priory in 1115 a community of augustinian canons was founded in burh of runcorn by william fitz nigel second baron of halton and constable of chester on south bank of river mersey where it narrows to form runcorn gap this was only practical site where mersey could be crossed between warrington and birkenhead and archaeologists fraser brown and christine howard davis consider it likely that canons cared for travellers and pilgrims crossing river they also speculate that william may have sought to profit from tolls paid by these travellers priory was second religious house to be founded in earldom of chester first was benedictine st werburgh s abbey at chester founded in 1093 by hugh lupus first earl of chester priory at runcorn had a double dedication to saint bertelin and to saint mary authors of victoria county history suggest that dedication to st bertelin was taken from a saxon church already existing on site in 1134 william fitz william third baron of halton moved priory to a site in norton a village to east of runcorn reasons for move are uncertain it may have been that fitz william wanted greater control of strategic crossing of mersey at runcorn gap or it may have been because canons wanted a more secluded site nothing remains of site of original priory in runcorn thumb right 380px plan of priory in 12th century left and 13th

location site for new priory was in damp scrubby woodland there is no evidence that it was agricultural land or that it contained any earlier buildings first priority was to clear and drain land there were freshwater springs near site and these would have provided fresh running water for latrines and domestic purposes they would also have been used to create watercourses and moated enclosures some of which might have been used for orchards and herb gardens sandstone for building priory was available at an outcrop nearby sand for mortar could be obtained from shores of river mersey and boulder clay on site provided material for floor and roof tiles excavation has revealed remnants of oak some of it from trees hundreds of years old it is likely that this came from various sources some from nearby and some donated from forests at delamere and macclesfield church and monastic buildings were constructed in romanesque style priory was endowed by william fitz nigel with properties in cheshire lancashire nottinghamshire lincolnshire and oxfordshire including churches of st mary great budworth and st michael chester by 1195 priory owned eight churches five houses tithe of at least eight mills rights of common in four townships and one tenth of profits from runcorn ferry prior supplied chaplain to hereditary constables of chester and to barons of halton during 12th century main benefactors of priory were barons of halton but after 1200 their gifts reduced mainly because they transferred their interests to cistercian abbey at stanlow which had been founded in 1178 by john fitz richard sixth baron archaeologist j patrick greene states that it is unlikely that any of barons of halton were buried in norton priory only members of family known to be buried there are richard brother of roger de lacy seventh baron and a female named alice identity of alice has not been confirmed but greene considers that she was niece of william earl warenne 5th earl of surrey and therefore a relative of delacy family who were at that time barons of halton earl made a grant to priory of 30 shillings a year in order to maintain a for her soul as role played by barons of halton declined so importance of members of dutton family increased duttons had been benefactors since priory s foundation and from 13th century they became principal benefactors there were two main branches of family one in dutton and other in sutton weaver dutton family had their own burial chapel in priory and burial in chapel is specified in three wills made by members of family aston family of aston were also important benefactors priory buildings including church were extended during late 12th and early 13th centuries it has been estimated that original community would have consisted of 12 canons and prior this increased to around 26 members in later part of 12th century making it one of largest houses in augustinian order by end of century church had been lengthened a new and larger chapter house had been built i on plan and a large chapel had been added to east end of church n in about 1200 west front of church was enlarged m a bell tower was built and guest quarters were constructed it is possible that chapel at east end was built to accommodate holy cross of norton a relic which was reputed to have miraculous healing powers a fire in 1236 destroyed timber built kitchen q and damaged west range of monastic buildings and roof of church kitchen was rebuilt and other damage was rapidly repaired abbey during first half of 14th century priory suffered from financial mismanagement and disputes with dutton family exacerbated by a severe flood in 1331 that reduced income from priory s lands direct effects of black death are not known but during 1350s financial problems continued these were party mitigated with selling of advowson of church at ratcliffe on soar matters further improved from 1366 with appointment of richard wyche as prior he was active in governance of wider augustinian order and in political affairs and in 1391 was involved in raising priory s status to that of a mitred abbey a mitred abbey was one in which abbot was given permission to use pontifical insignia including mitre ring and pontifical staff and to give solemn benediction provided a bishop was not present it was rare for an augustinian house to be elevated to this status out of about 200 augustinian houses in england and wales 28 were abbeys and only seven of these became mitred only other mitred abbey in cheshire was that of st werburgh in chester in 1379 and in 1381 there were 15 canons at norton and in 1401 there were 16 making it largest augustinian community in northwest of england by this time barony of halton had passed by a series of marriages to duchy of lancaster john of gaunt 1st duke of lancaster and 14th baron of halton agreed to be patron of newly formed abbey at this date church was long it was second longest augustinian church in northwest england exceeded only by long church at carlisle towards end of 14th century abbey acquired a giant statue of saint christopher three wills from members of dutton family from this period survive they are dated 1392 1442 and 1527 and in each will money was bequeathed to foundation thumb left model of abbey as it is thought it would have appeared in 16th century alt an abbey model seen from an elevated position from southeast abbey s fortunes went into decline after death of richard wyche in 1400 wyche was succeeded by his prior john shrewsbury who does not seem to have done more than keep house in order frequent floods had reduced its income and in 1429 church and other abbey buildings were described as being ruinous problems continued through rest of 15th century resulting in sale of more advowsons by 1496 number of canons had been reduced to nine and to seven in 1524 in 1522 there were reports of disputes between abbot and prior abbot was accused of wasting house s resources nepotism relations with women and other matters while prior admitted to fornication and lapses in observation of rule prior threatened abbot with a knife but then left abbey physical state of buildings continued to deteriorate records of priory and abbey have not survived but excavations and study of other documents have produced evidence of how monastic lands were managed principal source of income came from farming this income was required not only for building and upkeep of property but also for feeding canons their guests and visiting pilgrims priory also had an obligation from its foundation to house travellers fording mersey it has been estimated that nearly half of demesne lands were used for arable farming grain grown on priory lands was ground by a local windmill and by a watermill outside priory lands excavations revealed part of a stone in area used in monastic kitchen in addition to orchards and herb gardens in moated enclosures it is likely that beehives were maintained for production of honey there is evidence from bone fragments that cattle sheep pigs geese and chickens were reared and consumed but few bone fragments from deer rabbits or hares have been discovered was not eaten although few fish bones have been discovered it is known from documentary evidence that canons owned a number of local fisheries fuel used consisted of wood and charcoal and turf from marshes over which priory had rights of to cut turf events in 1536 surrounding fate of abbey at dissolution of monasteries are complicated and included a dispute between sir piers dutton who was in a powerful position as sheriff of cheshire and sir william brereton deputy chamberlain of chester dutton s estate was next to that of abbey and dutton plotted to gain some of its land from crown after dissolution while brereton supported abbot against dutton and held lucrative position of steward of abbey a campaign of vilification was directed at canons asserting that they were guilty of debauched conduct then in 1535 dutton falsely accused abbot and brereton of issuing counterfeit coins this charge was dismissed mainly because one of dutton s witnesses was considered to be unconvincing playing into duttons hands was gross undervaluation of abbey s assets as reported to royal commissioners of valor ecclesiasticus of 1535 as a result of which net annual income of abbey was recorded falsely as falling below ps200 threshold that would subsequently be chosen for first round of dissolutions in 1536 although whether this subterfuge was due to machinations of dutton or abbot or both remains unclear brereton and abbot appear to have attempted to have dissolution cancelled subject to payment of a fine as was case in large numbers of other houses in similar circumstances but in abbot s absence dissolution commissioners arrived unannounced at abbey in early october 1536 there was considerable opposition commissioners being menaced by around 300 local people for whom abbot rushing back threw an impromptu feast complete with roasted ox according to dutton s account after barricading themselves in a tower commissioners managed to send a letter to dutton who arrived with a force of men in middle of night most of rioters fled but dutton arrested abbot and four of canons who were sent to halton castle and then to prison in chester dutton sent a report of events to henry viii who demanded that if abbot and canons had behaved as dutton reported they should be immediately executed as traitors however because kings instructions had been conveyed by lord chancellor in form of letters to both dutton and brereton two faction leaders would be required to act together to effect them with consequence that brereton was temporarily able to stall any such action by refusing to meet with dutton events elsewhere in country further delayed execution and following an intercession to thomas cromwell whose own informal contacts had cast doubt on reliability of dutton s reports abbot and canons were discharged and awarded pensions abbey was made uninhabitable lead from roof bell metal and other valuable materials were confiscated for king and building lay empty for nine years estate came into ownership of crown and it was managed by brereton from evidence of damage to tiled floor of church brown and howard davis conclude it is likely that church was demolished at an early stage but otherwise archaeological evidence for this period is sparse and largely negative country house thumb 300px engraving of tudor house from west by buck brothers dated 1727 alt a courtyard showing a range at back that includes a tower a stairway leading to an arched entrance and a range of half timbered buildings on left side is a towered gateway and a narrow turret to right is a two storey building with battlements and a stair turret in 1545 abbey and manor of norton were sold to sir richard brooke for a little over ps1 512 brooke built a house in tudor style which became known as norton hall using as its core former abbot s lodgings and west range of monastic buildings it is not certain which other monastic buildings remained when abbey was bought by brookes excavations suggest that cloisters were still present a 17th century sketch plan by one of randle holme family shows that gatehouse remained at that time although almost all church had been demolished an engraving by buck brothers dated 1727 shows that little changed by next century during civil war house was attacked by a force of royalists brookes were first family in north cheshire to declare allegiance to parliamentary side halton castle was a short distance away and was held by earl rivers for royalists in february 1643 a large force from castle armed with cannon attacked house which was defended by only 80 men henry brooke successfully defended house with only one man wounded while royalists lost 16 men including their cannonier gunner they burnt two barns and plundered brooke s tenants but returned home with shame and hatred of country thumb left georgian house before 1868 alt a house seen from an angle main front has nine bays central three of which protrude forward and a double staircase leads to main entrance on first floor sheep graze in foreground at some time between 1727 and 1757 tudor house was demolished and replaced by a new house in georgian style house had an l plan main wing facing west standing on footprint of tudor house with a south wing at right angles to it ground floor of west wing retained former vaulted undercroft of west range of medieval abbey and contained kitchens and areas for storage of wines and beers first floor was piano nobile containing main reception rooms west front was symmetrical in three storeys with a double flight of stairs leading up to main entrance morriss r in clearance of other surviving remnants of monastic buildings had started but moated enclosures were still in existence at that time a drawing dated 1770 shows that by then all these buildings and moats had been cleared away and former fishponds were being used for pleasure boating between 1757 and early 1770s modifications were made to house main one being addition of a north wing morriss r in according to authors of buildings of england series architect responsible for this was james wyatt also between 1757 and 1770 brooke family built a walled garden at a distance from house to provide fruit vegetables and flowers family also developed woodland around house creating pathways a stream glade and a rock garden brick built wine bins were added to undercroft developing it into a wine cellar and barrel vaulting was added to former entrance hall to abbey which was known as outer parlour obscuring its arcade morriss r in during mid 18th century sir richard brooke was involved in a campaign to prevent bridgewater canal from being built through his estate bridgewater canal extension act had been passed in 1762 and it made allowances for limited disturbance to norton estate however sir richard did not see necessity for canal and opposed its passing through his estate in 1773 canal was opened from manchester to runcorn except for across estate which meant that goods had to be unloaded and carted around it eventually sir richard capitulated and canal was completed throughout its length by march 1776 thumb wine bins in undercroft alt two brick built arched wine bins each divided into four sections lower ones being larger than upper by 1853 a service range had been added to south wing of house in 1868 external flight of stairs was removed from west front and a new porch entrance was added to its ground floor entrance featured a norman doorway that had been moved from elsewhere in monastery greene believes that it probably formed entrance from west cloister walk into nave of church an exact replica of this doorway was built and placed to north of norman doorway making a double entrance whole of undercroft was radically restored giving it a gothic theme adding stained glass windows and a medieval style fireplace ground to south of house was levelled and formal gardens were established morriss r in during 19th century estate was again affected by transport projects in 1804 runcorn to latchford canal was opened replacing mersey and irwell navigation this cut off northern part of estate making it only accessible by a bridge grand junction railway was built across estate in 1837 followed by warrington and chester railway which opened in 1850 both of these lines affected southeast part of estate in 1894 runcorn to latchford canal was replaced by manchester ship canal and northern part of estate could only be accessed by a swing bridge brooke family left house in 1921 and it was almost completely demolished in 1928 rubble from house was used in foundations of a new chemical works during demolition undercroft was retained and roofed with a cap of concrete in 1966 current sir richard brooke gave norton priory in trust for benefit of public excavations and museum in 1971 j patrick greene was given a contract to carry out a six month excavation for runcorn development corporation as part of a plan to develop a park in centre of runcorn new town site consisted of a area of fields and woods to north of bridgewater canal greene s initial findings led to his being employed for a further 12 years to supervise a major excavation of site buildings found included norman doorway with its victorian addition and three medieval rooms specialists were employed and local volunteers were recruited to assist with excavation while teams of supervised prisoners were used to perform some of heavier work area excavated exceeded that at any european monastic site that used modern methods development corporation decided to create a museum on site and in 1975 norton priory museum trust was established in 1989 greene published his book about excavations entitled norton priory archaeology of a medieval religious house further work has been carried out recording and analysing archaeological findings in 2008 fraser brown and christine howard davis published norton priory monastery to museum in which findings are described in more detail howard davis was largely responsible for post excavation assessment and for compiling a database for artefacts and with brown for their analysis findings from excavations priory 1134 1236 excavations have revealed information about original priory buildings and grounds and how they were subsequently modified a series of ditches was found that would have provided a supply of fresh water and also a means for drainage of a relatively wet site evidence of earliest temporary timber buildings in which canons were originally housed was found in form of 12th century post pits norton priory is one of few monastic sites to have produced evidence of temporary quarters remains of at least seven temporary buildings have been discovered it is considered that largest of these because it had more substantial foundations than others was probably timber framed church another was most likely gatehouse and other buildings provided accommodation for canons and senior secular craftsmen thumb left norman doorway in undercroft alt a highly decorated arched norman doorway with a further lower arch beyond leading to a room with a window containing stained glass earliest masonry building was church which was constructed on shallow foundations of sandstone rubble and pebbles on boulder clay walls were built in local red sandstone with ashlar faces and a rubble and mortar core ground plan of original church was cruciform and consisted of a nave without aisles a choir at crossing with a tower above it a square ended chancel and north and south transepts each with an eastern chapel total length of church was and total length across transepts was giving a ratio of 2 1 walls of church were wide at base and crossing tower was supported on four piers other early buildings were built surrounding a cloister to south of church east range incorporated chapter house and also contained sacristy canons dormitory and reredorter upper storey of west range provided living accommodation for prior and an area where secular visitors could be received in lower storey was undercroft where food and fuel were stored south range contained refectory and at a distance from south range stood kitchen evidence of a bell foundry dating from this period was found to north of church it is likely that this was used for casting a tenor bell a few moulded stones from this early period were found these included nine blocks that probably formed part of a corbel table there were also two beak head voussoirs this type of is rare in cheshire and has been found in only one other church in county considerable expansion occurred during last two decades of 12th century and first two or three decades of 13th century south and west ranges were demolished and rebuilt enlarging cloister from about by to about by this meant that a door in south wall of church had to be blocked off and a new highly decorated doorway was built at northeast corner of cloister this doorway has survived lower storey of west range other standing remains of priory also dates from this period it comprises cellarer s undercroft and a passage to its north known as outer parlour outer parlour had been entrance to priory from outside world and was sumptuously decorated so that power and wealth of priory could be displayed in tangible fashion to those coming from secular world undercroft used for storage was divided into two chambers and its decoration was much plainer upper floor has been lost it is considered that this contained prior s living quarters and possibly a chapel over outer parlour a new and larger reredorter was built at end of east range and it is believed that work might have started on a new chapter house a system of stone drains was constructed to replace previous open ditches west wall of church was demolished and replaced by a more massive structure thick at base east wall was also demolished and chancel was extended forming an additional area measuring approximately by priory and abbey 1236 1536 excavation revealed evidence of fire of 1236 including ash charcoal burnt planks and a burnt wooden bowl it is thought that fire probably started in timber built kitchens at junction of west and south ranges and then spread to monastic buildings and church most of wood in buildings including furnishings and roofs would have been destroyed although masonry walls remained largely intact major repairs required gave an opportunity for extension of church by addition of new chapels to both of transepts and its refurbishment in a manner even grander than previously cloister had been badly damaged in fire and its arcade was rebuilt on previous foundations new arcade was of very high quality and finely wrought construction brown and howard davis state that kitchens were rebuilt on same site and it appears that they were rebuilt in timber yet again excavations have found evidence of a second bell foundry in northwest of priory grounds date of this is uncertain but greene suggests that it was built to cast a new bell to replace original one that was damaged in fire later in 13th century another chapel was added to north transept accommodation for guests was constructed to southwest of monastic buildings in later part of 13th century and during following century chapel in south transept was replaced by a grander two chambered chapel this balanced enlarged chapels in north transept restoring church s cruciform plan around this time east end of church was further extended when a reliquary chapel was added measuring about by a guest hall was built to west of earlier guest quarters after status of foundation was elevated from a priory to an abbey a tower house was added to west range this is shown on engraving by buck brothers but it has left little in way of archaeological remains church was extended by addition of a north aisle there is little evidence of later major alterations before dissolution there is evidence to suggest that cloister was rebuilt and that alterations were made to east range burials thumb 300px coffins found at norton priory alt two open stone coffins lying at an angle to each other one in foreground being badly cracked in front of them is lower part of trunk of a tree excavations revealed information about burials carried out within church and monastic buildings and in surrounding grounds they are considered to be either those of augustinian canons privileged members of their lay household or of important members of dutton family most burials were in stone coffins or in wooden coffins with stone lids and had been carried out from late 12th century up to time of dissolution site of burial depended on status of individual whether they were clerical or lay and their degree of importance priors abbots and high ranking canons were buried within church with those towards east end of church being most important other canons were buried in a graveyard outside church in an area to south and east of chancel members of laity were buried either in church towards west end of nave or in north aisle or outside church around its west end it is possible that there was a lay cemetery to north and west of church addition of chapels to north transept and their expansion was carried out for dutton family making it their burial chapel or family mausoleum butler lawrence in and highest concentration of burials was found in this part of church it is considered that north aisle built after priory became an abbey was added to provide a burial place for members of laity excavations revealed 49 stone coffins 30 coffin lids and five headstones twelve of lids were carved in high relief with designs including flowers or foliage one lid depicts an oak tree issuing from a human head in style of a green man another has a cross a dragon and a female effigy while others have shield and sword motifs two contain inscriptions in norman french identifying deceased remaining lids have simpler incised patterns mainly decorated crosses headstones contain crosses butler lawrence in most of coffins were sunk into ground with lid at level of floor although a few were found within walls only three stone coffins for children were discovered these lay in a group together with a coffin containing a male skeleton in vestibule leading to enlarged chapter house most prestigious type of coffin was tapered towards feet with head end carved externally to a hemi hexagonal shape another sign of higher status was provision of an internal pillow for head butler lawrence in thumb left carved coffin lids alt five tapering coffin lids and a circular object all are carved with a variety of types of decorated crosses a total of 144 graves was excavated they contained 130 articulated skeletons in a suitable condition for examination boylston anthea in of these 36 were well preserved 48 were in a fair condition and 46 were poorly preserved boylston anthea in males out numbered females by a ratio of three to one an expected ratio in a monastic site most of males had survived into middle age 36 45 years to old age 46 years or older while equal numbers of females died before and after age of about 45 years one female death was presumably due to a complication of pregnancy as she had been carrying a 34 week foetus boylston anthea in average height of adult males was and that of adult females was boylston anthea in bones show a variety of diseases and degenerative processes six skeletons showed evidence of paget s disease of bone osteitis deformans boylston anthea in most severe case of paget s disease was in a body buried in nave in a stone coffin lid was carved with two shields indicating that occupant had been a knight boylston anthea in one skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in face hands and feet boylston anthea in no definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of lungs boylston anthea in only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of down s syndrome relatively minor congenital abnormalities of spine were found in 19 skeletons ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae and transitional vertebrae boylston anthea in definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases boylston anthea in one cranium contained a large circular lesion which may have been consequence of boylston anthea in other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis dish and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy boylston anthea in three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets two had changes of osteoporosis and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis a metabolic condition affecting post menopausal women boylston anthea in benign tumours of bone were found in three cases boylston anthea in examination of jaws and teeth gave information about dental health of those buried in priory degree of wear of teeth was greater than it is at present while incidence of dental caries was much lower than it is now as was incidence of periodontal disease a consequence of wear of teeth was compensatory eruption of teeth in order to keep contact with opposing teeth it was concluded that people buried in priory had few problems with their teeth or jaws loss of teeth was due to wear of teeth rather than from caries or periodontal disease ogden alan in country house little archaeological evidence relates to period immediately after dissolution or to tudor house built on part of site a was found in outer courtyard it is considered that this might date from early period of brookes house or it may have been constructed during later years of abbey kitchens to south of tudor house and their drainage systems appear to have been used by brookes and according to brown and howard davis were possibly rebuilt by family areas previously occupied by cloisters and guest quarters were probably used as middens few archaeological findings remain from georgian house apart from a fragment of a wall from south front morriss r in and foundations of north wing much altered medieval undercroft still stands with its norman doorway and victorian replica barrel vaulting wine bins and blind arcading in former outer parlour johnson nick in artefacts from buildings thumb montage of mosaic tiles in museum alt an array of tiles of differing shapes and colours a large number of tiles and tile fragments that had lined floor of church and some of monastic buildings were found in excavations keen laurence in oldest tiles date from early 14th century total area of tiles discovered was about and is largest area of a floor of this type to be found in any modern excavation site has largest and most varied excavated collection of medieval tiles in north west and greatest variety of individual mosaic shapes found anywhere in britain keen laurence in tiles found made a pavement forming floor of choir of church and transepts chancel floor was probably also tiled these tiles have not survived because chancel was at a higher level than rest of church and tiles would have been removed during subsequent gardening a dump of tiles to south of site of chapter house suggests that this was also tiled in 15th century a second tile floor was laid on top of original floor in choir where it had become worn tiles on original floor were of various shapes forming a mosaic tiles were all glazed and coloured main colours being black green and yellow many of them had been decorated by impressing a wooden stamp into moist clay before it was fired these are known as line impressed tiles line impressed designs included masks of lions or other animals rosettes and trefoils keen laurence in other tiles or tile fragments showed portions of trees foliage birds and inscriptions keen laurence in in chapels of north transept burial place of dutton family were tiles depicting mail thought to be part of a military effigy and tiles bearing fragments of heraldic designs keen laurence in tiles from upper later pavement were all square and again were line inscribed with patterns forming parts of larger designs keen laurence in a related discovery at excavation was kiln in which most of tiles on site were fired thumb left 150px capital and spandrel from reconstructed arcade in museum alt top of a column and base of two arches in spandrel is a carving of an otter like creature capital is decorated with a carved head and foliage excavations also revealed stones or fragments of carved stone dating from 12th to 16th centuries harrison stuart in earliest are in romanesque style and include two voussoirs decorated with grotesque animal heads with long pointed bird like beaks other stones dating from 12th century are in gothic style they include a capital decorated with leaves and a portion of tracery from a rose window harrison stuart in many of stones from 13th century were originally part of cloister arcade and had been re used to form core of a later cloister arcade they include stones sculpted with depictions of humans and animals best preserved of these are heads of two canons each wearing a cowl with tonsure visible head of a woman with shoulder length hair parts of a seated figure holding an open book and a creature that might represent a serpent or an otter harrison stuart in there are numerous fragments dating from 14th and 15th centuries these include portions of string courses tracery corbels window jambs and arch heads at least three of corbels were carved in form of human heads harrison stuart in over 1 500 fragments of painted medieval glass were found most of it in a poor condition these show that glazing scheme used in priory was mainly in grisaille monochrome style almost 1 300 fragments of glass from later periods vose ruth hurst in and nearly 1 150 sherds of ceramic roof tiles were also found dawson jo with sean in artefacts from daily life some 500 fragments of pottery were found dating from medieval period most of these were parts of jars jugs or pipkins and were found in area of kitchen range most of it was produced locally although 13 sherds of stamford ware fragments of two jugs from north france and two small pieces of saintonge pottery have been identified only a few wooden bowls were recovered vaughan jenny in much more pottery was found dating from post medieval period and later again most of this had been manufactured in england especially in staffordshire fragments of pottery from abroad included pieces from a westerwald mug a jug from cologne and items of chinese porcelain excavations produced over 4 000 sherds of glass dating from 12th to 20th centuries but only 16 of these came from period before dissolution vose ruth hurst in a total of 1 170 fragments from clay tobacco pipes were found dating from about 1580 to early 20th century davey peter j in six medieval coins were recovered earliest of which was a silver penny of john from early 13th century coins from later periods were a silver threepence from reign of elizabeth i and a silver penny from charles i only low denomination coins were found from 18th century and later including a 10 pfennig piece from germany dated 1901 two silver spoons were recovered one of which was dated 1846 from hallmark objects made from copper alloy were found many of which were associated with personal adornment and dress including brooches buckles and buttons also found from this period was a small simple scabbard tip and part of a skimmer that had been used in kitchen artefacts made from iron other than nails were again mainly items of personal adornment and dress other identifiable iron items from this period included keys two possible spurs spurs with revolving pointed wheels and about 12 horseshoes nearly 2 000 fragments of lead were found 940 of which were droplets of melted metal some of these being a consequence of fire in 1236 one of earliest artefacts was a papal bulla dating from rule of pope
