battle of bicocca or la bicocca was fought on 27 april 1522 during italian war of 1521 26 a combined french and venetian force under odet of foix viscount of lautrec was decisively defeated by an imperial spanish and papal army under overall command of prospero colonna lautrec then withdrew from lombardy leaving duchy of milan in imperial hands having been driven from milan by an imperial advance in late 1521 lautrec had regrouped attempting to strike at colonna s lines of communication when swiss mercenaries in french service did not receive their pay however they demanded an immediate battle and lautrec was forced to attack colonna s fortified position in park of villa bicocca north of milan swiss pikemen advanced over open fields under heavy artillery fire to assault imperial positions but were halted at a sunken road backed by earthworks having suffered massive casualties from fire of spanish arquebusiers swiss retreated meanwhile an attempt by french cavalry to flank colonna s position proved equally ineffective swiss unwilling to fight further marched off to their cantons a few days later and lautrec retreated into venetian territory with remnants of his army battle is noted chiefly for marking end of swiss dominance among infantry of italian wars and of swiss method of assaults by massed columns of pikemen without support from other troops it was also one of first engagements in which firearms played a decisive role on battlefield prelude at start of war in 1521 holy roman emperor charles v and pope leo x moved jointly against duchy of milan principal french possession in lombardy a large papal force under federico ii gonzaga duke of mantua together with spanish troops from naples and some smaller italian contingents concentrated near mantua oman art of war 174 german forces which charles sent south to aid this venture passed through venetian territory near valeggio unmolested combined papal spanish and imperial army then proceeded into french territory under command of prospero colonna oman art of war 174 175 apparent inability of venetians to prevent enemy passage through their territory prompted a number of complaints from french for next several months colonna fought an evasive war of maneuver against odet of foix viscount of lautrec french commander besieging cities but refusing to give battle oman art of war 175 oman writes that colonna refused battle several times raised siege of parma when it was almost in his hands rather than risk anything and wearied out lautrec by retreats and flank movements by autumn of 1521 lautrec who was holding a line along adda river to cremona began to suffer massive losses from desertion particularly among his swiss mercenaries oman art of war 175 oman cites contemporary reports of 4 000 swiss remaining out of an initial 20 000 colonna took opportunity this offered and advancing close to alps crossed adda at lautrec lacking infantry and assuming year s campaign to be over withdrew to milan oman art of war 175 176 colonna had no intention of stopping his advance however on night of november 23 he launched a surprise attack on city overwhelming venetian troops defending one of walls following some abortive street fighting lautrec withdrew to cremona with about 12 000 men oman art of war 176 lautrec s remaining forces consisted of 5 500 french and 6 400 venetian troops by january 1522 french had lost alessandria pavia and como and francesco ii sforza bringing further german reinforcements had slipped past a venetian force at bergamo to join colonna in milan oman art of war 176 only como was actually besieged by imperial troops other two cities rose up against french and drove them out lautrec had meanwhile been reinforced by arrival of 16 000 fresh swiss pikemen and some further venetian forces as well as additional companies of french troops under command of thomas de foix lescun and pedro navarro he had also secured services of giovanni de medici who brought his black bands into french service oman art of war 176 giovanni had been in papal service but reneged on his contract claiming that it had been made with recently dead pope leo x and not with his successor pope adrian vi french proceeded to attack novara and pavia hoping to draw colonna into a decisive battle oman art of war 176 177 colonna leaving milan fortified himself in monastery of south of city considering this position to be too strong to be easily assaulted lautrec attempted instead to threaten colonna s lines of communication by sweeping around milan to monza cutting roads from city into alps oman art of war 176 177 lautrec was suddenly confronted however with intransigence of swiss who formed largest contingent of french army they complained that they had not received any of pay promised them since their arrival in lombardy swiss captains led by albert von stein demanded that lautrec attack imperial army immediately else mercenaries would abandon french and return to their cantons lautrec reluctantly acquiesced and marched south towards milan arfaioli black bands 10 oman art of war 177 178 battle 300px thumb right a diagram of battle lautrec s movements are indicated in blue colonna s in red dispositions colonna had meanwhile relocated to a formidable new position manor park of bicocca about four miles 6 km north of milan park was situated between a large expanse of marshy ground to west and main road into milan to east along this road ran a deep wet ditch which was crossed by a narrow stone bridge some distance south of park north side of park was bordered by a sunken road colonna deepened this and constructed an earthen rampart on southern bank imperial artillery placed on several platforms jutting forward from earthworks was able to sweep fields north of park as well as parts of sunken road itself hall weapons and warfare 175 oman art of war 178 179 oman notes that descriptions of ground on north side of park in contemporary sources vary with some referring to a sunken road while others refer to a ditch entire length of north side of park was less than which permitted colonna to place his troops quite densely immediately behind rampart were four ranks of spanish arquebusiers commanded by fernando d avalos marquess of they were backed by spanish pikemen and german landsknechts under georg frundsberg oman art of war 178 179 taylor art of war 51 52 most of imperial cavalry was placed at south end of park far behind infantry a separate force of cavalry was positioned to south guarding bridge oman art of war 179 taylor art of war 125 oman suggests that d avalos and other spanish commanders remembered result of precipitous advance made by spanish cavalry at battle of ravenna ten years prior and positioned cavalry further back to avoid a repeat on evening of 26 april lautrec sent a force of about 400 cavalry under sieur de pontdormy to reconnoiter imperial positions patrol reported that ground was cut by irrigation ditches and ill suited for maneuvering but this failed to dissuade swiss oman art of war 179 colonna having observed french presence sent messengers to milan to request reinforcements francesco sforza arrived next morning with 6 400 additional troops joining cavalry near bridge to south of colonna s camp oman art of war 179 milanese force included 400 cavalry and 6 000 infantry oman describes latter as indifferent and suggests that they were primarily city militia at dawn on 27 april lautrec began his attack black bands brushed aside spanish pickets clearing ground before imperial positions french advance was headed by two columns of swiss each comprising about 4 000 to 7 000 men accompanied by some artillery this party was to assault entrenched front of imperial camp

180 pontdormy trailed lescun with a separate cavalry force to ensure that he was not attacked from flank remainder of french army including french infantry bulk of heavy cavalry and remnants of swiss formed up in a broad line some distance behind two swiss columns behind this was a third line composed of venetian forces under francesco maria della rovere duke of urbino oman art of war 180 181 venetian line was shifted somewhat to french right and faced imperial camp on side protected by marshes swiss attack overall command of swiss assault was given to anne de montmorency as swiss columns advanced towards park he ordered them to pause and wait for french artillery to bombard imperial defences but swiss refused to obey oman art of war 180 taylor art of war 126 perhaps swiss captains doubted that artillery would have any effect on earthworks historian charles oman suggests that it is more likely they were inspired by blind and self confidence oman art of war 180 oman notes that this theory was popular among french observers of battle in any case swiss moved rapidly towards colonna s position leaving artillery behind there was apparently some rivalry between two columns as one commanded by arnold winkelried of unterwalden was composed of men from rural cantons while other under albert von stein consisted of contingents from bern and urban cantons oman art of war 180 advancing swiss quickly came into range of imperial artillery unable to take cover on level fields they began to take substantial casualties as many as a thousand swiss may have been killed by time columns reached imperial lines oman art of war 180 181 thumb left 200px anne de montmorency painted by jean clouet c 1530 montmorency commanded swiss assault and was only survivor among french nobles who accompanied it swiss came to a sudden halt as columns reached sunken road in front of park depth of road and height of rampart behind it together higher than length of swiss pikes effectively blocked their advance moving down into road swiss suffered massive casualties from fire of d avalos s arquebusiers hall weapons and warfare 175 oman art of war 181 oman relates that all standards went down and that three or four first ranks perished wholesale nevertheless swiss made a series of desperate attempts to breach imperial line some parties managed to reach top of rampart only to be met by landsknechts who had come up from behind arquebusiers one of swiss captains was apparently killed by frundsberg in single combat and swiss unable to form up atop earthworks were pushed back down into sunken road hall weapons and warfare 175 oman art of war 182 arnold winkelried and albert von stein are each named as frundsberg s opponent in contemporary sources oman suggests that winkelried s actions here may have caused his name to appear in legend of arnold winkelried of sempach after attempting to move forward for about half an hour remnants of swiss columns retreated back towards main french line in fields which they had crossed and before rampart they left more than 3 000 dead among these were twenty two captains including both winkelried and albert von stein oman art of war 182 of french nobles who had accompanied swiss assault only montmorency survived oman art of war 182 montmorency was badly wounded and had to be carried out of sunken road denouement lescun with about 400 heavy cavalry under his command had meanwhile reached bridge south of park and fought his way across it and into imperial camp beyond oman art of war 182 colonna responded by detaching some cavalry under antonio de leyva to halt french advance while francesco sforza came up road towards bridge aiming to surround lescun pontdormy held off milanese allowing lescun to extricate himself from camp french cavalry then retraced its path and rejoined main body of army oman art of war 182 183 oman notes that engagement between pontdormy and sforza is only mentioned in a single contemporary account despite urging of d avalos and several other imperial commanders colonna refused to order a general attack on french pointing out that much of lautrec s army including bulk of his cavalry was still intact colonna suggested that french were already beaten and would soon withdraw this assessment was shared by frundsberg oman art of war 183 oman notes that some contemporary chroniclers suggested that frundsberg s reticence was due to landsknechts demands for double pay if they engaged in a second fight but considers story improbable nevertheless some small groups of spanish arquebusiers and light cavalry attempted to pursue withdrawing swiss only to be beaten back by black bands which were covering removal of french artillery from field oman art of war 183 colonna s judgement proved to be accurate swiss were unwilling to make another assault and marched for home on 30 april lautrec believing that his resulting weakness in infantry made a further campaign impossible retreated to east crossing adda into venetian territory at trezzo oman art of war 183 184 having reached cremona lautrec left lescun in command of remnants of french army and rode unescorted to lyon to make his report to francis i oman art of war 184 aftermath lautrec s departure heralded a complete collapse of french position in northern italy no longer menaced by french army colonna and d avalos marched on genoa capturing it after a brief siege oman art of war 186 pedro navarro taken prisoner at genoa spent next three years imprisoned in naples as a punishment for transferring his allegiance to french lescun learning of loss of genoa arranged an agreement with francesco sforza by which castello in milan which still remained in french hands surrendered and remainder of french forces withdrew over alps oman

treaty of madrid which francis was forced to sign after his defeat at battle of pavia would leave italy in imperial hands another effect of battle was changed attitude of swiss francesco guicciardini wrote of aftermath of bicocca they went back to their mountains diminished in numbers but much more diminished in audacity for it is certain that losses which they suffered at bicocca so affected them that in coming years they no longer displayed their vigour oman art of war 184 while swiss mercenaries would continue to take part in italian wars they no longer possessed willingness to make headlong attacks that they had at novara in 1513 or marignano in 1515 their performance at battle of pavia in 1525 would surprise observers by its lack of initiative hall weapons and warfare 175 oman art of

would not be demonstrated until battle of where arquebusiers would prevail against heavy cavalry on open ground two years later weapon nevertheless became a sine qua non for any army which did not wish to grant a massive advantage to its opponents while pikeman would continue to play a vital role in warfare it would be equal to that of together two types of infantry would be combined into so

had become obsolete indeed offensive doctrines in general were increasingly replaced with defensive ones combination of arquebus and effective field fortification had made frontal assaults on
