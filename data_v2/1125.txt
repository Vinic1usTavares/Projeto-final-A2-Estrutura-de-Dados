neglected to take risks with its musical numbers and left her with a stale feeling sandra gonzalez of entertainment weekly was confused by message presented she approved of will emma plot and holly s departure but was dismayed by lack of kurt and blaine and criticized mercedes storyline for its repetitive nature washington post lisa de moraes lambasted league of doom plot which she wrote consisted of two characters whom viewers will barely remember one who is super creepy and another who fans despised she suggested that they were included for contractual rather than storyline reasons though lauded jackson s talent for steal ing every scene he s in futterman also praised jackson s long overdue return cnn s lisa respers france said episode failed to meet her expectations she was concerned that mercedes plot may lead towards character becoming unlikeable and criticized holly s sudden departure though she enjoyed sunshine s return seeing kurt and blaine at mckinley and mercedes solo she noted all of those moments were fleeting and only contributed to uneven feel of show amy reiter of los angeles times called it a quirky mixed bag packed with amusing bits and pieces but very little emotional or musical oomph myles mcnutt of a v club graded episode c he suggested that its purpose was to address two criticisms of show under use of its supporting cast members and maniacal behavior of sue mcnutt wrote not only was execution on these endeavors spotty at best and outright obnoxious at worst but growing futility of continuity in this series renders any and all developments wholly temporary this episode was not a step in right direction so much as it was an escalator to nowhere a week from now chances of any of this resonating in show itself is slim to none he felt that mercedes has become a prop rather than a character and criticized episode for attributing her blame for marginalization writers have subjected her to mtv s aly semigran enjoyed comedy and conclusion of holly s plot in what she deemed a pretty decent episode though found charice s appearance extraneous ign s robert canning gave a night of neglect 8 5 10 and called it a bright and funny installment he too praised comedy storylines particularly league of doom plot and academic decathlon scenes as it s this type of off topic shenanigans read not about fitting in or rachel berry becoming a star that breathes refreshing life into glee and keeps reminding us how funny and entertaining this series can be he was less impressed with benefit concert which he felt harmed episode s pacing and as with gonzalez found nature of mercedes storyline repetitive musical performances right thumb upright episode was criticized for once again cutting down a solo by tina jenna ushkowitz pictured musical performance in episode which entertainment weekly emily exton observed failed to fit neglected criteria also attracted mixed reviews futterman wrote that charice pull ed out all stops with her cover of all by myself which reached power notes that provided a viable threat to rachel and mercedes diva singing wall street journal raymund flandez commended her vocal control and efficiency belying her young age semigran called it a stirring rendition and gonzalez gave it an a her joint highest grade of episode her second a was awarded to bubble toes which she called one of best performances of season semigran concurred mike s dancing is awesome critics disapproved of continuing trend for cutting short tina s solos gonzalez gave her rendition of i follow rivers a b and commented will tina ever get to finish a song well judging by 20 seconds we saw she certainly deserves to futterman called her performance mostly spot on and tvline michael slezak pointed out why is it that every time tina sings remember her sobbing my funny valentine things end weirdly i wish we d gotten a little more vocal and a little less booing in an episode about club s underappreciated talents exton suggested maybe she ll get a chance to do a non comedic relief song in its entirety by season 5 flandez disliked her performance he commented that she sounded like a flailing white swan a poor man s bjork holly s performance of turning tables was considered inferior to original futterman named it her least favorite of paltrow s covers to date and said that her vocals lacked texture that made adele s version so heartbreaking gonzalez gave it her lowest grade of episode a b and semigran opined that while paltrow is a nice enough singer she in no way has chops song requires while flandez called it a scene stealing turn and commended it visually and vocally he noted that paltrow lacks adele s veracity mercedes ain t no way was named best performance of episode by both futterman who enjoyed her powerhouse vocals and new york post jarett wieselman who called it unbelievable and praised focus placed on mercedes following a season which failed to showcase her flandez described number as being sung like star she is and hoped that she would be better used in future in contrast reiter called it a restrained rendition but prettily sung nonetheless and gonzalez struggled to connect with uncharacteristically average song though noted that for mercedes that is still 10 times better than a normal person and awarded it a b references external links a night of neglect at fox
