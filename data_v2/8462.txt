bethena a concert waltz copyright registered march 6 1905 is a composition by scott joplin it was first joplin work since his wife freddie s death on september 10 1904 of pneumonia ten weeks after their wedding at time composer had significant financial problems work did not sell successfully at time of publication and was soon neglected and forgotten it was rediscovered as a result of joplin revival in 1970s and has received acclaim from joplin s biographers and other critics piece combines two different styles of music classical waltz and rag and has been seen as demonstrating joplin s excellence as a classical composer work has been described as an enchantingly beautiful piece that is among greatest of ragtime waltzes a masterpiece and joplin s finest waltz background and composition joplin s principal claim to fame was publication in 1899 of maple leaf rag which became a best selling instrumental hit and provided composer with a steady income for rest of his life from royalties despite this success early on in his career he was named as king of ragtime by numerous contemporaries he had continued financial problems and never repeated success of maple leaf rag berlin 1996 p 57 58 in fall of 1903 joplin lost a large amount of money on national tour of his first opera a guest of honor when box office receipts were stolen by an unidentified associate joplin s belongings including score for opera were confiscated for non payment of his boarding house bills jasen jones 2002 p 21 opera is now considered lost as no copy was registered with copyright office and none has been found since subsequently joplin was short of money and is thought to have been actively seeking commissions after divorce from his first wife belle a disastrous relationship underscored by loss of their infant daughter joplin married his 19 year old second wife freddie in june 1904 he had dedicated to her his rag chrysanthemum which was published in that year she died on 10 september 1904 of pneumonia ten weeks after their wedding jasen jones 2002 p 22 joplin s whereabouts are unknown from that point until early 1905 when he returned to st louis missouri where some of joplin s known associates such as pianist louis chauvin and musician joe jordan still lived berlin 1996 p 145 on 6 march joplin registered copyright of bethena a concert waltz and dedicated work to otherwise little known mr and mrs dan e davenport of st louis mo berlin 1996 p 146 copyright date is significant because not all joplin works were registered for copyright purposes and there is a lack of detail about many aspects of joplin s life including when many of pieces were composed berlin 1996 p 5 index p 325 scott joplin complete piano works new york public library 1981 biographer edward berlin speculated that this dedication was unusual because davenports were not able to help joplin professionally by showcasing his work or commissioning more but was a recognition of personal support that they had given him through difficult time after freddie s death origin of name bethena is a mystery and identity of woman featured on cover of work s original publication is unknown it has been claimed that image is of freddie from her wedding day although positive identification is made more difficult because photograph on cover of piece does not show subject s race clearly berlin 1996 p 147 work was published by t piano manufacturing company st louis a firm which only published two other joplin compositions berlin speculates that at this point in his career despite fame brought by maple leaf rag joplin was unable to arrange favorable terms with publishers for example joplin announced in july 1905 completion of song you stand good with me babe which was never published and no copies of song have ever been found berlin 1996 pp 149 150 bethena was released at a difficult time for joplin both emotionally and financially most of compositions released in two and a half years since death of freddie had been by little known and insignificant publishers were largely unnoticed at time of publication and except for bethena were not quality joplin joplin s finances remained in an unsatisfactory state and he wrote several works for hire berlin 1996 p 161 form right thumb 400px a strain in g major bars 9 13 showing waltz style left hand as well as syncopated melody in right

passages joplin de 2001 p 4 which enable work to change key between strains by means of a chromatic interlude or modulation each of themes is written with instruction cantabile which means and flowing in style piece is notated in 3 4 time with main theme repeated three times in work as well as in introduction and coda sadly poignant graceful wistful and tenderly nostalgic mood is partly dictated by this main theme which starts with melody note a harmonised against a g major chord thus creating a dissonance in next measure theme is set against a different harmony before joplin creates variations there are variants of theme in haunting b minor key of d strain and in e strain s d major key which brightens mood berlin 1996 p 148 chase 1992 p 418 joplin combines waltz oom pa pah rhythm and its conventionally accented three quarter notes in bass with a syncopated melody in treble main melody line used in introduction and then repeated regularly throughout with its alternate unaccented eighth notes and accented quarter notes is rhythm of cakewalk minus final note cakewalk was a popular african american dance which originated in plantation slave communities in nineteenth century america and ultimately contributed to musical style ragtime simultaneous sounding of two independent rhythms he combination of waltz in bass and syncopation of main theme in treble is an example of a 4 against 3 polyrhythm there are many subtle variations of this sequence which occur throughout work left hand follows standard approach of classical waltzes with a bass note followed by two mid range chords and in addition there are some contrapuntal 2005 p unknown where two melodies move independently but complement each other harmonically miller 2005 p 195 for example b and c themes are examples of joplin employing counterpoint in octaves b theme in key of b flat major is closely related to main theme presenting its counterpoint with bass and treble melody lines moving in opposite directions in contrary motion to each other and then exchanging their melodies bars 29 30 and 31 32 this pattern repeats itself during theme in opening phrase bars 77 81 of rag like c theme in key of f major counterpoint is evident with harmony of treble moving in contrary motion to bass line in a similar way to that used in b section in treble harmony falls from f to d while bass rises from f to g sharp critical reception it is not clear what composition s reception was at time and piece s publication by a company which had little previous experience of this endeavour indicate that there was little positive impact on composer s financial problems joplin wanted to be considered as a serious artist and spoke of his preference for classical music compositions such as bethena a concert waltz and his operas a guest of honor and indicate that he was trying to be taken seriously as a composer berlin 1996 p 184 149 like many of his other works bethena was largely forgotten after joplin s death from syphilis in 1917 slow revival and re discovery of ragtime and joplin started in 1940s although it concentrated on rags such as maple leaf rag rather than bethena joshua rifkin s 1970 lp piano rags by

button performance of composition by pianist randy kerber was described by one critic on national public radio as letting inherent wistfulness of music emerge with piece perfectly suited to movie as it was a tender and heartfelt remembrance of a love lost joplin biographer edward a berlin believed that bethena was an enchantingly beautiful piece that is among greatest of ragtime waltzes because of repeated main theme in g major contrapuntal passages and harmonies berlin 1996 p 149 another biographer rudi blesh wrote that work was a masterpiece thanks to its rhythmic variations beauty of each strain s melodies and richly scored harmony especially when considered in comparison to light salon style of binks waltz published in same year blesh janis 1950 p 77 in another publication blesh described work as joplin s finest waltz blesh 1981 p xxiii other critics have praised piece with author of a survey of american music noting that rhythms of waltz and ragtime combined to produce an ingenious and delightful example of such a stylistic accommodation showing that composer was an adventurous classicist par excellence because he was able to combine tradition and innovation in a consistently inventive way another critic arranger of joplin s music for solo guitar wrote that bethena displayed joplin s characteristic syncopated style in a seductive manner even in waltz s 3 4
