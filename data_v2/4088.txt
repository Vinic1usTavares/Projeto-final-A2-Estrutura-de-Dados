agathaeromys is an extinct genus of oryzomyine rodents from pleistocene of bonaire netherlands antilles two species are known which differ in size and some details of tooth morphology larger a donovani type species is known from hundreds of teeth found in four localities that are probably 900 000 to 540 000 years old a praeuniversitatis smaller species is known from 35 teeth found in a single fossil site which is probably 540 000 to 230 000 years old although material of agathaeromys was first described in 1959 genus was not formally named and diagnosed until 2010 it probably belongs to clade d within oryzomyine group together with many other island dwelling species molars of both species possess several accessory crests in addition to main cusps in addition to some differences in features of chewing surface of molars a donovani has more roots on its lower molars than does a praeuniversitatis etymology name agathaeromys combines greek words good air and mouse referring to name of island of bonaire and to fresh air that contributions by marcelo weksler and colleagues brought to classification of oryzomyini zijlstra et al 2010 p 862 cf weksler 2006 weksler et al 2006 name donovani honors stephen donovan for his contributions to scientific knowledge of et al 2010 p 863 and praeuniversitatis refers to leiden university s pre university college which provided an opportunity for zijlstra to participate in project that led to identification of agathaeromys zijlstra et al 2010 p 866 taxonomy material of agathaeromys was first described by dirk hooijer in 1959 in same paper that first named extinct giant rat of curacao megalomys curazensis hooijer described a few fossil teeth and jaws from fontein bonaire as an indeterminate species of thomasomys thomasomys sp and considered them to be similar to species now placed in delomys hooijer 1959 p 18 zijlstra et al 2010 p 861 in his 1974 monograph on geology of abc islands aruba bonaire and curacao three dutch islands off northwestern venezuela paul henri de buisonje listed thomasomys sp from additional fossil sites on bonaire and additionally mentioned oryzomys sp from a different bonaire site seroe grandi de buisonje 1974 pp 83 186 187 216 217 although bonaire material represented one of few fossil records of thomasomys it was only rarely mentioned in literature zijlstra et al 2010 p 861 in 2010 jelle zijlstra anneke madern and lars van den hoek ostende reviewed material they considered it unlikely that bonaire thomasomys would belong to southern brazilian genus delomys or to thomasomys which occurs only in mountains of andes using a cladistic analysis of sigmodontinae they provided evidence that bonaire material belonged to tribe oryzomyini rather than which includes thomasomys zijlstra et al 2010 fig 6 they carried out another cladistic analysis focused on oryzomyini which suggested that bonaire thomasomys and material from seroe grandi de buisonje s oryzomys sp were closely related but distinct from any recognized oryzomyine genus zijlstra et al 2010 fig 7 therefore they named a new oryzomyine genus agathaeromys with two species agathaeromys donovani type species for material previously identified as thomasomys and agathaeromys praeuniversitatis for material from seroe grandi zijlstra et al 2010 p 862 although zijlstra and colleagues could not precisely determine position of agathaeromys within oryzomyini their results suggest that it occupies a position near base of clade d one of major subgroups of oryzomyini this clade contains a number of species only occurring on islands including members of agathaeromys megalomys oryzomys and zijlstra and colleagues suggested that this is related to high proportion of semiaquatic and non forest species in clade d most other oryzomyines are forest dwellers zijlstra et al 2010 pp 870 871 turvey et al 2010 p 766 however subsequent phylogenetic studies based on variations of same data set used by zijlstra and colleagues did not corroborate this placement in their 2012 description of megalomys turvey and colleagues recovered agathaeromys outside each of major groups of oryzomyini turvey et al 2012 fig 3 zijlstra placed agathaeromys within clade c in a clade with oligoryzomys and an undescribed fossil species of oligoryzomys from aruba in his 2012 paper naming dushimys zijlstra 2012 fig 3 as a whole oryzomyini includes over a hundred species in about thirty genera weksler 2006 pp 1 10 weksler et al 2006 p 1 table 1 oryzomyini is one of several tribes within subfamily sigmodontinae of family cricetidae which encompasses hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents distributed chiefly in eurasia and americas musser and carleton 2005 description agathaeromys is characterized mainly on basis of features of molar teeth as usual in muroid rodents there are three molars on both sides of upper jaw referred to as m1 m2 and m3 from front to back and lower jaw referred to as m1 m2 and m3 agathaeromys is generally similar to other oryzomyines but differs from other genera in a variety of details of molar crowns zijlstra et al 2010 pp 862 863 agathaeromys donovani m1 length 2 03 2 84 mm is substantially larger than a praeuniversitatis m1 length 1 77 1 94 mm zijlstra et al 2010 p 869 table 4 upper dentition thumb left right first upper molar of agathaeromys praeuniversitatis cusp at front of m1 anterocone is separated into two smaller cusps by an indentation in a donovani a ridge generally connects two cusps at front margin of tooth so that indentation separating them is closed at front an anteromedian fossette but in a praeuniversitatis it is open toward front an anteromedian flexus an additional crest anteroloph is present behind anterocone further to back there is a pair of cusps protocone at lingual or inner side and paracone at labial or outer side a crest issues from paracone and is attached to front or middle part of protocone behind paracone mesoloph crest is present an additional crest usually connects two at back of tooth there are two additional large cusps hypocone lingual and metacone labial and a prominent crest posteroloph issues from hypocone and is located behind metacone in a donovani metacone is generally connected to posteroloph but in a praeuniversitatis it is directly connected to hypocone valleys that separate cusps extend from lingual and labial margins to about midline of molar in addition to a large root at front and two large roots at back one labial one lingual there is a small additional labial root zijlstra et al 2010 pp 862 864 867 there is no anterocone on m2 but a large anteroloph is present in front of paracone there is a an indentation in crown in front of protocone as in m1 paracone is connected to front or middle of protocone mesoloph is well developed and valleys meet at midline of tooth there are three roots two at labial and one at lingual side m3 is a small triangular tooth there is large basin in middle and a mesoloph is present at back of tooth there is a distinct posteroloph in a donovani there are two roots at front labial and lingual and one at back there are no m3 of a praeuniversitatis with preserved roots lower dentition anteroconid cusp at front of m1 is usually divided in two by a central indentation anteromedian fossettid in a donovani but this fossettid is absent in a praeuniversitatis behind anteroconid is protoconid metaconid pair of cusps there is an anterolabial cingulum a crest at front labial margin in front of protoconid there is a long crest behind metaconid a mesolophid there is usually no corresponding crest an ectolophid behind protoconid another pair of cusps hypoconid and entoconid is located at back of tooth entoconid lingual cusp of two is oriented forwards there is always a large root at front of tooth and another at back a donovani usually has a small labial root between two large roots and often also another small root at lingual side but only one of four a praeuniversitatis even has labial there is no anteroconid in m2 and tooth lacks an additional crest anterolophid in front of metaconid but there is an anterolabial cingulum in front of protoconid there is a mesolophid in addition to a large root at back there are two roots at front in a donovani which are sometimes partially fused but only one in a praeuniversitatis zijlstra et al 2010 pp 862 864 865 867 anterolabial cingulum and anteroconid are both absent on m3 mesolophid is usually absent as in m2 there are two roots at front in a donovani and only one in a praeuniversitatis but front roots are usually fused in a donovani zijlstra et al 2010 pp 862 865 867 jaws thumb a left mandible lower jaw of agathaeromys praeuniversitatis seen from outer side all teeth are missing maxilla upper jaw is known only for a donovani in these fossils back margin of incisive foramen an opening in palate is about at same level as front of m1 and back margin of zygomatic plate a bony plate at side of skull connected to zygomatic arch is also close to front of m1 mandibles lower jaws of both species are known mental foramen an opening in front of jaw bone opens towards labial side of bone except in one mandible of a praeuniversitatis in which its opening is located higher there is a well developed capsular process a raising in bone that houses root of lower incisor masseteric ridges two ridges on labial side of bone that anchor some of chewing muscles are joined into a single crest towards front and reach to a point below front of m1 zijlstra et al 2010 pp 866 867 a single mandible from porto spanjo one of sites where fossils of a donovani have been found without preserved molars differs from all agathaeromys dentaries and is thought to represent an unknown different sigmodontine rodent this jaw is more slender than a donovani dentaries has a shorter diastema gap between incisors and molars has incisor less shifted lingually relative to molars and has more roots under molars as shown by preserved alveoli zijlstra et al 2010 pp 867 868 age and range agathaeromys donovani is known from four fossil sites fontein porto spanjo and 80 m above sea level that have yielded 259 148 54 and 5 molars respectively agathaeromys praeuniversitatis is known from 35 molars from a single site seroe grandi although deposits have not been precisely dated zijlstra and colleagues suggested on basis of correlations with similar deposits on nearby curacao and sea level fluctuations that material of a praeuniversitatis is likely 540 000 to 230 000 years old and that of a donovani is likely 900 000 to 540 000 years old zijlstra et al 2010 p 869 similarly aged fossil sites are also known from nearby islands of curacao and aruba but these contain various other rodents including megalomys curazensis and dushimys on curacao and species of oligoryzomys sigmodon and zygodontomys on aruba zijlstra et al 2010 p 872 zijlstra 2012 p 67 agathaeromys probably descends from an unknown oryzomyine that migrated to island from mainland venezuela sometime during pleistocene zijlstra et al 2010 p 872 references
