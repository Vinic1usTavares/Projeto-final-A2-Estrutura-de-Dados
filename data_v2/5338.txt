nihongo zuiho class rui feng xing also known as nihongo shoho class xiang feng xing was a group of two aircraft carriers built for imperial japanese navy before world war ii both ships were originally built as submarine tenders but were subsequently converted into carriers completed in early 1942 shoho supported invasion forces in operation mo invasion of port moresby new guinea and was sunk by american carrier aircraft on her first combat operation during battle of coral sea on 7 may shoho was first japanese aircraft carrier to be sunk during world war ii zuiho played a secondary role in battle of midway in mid 1942 and did not engage any american aircraft or ships during battle ship participated in guadalcanal campaign during rest of 1942 she was lightly damaged during battle of santa cruz islands during this campaign and covered evacuation of japanese forces from island in early 1943 after repairs afterwards her aircraft were disembarked several times in mid to late 1943 and used from land bases in a number of battles in south west pacific zuiho participated in philippine sea and leyte gulf in mid 1944 in this last battle zuiho mainly served as a decoy for main striking forces and she was finally sunk by american aircraft fulfilling her task in between engagements ship served as a ferry carrier and a training ship design construction and conversion in mid 1930s imperial japanese navy decided to build a class of two submarine tenders which could be converted into light aircraft carriers or fleet oilers first ship tsurugizaki was commissioned into service in 1939 construction of second was stopped soon after launch and she was completed as an aircraft carrier ship was commissioned as zuiho in december 1940 in early 1941 tsurugizaki was taken out of service converted to an aircraft carrier and recommissioned as shoho in early 1942 thumb left schematic of shoho after their conversion ships had a length of overall they had a beam of and a draft of they displaced at standard load as part of their conversion their original diesel engines which had given them a top speed of were replaced by a pair of destroyer type geared steam turbine sets with a total of each driving one propeller steam was provided by four kampon water tube boilers and they now had a maximum speed of boilers exhausted through a single downturned starboard funnel and ships

at 50deg this provided a maximum range of and an effective ceiling of maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute due to frequent need to change fifteen round magazines campbell p 200 in 1943 zuihos light aa armament was increased to 48 twenty five mm guns following year an additional twenty 25 mm guns were added in addition to six 28 round aa rocket

assigned to operation mo and arrived in truk on 29 april following day she departed truk in company with four heavy cruisers and they formed main force of operation stille p 32 due to aircraft shortages her aircraft complement consisted of only four obsolete mitsubishi a5m claude and eight modern mitsubishi a6m2 zero fighters plus six nakajima b5n2 kate torpedo bombers covering other elements of operation mo was striking force that consisted of fleet carriers and coral sea midway and guadalcanal after covering landings on tulagi on 3 may shoho headed north to cover invasion convoy next day and was not present when aircraft from american carrier attacked japanese shipping at tulagi this air strike confirmed that at least one american carrier was in vicinity but japanese had no idea of its location stille pp 46 48 they launched a number of reconnaissance aircraft following day to search for americans but without result us army air force usaaf aircraft spotted shoho southwest of bougainville island on 5 may but she was too far north to be attacked by american carriers which were refueling stille pp 49 51 that day rear admiral frank jack fletcher received magic intelligence that placed three japanese carriers known to be involved in operation mo near bougainville and predicted 10 may as date of invasion it also predicted airstrikes by japanese carriers in support of invasion several days before 10 may based on this information fletcher planned to complete refueling his ships on 6 may and move closer to eastern tip of new guinea to be in a position to locate and attack japanese forces on 7 may lundstrom p 179 american reconnaissance aircraft reported two japanese heavy cruisers northeast of misima island in louisiade archipelago off eastern tip of new guinea at 0735 and two carriers at 0815 on 7 may an hour later fletcher ordered an airstrike launched believing that two carriers reported were shokaku and zuikaku and yorktown launched a total of 53 douglas sbd dauntless dive bombers and 22 douglas tbd devastator torpedo bombers escorted by 18 f4f wildcats 0815 report turned out to be as pilot had intended to report two heavy cruisers but usaaf aircraft had spotted shoho her escorts and invasion convoy in meantime as latest spot report plotted only away from 0815 report aircraft en route were diverted to this new target lundstrom pp 193 195 96 thumb right shoho hit by a torpedo launched by a devastator from lexington shoho and rest of main force were spotted by aircraft from lexington at 1040 at this time shohos combat air patrol cap consisted of two a5ms and one a6m zero first dive bomber attacks all missed and cap shot down one dauntless after it had dropped its bomb second squadron of dauntlesses followed shortly afterwards and they hit shoho twice with bombs these penetrated ship s flight deck and burst inside her hangars setting fueled and armed aircraft there on fire a minute later devastators of vt 2 began dropping their torpedoes from both sides of ship they hit shoho five times and damage from hits knocked out her steering and power in addition hits flooded both engine and boiler rooms yorktowns aircraft delivered coup de grace with another eleven hits from 1000 pound bombs in addition to two more torpedo hits after his attack lieutenant commander robert e dixon commander of vs 2 radioed his famous message to american carriers scratch one flat top lundstrom pp 198 206 shoho was ordered abandoned at 1131 and sank four minutes later some 300 men successfully abandoned ship but they had to await rescue as remaining ships of main force headed north at high speed to avoid any further airstrikes around 1400 destroyer returned to scene and rescued only 203 survivors rest of her crew of 834 died during attack or in water awaiting rescue lundstrom p p 61 shoho was first japanese aircraft carrier lost during war zuiho led support fleet during battle of midway and did not engage american carriers directly her aircraft complement consisted of six mitsubishi a5m claude and six mitsubishi a6m2 zero fighters and twelve nakajima b5n2 kate torpedo bombers parshall tully p 543 after a brief refit in july august ship was assigned to first carrier division with shokaku and zuikaku on 12 august division sailed to truk on 1 october to support japanese forces in guadalcanal campaign and left truk on 11 october based on promise of japanese army to capture henderson field on guadalcanal at this time zuiho carried 18 a6ms and 6 b5ns japanese and american carrier forces discovered each other in early morning of 26 october during battle of santa cruz islands and each side launched air strikes aircraft passed each other en route and nine of zuihos zeros attacked aircraft launched by they shot down three each grumman f4f wildcat fighters and grumman tbf avenger torpedo bombers and damaged one more of each type while losing four of their own two of enterprises douglas sbd dauntless dive bombers hit zuiho with bombs and damaged her flight deck enough that she could not conduct flight operations although she was not seriously damaged otherwise polmar genda pp 292 96 together with damaged shokaku ship withdrew from battle and reached truk two days later after temporary repairs two carriers returned to japan in early november and zuihos repairs were completed on 16 december ship left kure on 17 january 1943 and sailed for truk with a load of aircraft upon arrival she was assigned to second carrier division to provide cover for evacuation of guadalcanal along with and zuikaku later in month and in early february zuiho arrived at sasebo on 9 may and received a brief refit in mid june she returned to truk on 15 july and remained in area until 5 november when she returned to yokosuka by this time zuiho was assigned to first carrier division with shokaku and zuikaku and they sailed for eniwetok atoll on 18 september for training and to be in position to intercept any attacks by american carriers in vicinity of wake island and marshall islands area that day american carriers raided gilbert islands and were gone by time japanese reached eniwetok on 20 september polmar genda p 377 on 30 november zuiho together with escort carriers and departed truk for japan escorted by four destroyers americans had cracked japanese naval codes and positioned several submarines along their route to yokosuka unsuccessfully attacked zuiho on 30 november while torpedoed and sank chuyo five days later with heavy loss of life polmar genda p 370 from december to may 1944 zuiho ferried aircraft and supplies to truk and guam although she was reassigned to third carrier division on 29 january together with converted carriers and each of three carriers was intended to be equipped with 21 fighters and 9 torpedo bombers but this plan was changed on 15 february to a consolidated air group 653rd that controlled aircraft of all three carriers hata izawa p 56 while fully equipped by may with 18 zero fighters 45 zero fighter bombers 18 b5ns and 9 nakajima b6n jill torpedo bombers polmar genda p 389 air group s pilots were largely drawn from two most recent classes and lacked experience hata izawa p 83 ship sailed for tawi tawi on 11 may in philippines new base was closer to oil wells in borneo on which navy relied and also to palau and western caroline islands where japanese expected next american attack however location lacked an airfield on which to train green pilots and american submarines were very active in vicinity which restricted ships to anchorage polmar genda pp 380 81 battle of philippine sea 1st mobile fleet was en route to guimares island in central philippines on 13 june where they intended to practice carrier operations in an area better protected from submarines when vice admiral jisaburo ozawa learned of american attack on mariana islands previous day upon reaching guimares fleet refueled and sortied into philippine sea where they spotted task force 58 on 18 june americans failed to locate ozawa s ships that day and japanese turned south to maintain a constant distance between them and american carriers as ozawa had decided on launching his air strikes early following morning he had deployed his forces in a t shaped formation with 3rd carrier division at end of stem ahead of 1st and 2nd carrier divisions that formed crossbar of t zuiho and her consorts were intended to draw attentions of americans while other carriers conducted their air strikes without disruption first wave of search aircraft spotted one group of four carriers from task force 58 at and japanese carriers launched their aircraft an hour later this consisted of 43 zero fighter bombers and 7 b6ns escorted by 14 a6m5 fighters carriers retained only three fighters two fighter bombers two b6ns and two b5ns for self defense and later searches while air strike was still forming up second wave of searchers located task force 58 s battleships and air strike was diverted to attack them americans detected incoming japanese aircraft and had a total of 199 grumman f6f hellcat fighters in air by time japanese aircraft were in range of american ships defending fighters decimated japanese aircraft and only 21 survived doing little damage to american ships some of surviving japanese aircraft landed at guam while others including five surviving b6ns returned to their carriers where they claimed one carrier definitely damaged and another probably hit brown 2009 pp 258 60 at dusk japanese turned away to northwest to regroup and to refuel and americans turned west to close distance both sides launched aircraft next day to locate each other zuiho launched three aircraft at 1200 to search east of fleet but they did not discover americans americans discovered retiring japanese fleet during afternoon and vice admiral marc mitscher ordered an air strike launched while they sank one japanese carrier and damaged two others zuiho was not attacked and successfully disengaged that evening brown 2009 pp 263 65 by end of battle air group 653 was reduced to two zero fighters three zero fighter bombers and six torpedo bombers hata izawa pp 84 85 after reaching japan on 1 july ship remained in japanese waters until october training replacements for her air group hata izawa p 85 battle of leyte gulf after americans attacked philippines formosa and ryukyu islands beginning on 10 october japanese implemented their plan for defense of these 2009 p 270 that required transfer of most of air group 652 to formosa and luzon to attack american forces with only a few aircraft retained for carrier operations most of these aircraft were lost for little gain as americans suppressed japanese defenses in philippines preparatory to actual invasion polmar genda p 412 thumb left zuiho under attack during battle of cape engano on 25 october 1944 on 18 october admiral soemu toyoda activated naval portion of defense plan after receiving reports of landings on leyte zuihos role together with chiyoda chitose zuikaku and rest of main body of 1st mobile fleet approaching leyte gulf from north was to serve as decoys to attraction away from two other forces approaching from south and west all forces were to converge on leyte gulf on 25 october and main body left japan on 20 october as decoys carriers were only provided with a total of 116 aircraft 52 zero fighters 28 zero fighter bombers 7 yokosuka d4y judy dive bombers 26 b6n and 4 b5n torpedo bombers by morning of 24 october main body was within range of northernmost american carriers of task force 38 and admiral ozawa ordered an air strike launched to attract attention of americans this accomplished little else as japanese aircraft failed to penetrate past defending fighters survivors landed at airfields on luzon americans were preoccupied dealing with other japanese naval forces and defending themselves from air attacks launched from luzon and leyte and could not spare any aircraft to search for japanese carriers until afternoon they finally found them at 1605 but admiral william halsey jr commander of task force 38 decided that it was too late in day to mount an effective strike he did however turn all of his ships north to position himself for a dawn attack on japanese carriers next day in what came to be called battle of cape engano polmar genda pp 420 422 428 thumb zuiho sinking american aircraft were able to track japanese ships for most of night and halsey ordered an air strike of 60 hellcat fighters 65 helldiver dive bombers and 55 avenger torpedo bombers launched shortly after dawn in anticipation of locating japanese fleet they spotted it at 0735 and brushed aside 13 zeros that japanese had retained for self defense zuiho attempted to launch her few remaining aircraft but was hit by a single bomb on her aft flight deck after a number of torpedo carrying avengers missed polmar genda pp 429 30 bomb started several small fires lifted rear elevator bulged flight deck knocked out steering and gave ship a small list to port twenty minutes later fires were put out steering repaired and list corrected a second attack an hour later focused on chiyoda and ignored zuiho third wave arrived around 1300 and badly damaged ship she was hit once by a torpedo and twice by small bombs although fragments from as many as 67 near misses cut steam pipes and caused flooding of both engine rooms and one boiler room zuiho was forced to reduce speed to and flooding increased so that all available hands were ordered to man pumps at 1410 ship took on a 13deg list to starboard and went dead in water at 1445 when port engine room fully flooded a fourth wave of american aircraft attacked ten minutes later but only damaged her with splinters from another ten near misses this was enough to increase her list to 23deg and she was ordered abandoned at 1510 zuiho sank at 1526 at position with loss of 7 officers and 208 men destroyer and battleship rescued 58 officers and 701 men between them notes footnotes references further reading translation of excerpts from senshi sosho category aircraft carrier classes
