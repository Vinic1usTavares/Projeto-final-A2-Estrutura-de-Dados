comprehensive nation building program in government but his controversial handling of industrial relations led to a dramatic defeat at polls in 1929 bruce later pursued a long and influential diplomatic career as high commissioner to united kingdom 1933 1945 and chairman of food and agriculture organization 1946 1951 born into a briefly wealthy melbourne family bruce studied at university of cambridge and spent his early life tending to importing and exporting business of his late father he served on front lines of gallipoli campaign in world war i and returned to australia wounded in

federal government administration and oversaw its transfer to new capital city of canberra he implemented various reforms to australian federal system to strengthen role of commonwealth and helped develop forerunners of australian federal police and csiro bruce s men money and markets scheme was an ambitious attempt to rapidly expand australia s population and economic potential through massive government investment and closer ties with great britain and rest of british empire however his endeavours to overhaul australia s industrial relations system brought his government into frequent conflict with labour movement and his radical proposal to abolish commonwealth arbitration in 1929 prompted members of his own party to cross floor to defeat government in resounding loss at subsequent election prime minister lost his own seat an event unprecedented in australia and one that would not occur again until 2007 although he returned to parliament in 1931 bruce s service in lyons government was brief instead he pursued an international career accepting appointment as high commissioner to united kingdom in 1933 bruce became an influential figure in british government circles and at league of nations emerging as a tireless advocate for international cooperation on economic and social problems especially those facing developing world particularly passionate on improving global nutrition bruce was one of key figures in establishment of food and agriculture organization serving as first chairman of its governing council he was first australian to sit in house of lords as well as first chancellor of australian national university although his diplomatic career went largely unnoticed in australia he continued throughout his life in london to vociferously advocate for australian interests particularly during world war ii and asked that his remains be returned to canberra when he died early life thumb left firm of paterson laing and bruce 1900 john

to australia in 1858 at age of 18 his mother mary ann henderson was irish and had married her cousin john after emigrating to australia in 1872 at age of 24 john bruce became a talented businessman

became influential in colonial victoria s social and political life an avid golfer he was one of founders of royal melbourne golf club he was prominent in liberal protectionist political movement within state and an early supporter of future prime minister alfred deakin john bruce s success ensured that stanley bruce his sister mary and his brothers ernest william and robert were born into affluence shortly after stanley bruce s birth family relocated to stately manor built by john bruce in toorak however john bruce was an aloof and remote figure in lives of his children as his son stanley later recounted despite their family s presbyterian back ground stanley bruce was sent to melbourne church of england grammar school now melbourne grammar school and subsequently stanley bruce would come to identify principally as anglican bruce was an average student but extremely active in sporting life of school and captain of its football team and then of school itself in 1901 today

bruce family fortunes hard john bruce lost much of his fortune in victorian bank collapse of 1894 and incurred large debts to buy out his partners in importing business in 1897 family suffered a great deal more tragedy over coming decades stanley s brother william committed suicide in 1899 shortly after seeking treatment for mental illness just two years later john bruce took his own life during a business trip to paris he had suffered from depression as a result of great pressures on his business and finances his sister mary endured a long illness before succumbing in 1908 and his mother died too in 1912 finally bruce s beloved brother ernest shot himself in 1919 suffering from physical and mental injuries sustained during his military service in world war i left upright thumb bruce in 1910s in aftermath of his father s death in 1901 family fortunes were at a low ebb and bruce went into family business after leaving high school young bruce was ambitious and determined to get an education with loaned money he moved to united kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in trinity hall cambridge in 1902 he was a popular if average student heavily involved in athletic life of college including as a member of cambridge rowing crew that won boat race in 1904 rowing remained one of his great passions and he continued to coach crews including several for henley royal regatta and write on subject for much of his life ernest bruce had remained in australia to take charge of family s business interests in 1906 he lobbied directors of company to have his brother stanley take over chairmanship of paterson laing and bruce and was ultimately successful despite being just 23 he proved an able chairman and with stanley in london managing exporting and financial interests and ernest managing importation and sales operations in melbourne financial fortunes of business and family rapidly recovered during these years bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a barrister in london with firm of ashurst morris crisp co his work for firm took him to mexico in 1908 and colombia in 1912 which fostered an interest in international affairs by 1912 bruce was a businessman and a successful barrister and it was in this year ethel dunlop anderson traveled to england and was reacquainted with bruce whom she had known as a child aged 32 ethel was of similar scottish irish ancestry and hailed from a prominent squatter family of victoria she shared many of bruce s interests especially golf and his political outlook they married in july 1913 in a quiet ceremony theirs was a close knit relationship they would have many acquaintances but a small circle of close friends and their relationship was one of mutual devotion but death of all but one member of his immediate family in just over a decade and fact that bruces would bear no children of their own deeply affected bruce his brother ernest s daughter helen bruce came to play a large part in his life and was to become main beneficiary of his will but bruce was left with a sense of insecurity and melancholy military service right upright thumb captain bruce of royal fusiliers during world war i bruce returned briefly to australia in 1914 swapping positions within company with his brother ernest world war i broke out in august of that year bruce and his brothers sought to enlist in defence of empire but all three of them would choose to serve in british army rather than australian imperial force it was easier to obtain officer commissions in british army and family had a close association with and for many of them long periods of residency in great britain bruce enlisted and received a commission as lieutenant on 7 february 1915 and was attached to 2nd battalion royal fusiliers in egypt which was then assigned to british 29th division 29th subsequently joined operations in turkey along with australian and new zealand army corps anzac troops that year under sir ian hamilton commander of mediterranean expeditionary force mef first lord of admiralty winston churchill had devised a strategy of capturing dardanelles from turkey to allow naval access to allied russia however allied naval forces were unable to secure passage through narrow straits and mef under hamilton devised a plan to wrest control through amphibious landings this was beginning of now infamous gallipoli campaign bruce s regiment landed at cape helles in mid 1915 where he fully distinguished himself in construction of trenches and as an able commander his battalion suffered heavy casualties over coming months and bruce himself was wounded on 3 june by a shot to arm though it was this injury that spared him from a major assault by his battalion on 4 june in which many of his peers perished he later reflected that he must have been kept on earth for some purpose he returned to front lines and his division moved to new front at suvla bay where it was involved in particularly heavy fighting and sustained trench warfare throughout august and september bruce received military cross and croix de guerre for his service during these months and rose to rank of captain on 5 august he was wounded again on 26 september this time by a shot to knee which left him crippled for several years and forced him to return to england to recuperate while rest of his regiment were transferred to france after abandonment of gallipoli campaign although it had been agreement before war that ernest would stay and manage paterson laing and bruce while his brothers were serving ernest bruce decided to enlist in british army in 1915 hence in september 1916 bruce sought to resign his commission and return to australia to resume management of family business war office refused his request but granted him leave to return to australia while recuperating from his injuries as a decorated soldier on crutches with a gift for public speaking he was enlisted to become a spokesperson for government recruitment in australia his success and popularity in this role brought attention of nationalist league and then prime minister billy hughes who lobbied british government on his behalf and succeeded in convincing war office to allow bruce to relinquish his commission in june 1917 having served with many of his countrymen he returned to australia with a renewed sense of pride and mission in country of his birth but having borne witness to catastrophic loss of life in gallipoli campaign and death of most of his army comrades as well as having suffered through loss of most of his family at age 34 bruce was imbued with a driving ambition to make something of a life which providence had spared early years in politics bruce s popularity as a speaker for government recruitment efforts also earned him attention of national union of victoria an influential group of melbourne businessmen who provided much of financing for federal nationalist party as sir william irvine had recently resigned from parliament to become chief justice of victoria there was to be a by election for his seat of flinders in 1918 which national union asked bruce to stand for nationalist preselection for seat attracted many candidates and sir edward mitchell one of australia s leading constitutional lawyers was presumed to be front runner mitchell proved to be a disappointing speaker and bruce won preselection with help of national union a deal arranged by acting prime minister william watt prevented newly formed country party from challenging bruce in what was a partly rural seat stretching from dandenong out into rural areas south and east of melbourne in by election of 11 may bruce easily defeated his labor opponent gordon holmes speaking to delegates in dandenong bruce summed up his political philosophy a plain soldier and business man i am no politician nor have i any desire to be one in course of my commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways what i have seen in course of that experience has given me little respect either for professional politician or his methods i am desirous of seeing this country governed in ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles and i think that desire of mine is heartily share by vast majority of population right thumb billy hughes herbert pratten and stanley bruce bruce s early years in parliament were unremarkable and his energies were primarily focused on affairs of paterson laing and bruce however in 1921 he attracted attention of his parliamentary colleagues over matter of commonwealth line nationalist prime minister billy hughes now a peace time leader had declined in popularity within party due to his left wing domestic policies commonwealth line had been created by hughes government as a state owned concern to ship australian goods during world war i when british and domestic commercial shipping were unavailable however its post war existence was extensively criticised by bruce as inappropriate and inefficient and many of his economically conservative colleagues agreed bruce also distinguished himself as one of australia s two representatives to league of nations in 1921 in geneva at which he passionately advocated for disarmament and greater international cooperation despite his general scepticism with regards to league s mission and potential for success treasurer 1921 23 returning from europe in october 1921 he was invited by prime minister billy hughes to join his government as minister for trade and customs bruce was not interested he was head of one of australia s largest importing houses and thus had a serious conflict of interest with portfolio as well as being very busy running affairs of that business but he countered by stating that he might feel obliged to accept if position of treasurer was offered knowing that it had already been promised to walter massy greene to bruce s surprise hughes agreed although massy greene was to remain number two in government and minister for defence although he had only been in parliament for three years his business background was highly desirable to hughes who was facing growing criticism from pro business wing of party who had become increasingly suspicious of hughes and his interventionist approach to economy influential party figures such as senator george pearce and national union has also identified bruce as their preferred choice for treasury bruce and hughes clashed in both style and ideology bruce found hughes management of government capricious and chaotic and felt little was accomplished in cabinet or in party meetings so long as hughes headed them but he served as a strong counterweight to domineering hughes resisting several of his more expensive proposals or acting as voice of reason to talk hughes down from several of his more outlandish ideas his tenure would ultimately be short presiding over just one budget in 1922 which was conservative and tax cutting opposition criticised budget for its failure to limit rising government spending and indebtedness budget included many concessions to rural interests and recently formed country party which appeared as a major threat to nationalist party dominance going into 1922 elections in december yet bruce endeared himself to many of his colleagues with his amiable personal style his forceful voice in cabinet against hughes and his conservative views which were more in line with majority of party prime minister 1923 29 right upright 1 4 thumb bruce s newly assembled ministry 1923 nationalists lost eleven seats and their majority in house of representatives in election of 1922 only three of these seats were picked up by labor party though and labor still lacked numbers to form government in their own right rather a breakaway anti hughes liberal party took five government seats while country party increased their number to 14 and now held balance of power only politically realistic option for nationalists to stay in office was to come to an agreement with country party however country party leader earle page refused to support a nationalist government with hughes as prime minister and negotiations throughout january and february failed to break impasse rather than risk being defeated in legislature which might have resulted in governor general asking labor to form government hughes surprised his colleagues by announcing his intention to resign on 2 february with deputy leader walter massy greene having lost his seat at 1922 election hughes now sent for bruce to take over as leader of party after some reluctance bruce finally agreed although hughes later regretted decision and became one of new prime minister s most outspoken detractors bruce moved quickly to secure a working majority for his government he convinced hughes long time political ally george pearce to join his ministry and shored up support of other former national labor members of nationalist party whom had walked out of labor party with hughes in 1916 he appointed william watt as speaker of house effectively removing one of his key opponents from benches a tactical manoeuvre that became common in australian politics thereafter but his most lasting political achievement was negotiation of what became known as coalition an arrangement of electoral and political cooperation between nationalists and their successors and country party although differing greatly in character and background orderly and diplomatic bruce forged a strong working relationship with intelligent but irascible country party leader page bruce had to pay a very high price for this relationship however as part of coalition agreement country party received five seats in a cabinet of 11 page also became treasurer and ranked second in cabinet nationalists also made major concessions on rural development and taxation policy compromises that stirred some resentment among some members of bruce s party page who would serve as treasurer and de facto deputy prime minister throughout bruce s tenure would become a great admirer of bruce stating he was a leader who impressed his colleagues with his sincerity and his capacity and earned their loyalty as reward for his wisdom and integrity bruce s appointment as prime minister marked an important turning point in australian political history he was first prime minister who had not been involved in movement for federation who had not been a member of a colonial or state parliament and who had not been a member of original 1901 federal parliament he was in addition first prime minister to head a cabinet consisting entirely of australian born ministers yet bruce himself was frequently caricatured in public as an englishman who happened to have been born in australia he drove a rolls royce wore white spats and was often seen as distant and lacking common touch characteristics that did little to personally endear him to australian public men money and markets right thumb poster promoting migration to australia as part of men money and markets scheme 1928 in 1923 australia was prosperous by comparison with other developed nations of period having quickly rebounded economically after world war i unemployment and inflation were relatively low by international standards and commonwealth revenues had grown significantly since australia became a federation australia was a vast and richly resourced country with fewer than six million inhabitants and bruce made it his government s priority to develop australia s economy in his first speech to house of representatives as prime minister he outlined a comprehensive vision for australia that centred on economic development reform of federal system increased commonwealth powers over industrial relations a greater voice for australia within british empire and establishment of a national capital he summarised this vision as a program of men money and markets according to bruce men were needed to allow australia s extensive resources to be developed in 1923 much of australia s land was virtually unoccupied and bruce believed australia had potential to be one of most fertile and productive nations in world which could sustain populations upward of 100 million over time more than 16 times population of his time despite dissenting voices from scientists who noted that poor climate soils and water availability were significant barriers to large populations bruce page government enacted policies to encourage large numbers of british to migrate to australia under auspices of new development and migration commission ps34 million in loans took place over decade starting in 1924 to facilitate immigrant settlement through improvements to rural infrastructure land access and subsidising immigrant journeys passages estimates as high as half a million british immigrants over ten years were predicted at start of policy whereas just over 200 000 travelled to australia during that time period bruce s settlement plan rested on rural growth migrants were often selected on basis of their willingness to work on land state and commonwealth governments concentrated their investment on rural development and encouraged returned servicemen to take up farms on periphery of settled areas despite this a majority of these migrants settled in urban areas as australia s rural areas were far more remote and difficult to work than for example england s and many of those taking advantage of assistance scheme were urban workers or family and friends of those already settled immigration from outside great britain and her dominions was considered unpalatable bruce government upheld white australia policy by placing strong restrictions on immigration from other areas notwithstanding its population growth targets in his campaign speech for 1925 election bruce stated it is necessary that we should determine what are ideals towards which every australian would desire to strive i think those ideals might well be stated as being to secure our national safety and to ensure maintenance of our white australia policy to continue as an integral portion of british empire we intend to keep this country white and not allow its people to be faced with problems that at present are practically insoluble in many parts of world money was borrowed from britain to fund state s programs and at an unprecedented rate over ps230 million was extended in loans from city of london to state and commonwealth treasuries during 1920s a further ps140 million arrived through private investment bruce s plan for australian economic development needed a much stronger role for commonwealth government than had been traditionally accepted both he and page were conspicuously national rather than federal in their outlook and sought major changes to federal state relations in order implement their development policy increasingly our problems are becoming national in character our financial resources are curtailed and there is an immediate repercussion throughout commonwealth all our problems are common problems none can be prosperous unless all are prospering i am more convinced that we have to look at all our problems with eyes of a nation and not as individuals where a great problem confronts a state it may be solved by cooperation of commonwealth for benefit of states and benefit and advancement of whole of australia bruce page plan of may 1923 put in motion efforts to coordinate state federal operations in several areas particularly infrastructure and rural development schemes main roads development act of 1923 was one of first and most important legislative accomplishments in this vein act leveraged section 96 of constitution to grant financial assistance to states by employing it to fund road construction and maintenance according to plans of federal transportation portfolio in effect allowing commonwealth to operate directly in what was constitutionality exclusive domain of state governments act would provide a precedent for many types of special purpose payments that became a common feature of australian federal fiscal relations despite some major successes bruce was more frequently frustrated by a lack of progress in many key areas of intergovernmental cooperation states could not be induced to standardise electrical power schemes nor unify on track gauges nor national health insurance despite years of work and solid arguments in favour left thumb bruce in about 1925 although men and money had been secured markets component of bruce plan was never fully realised at 1923 imperial economic conference bruce lobbied consistently for conservative government of stanley baldwin to make changes to great britain s trading arrangements to give preference to dominion products over imports from other nations he argued for empire wide economic trading arrangements that filled domestic demands by production from member states before seeking supplemental imports from other countries and empires baldwin and conservatives attempted to introduce such a scheme in britain however british public feared higher prices for basic products particularly food and this fear was a factor in conservative government s defeat in election of december 1923 baldwin s successor ramsay macdonald repudiated plan much to bruce s chagrin and attempts to revive negotiations foundered as economic conditions worsened throughout decade world agricultural prices stalled in mid 1920s as european and american agricultural production recovered to pre war levels and australian exports were crowded out of markets as decade progressed in 1927 earle page handed down first budget in deficit for coalition government and bruce recognised that australia s economic position was deteriorating federal and state debt that year totalled just over ps1 billion of which ps305 million were war debts and rest had been spent on development that had failed had deliver high returns nearly half of total debt was owed to overseas lenders principally those in london economic growth was slow and far lower than levels hoped exports and revenues were falling behind government needs and investors had begun to express alarm at australia s level of debt bruce persisted with his plans and believed that growing australian exports were key to rectifying problems thus justifying further investment and encouragement of population growth government did act to try to manage debt problem by mid 1920s states were borrowing at unsustainable rates to fund their own programs to compensate for dwindling revenues in response bruce proposed that responsibility for all government debts commonwealth and state and authority to acquire new debt should be handed over to a national loan council in which all states would have one vote and commonwealth would have two votes and casting vote he also moved to abolish per capita payments to states to be replaced by a funding formula tied more to financial need these two changes formed financial agreement of 1927 provisions of which were approved by referendum in 1928 these changes would prove to be amongst most significant in australian constitutional history as states had now lost much of their financial independence faced with severe financial pressures and an increasing reliance upon commonwealth transfer payments after some resistance states consented although vertical fiscal imbalance between states and commonwealth continued to be an enduring feature of australian federal relations modernising government thumb right bruce speaking at opening of parliament house canberra on 9 may 1927 bruce set about applying his business principles to his cabinet putting his experience as both a corporate manager and rowing coach to use in a cabinet system that was orderly and practical he implemented a formal system whereby a proper agenda for cabinet meetings would be formulated and minister responsible for each item would circulate papers to bring other members up to speed on issue his decision making procedures ensured that his colleagues were informed and actively participated in decisions or if they disagreed gave leave for cabinet members to absent themselves from meetings to preserve cabinet solidarity in this respect bruce earned quick respect and approval of his colleagues and in many respects came to dominate cabinet through his and cabinet minister george pearce would later conclude that bruce was best of prime ministers that he served or opposed in his 38 year parliamentary career bruce also greatly strengthened research and information gathering capacity of executive and sought to make decisions and policy on basis of best available evidence and information a record 22 royal commissions reported to bruce government as well as scores of other inquiries and research projects undertaken by commonwealth in a wide range of areas particularly on economic industrial and agricultural matters recognising that investment in science was essential to expanding opportunities for agricultural and economic development in australia bruce established council for scientific and industrial research now known as csiro he established bureau of economic research in 1929 and for first time economists were regularly employed to advise government on what had been until then exclusively political issues by time he left office he had put in place extensive structures to provide information to prime minister and executive branch on most major areas of policy a major development in professional capacity of australian prime minister thumb left stanley and ethel bruce after moving into lodge 1926 under bruce australian government also moved to its new permanent home in planned federal city of canberra plans for a new federal capital had been circulated since time of federation and a site on molonglo river was selected in 1913 design and construction had proceeded slowly due to world war i as well as funding and management problems bruce was a committed advocate of new capital however stating for purposes of federation it was essential that there should be some central point of nationhood suitable to australia as a nation and sooner or later there would have to be a national capital overriding state boundaries and state prejudices this came to pass on 9 may 1927 when federal parliament moved to its new premises in canberra bruce had moved himself and his wife to lodge a few days earlier at federal parliament s opening ceremony bruce decided that voices of clerks of house of representatives and senate were too heavily accented and determined that he would personally welcome duke of york and co open new building a move that was criticised by several parliamentarians business of transferring government and cabinet operations to new capital proceeded slowly over 1927 and 1928 this was an administrative task that occupied a significant proportion of government s time in those years with many departments only very gradually transferring from melbourne much to bruce s consternation imperial overtures thumb upright 1 6 right much coverage was given to stand taken by bruce at 1923 imperial conference loyal to concept of british empire bruce envisaged strengthening it through mutual economic development greater political cooperation and common policies on defence trade and foreign affairs his first trip abroad as prime minister was for 1923 imperial conference in london bruce put forward a wide range of proposals for stronger cooperation between great britain and her dominions in a wide range of areas particularly in areas of trade defence and formulation of a common foreign policy he particularly desired a greater role for dominions in imperial affairs including a collective decision making body for common questions of defence and foreign affairs he took exception to a lack of involvement in foreign policy decisions made by britain that would have significant ramifications for australia in 1922 in what became known as chanak crisis british over turkey s aggressive manoeuvres to redefine its border with greece had escalated to point where british cabinet had threatened war against turkey this threat included military participation of dominions in an intervention though no dominion government had been informed of developments in turkey although a diplomatic end to crisis was eventually found dominion leaders were angered at having almost been committed to a military conflict without any consultation bruce pushed for greater consultation and voice for dominions and succeeded in having richard casey appointed as a permanent political liaison in london who would have access to british government decisions and act as a conduit between westminster and melbourne he also successfully lobbied for creation of a dominion office separated out from colonial office to acknowledge different state of affairs that now existed in empire however while fellow dominions generally agreed that imperial system should be modified not all shared his vision for closer collaboration and strong ties canada and union of south africa were instead seeking greater independence from london and there was little enthusiasm for many of bruce s more ambitious plans for inter empire trade and policy cooperation despite australia s greater representation in london after 1923 bruce s hope for collective imperial decision making was dashed once more with british decision to recognise soviet union in 1924 this act dismayed fervently anti communist bruce who disagreed with decision ideologically and on grounds that once again dominions had not been consulted ultimately though differences between britain s and her dominions opinions on matter were too great to be reconciled instead britain signed general treaty with soviet union only on her own behalf marking first major split between britain and australia on a matter of foreign policy despite its applicability solely to european security arrangements bruce had criticised britain s signing of locarno treaties in 1925 without dominion consultation though eventual treaty was not binding on dominions left thumb bruce back row centre at 1926 imperial 1926 imperial conference confirmed that britain and her dominions were rapidly diverging in interests and that greater independence not greater cooperation was most practical solution bruce recognised empire had reached a turning point but despite his optimism for a reinvigorated imperial system there was little interest from other governments his plan for greater economic and defensive cooperation was discussed as well as a revival of imperial preference in trading arrangements but such ideas were now politically unpalatable in britain and failed to develop his attitudes were almost opposite of those held by leaders of canada south africa and irish free state as prime minister baldwin remarked at conference if you mr bruce would use word empire a bit less and you mr mcgilligan would use it a bit more then we would make better progress ultimately proposals for greater independence won out and 1926 imperial conference recognised through balfour declaration that dominions were essentially independent entities that freely associated as british commonwealth of nations though after much negotiation it stopped short of using terms nation or state governors general were redefined as representatives only of british monarch not british government and were obliged now to act only on advice of their respective dominion governments these changes were both symbolically and practically significant in transformation of dominions from colonies to independent nations bruce had mixed feelings about these developments on one hand he believed that empire was still a strong and vital international organization playing a positive role in international affairs but on other hand he was disappointed that other member nations did not share his vision or commitment to maintaining its integrity and unity bruce did have some successes at conference however expanding work of imperial economic committee and increasing inter empire cooperation in technical and scientific areas industrial relations thumb right workers protest decisions of commonwealth court of conciliation and arbitration during 1929 timber workers strike strikes and industrial unrest were frequent in aftermath of world war i arising from discontent over poor conditions and rise of militant labour organizations like communist party of australia and industrial workers of world problems were made worse in australia due to overlapping system of industrial courts that had evolved since federation although federal arbitration was intended for industrial disputes that impacted upon multiple states or federal employees courts had through several judgments greatly expanded potential jurisdiction of federal arbitration and system had developed into a duality with both state and federal tribunals weighing into a wide range of industrial disputes this was exploited by both unions and employers who pursued matters in courts they felt most likely to be favourable and switched between different jurisdictions to arrive at best combination of state and federal conditions protracted disputes arose as employers and employees pursued disputes in different courts or refused to recognise rulings of one in favour of other billy hughes and several of his predecessors had sought resolution to problem through greater commonwealth powers but all referendums to expand commonwealth industrial powers had failed at ballot box bruce s attitudes towards industrial relations were varied and he was initially unsympathetic to either employer or employee complaints believing best resolutions to be those brokered between businesses and their employees he frequently called upon both sides to embrace a spirit of cooperation situation became acute when waterfront workers led by seamen s union went on strike in 1925 this had severe and immediate effect on australian economy reliant as it was on sea transportation for its imports and exports a situation prime minister recognised as untenable with union disregarding commonwealth rulings on dispute bruce rushed through navigation act and immigration act first allowed british and foreign shipping not working under australian industrial awards to operate in australian waters although british vessels working in australia would soon initiate a strike of their own second allowed commonwealth to deport any foreign born person whom a special tribunal found guilty of disrupting industrial life of community key foreign born strike leaders were immediately targeted for deportation but new south wales premier jack lang refused to allow state police to serve summonses on two leading union leaders bruce responded with peace officers act which re established a commonwealth police force thumb right caricature of bruce as prime minister these heavy handed tactics drew outrage from labor party which challenged prime minister to seek approval from people this bruce did and elections of 1925 were australia s first red scare election he campaigned for industrial peace and an increased commonwealth role in securing it but also denounced foreign agitators and class war in appealing for law and order on waterfront he openly challenged pre existing federal arrangements stating on campaign trail that australia should now consider whether that great historic instrument constitution meets needs of to day in light of developments which have taken place campaign was a success and bruce government was easily re elected increasing by 11 seats its majority over a disheartened alp whose leader matthew charlton was in poor health my government was returned to power on a clear issue and with a definite mission to introduce measures for preservation of industrial peace bruce declared during his second term and called a referendum to amend australian constitution and bring industrial relations under exclusive jurisdiction of commonwealth attempts to amend constitution for this purpose had been rejected narrowly in 1911 1913 and 1919 but against a background of ongoing industrial strife bruce made clear problems of mixed jurisdiction confusing dual awards and insufficient regulatory and enforcement powers at commonwealth level controversially he also formulated an essential services question to be put at same time giving government power to protect public from any actual or probable disruption to essential services these proposals drew hostile reception from many quarters even from future conservative prime minister robert menzies and both australian labor party and conservative groups were divided in opinion on amendments with alp eventually taking no fixed position on questions but by september issue had drawn so much controversy and ill feeling that it was no surprise for many commentators that proposals failed to attract sufficient popular support to overcome high bar for constitutional change thumb left a license or dog collar issued to a waterfront worker under transport workers act in 1929 problems of industrial unrest continued to flare up and waterfront remained a flashpoint in a review of commonwealth conciliation and arbitration act in 1928 bruce required industrial courts to consider economic effects of its awards in addition to welfare of worker immediate problems followed when a new award for waterside workers in 1928 worsened conditions for workers on economic grounds new industrial action led by waterside workers federation broke out in melbourne these turned to riots claiming casualties and at least one fatality reviving red scare pitch for 1928 election campaign bruce pushed transport workers act through parliament in response which gave executive unprecedented regulatory power in industrial relations all waterfront workers now required federal licenses or dog collars as they were derisively known to work act allowed commonwealth government to effectively control who worked on docks and nearly destroyed waterside workers federation earning government deep unpopularity among organised labour at 1928 election bruce s government was returned to power but it now had a majority of just nine a fragile result given growing propensity for nationalist member defections most of nationalists parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out james scullin had assumed leadership of alp earlier in year upon retirement of charlton and party was invigorated as a consequence bruce was undeterred though and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured australia was heading towards a major economic crisis this doctrine was basis of his appeals to public for next year and a half maritime industries crisis thumb right waterfront workers federation was highly militant during 1920s much of bruce s industrial legislation was targeted at curbing organization s power as early as 1927 economic indicators were signalling onset of a recession in australia by 1929 evidence was unavoidable that recession was becoming depression as a resulting of rapidly deteriorating international conditions in that year prices for australian exports fell by nearly a third and gdp had fallen by 10 with no attendant fall in cost of living australia s debt now stood at million interest payments on which were equivalent to nearly half of australia s export receipts a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive economic climate investors and banks recognised risk and australia s credit access was rapidly drying up bruce s grand economic development plans had increased national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal economic expansion in short term to make matters worse for government industrial unrest was a persisting problem particularly in economically key states of new south wales and victoria opposition had become more potent as well scullin was widely recognised as one of parliament s most gifted and articulate members even his opponents respected his personal probity scullin forecast that australian economy was highly vulnerable given its indebtedness and was on a course for severe depression if government finances were not turned around dramatically furthermore prime minister s own party was breaking down underneath him there had been no official party platform yet agreed to and individual members had a wide degree of latitude to determine issues they ran on leading to frequent government defections on legislation government s existing nine seat majority shrank during 1928 and 1929 over various issues as a result of by elections and several leading figures who had previously worked with bruce became increasingly sharp critics of him hughes and edward mann were two of government s most ardent opponents in 1929 worsening economic conditions had put further pressure on industrial relations with unemployment rising and employers seeking to cut costs strikes of sugar mill workers in 1927 waterside workers in 1928 and then transport and timber industry workers in 1929 continued to disrupt economic operations worst came with ongoing disputes between miners and mine owners on coalfields of new south wales had culminated in riots and in 1929 and intervention by bruce government failed to produce a settlement notably in march 1929 newcastle based mine owner john brown locked out workers from his mines at main and richmond main to try to force acceptance of lower wages attorney general john latham pursued legal action against brown for illegally using coercive industrial tactics but bruce intervened to stop prosecution believing case to be doubtful and that dropping it would give government a chance to negotiate an end to dispute mine owners refused to accede to government brokered negotiations anyway and government was seen to have been siding with rich businesses and applying double standards undermining bruce s own credibility as an impartial leader and law and order prime minister thumb left bruce with john latham his attorney general and eventual successor as leader of nationalist party bruce and conservatives in parliament became increasingly convinced that economic deterioration was product rather than possible cause of worsening industrial relations exasperated prime minister made a dramatic move and presented an ultimatum to australian state governments either they should voluntarily hand their powers of industrial regulation to federal government or federal government would divest itself of its industrial powers and dismantle federal arbitration announcement came as a major shock to all sides of politics not least members of bruce s own cabinet most of whom had not been informed of dramatic change in policy until day it was announced to states bruce calculated that states would not give up their powers and thus move was one designed to sanction end of commonwealth arbitration for bruce only inconceivable outcome now was that status quo of dual jurisdiction remained unchanged opposition to proposal which prime minister introduced to parliament as maritime industries bill was swift and fierce in 1929 over 150 unions and 700 000 workers were covered by commonwealth awards over a wide range of industries although there was dissatisfaction in coal and timber sectors most were happy with their arrangements and feared worse pay and conditions if moved back to state awards he defended his actions as being necessary to create certainty and end duplication that had caused so many problems in recent years other government decisions in 1929 had attracted controversy as well page handed down his last budget on 22 august which hinted at burgeoning debt crisis and introduced a new tax on entertainment and theatres to help cover deficit tax was very unpopular with public and entertainment industry mounted a vocal campaign to stop it bruce supported by brigden report of 1929 also raised concern that protective tariffs were too high and were in need of reform a position controversial with powerful protected industries second reading of maritime industries bill passed by only four votes with hughes edward mann and george maxwell voting against government hughes moved an amendment to bill that stipulated it should only take effect after being approved by people at a referendum or general election bruce ruled out any referendum stating that amendment would constitute a vote of confidence in his government and urged his party to vote it down nationalist mp walter marks and independent mp william mcwilliams joined opposition giving opposition a one vote majority bruce and his supporters now lobbied speaker sir littleton groom to make a deliberative vote in committee to tie numbers leaving committee chairman james bayley with casting and presumably pro government vote groom refused citing long standing westminster though not australian parliamentary tradition of speaker s impartiality groom s bitterness at having been dismissed by bruce from job of attorney general in 1925 had a significant bearing on his later decision right thumb bruce meeting with prime minister elect scullin a day before scullin s swearing in a snap election was called with bruce taking his case to people that dramatic action on industrial relations was needed opposition leader scullin forcefully attacked government blaming prime minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive stressing that commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation scullin also criticised government for growing debt problem and economic malaise which for some years he had predicted would lead to a major economic crisis in event government was soundly defeated on 12 october losing more than half its seats in parliament to add to his humiliation bruce was defeated in his own seat of flinders by labor challenger jack holloway on paper there was no indication that bruce was in any danger of losing his seat he held flinders with a reasonably safe majority of 10 7 percent in 1928 however on second count holloway picked up enough preferences from an independent liberal candidate to give him victory bruce was first sitting prime minister to lose his own seat a feat which would not be repeated until 2007 he was measured in defeat however stating people have said they do not want my services and i am going into banishment to which they have sent me return to cabinet 1931 33 thumb right bruces arriving in england bruce returned to england after his defeat to holiday and attend to his business sir john latham took over as leader of nationalists with stock market crash in 1929 and onset of great depression in australia bruce commented to his colleagues that their defeat was probably fortunate but he ardently defended his government s record maintaining that economic crisis was inevitable and that his own policies were justified attempts to try to strengthen australian economy it was this defence that he mounted in april 1931 when he announced he would return to politics and seek to regain his seat of flinders at next election by now nationalists had regrouped as united australia party uap under joseph lyons who had defected with several others from embattled scullin government in november 1931 scullin government was defeated in parliament over its controversial premiers plan catching bruce by surprise as he was in england attending to paterson laing and bruce affairs when a new election was called scullin government was subsequently defeated in a landslide losing a then record 32 seats two labor factions were cut down to only 18 seats between them with holloway having abandoned flinders to run in much friendlier melbourne ports bruce was returned in absentia to his old seat regaining it with a swing of 18 5 percent he was appointed assistant treasurer in new lyons government lyons having taken treasury portfolio personally lyons leaned heavily on bruce and latham in his first six months of government though bruce had by now set his sights on international affairs rather than domestic crisis bruce led australian delegation to 1932 imperial economic conference in ottawa he redoubled his efforts to improve australian economic prospects with empire and conference agreed to a limited form of his long sought imperial preference scheme that would give australia greater access and competitiveness in imperial markets over five years an achievement for which bruce received much praise from lyons government closer trading arrangements of ottawa agreements would set pattern for australian british trade relations until britain s entry in european common market in 1973 after success of imperial economic conference lyons appointed bruce to london as resident minister in united kingdom it was to remain his and ethel s home for rest of their lives his first task in london was to renegotiate terms of australia s burgeoning government debts repayment of which was crippling depression era australia over two years he negotiated with westminster bank and british government for loan conversions worth ps84 million which saved australia millions of pounds in interest over several years and along with ottawa agreements were significant in helping alleviate australian government s budgetary difficulties bruce was asked at several points during 1930s to return to australia by uap backers and other political figures who hoped that he could replace lyons as prime minister he himself had questioned lyons health and capacity to execute role effectively but he showed little interest in returning in 1938 and 1939 bruce was approached by senior uap figures and lyons himself to return to australia and assume leadership of government which was struggling under ailing lyons but he either flatly declined or set conditions for his return such as an all party government behind him that were impossible to meet high commissioner to united kingdom 1933 45 thumb left bruce in 1934 in september 1933 bruce was appointed by lyons to replace ailing sir granville ryrie as high commissioner to united kingdom giving him ambassadorial rank he formally resigned from parliament on 7 october 1933 bruce would excel in new post becoming a trusted confidant among conservative politicians and a familiar face in british government circles which led to him at one point considering entering british politics formally bruce was particularly close to prime minister stanley baldwin with whom he frequently consulted and was notably influential in pressing for edward viii s abdication in 1936 his importance and power in london was due in part to free rein that lyons gave him a rarity in history of position combined with turmoil and frequent ministerial changes within commonwealth department of external affairs bruce was generally credited as australia s most influential and credible international representative during his posting often determining matters of foreign policy in his own right league of nations right thumb bruce chairing league of nations council in 1936 joachim von ribbentrop is addressing council bruce represented australia at league of nations and successfully lobbied for australia to participate as a member of league council from 1933 to 1936 he opposed action against japan following invasion of manchuria in 1933 concerned as to australia s trading relationship with japan and potential future threat it posed to peace in pacific he also attempted to steer league away from sanctioning member nations believing it yet lacked military or economic sway to do so effectively and feared breakdown of league a prospect that loomed after germany and japan departed body in 1933 during abyssinia crisis bruce again counselled against partial sanctions believing them worst option as they would not stop ethiopian invasion and yet would alienate italy then a potential ally against a rearming nazi germany he further argued for much greater rearmament efforts in united kingdom and france to provide greater military capacity to enforce future decisions by league bruce assumed presidency of league of nations council in 1936 at height of crisis and after failure of hoare laval pact between france italy and britain but further attempts to forestall invasion failed he presided as league council president during rhineland crisis although once again attempts to respond to fascist aggression failed although this did not shake his conviction in potential of league he saw it doomed to failure without fundamental reforms to its structure and system of sanctions he was nominated by turkey to chair 1936 montreux conference which was far more successful in negotiating international agreement on passage through turkish straits an issue of particular relevance to bruce as a veteran of gallipoli campaign despite turmoil of his presidency league historian f p walters would later describe bruce as best perhaps of many first rate chairmen who presided over council conferences or committees of league f p walters a history of league of nations 1952 833 pages freely available on site of united nations office in geneva online by 1937 bruce s attention had shifted to social and economic cooperation which he believed had far greater potential for success and was of greater importance to humanity at large he had taken a leading role in promoting agriculture nutrition and economic cooperation through league of nations working intensively with frank mcdougall and john boyd orr throughout decade in 1937 he presented a plan of economic appeasement which built on this work and aimed to ease international tensions by reviving international trade and improving living standards in europe through better working conditions lower food prices rural credits and housing assistance barriers to trade would gradually be reduced while european nations still recovering from depression would be reintegrated into international economy in doing so he made a firm link between international trade and international peace believing it key to unlocking world economic potential foreshadowing logic of marshall plan bruce argued that unrelieved economic and social hardship threatened to push other nations towards fascism or communism thumb bruce as chairman of montreux conference 1938 i feel very strongly that it will be impossible to find a solution to political problems of europe and remove present nightmare conditions unless something is done to improve economic position it is vital for prestige and future wellbeing of league that it should afford active leadership towards bringing about economic appeasement plan was supported by secretary general joseph louis anne who like bruce recognised that league was rapidly becoming moribund and that a major change of direction was needed although neither was successful in convincing key states in contributing to plan critically new british prime minister neville chamberlain could not be convinced by bruce to invest further into development of league and body began to lose its political impetus as war loomed he would continue to press for league reform in lead up to war bruce committee to advise on league reform was formed in 1939 in aftermath of partition of czechoslovakia by nazi germany and apparent failure of chamberlain s appeasement policy this committee which met in july and august 1939 proposed a significant expansion of bruce s earlier ideas to league bringing a wide range of economic and social programs under its purview as a means of fostering international cooperation their work however would be rendered moot by outbreak of world war ii world war ii in events leading up to world war ii bruce and lyons had been supporters of british under chamberlain and policy of appeasement exercised with regards to reoccupation of rhineland anschluss and munich crisis even during phoney war bruce continued to advocate implementation of a more durable international system to enforce peace through mutual disarmament expansion of transnational trade and global organizations capable of addressing pressing social and economic questions that he felt were recurrent causes of international conflict he had become a close confidant of senior conservative party figures anthony eden and neville chamberlain in this period and was strident in advancing opinion of australia and dominions more broadly that negotiation and compromise with nazi germany was preferable to war bruce actively participated in negotiations for munich agreement when lyons died in april 1939 earle page and richard casey personally appealed for bruce to return to australia and take over once more as prime minister at head of uap bruce demurred however and made it condition of his return that he be allowed to sit in parliament as an independent and lead an all party unity government such conditions were politically impossible to meet and robert menzies was elected as new leader of uap thumb upright 1 4 left high commissioner bruce drinking tea with australian troops in london during world war ii britain s declaration of war against germany on 3 september 1939 was followed within hours by australia s prime minister menzies stating that because of britain s declaration australia too was now at war with germany winston churchill s accession as british prime minister in may 1940 brought bruce into frequent conflict with british government churchill saw dominions as still semi dependent colonies who were at london s command whereas bruce saw empire as a kind of international partnership and dominions as rightful parties to decision making process britain s preoccupation with european theatre alarmed australian politicians given tenuous position of far eastern possessions and looming possibility of japanese invasion after a string of defeats in far east particularly fall of singapore australian government was finally successful in having bruce accredited to british war cabinet and pacific war council as an australian and dominion representative however bruce soon became embroiled in disputes over churchill s autocratic leadership style and his lack of consultation with cabinet over war decisions he was regularly left out of cabinet communique or not invited to meetings much to his displeasure with fear of japanese invasion mounting in australia throughout 1942 bruce directly confronted churchill on a number of occasions over far east policy and continuing lack of consultation with australia and his own cabinet churchill usually responded by rebuffing him or pointedly excluding him further from government business although outwardly relenting in face of pressure exerted by dominions for representation in war decisions churchill routinely marginalised or ignored that representation bruce persisted in this difficult arrangement until may 1944 when he became completely disillusioned and resigned choosing other forums in which to represent australia in london in spite of his tempestuous relationship with churchill bruce was held in high regard by many cabinet members particularly future prime ministers clement attlee and anthony eden and his dogged determination to advance dominion interests during war years earned him high praise from john curtin and other dominion prime ministers food and agriculture organization 1946 51 thumb pope pius xii with chairman bruce and members of world food council in rome 1950 by war s end in 1945 bruce had become tired of high commission posting and hinted to curtin s successor ben chifley that he would not object to being replaced in position in last years of war he had envisaged a post war order based on a continuing alliance of four powers united states british empire soviet union and china that could evolve into a new international body with a similar function as league of nations but with a stronger role and authority in international matters bruce had rejoined frank mcdougall and john boyd orr in these years in reviving their proposals for international cooperation on nutrition and agriculture he wrote and made representations at all levels on subject and became a leading voice once more advocating creation of an international body to examine social and economic questions much as he had done during his years with league of nations efforts of mcdougall bruce and orr finally paid off when their work came to attention of eleanor roosevelt and subsequently american government and their proposals would find expression at food and agriculture conference that franklin roosevelt convened in hot springs virginia in may 1943 this conference agreed to establishment of food and agriculture organization fao which became an associated institution with united nations when it was established formally in october 1945 as war in europe drew to a close and united nations charter was promulgated in june 1945 bruce s name was among those being considered to become first secretary general of united nations with american secretary of state dean acheson and british foreign minister anthony eden actively supporting his candidacy bruce however was now 62 and indicated that he felt himself too old for position instead preferring a less demanding role considering economic and social questions in 1946 he assumed chairmanship of fao preparatory commission on world food proposals which had mission of establishing a world food board to coordinate international policy on nutrition and develop a system to eliminate global agricultural shortages he proposed many international schemes as part of this work particularly a world food reserve and special pricing mechanisms to reallocate and release food to where it was most needed in times of need bruce s commission also placed a high emphasis on agricultural modernization international development aid commodity agreements and price stability to help starving developing nations in its findings presented in 1947 proposals were never adopted as costs and challenges to national sovereignty proved too difficult to overcome politically undeterred bruce was elected chairman of newly formed fao council in november 1947 working once more with john boyd orr now secretary general of fao acute shortages of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in europe and international food supply system was under serious strain after devastation of war bruce and council worked in these years to distribute fertiliser and agricultural machinery as well as improve nutrition especially in less developed nations more than two thirds of world was undernourished in 1949 and bruce felt it imperative for council to bring these stark facts to developed nations a landmark agreement on technical aid between fao and united nations was reached in november 1949 and fao received funding and logistical capacity to act on food shortage crisis and problems of poor nutrition in developing world bruce and fao were successful in these years in supporting recovery of world agricultural output by 1951 this had exceeded pre war levels and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally but by time bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough to keep pace with post war population boom council faced major obstacles in supporting improvement of conditions in developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence post colonial and cold war conflicts multiplied frustrated by continuing world conflict and lack of commitment from developed world to support lofty but very difficult aims of fao both bruce and orr resigned from fao disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems later life thumb arms of viscount bruce of melbourne or a saltire gules between four mullets sable on a chief of second a pale argent charged with a saltire of third bruce occupied a range of positions in his later years sharing his time between united kingdom and australia he had been chairman of finance corporation of industry since 1946 and continued in role until 1957 providing finance to projects of benefit to british national economy bruce helped establish program in australia in 1954 and on a commonwealth basis in 1956 he became first chancellor of newly established australian national university in 1952 and took an active interest in its development especially as a research centre for study of asia and pacific bruce concluded that australia s position in world had changed as a result of world war ii commenting australia has become a bridgehead between east and west it is now vital that australia should understand problems of east that she should do whatever is in her power to alleviate those problems and that she should interpret nature of those problems to rest of world residential college bruce hall was named in his honour and he remained active in life of university until his retirement from position in 1961 bruce sat as director on many corporate boards in retirement notably national bank of australia p o and national mutual life association in 1947 he became first australian to sit in house of lords sir john forrest had been granted a peerage but died before it could be invested having been elevated to peerage as viscount bruce of melbourne by long time colleague clement attlee he would be an active participant in chamber attending regularly right up until his death bruce used it as a platform to continue to campaign on international and national social and economic questions and to promote recognition and representation for australia within commonwealth though by this time australian and british interests were becoming increasingly far apart and british empire was rapidly disintegrating he also continued to lobby british government in these years to increase its commitment to third world development and fao an avid golfer his whole life bruce became first australian captain of royal and ancient golf club of st andrews in 1954 from 1948 to 1952 he was president of leander club while continuing to coach rowing at cambridge university sporadically and frequently appeared at public events both in australia and in england death thumb right bust of stanley bruce by sculptor wallace anderson located in prime ministers avenue in ballarat botanical gardens in ballarat victoria bruce remained active and in good health right through his retirement despite gradual onset of deafness but death of his wife ethel in march 1967 took a deep toll on him he died on 25 august 1967 at age of 84 he was last surviving member of billy hughes cabinet his memorial service was held at st martin in fields and was widely attended including by representatives of royal family his ashes were scattered over lake burley griffin in canberra canberra suburb of bruce and electoral division of bruce based in south east melbourne were both named for him legacy and evaluation despite his many accomplishments both at home and abroad bruce s post prime ministerial career was not well known in australia and most still harboured memories of his harsh anti union legislation and his government s landslide defeat in 1929 his public persona was one of an aloof man too english for australia in style and bearing upon his death in 1967 age of his hometown melbourne remarked that for most australians he is little more than a shadow bruce spent much of his life and career in united kingdom country that conversely held him in high regard but never forgot his australian roots and for much of his career was a tireless advocate for its interests in contrast to his image as a member of british aristocratic elite he spent much of his later career working for solutions to problems facing world s poorest bruce was high minded and ambitious in setting an agenda as prime minister he pursued complex and aspiring schemes of economic social and administrative development including grandiose solutions to problem of industrial relations and an egalitarian reworking of british empire in his diplomatic career he pursued better treatment for commonwealth and programs through league of nations and united nations that would address world questions of pressing social and economic concern culminating in his most ambitious work to eliminate world hunger through food and agriculture organization australian government even nominated bruce for nobel peace prize in recognition for these efforts yet his schemes frequently bordered on idealistic and he was frequently disappointed at limited degree to which he could practically implement his ideas as bruce himself would concede in later life he was overly ambitious by nature and forever buying into things that aren t really my concern but despite his lack of public recognition in australia peers and historians have long recognised abiding impact bruce had both as prime minister and internationalist leading his successor as chancellor of australian national university sir john cockcroft to conclude in 1962 that bruce was probably outstanding australian of our time melbourne sun agreed with assessment stating upon his death that bruce was probably least remembered but most extraordinary of our prime ministers see
