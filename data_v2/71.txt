for their work in mining industry thumb left kimberley mine and town 1891 rhodes outmanoeuvred his main opponent barney barnato and brought all mines under control of his company de beers in 1888 on 30 october of that year through signing of rudd concession by king lobengula of matabeleland he obtained exclusive mining rights across all of lobengula s territories in matabeleland mashonaland and beyond for his soon to be formed british south africa company bsac queen victoria granted bsac a royal charter to administer and develop these territories on 29 october 1889 for an initial period of 25 years this charter included right to take possession of deal with and dispose of land on 12 september 1890 rhodes s pioneer column reached what was to become salisbury coghlan took an active part in public debates he was loyal to britain but held that all parts of british empire should be internally self governing with each territory supporting others arguing that this should extend to his ancestral home of ireland he expressed support for home rule movement there he disapproved of policy of south african republic government under paul kruger of conscripting uitlanders mostly british settlers for military service while denying them electoral franchise coghlan was elected to kimberley town council in 1897 following year colonel frederick schermbrucker s youngest daughter gertrude mary schermbrucker described as an attractive and sociable woman arrived to stay at house coghlan shared with his sister and mother coghlan married gertrude in a southern suburb of cape town on 10 january 1899 around this time coghlan s friend percy ross frames invited him to join him in bulawayo one of main settlements in rhodesia as matabeleland mashonaland and adjoining areas were now collectively called coghlan was receptive to idea but was compelled to stay in kimberley by outbreak of second boer war in october 1899 kimberley was besieged by boer forces cut off by rail and telephone from 14 october until its relief by general john french on 15 february 1900 bulawayo 1900 1908 after a break in cape town coghlan and his wife left kimberley for bulawayo on 30 july 1900 there they found conditions to be very basic and buildings ramshackle nevertheless settlers enjoyed outdoor pursuits dances and musical and theatrical performances coghlan and his wife lodged at grand hotel in 1901 not long after they arrived first child was born but baby lived only three days a second child a girl named petal was born in november 1902 and lived to old age coghlan gained admission to rhodesian bar and entered into partnership with frames to create frames and coghlan frames left for johannesburg in late 1902 citing poor economic conditions in southern rhodesia following second boer war ending this firm coghlan and allan ross welsh formed a new partnership coghlan and welsh firm expanded into salisbury as coghlan welsh and tancred in 1907 when bernard tancred a south african cricketer and friend of coghlan s from johannesburg joined shortly before 1908 elections to southern rhodesian legislative council welsh sent a telegram to coghlan who was visiting relatives in advising him to stand coghlan did so successfully in march 1908 towards responsible government 1908 1922 it was widely expected that southern rhodesia would eventually be incorporated into union of south africa as its fifth province it was generally considered part of south africa geographically and in colonial terms part of british expansion into region that had begun with 1820 settlers representatives from rhodesia had participated in south african national convention of 1908 and section 150 of south africa act 1909 made specific provision for accession of bsac territories coghlan had represented interests of rhodesian people at convention although his contribution was insignificant presence of rhodesian delegation had been supported and even secured by louis botha who was keen to win trust of settlers in november 1909 at a banquet for lord selborne departing high commissioner in cape town coghlan spoke of bsac and people of southern rhodesia working together towards entering union though some settlers wished to enjoy what he called an artificial stage of responsible government first indeed order in council of 1898 had provided southern rhodesia with a constitution that resembled that of a crown colony with responsible government and south africa act made no changes to territory s administrative framework botha who had been asked by union s first governor general viscount gladstone to form a government began to make policies and speeches that appeared to coghlan to be unfair to south africans of british origin attorney general j b m hertzog interpreted convention in a way that coghlan considered to be to detriment of english speakers coghlan came to conclusion in 1910 that southern rhodesia s joining union was much further off than he had previously thought though he still saw it as territory s inevitable destiny whose timing and terms local electorate must determine at this time he rejected notion of responsible government self government while retaining colonial status on grounds that he thought it would take up to two decades to achieve he was furthermore against idea of keeping rhodesia for english speaking settlers seeing in that end same racial discrimination he perceived dutch speakers to be displaying against british in union in 1911 partnership of coghlan welsh and tancred ended when tancred died around same time coghlan who was representing a mining company encountered ernest guest in opposition in a case in court of mining commissioner who judged in favour of guest s client coghlan although irritated by guest recognised his ability and offered him a partnership which he accepted leading to formation of coghlan welsh and guest in salisbury in 1912 article 33 of bsac charter of 1889 gave british government right to alter or repeal any of administrative provisions of charter after 25 years so it was widely anticipated by all sections of southern african political opinion after 1910 that bsac s administration would come to an end in 1914 yet bsac remained in place during course of first world war rhodesia s white population was split between unionists for amalgamation into union of south africa and responsible government association for independence while rga was led by coghlan union party s leader was herbert longden another lawyer from bulawayo longden like british government believed rhodesia lacked population and resources for an independent state for britain union with south africa would mean avoiding having to buy out bsac leaving burden on south africa instead after war coghlan noted that new secretary of state winston churchill was determined to achieve amalgamation of southern rhodesia with south africa for its part bsac encouraged unionists expecting that it would get a better price for its assets from south africa than from southern rhodesia other major corporations were also pro union since south africa would be able to provide cheap labour from south these interests controlled local press and were thus highly influential in debate with general smuts a skillful statesman also on side of unionists it seemed unlikely that coghlan would dissuade electorate from entering into union at 1920 elections domestic interests aligned against those of bsac rather than unreservedly in favour of responsible government run up to 1922 referendum was long and acrimonious for union were most of leading citizens of salisbury and bulawayo british south african and rhodesian presses bsac and british government against them was responsible government association founded in 1917 by ethel jollie wallis in his biography of coghlan one man s hand gives him credit for victory of responsible government lobby lewis hastings reviewing wallis s book recalls campaigning with coghlan and says that he was undisputed leader of movement highly competent with a clear vision principled and sincere he attributes coghlan s resolve to his years in kimberley where he experienced autocratic rule of de beers mining company owned by bsac by 1922 display of unity by white farmers against chartered rule at 1920 elections fell apart majority of them mostly ranchers and tobacco planters who relied on southern market voted for union on other hand mashonaland maize growers wanting to retain full share of local produce markets wanted responsible government 1922 referendum results were 8 774 for responsible government and 5 989 for joining south africa role of women in defeat of unionists was substantial with approximately 75 of them voting for responsible government even when their husbands voted for union in a letter to south african prime minister jan smuts company administrator sir francis drummond chaplin cited anti afrikaner sentiments particularly amongst women as a major factor in result premiership 1923 1927 350px thumb right map of southern rhodesia showing railway lines and rivers before 1923 coghlan had opposed amalgamation of northern and southern rhodesia concerned that it would make responsible government harder to attain one outcome of jameson raid in 1895 96 had been to prevent concentration of bsac into one administration instead high commission in bechuanaland was maintained northern rhodesia kept its own administration and britain oversaw bsac affairs more closely one year into his premiership coghlan began to consider territorial expansion and staked a claim to northwestern bechuanaland dominions office rejected claim on grounds that union of south africa would respond with its own claim for southern half of territory coghlan directed his attention to northern rhodesia howard moffat his minister for mines and works had supervised mineral exploration in northern rhodesia twenty years earlier and so knew of rich copper deposits across zambezi however moffat s first public claim on northern territory in november 1925 was on issue of control of railway which would grant control of central african cattle trade at 1926 imperial conference in london some degree of control over railway was granted to southern rhodesia there was also issue of attracting labour for mines and farms from far north and this gave impetus to coghlan s and moffat s territorial expansionism in northern rhodesia and nyasaland coghlan called on britain s colonial secretary leopold amery to give north entirely to south or at least right to it but amery refused this request during his tour of southern rhodesia following year amery appeared to give support to its claims to neighbouring territories but by 1928 after coghlan s death both dominions office and colonial office were for maintaining northern rhodesia s territory intact and favoured its association with east african dependencies of kenya tanganyika and uganda death and legacy sir charles coghlan died on sunday 28 august 1927 at age of 64 of a cerebral haemorrhage a solemn requiem was celebrated for him in westminster cathedral he was initially buried in bulawayo cemetery but following a petition from bulawayo town council parliament consented for him to be reburied in matopos hills alongside cecil rhodes and sir starr jameson at a ceremony on 14 august 1930 sir john chancellor first governor of southern rhodesia after his retirement in 1928 spoke of progress that country had made in its first years of responsible government under stewardship of sir charles coghlan country s economy grew with annual revenue increasing from ps1 3 million to ps2 million with exports up from ps8 5 million to ps12 million despite setbacks in cotton and tobacco industries building housing zimbabwe s central intelligence organization bore name of sir charles however in april 1985 it was changed by office of prime minister robert mugabe to that of an ancestral spirit invoked by guerrillas opposing government of ian smith honours coghlan was knighted in 1910 for his services to 1908 national convention which led to south africa act 1909 and ultimately formation of union of south africa in 1925 rank of kcmg was conferred on him warrant having been signed by his friend earl buxton chancellor of order who had served as governor general of south africa from 1914 to 1920 and was president of african society from 1920 to 1933 references bibliography further reading external links coghlan and welsh coghlan welsh guest category
