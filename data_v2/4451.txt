john bull is a british built railroad steam locomotive that operated in united states it was operated for first time on september 15 1831 and it became oldest operable steam locomotive in world when smithsonian institution operated it in 1981 klein and bell pp 280 1 built by robert stephenson and company john bull was initially purchased by and operated for camden and amboy railroad first railroad in new jersey which gave john bull number 1 and its first name stevens robert l stevens was president of camden and amboy railroad at time c a used locomotive heavily from 1833 until 1866 when it was removed from active service and placed in storage after c a s assets were acquired by pennsylvania railroad prr in 1871 prr refurbished and operated locomotive a few times for public displays it was fired up for centennial exposition in 1876 and again for national railway appliance exhibition in 1883 in 1884 locomotive was purchased by smithsonian institution as museum s first major industrial exhibit in 1939 employees at prr s altoona pennsylvania workshops built an operable replica of locomotive for further exhibition duties as smithsonian desired to keep original locomotive in a more controlled environment after being on static display for next 42 years smithsonian commemorated locomotive s 150th birthday in 1981 by firing it up making it world s oldest surviving operable steam locomotive today original john bull is on static display once more in smithsonian s national museum of american history in washington d c replica john bull is preserved at railroad museum of pennsylvania construction and initial use thumb left john bull and train as it looked in 1831 drawn by isaac dripps in 1887 image from collection of national museum of american history smithsonian institution america on move exhibit used with permission john bull was built in newcastle england by robert stephenson and company for camden and amboy railroad c a first railroad built in new jersey it was dismantled and then shipped across atlantic ocean in crates aboard allegheny c a engineer isaac dripps reconstructed locomotive to best of his ability shipment did not include any drawings or instructions to assemble locomotive and ran it for first time in september 1831 carter p 140 whittemore p 32 on november 12 1831 robert stevens then president of c a repaid some political debts by inviting several members of new jersey legislature and some local dignitaries including napoleon s nephew prince murat for rides behind newly delivered locomotive over a short test track prince s wife catherine willis gray made a point of hurrying onto train so she could be declared first woman to ride a steam powered train in america though unknown to her men and women had already ridden behind steam powered maiden runs on baltimore and ohio south carolina railroad and mohawk and hudson by this point in 1831 wilson p 225 until railroad was completed locomotive was placed in storage horse drawn cars served construction efforts until 1833 c a applied both numbers and names to their first locomotives giving this engine number 1 and officially naming it stevens after c a s first president robert l stevens whittemore p 30 however through regular use of engine crews began calling it old john bull a reference to cartoon personification of england john bull eventually informal name was shortened to john bull and this name was so much more widely used that stevens fell out of use in september 1836 john bull and two coaches were shipped by canal to harrisburg and became first locomotive to operate there wilson p 54 mechanical modifications and early exhibitions thumb left john bull as it appeared in 1877 note cab and wider exhaust stack image from collection of national museum of american history smithsonian institution america on move exhibit used with permission stephenson built locomotive originally as an 0 4 0 locomotive s power was transmitted to driving axles through pistons that were mounted under boiler between two front wheels and in front of front axle these inside cylinders main rods were connected to a rear crank axle with a connecting rod between two axles to power front axle due to poorer quality track than was norm in its native england locomotive had much trouble with derailment c a s engineers added a leading truck to help guide engine into curves leading truck s mechanism necessitated removal of coupling rod between two main axles leaving only rear axle powered effectively john bull became a 4 2 0 later c a also added a pilot cowcatcher to lead truck klein and bell pp 283 287 cowcatcher is an angled assembly designed to deflect animals and debris off of railroad track in front of locomotive to protect locomotive s crew from weather c a also added a cab to locomotive c a workshop crews also added safety features such as a bell and headlight after several years serving as a switching engine and stationary boiler john bull was retired in 1866 and stored in bordentown new jersey toward end of its life in revenue service locomotive worked as a pump engine and as power for a sawmill white pp 32 34 c a was soon absorbed into united new jersey railroad and canal company 1869 which in turn was merged into pennsylvania railroad prr in 1871 prr saw potential publicity to be gained by exhibiting such an old engine showing it at 1876 centennial exposition in philadelphia prr workshop staff then back dated engine by replacing some original parts with parts that looked old or by removing them entirely exhaust stack was replaced with a straight tube of metal and cab walls and roof were removed prr then exhibited engine in 1883 at national railway appliance exhibition in chicago illinois in 1885 smithsonian institution accepted donation of john bull from prr as institution s first large engineering artifact smithsonian institution and locomotive restoration at exhibition in 1883 pennsylvania railroad ended up resolving two problems at once in smithsonian institution railroad was able to find a home for historic locomotive as well as a suitable new employer for a young civil engineer named j watkins watkins had been involved in an accident on railroad in new jersey a few years before exhibition he had lost a leg in accident so he was no longer suited to physical demands of railroad work although railroad did employ him as a clerk for a while after his accident prr employed his engineering experience as an expert curator for smithsonian s new arts and industries building which was opened in 1880 locomotive s first public exhibition at smithsonian occurred on december 22 1884 where it was displayed in east hall of arts and industries building white p 39 thumb john bull at world s columbian exposition in 1893 locomotive remained on display in this location for nearly 80 years but it was transported for display outside museum on certain rare occasions most significant display in this time occurred in 1893 when locomotive traveled to chicago for world s columbian exposition pennsylvania railroad like many other railroads of time put on grand displays of their progress prr arranged for locomotive and a couple of coaches to be delivered to railroad s jersey city new jersey workshops where it would undergo a partial restoration to operating condition prr was planning an event worthy of locomotive s significance to american railroad history railroad actually planned to operate locomotive for entire distance between new jersey and chicago restoration was supervised by prr s chief mechanical officer theodore n ely ely was confident enough in its 50 mile 80 5 km test run to perth amboy new jersey which took two hours and fifteen minutes that governors of all states that locomotive was to pass through and then president of united states grover cleveland were invited to ride behind engine on its first leg toward chicago john bull was to pull a few passenger cars in a train that would carry dignitaries and representatives of press train traveled to philadelphia pennsylvania in charge of one locomotive crew from philadelphia local engineers train drivers were employed to ride on locomotive s footplate as pilots to advise operators for trip over local engineers territories for rest of journey to chicago traveling at train departed from pennsylvania railroad s jersey city station at 10 16 a m on april 17 and reached chicago on april 22 locomotive operated during exhibition giving rides to exhibition s attendees and then train left chicago on december 6 for return trip to washington locomotive arrived back in washington on december 13 white pp 39 45 in 1927 john bull again traveled outside museum baltimore and ohio railroad was celebrating its centenary that year in its fair of iron horse in baltimore maryland since locomotive s original tender fuel and water car had deteriorated beyond repair and was dismantled in 1910 prr built a replica of tender at its altoona pennsylvania workshops locomotive was also refurbished in altoona for operation during fair white p 45 this fair was last steam up for locomotive until 1980 mostly static display after locomotive returned to smithsonian it remained on static display in 1930 museum commissioned altoona works to build a second replica of locomotive s tender for display with locomotive in museum this time however replica tender re used some of fittings that museum had retained when original tender was dismantled twenty years earlier smithsonian recognized locomotive s age in 1931 but since museum didn t have funds to refurbish locomotive for full operation again it was decided to run locomotive in place with driving wheels lifted off rails using jacks with compressed air museum borrowed an 1836 coach from pennsylvania railroad to display on track behind newly rebuilt tender and locomotive s 100th birthday was officially celebrated on november 12 1931 locomotive s semi operation was broadcast over cbs radio network with stanley bell narrating ceremonies for radio audience white pp 45 46 prr again borrowed locomotive from 1933 to 1934 for century of progress exhibition in chicago unlike its earlier jaunt to chicago for this trip railroad hauled and displayed it as a static exhibit while this exhibit was progressing altoona works were busy again building a replica this time replica was an operable copy of locomotive replica was then operated in 1940 at new york world s fair while original locomotive and rebuilt tender returned to smithsonian white p 46 original locomotive was displayed outside museum one more time in 1939 at new york world s fair but museum s curators decided that locomotive was becoming too fragile for repeated outside exhibits it was then placed in somewhat permanent display back in east hall where it remained for next 25 years in 1964 locomotive was moved to its current home national museum of american history then called museum of history and technology thumb 200px original locomotive under steam in 1981 john bull had remained on static display for another 15 years but locomotive s significance as one of oldest locomotives in existence or its use on first railroad in new jersey was not very plainly noted in display s literature as 1981 and locomotive s 150th birthday approached smithsonian started discussions on how best to commemorate locomotive s age and significance there was very little question that special publications and exhibits would be prepared but museum officials were left with thought that exhibit could still be so much more than that white pp 46 48 many superficial inspections were performed on locomotive in 1980 and it was found to be in relatively sound mechanical condition there wasn t a significant amount of deterioration noted in these early inspections and when wheels were jacked off rails as they had been 50 years earlier axles were found to be freely operable one morning in january 1980 before museum opened to public museum officials used compressed air to power cylinders and move wheels through connecting rods for first time since its last semi operation after compressed air blew some dirt and debris out of locomotive s exhaust stack it was soon running smoothly running gear seemed to be in good order but it was still unknown if boiler could still handle pressure of steam and a live fire again museum asked hartford steam boiler inspection and insurance company to inspect locomotive s boiler for operation inspections were conducted after hours at museum from 6 30 p m to 4 00 a m over three days and included electromagnetic ultrasonic and radiographic tests tests did reveal a few flaws but it was projected that engine could operate at a reduced boiler pressure of 50 psi 340 kpa as delivered to camden amboy boiler was rated for smithsonian s staff after a few further hydrostatic tests were confident that locomotive could again operate under its own power items that needed repair were repaired and on october 14 1980 locomotive was successfully field tested on warrenton branch line in fauquier county between calverton and casanova virginia site was selected because at time only one freight train per week used branch line on september 15 1981 locomotive operated under steam on a few miles of branch line near potomac river within washington d c with this exhibition locomotive became oldest operable steam locomotive and oldest self propelled vehicle in world original john bull is
