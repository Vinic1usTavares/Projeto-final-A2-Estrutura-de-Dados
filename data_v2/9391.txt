battle of kapetron or was fought between a byzantine georgian army and seljuq turks at plain of kapetron modern hasankale in northeastern turkey in 1048 event was culmination of a major raid led by seljuq prince ibrahim inal into byzantine ruled armenia a combination of factors meant that regular byzantine forces were at a considerable numerical disadvantage against turks local thematic armies had been disbanded while many of professional troops had been diverted to balkans to face revolt of leo tornikios as a result byzantine commanders aaron and katakalon kekaumenos disagreed on how best to confront invasion kekaumenos favoured an immediate and pre emptive strike while aaron favoured a more cautious strategy until arrival of reinforcements emperor constantine ix chose latter option and ordered his forces to adopted a passive stance while requesting aid from georgian ruler liparit iv this allowed turks to ravage at will notably leading to sack and destruction of great commercial centre of artze after georgians arrived combined byzantine georgian force gave battle at kapetron modern hasankale in a fierce nocturnal battle christian allies managed to repel turks and aaron and kekaumenos in command of two flanks pursued turks until next morning in centre however inal managed to capture liparit a fact of which two byzantine commanders were not informed until after they had given thanks to god for their victory inal was able to return unmolested to seljuq capital at rayy carrying enormous plunder two sides exchanged embassies leading to release of liparit and start of diplomatic relations between byzantine and seljuq courts emperor constantine ix took steps to strengthen his eastern frontier but due to internal infighting turkish invasions did not recommence until 1054 turks experienced increasing success aided by renewed diversion of byzantine troops to balkans to fight pechenegs disputes between various ethnic groups of eastern byzantine provinces and decline of byzantine army background after conquest of iran by seljuq empire a large number of oghuz turks arrived on byzantine borderlands of armenia in late 1040s eager for plunder and distinction in path of jihad they began raiding byzantine provinces in armenia at same time eastern defences of byzantine empire had been weakened by emperor constantine ix monomachos who allowed thematic troops provincial levies of iberia and mesopotamia to relinquish their military obligations in favour of tax payments seljuq expansion westward was a confused affair as it was accompanied by a mass migration of turkish tribes these tribes were only nominally subjects of seljuq rulers and their relations were dominated by a complex dynamic while seljuqs aimed at establishing a state with an orderly administration tribes were more interested in plunder and new pasture lands and launched raids independently of seljuq court latter tolerated this phenomenon as it helped to defuse tensions in seljuq heartlands a first large scale raid against eastern byzantine province of vaspurakan may have been undertaken around 1045 by qutalmish a cousin of seljuq ruler tughril beg qutalmish defeated and captured local byzantine commander stephen leichoudes another large scale invasion under tughril s nephew hasan deaf was launched soon after from tabriz into georgia returning via vaspurakan hasan s army was ambushed and destroyed east of lake van by local byzantine commanders katepano of vaspurakan aaron and katepano of ani and iberia katakalon kekaumenos this first raid is variously dated either to 1045 46 or 1048 an even larger invasion followed under ibrahim inal half brother of tughril beg byzantine sources regard this as a retaliation for hasan s defeat but as anthony kaldellis points out there were other factors at play as well ibn al athir reports that ibrahim had at this time received a large number of recent oghuz arrivals from transoxiana and that unable to provide for them sent them to raid byzantine provinces of armenia promising that he would soon follow with his own troops events of this campaign are well attested through histories of armenian historians aristakes lastivertsi and matthew of edessa and byzantine official john skylitzes ibrahim s invasion is usually dated by modern sources to 1048 although some date it to 1049 seljuq invasion and byzantine reaction thumb right alt mosaic of a standing crowned and bearded man dressed in gem clothing and carrying a big bag of money emperor constantine ix mosaic from hagia sophia skylitzes reports with obvious exaggeration that invaders numbered 100 000 men or five times as many as hasan s force he also adds detail that alongside turks seljuq army also counted many daylamites and probably khurasani iranians indeed skylitzes mentions that ibrahim had two lieutenants one chorosantes possibly a corruption of khurasani who likely commanded khurasani contingent and aspan salarios clearly a hellenisation of persian military rank like previous raid seljuq force most likely set out from tabriz and following course of araxes river entered ibn al athir reports that raiding detachments reached as far as trebizond in and river in north and districts of taron and in south but this probably refers to oghuz raiders ibrahim had sent out rather than main part of his army ibrahim s main army raided district of basean and area between theodosiopolis artze and district of on byzantine side skylitzes records a difference of opinion as to how to counter seljuq invasion kekaumenos who was probably one of historian s main sources and is generally lionised by skylitzes reportedly argued that they should confront them as soon as possible while they were still weary from their march and byzantines were in high spirits after their recent victory aaron on other hand argued in favour of a defensive strategy against such a large army recommending withdrawing behind their fortifications and conserving their forces until emperor constantine ix sent clear instructions it is clear that byzantines were considerably outnumbered likely as an effect not only of reduction of eastern provincial troops under constantine ix but also due to diversion of much of troops standing professional forces to deal with a revolt of western armies under leo tornikios in 1047 as a result aaron s view prevailed messages were sent to constantinople to inform emperor and in meantime byzantine troops made camp on plain of in basean while civilian population was ordered to find refuge in local fortresses indeed emperor constantine ix quickly sent orders that they should avoid action until arrival of reinforcements namely georgians of liparit iv duke of to whom emperor wrote requesting his aid sack of artze byzantine army s inactivity had tragic consequences as seljuqs were able to move about freely and attack fortress of artze a wealthy market town which attracted merchants from syria and armenia inhabitants resisted successfully for a while as seljuqs could not overcome barricades they had hastily erected but kekaumenos urgings to go to town s aid were rebuffed according to skylitzes by his fellow generals on account of emperor s order finally seljuqs dropped flammable material and torches into town so that defenders caught between a raging fire and turkish archers broke and fled town was captured and plundered and its inhabitants massacred skylitzes writes that around 150 000 souls reportedly perished by sword or by fire although this number is clearly exaggerated

athir claims that byzantine georgian troops numbered 50 000 men while aristakes lastivertsi raises number to 60 000 just as with turkish army both figures are clearly exaggerated again according to skylitzes kekaumenos advice to attack isolated turkish detachments as they arrived was not heeded because it was a saturday 18 september and liparit considered it an unlucky day and refused to fight this gave time for turks to bring up their entire army and form battle lines before advancing on byzantine georgian army which now was forced to prepare to give battle willy kekaumenos commanded right wing faced on turkish side by ibrahim himself liparit held centre faced by aspan salarios while byzantine left was commanded by aaron who was faced by chorosantes battle began late in evening and lasted through night aaron and kekaumenos in command of their respective flanks each defeated turks and pursued them till cock s crow killing turkish commander chorosantes in process in centre however ibrahim managed to capture liparit who was thrown off his horse when it was wounded this was not known to two byzantine commanders who thought georgian prince was pursuing enemy as they were they were not informed of true events until after they had stopped their pursuit to give thanks to god for their victory matthew of edessa whose narrative is heavily anti byzantine claims that liparit was betrayed by byzantine commanders while aristakes claims that rivalry between byzantine commanders led aaron to abandon his position mid battle leading to liparit s capture skylitzes account however being far more detailed is considered more reliable by modern scholars while ibrahim managed to escape with his men and captives to fortress of some 40 km east of theodosiopolis byzantine commanders held a council of war and decided to divide their forces and return to their respective bases aaron with his men returned to vaspurakan and kekaumenos with his forces to ani overall result of battle was thus mixed while byzantines prevailed against their turkish counterparts capture of liparit and successful escape of ibrahim led many of medieval sources to consider it a byzantine defeat aftermath thumb right 300px alt political map of caucasus region with various countries labelled and depicted in different colours political map of caucasus region according to skylitzes ibrahim returned to rayy in only five days presenting himself before his brother ibn al athir reports with obvious exaggeration for propaganda purposes that ibrahim brought back 100 000 captives and a vast booty including large numbers of horses flocks and goods as well as 8 000 coats of mail loaded on backs of ten thousand camels devastation left behind by seljuq raid was so fearful that byzantine magnate eustathios described in 1051 52 those lands as foul and unmanageable inhabited by snakes scorpions and wild beasts muslim sources on other hand follow conventions of jihad narratives in stressing success of campaign in reaching deep into byzantine territory allegedly only 15 days march from constantinople and amount of plunder and captives seized these successes were widely publicized to serve political aims taking up mantle of jihad against age old enemy of islam legitimized upstart seljuqs and bolstered their claims to be pre eminent power in muslim world particularly in their chosen role as champions of sunni orthodoxy against shi a fatimid caliphate emperor constantine ix lamented liparit s capture and tried to secure his release offering a rich ransom seljuq ruler set liparit free and gave him ransom after extracting a pledge from him not to fight against turks again perhaps swayed by his brother s claims that campaign had been an unalloyed success also sent a sharif to constantinople to demand tribute of constantine ix but envoy was sent back empty handed constantine ix did however agree to allow tughril to sponsor restoration of mosque of byzantine capital and to have names of abbasid caliph al qa im and of tughril himself commemorated in friday prayer instead of fatimid caliph expecting an imminent resumption of seljuq raids emperor sent agents to fortify his eastern border but toghril was occupied for a time with revolt of ibrahim instigated according to skylitzes by seljuq ruler s jealousy of achievements of his brother this is likely also moment when byzantines launched an offensive under nikephoros against their old adversary abu l ibn fadl emir of dvin nevertheless byzantine defences in east were weakened again as troops were transferred to balkans to face invasions of pechenegs which began at that time seljuq raids recommenced on a large scale in 1054 with toghril himself leading them cities of and were sacked and manzikert was besieged turkish incursions continued with increasing success as native byzantine troops were run down by neglect from central government increasingly replaced by unreliable mercenaries and misguided policies exacerbated rivalries and disputes between byzantine greeks armenians and in empire s eastern provinces as balance of power turned seljuqs began capturing major urban centres in
