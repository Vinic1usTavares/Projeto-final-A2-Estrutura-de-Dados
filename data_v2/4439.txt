year award for his 1983 book my journey with loch ness monster he began forging documents that same year as a way to earn money story which became basis for drowned god was originally a phony manuscript horse wrote in 1983 ostensibly describing events after destruction of lost city of atlantis manuscript dated 1846 was said to have been written by english poet richard horne who shares horse s birth name horse s initiation into concept of an alternate history came in early 1980s when he first encountered professor ian halpke who explained to him that information from kabbalah and ancient jewish texts hide and secret namely human evolution was aided by extraterrestrial intelligence according to horse halpke believed ark of covenant was a nuclear device and that humans and pigs share compatible genes initially experts determined manuscript was genuine as date horse picked matched time period horne had been alive and active and manuscript s topics matched poet s interests horse had written manuscript without knowing any of these details after his hoax was discovered horse held onto text for next decade until he played myst and 7th guest and decided point and click adventure genre was a good match for his conspiracy theory inspired ideas he later said that while story of myst did not interest him game s artwork and sense of immersion inspired him to immediately begin working on drowned god in 1994 game was originally commissioned by a division of time warner and was later taken over by inscape when that division closed horse worked with inigo orduna and anthony mcgaw for six months designing game then cooperated with game s artists and until project s completion game s producer algy williams hired puzzle expert chris whose output he called fiendishly difficult to design game s puzzles together with john morris williams also employed sculptor greg boulton who had previously worked on peter gabriel video sledgehammer drowned god music was written and performed by an ambient music duo operating under name miasma william s burroughs was originally scheduled to narrate game but died just before he could begin recording mcgaw and williams later founded company babel media which specializes in video game localization god was released on october 31 1996 for windows 95 operating system around same time there was going to be a release for windows 3 1 but those plans were cancelled in its first two weeks it sold 34 000 copies in united states it was one of top ten best selling video games in united states during first month after its release but bugs and poor support from developers caused it to fall out of favor with gamers by december by february 1998 game had sold over 60 000 copies around time of game s release horse stated that its story was incomplete and that rest of story would be revealed in a sequel called cult planned to center around area 51 however he killed himself as well as his wife and pets a decade after game s release and no sequel was ever completed god received mixed reviews with many critics complimenting game s ideas and imagery while giving a less favorable response to its audio puzzles and execution gamespot reviewer vince broady wrote that game sounded very promising and might also raise awareness of thread of deception that runs throughout recorded history steve ramsey of quandary said drowned god presented its massive assortment of conspiracy theories entertainingly ray ivey of just adventure called drowned god strangest creepiest most psychedelic adventure game i ve yet to come across although ivey did not understand much of game he found it enjoyable because it made sense to game s characters and creators t liam mcdonald of pc gamer wrote that he was fascinated by strong sense of style and intellectual approach to terrific subject matter steven levy and patricia king of newsweek found game to be richly detailed and original article details in 2012 andy hughes of topless robot put game at top of his list of 9 surprising literary references in videogames hughes wrote that game was one that could be played from start to finish without having any idea what hell s going on noting its references to a wide variety of subjects including egyptian mythology man in iron mask and bermuda triangle broady complimented graphics writing drowned god is loaded with freaky animations and unexpected visual twists ramsey praised visuals and audio saying both contributed to game s shadowy and secretive feelings his one significant criticism was that dialogue was difficult to hear with no option to display text for it regarding game s audio aspect broady said soundtrack is less impressive primarily because of overuse background effects drone on mercilessly and many of game s narratives which are universally well written and finely acted must be listened to over and over again puzzles according to broady were of uneven quality he called some hopelessly difficult and others extremely derivative by contrast he viewed albert einstein and isaac newton dialogue puzzle as brilliant but said ideas as original as horse s call for puzzles to match not rehashes of things we ve seen far too many times already ramsey thought puzzles were challenging but not overly difficult arguing on almost every occasion i felt that i was making progress and i never felt bogged down and hopelessly lost he felt puzzles were mostly well integrated and found those that were not did not detract from his enjoyment ivey remarked for puzzle lovers drowned god is a treasure trove this collection of tricky are challenging and frequently innovative broady panned navigation for being confusing counter intuitive and requiring player to revisit locations multiple times he concluded his review by saying net effect is that story which made this game so intriguing in first place is almost totally lost and that is a shame gamespot considered game one of most disappointing of 1996 in their annual recap writing great premise is buried like mysteries of ages themselves under a mediocre myst clone bob strauss of entertainment weekly opined that game tried to be too many things and quipped result is a game so obscure you d be better off perusing something more comprehensible like collected works of zoroaster mark reece and brooke adams of deseret news also had mixed feelings about game calling it both clever and deep and frustrating and difficult mcdonald wrote that he was frustrated by lack of good game play hughes called pace of game and its puzzles both tedious and ponderous but said it had ambition out genetically modified ears editors of cnet gamecenter nominated drowned god for their 1996 best adventure game award which ultimately went to they wrote national enquirer meets myst for adventure gamer with a taste for mouse pounding puzzles it just didn t get much better than this references external links drowned god electronic press kit
