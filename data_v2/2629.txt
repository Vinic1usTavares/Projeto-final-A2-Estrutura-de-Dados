indonesian national revolution or indonesian war of independence was an armed conflict and diplomatic struggle between republic of indonesia and dutch empire and an internal social revolution during postwar and postcolonial indonesia it took place between indonesia s declaration of independence in 1945 and netherlands recognition of indonesia s independence at end of 1949 four year struggle involved sporadic but bloody armed conflict internal indonesian political and communal upheavals and two major international diplomatic interventions dutch military forces and for a while forces of world war ii allies were able to control major towns cities and industrial assets in republican heartlands on java and sumatra but could not control countryside by 1949 international pressure on netherlands and partial military stalemate became such that it recognised indonesian independence revolution marked end of colonial administration of dutch east indies except for netherlands new guinea it also significantly changed ethnic castes as well as reducing power of many of local rulers raja it did not significantly improve economic or political fortune of majority of population although a few indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce background indonesian independence movement began in may 1908 which is commemorated as day of national awakening indonesian nationalism and movements supporting independence from dutch colonialism such as budi utomo indonesian national party sarekat islam and indonesian communist party pki grew rapidly in first half of 20th century budi utomo sarekat islam and others pursued strategies of co operation by joining dutch initiated volksraad people s council in hope that indonesia would be granted self rule others chose a non cooperative strategy demanding freedom of self government from dutch east indies colony most notable of these leaders were sukarno and mohammad hatta two students and nationalist leaders who had benefited from educational reforms of dutch ethical policy occupation of indonesia by japan for three and a half years during world war ii was a crucial factor in subsequent revolution netherlands had little ability to defend its colony against japanese army and within only three months of their initial attacks japanese had occupied dutch east indies in java and to a lesser extent in sumatra indonesia s two dominant islands japanese spread and encouraged nationalist sentiment although this was done more for japanese political advantage than from altruistic support of indonesian independence this support created new indonesian institutions including local neighbourhood organisations and elevated political leaders such as sukarno just as significantly for subsequent revolution japanese destroyed and replaced much of dutch created economic administrative and political infrastructure on 7 september 1944 with war going badly for japanese prime minister koiso promised independence for indonesia but no date was set for supporters of sukarno this announcement was seen as vindication for his collaboration with japanese independence declared under pressure from radical and politicised pemuda youth groups sukarno and hatta proclaimed indonesian independence on 17 august 1945 two days after japanese emperor s surrender in pacific following day central indonesian national committee knip elected sukarno as president and hatta as vice president revolution and bersiap thumb left bendera pusaka first indonesian flag is raised on 17 august 1945 it was mid september before news of declaration of independence spread to outer islands and many indonesians far from capital jakarta did not believe it as news spread most indonesians came to regard themselves as pro republican and a mood of revolution swept across country external power had shifted it would be weeks before allied forces shipping entered indonesia owing in part to boycotts and strikes in australia on coaling loading and manning dutch shipping from australia where netherlands east indies government in exile was based these strikes were only fully broken in july 1946 japanese on other hand were required by terms of surrender to both lay down their arms and maintain order a contradiction that some resolved by handing weapons to japanese trained indonesians resulting power vacuums in weeks following japanese surrender created an atmosphere of uncertainty but also one of opportunity for republicans many pemuda joined pro republic struggle groups badan most disciplined were soldiers from japanese formed but disbanded giyugun peta volunteer army and heiho local soldiers employed by japanese armed forces groups many groups were undisciplined due to both circumstances of their formation and what they perceived as revolutionary spirit in first weeks japanese troops often withdrew from urban areas to avoid confrontations by september 1945 control of major infrastructure installations including railway stations and trams in java s largest cities had been taken over by republican pemuda who encountered little japanese resistance to spread revolutionary message pemuda set up their own radio stations and newspapers and graffiti proclaimed nationalist sentiment on most islands struggle committees and militia were set up republican newspapers and journals were common in jakarta yogyakarta and surakarta which fostered a generation of writers known as 45 generation of 45 many of whom believed their work could be part of revolution republican leaders struggled to come to terms with popular sentiment some wanted passionate armed struggle others a more reasoned approach some leaders such as leftist tan malaka spread idea that this was a revolutionary struggle to be led and won by indonesian pemuda sukarno and hatta in contrast were more interested in planning out a government and institutions to achieve independence through diplomacy pro revolution demonstrations took place in large cities including one led by tan malaka in jakarta with over 200 000 people which sukarno and hatta fearing violence successfully quelled thumb dutch soldiers in east indies 1946 by september 1945 many of self proclaimed pemuda who were ready to die for 100 freedom were getting impatient it was common for ethnic out groups dutch internees eurasian ambonese and chinese and anyone considered to be a spy to be subjected to intimidation kidnap robbery murder and organised massacres such attacks would continue throughout course of revolution but were most present during 1945 46 period which is known as bersiap after bersiap in 1947 dutch authorities attempted to retrieve bodies of victims and several survivors of period provided legal testimony to attorney general office due to continued revolutionary warfare few bodies were found and few cases came to court around 3 500 graves of bersiap victims can be found in kembang kuning war cemetery in surabaya and elsewhere

revolutionaries lost at least 20 000 often young fighting men estimates of number of indonesian fighters killed in lead up and during battle of surabaya range from 6 300 to 15 000 japanese forces lost around 1 000 soldiers and british forces registered 660 soldiers mostly british indians as killed with a similar number missing in action actual dutch military were hardly involved former knil pows were still recuperating in allied military bases outside of indonesia e g japan and philippines british in fact prohibited dutch troops from entering country during most of bersiap period as they only started to return to indonesia in march and april 1946 formation of republican government by end of august 1946 a central republican government had been established in jakarta it adopted a constitution drafted during japanese occupation by preparatory committee for indonesian independence with general elections yet to be held a central indonesian national committee knip was appointed to assist president similar committees were established at provincial and regency levels questions of allegiance immediately arose amongst indigenous rulers central javanese principalities for example immediately declared themselves republican while many raja rulers of outer islands who had been enriched from their support of dutch were less enthusiastic such reluctance among many outer islands was sharpened by radical non aristocratic and sometimes islamic nature of java centric republican leadership support did however come from south sulawesi including king of bone who still recalled battles against dutch from early in century and from makassarese and bugis raja who supported republican governor of jakarta a christian many balinese raja accepted republican authority fearing dutch would attempt to re establish their authority over indonesia new republican government and its leaders moved quickly to strengthen fledgling administration within indonesia newly formed government although enthusiastic was fragile and focused in java where focused at all it was rarely and loosely in contact with outer islands which had more japanese troops particularly in japanese naval areas less sympathetic japanese commanders and fewer republican leaders and activists in november 1945 a parliamentary form of government was established and sjahrir was appointed prime minister in week following japanese surrender giyugun peta and heiho groups were disbanded by japanese most peta and heiho members did not yet know about declaration of independence command structures and membership vital for a national army were consequently dismantled thus rather than being formed from a trained armed and organised army republican armed forces began to grow in september from usually younger less trained groups built around charismatic leaders creating a rational military structure that was obedient to central authority from such disorganisation was one of major problems of revolution a problem that remains through to contemporary times in self created indonesian army japanese trained indonesian officers prevailed over those trained by dutch a thirty year old former school teacher sudirman was elected commander in chief at first meeting of division commanders in yogyakarta on 12 november 1945 allied counter revolution dutch accused sukarno and hatta of collaborating with japanese and denounced republic as a creation of japanese fascism dutch east indies administration had just received a ten million dollar loan from united states to finance its return to indonesia allied occupation netherlands however was critically weakened from world war ii in europe and did not return as a significant military force until early 1946 japanese and members of allied forces reluctantly agreed to act as caretakers as us forces were focusing on japanese home islands archipelago was put under jurisdiction of british admiral earl louis mountbatten supreme allied commander south east asia command allied enclaves already existed in kalimantan indonesian borneo morotai maluku and parts of irian jaya dutch administrators had already returned to these areas in japanese navy areas arrival of allied troops quickly prevented revolutionary activities where australian troops followed by dutch troops and administrators took japanese surrender except for bali and lombok due to lack of strong resistance two australian army divisions succeeded in occupying eastern indonesia thumb left indian and british troops move cautiously along a jungle track round town of gresik british were charged with restoring order and civilian government in java dutch took this to mean pre war colonial administration and continued to claim sovereignty over indonesia british and indian troops did not however land on java to accept japanese surrender until late september 1945 lord mountbatten s immediate tasks included repatriation of some 300 000 japanese and freeing prisoners of war he did not want nor did he have resources to commit his troops to a long struggle to regain indonesia for dutch first british troops reached jakarta in late september 1945 and arrived in cities of medan north sumatra padang west sumatra palembang south sumatra semarang central java and surabaya east java in october in an attempt to avoid clashes with indonesians british commander lieutenant general sir philip christison diverted soldiers of former dutch colonial army to eastern indonesia where dutch reoccupation was proceeding smoothly tensions mounted as allied troops entered java and sumatra clashes broke out between republicans and their perceived enemies namely dutch prisoners dutch colonial troops knil chinese indo europeans and japanese first stages of warfare were initiated in october 1945 when in accordance with terms of their surrender japanese tried to re establish authority they had relinquished to indonesians in towns and cities japanese military police killed republican pemuda in pekalongan central java on 3 october and japanese troops drove republican pemuda out of bandung in west java and handed city to british but fiercest fighting involving japanese was in semarang on 14 october british forces began to occupy city retreating republican forces retaliated by killing between 130 and 300 japanese prisoners they were holding five hundred japanese and 2 000 indonesians had been killed and japanese had almost captured city six days later when british forces arrived allies repatriated remaining japanese troops and civilians to japan although about 1 000 elected to remain behind and later assisted republican forces in fighting for independence thumb destruction in bandung s chinese quarter british subsequently decided to evacuate 10 000 indo europeans and european internees in volatile central java interior british detachments sent to towns of ambarawa and magelang encountered strong republican resistance and used air attacks against indonesians sukarno arranged a ceasefire on 2 november but by late november fighting had resumed and british withdrew to coast republican attacks against allied and alleged pro dutch civilians reached a peak in november and december with 1 200 killed in bandung as pemuda returned to offensive in march 1946 departing republicans responded to a british ultimatum for them to leave city of bandung by deliberately burning down much of southern half of city in what is popularly known in indonesia as bandung sea of fire last british troops left indonesia in november 1946 but by this time 55 000 dutch troops had landed in java battle of surabaya thumb right a soldier of an indian armoured regiment examines a marmon herrington light tank used by indonesian nationalists and captured by british forces during fighting in surabaya battle of surabaya was heaviest single battle of revolution and became a national symbol of indonesian resistance pemuda groups in surabaya second largest city in indonesia seized arms and ammunition from japanese and set up two new organisations indonesia national committee and people s security council bkr by time allied forces arrived at end of october 1945 pemuda foothold in surabaya city was described as a strong unified fortress in september and october 1945 europeans and pro dutch eurasians were attacked and killed by indonesian mobs ferocious fighting erupted when 6 000 british indian troops landed in city sukarno and hatta negotiated a ceasefire between republicans and british forces led by brigadier mallaby mallaby was killed on 30 october 1945 while he was travelling about surabaya under a white flag to spread news about cease fire agreement and rescue some stranded mahratta troops despite being warned of danger by force 136 troops following killing of mallaby on 30 october british sent more troops into city from 10 november under cover of air attacks although european forces largely captured city in three days poorly armed republicans fought on until 29 november and thousands died as population fled to countryside despite military defeat suffered by republicans and a loss of manpower and weaponry that would severely hamper republican forces for rest of revolution battle and defence mounted by indonesians galvanised nation in support of independence and helped garner international attention for dutch it removed any doubt that republic was a well organised resistance with popular support it also convinced britain to lie on side of neutrality in revolution and within a few years britain would support republican cause in united nations installing netherlands indies civil administration thumb right javanese revolutionaries armed with bamboo spears and a few japanese rifles 1946 with british assistance dutch landed their netherlands indies civil administration nica forces in jakarta and other key centres republican sources reported 8 000 deaths up to january 1946 in defence of jakarta but they could not hold city republican leadership thus established themselves in city of yogyakarta with crucial support of new sultan sri sultan hamengkubuwono ix yogyakarta went on to play a leading role in revolution which would result in city being granted its own special territory status in bogor near jakarta and in balikpapan in kalimantan republican officials were imprisoned in preparation for dutch occupation of sumatra its largest cities palembang and medan were bombed in december 1946 special forces depot dst led by commando and counter insurgency expert captain raymond turk westerling were accused of pacifying southern sulawesi region using arbitrary terror techniques which were copied by other anti republicans as many as 3 000 republican militia and their supporters were killed in a few weeks on java and sumatra dutch found military success in cities and major towns but they were unable to subdue villages and countryside on outer islands including bali republican sentiment was not as strong at least among elite they were consequently occupied by dutch with comparative ease and autonomous states were set up by dutch largest state of east indonesia nit encompassed most of eastern indonesia and was established in december 1946 with its administrative capital in makassar diplomacy and military offensives linggadjati agreement linggadjati agreement brokered by british and concluded in november 1946 saw netherlands recognise republic as de facto authority over java madura and sumatra both parties agreed to formation of united states of indonesia by 1 january 1949 a semi autonomous federal state with monarch of netherlands at its head republican controlled java and sumatra would be one of its states alongside areas that were generally under stronger dutch influence including southern kalimantan and great east which consisted of sulawesi maluku lesser sunda islands and western new guinea central national committee of indonesia knip did not ratify agreement until february 1947 and neither republic nor dutch were satisfied with it on 25 march 1947 lower house of dutch parliament ratified a stripped down version of treaty which was not accepted by republic both sides soon accused other of violating agreement operation product at midnight on 20 july 1947 dutch launched a major military offensive called operatie product with intent of conquering republic claiming violations of agreement dutch described campaign as police actions to restore law and order this used to be task of knil however at time majority of dutch troops in indonesia belonged to royal netherlands army soon after end of world war ii 25 000 volunteers among them 5 000 marines had been sent overseas they were later followed by larger numbers of conscripts from netherlands in offensive dutch forces drove republican troops out of parts of sumatra and east and west java republicans were confined to yogyakarta region of java to maintain their force in java now numbering 100 000 troops dutch gained control of lucrative sumatran plantations and oil and coal installations and in java control of all deep water ports thumb a dutch military column during operation product international reaction to dutch actions was negative neighbouring australia and newly independent india were particularly active in supporting republic s cause in un as was soviet union and most significantly united states dutch ships continued to be boycotted from loading and unloading by australian waterside workers a blockade that began in september 1945 united nations security council became directly involved in conflict establishing a good offices committee to sponsor further negotiations making dutch diplomatic position particularly difficult a ceasefire called for by unsc resolution 27 was ordered by dutch and sukarno on 4 august 1947 during military action on 9 december 1947 dutch troops killed many civilians in village of now in west java renville agreement thumb van mook line in java areas in red were under republican control united nations security council brokered renville agreement in an attempt to rectify collapsed agreement agreement was ratified in january 1948 and recognised a cease fire along so called van mook line an artificial line which connected most advanced dutch positions many republican positions however were still held behind dutch lines agreement also required referenda to be held on political future of dutch held areas apparent reasonableness of republicans garnered much important american goodwill diplomatic efforts between netherlands and republic continued throughout 1948 and 1949 political pressures both domestic and international hindered dutch attempts to decide upon objectives similarly republican leaders faced great difficulty in persuading their people to accept diplomatic concessions by july 1948 negotiations were in deadlock and netherlands pushed unilaterally towards van mook s federal indonesia concept new federal states of south sumatra and east java were created although neither had a viable support base netherlands set up voor or federal consultative assembly a body comprising leadership of federal states and charged with formation of a united states of indonesia and an interim government by end of 1948 dutch plans however had no place for republic unless it accepted a minor role already defined for it later plans included java and sumatra but dropped all mention of republic main sticking point in negotiations was balance of power between netherlands high representative and republican forces mutual distrust between netherlands and republic hindered negotiations republic feared a second major dutch offensive while dutch objected to continued republican activity on dutch side of renville line in february 1948 siliwangi division 35 000 men of republican army led by nasution marched from west java to central java relocation was intended to ease internal republican tensions involving division in surakarta area battalion however clashed with dutch troops while crossing mount slamet and dutch believed it was part of a systematic troop movement across renville line fear of such incursions actually succeeding along with apparent republican undermining of dutch established pasundan state and negative reports led to dutch leadership increasingly seeing itself as losing control operation crow and general offensive serangan oemoem left thumb two men with rope around their necks are handcuffed by tni officers on september 1948 in madiun indonesia frustrated at negotiations with republic and believing it weakened by both darul islam and madiun insurgencies dutch launched a military offensive on 19 december 1948 which it termed operatie kraai operation crow by following day it had conquered city of yogyakarta location of temporary republican capital by end of december all major republican held cities in java and sumatra were in dutch hands republican president vice president and all but six republic of indonesia ministers were captured by dutch troops and exiled on bangka island off east coast of sumatra in areas surrounding yogyakarta and surakarta republican forces refused to surrender and continued to wage a guerrilla war under leadership of republican military chief of staff general sudirman who had escaped dutch offensives an emergency republican government republik indonesia was established in west sumatra thumb dutch forces in east indies 1948 although dutch forces conquered towns and cities in republican heartlands on java and sumatra they could not control villages and countryside republican troops and militia led by lt colonel later president suharto attacked dutch positions in yogyakarta at dawn on 1 march 1949 dutch were expelled from city for six hours but reinforcements were brought in from nearby cities of ambarawa and semarang that afternoon indonesian fighters retreated at 12 00 pm and dutch re entered city indonesian attack later known in indonesia as serangan oemoem new spelling serangan 1 march general offensive is commemorated by a large monument in yogyakarta a large scale attack against dutch troops in surakarta on 10 august same year resulted in republican forces holding city for two days once again international opinion of dutch military campaigns was one of outrage significantly in both united nations and united states in january 1949 united nations security council passed a resolution demanding reinstatement of republican government united states aid specifically earmarked for dutch indonesia was immediately cancelled and pressure mounted within us congress for all united states aid to be cut off this included marshall plan funds vital for dutch post world war ii rebuilding that had so far totalled us 1 billion netherlands government had spent an amount equivalent to almost half of this funding their campaigns in indonesia that united states aid could be used to fund a senile and ineffectual imperialism encouraged many key voices in united states including those amongst us republican party and from within american churches and ngos to speak out in support of indonesian independence internal turmoil social revolutions so called social revolutions following independence proclamation were challenges to dutch established indonesian social order and to some extent a result of resentment against japanese imposed policies across country people rose up against traditional aristocrats and village heads and attempted to exert popular ownership of land and other resources majority of social revolutions ended quickly in most cases challenges to social order were quashed although in east sumatra sultanates were overthrown and there were mass killings of members of aristocratic families a culture of violence rooted in deep conflicts that split countryside during revolution would repeatedly erupt throughout whole second half of 20th century term social revolution has been applied to a range of mostly violent activities of left that included both altruistic attempts to organise real revolution and simple expressions of revenge resentment and assertions of power violence was one of many lessons learned during japanese occupation and figures identified as feudal including kings regents or simply wealthy were often attacked and sometimes beheaded rape became a weapon against feudal women in coastal sultanates of sumatra and kalimantan for example sultans and others whose authority had been shored up by dutch were attacked as soon as japanese authority left secular local lords of aceh who had been foundation of dutch rule were executed although most of indonesia s sultanates fell back into dutch hands most indonesians lived in fear and uncertainty particularly a significant proportion of population who supported dutch or who remained under dutch control popular revolutionary cry freedom or death was often interpreted to justify killings under claimed republican authority traders were often in particularly difficult positions on one hand they were pressured by republicans to boycott all sales to dutch on other hand dutch police could be merciless in their efforts to stamp out smugglers on which republican economy depended in some areas term kedaulatan rakyat exercising sovereignty of people which is mentioned in preamble of constitution and used by pemuda to demand pro active policies from leaders came to be used not only in demanding of free goods but also to justify extortion and robbery chinese merchants in particular were often forced to keep their goods at artificially low prices under threat of death communist and islamist insurgencies on 18 september 1948 an indonesian soviet republic was declared in madiun east of yogyakarta by members of pki and indonesian socialist party psi judging time right for a proletarian uprising they intended it to be a rallying point for revolt against sukarno hatta slaves of japanese and america madiun however was won back by republican forces within a few weeks and insurgency leader musso killed rm suryo governor of east java as well as several police officers and religious leaders were killed by rebels this ended a distraction for revolution and it turned vague american sympathies based on anti colonial sentiments into diplomatic support internationally republic was now seen as being staunchly anti communist and a potential ally in emerging global cold war between american led free world and soviet led bloc members of republican army who had come from indonesian hizbullah felt betrayed by indonesian government in may 1948 they declared a break away regime negara islam indonesia indonesian islamic state better known as darul islam led by an islamic mystic darul islam sought to establish indonesia as an islamic theocracy at time republican government did not respond as they were focused on threat from dutch some leaders of sympathised with rebellion after republic regained all territories in 1950 government took darul islam threat seriously especially after some provinces declared that they had joined darul islam rebellion was put down in 1962 transfer of sovereignty thumb australian newspaper regarding independence of indonesia date december 28 1949 resilience of indonesian republican resistance and active international diplomacy set world opinion against dutch efforts to re establish their colony second police action was a diplomatic disaster for dutch cause newly appointed united states secretary of state dean acheson pushed netherlands government into negotiations earlier recommended by united nations but until then defied by netherlands dutch indonesian round table conference was held in hague from 23 august 1949 to 2 november 1949 between republic netherlands and dutch created federal states netherlands agreed to recognise indonesian sovereignty over a new federal state known as united states of indonesia rusi it would include all territory of former dutch east indies with exception of netherlands new guinea sovereignty over which it was agreed would be retained by netherlands until further negotiations with indonesia other issue on which indonesia gave concessions was netherlands east indies debt indonesia agreed to responsibility for this sum of ps4 3 billion much of which was directly attributable to dutch attempts to crush revolution sovereignty was formally transferred on 27 december 1949 and new state was immediately recognised by united states of america thumb left united states of indonesia december 1949 republic of indonesia is shown in red republican controlled java and sumatra together formed a single state in sixteen state rusi federation but accounted for almost half its population other fifteen federal states had been created by netherlands since 1945 these states were dissolved into republic over first half of 1950 an abortive anti republic coup in bandung and jakarta by westerling s legion of ratu adil apra on 23 january 1950 resulted in dissolution of populous pasundan state in west java thus quickening dissolution of federal structure colonial soldiers who were largely ambonese clashed with republican troops in makassar during makassar uprising in april 1950 predominantly christian ambonese were from one of few regions with pro dutch sentiments and they were suspicious of javanese muslim dominated republic whom they unfavourably regarded as leftists on 25 april 1950 an independent republic of south maluku rms was proclaimed in ambon but this was suppressed by republican troops during a campaign from july to november with state of east sumatra now being only federal state remaining it too folded and fell in line with unitary republic on 17 august 1950 fifth anniversary of his declaration of indonesian independence sukarno proclaimed republic of indonesia as a unitary state impacts thumb indonesian vice president hatta and dutch queen juliana at signing ceremony which took place at royal palace of amsterdam with treaty signed dutch officially recognised indonesian sovereignty although there is no accurate account of how many indonesians died they died in far greater numbers than europeans estimates of indonesian deaths in fighting range from 45 000 to 100 000 and civilian dead exceeded 25 000 and may have been as high as 100 000 a total of 1 200 british soldiers were killed or went missing in java and sumatra in 1945 and 1946 most of them indian soldiers more than 5 000 dutch soldiers lost their lives in indonesia between 1945 and 1949 many japanese died in bandung alone 1 057 died only about half of whom died in actual combat rest killed in

losses in war at in delft revolution had direct effects on economic conditions shortages were common particularly food clothing and fuel there were in effect two economies dutch and republican both of which had to simultaneously rebuild after world war ii and survive disruptions of revolution republic had to set up all necessities of life ranging from postage stamps army badges and train tickets whilst subject to dutch trade blockades confusion and ruinous inflationary surges resulted from competing currencies japanese new dutch money and republican currencies were all used often concurrently indonesian independence was secured through a blend of both diplomacy and force despite their ill discipline raising prospect of anarchy without pemuda confronting foreign and indonesian colonial forces republican diplomatic efforts would have been futile revolution is turning point of modern indonesian history and it has provided reference point and validation for country s major political trends that continue to present day it gave impetus to communism in country to militant nationalism to sukarno s guided democracy to political islam origins of indonesian army and its role in indonesian power country s constitutional arrangements and centralism of power in indonesia revolution destroyed a colonial administration ruled from other side of world and dismantled with it raja seen by many as obsolete and powerless also it relaxed rigid racial and social categorisations of colonial indonesia tremendous energies and aspirations were created amongst indonesians a new creative surge was seen in writing and art as was a great demand for education and modernisation it did not however significantly improve economic or political fortune of population s poverty stricken peasant
