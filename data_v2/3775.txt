model maker and graphic designer he also assisted gillain with setting up of totale journal a publication he would later work for again upon his return from america work in united states mezieres had been fascinated by american old west since he was a little boy through exposure to western genre films starring likes of gary cooper burt lancaster and james stewart and comics such as lucky luke and jerry spring at age of sixteen he had attempted to travel to mexico with jean giraud whose mother lived there but was prevented by his parents in 1965 mezieres arranged a working visa through a friend of jije s who had a factory in houston texas in end however he never took up job in houston after staying in new york for a few months call of west proved too strong and eventually he ended up hitchhiking across country first to seattle and then to montana where he worked on a ranch driving tractors laying posts and cleaning stables before ending up in san francisco his initial plan was to find work in an advertising agency in san francisco but he ran foul of immigration service who told him that his visa was good for working in factory in houston and nowhere else he quickly left san francisco in search of an authentic wild west cowboy experience arriving in salt lake city utah with no money he sought out pierre christin who was living there while teaching at university of utah and turned up on his doorstep asking him if he could sleep on his to make ends meet mezieres produced some illustrations for a small advertising agency in salt lake city and for a mormon children s magazine called children s friend as well as selling some photographs he had taken while working on ranch in montana after a few months he found work on a ranch in utah this time succeeding in his aspiration of living life of a cowboy an experience he described as better than in my dreams when winter came and there was no work available on ranches he collaborated with christin on a six page strip called le du punch a copy of which he sent to jean giraud who was by now writing and illustrating blueberry for franco belgian comics magazine pilote giraud showed strip to pilote s editor rene goscinny who agreed to publish it issue 335 24 march 1966 this was followed by another collaboration titled comment reussir en affaires en se donnant un mal fou how to succeed in business by almost killing oneself through hard work which was also published in pilote issue 351 14 july 1966 by this stage mezieres visa was almost expired and so he used money from these strips to pay for his ticket home in leaving america mezieres also left behind a young woman linda one of christin s students she followed him to france some months later and is now his wife mezieres experiences in united states have provided inspiration for several magazine articles published in pilote tintin and geo magazines as well as two books olivier chez les cow boys olivier with cowboys a children s book written by pierre christin with photographs and illustrations by mezieres about a visit christin s son olivier paid to ranch mezieres worked on in utah and adieu reve americain farewell american dreams again written by christin with photographs and illustrations by mezieres a nostalgic look back at their time in united states valerian on his return from united states mezieres visited offices of pilote magazine to see rene goscinny and jean michel charlier goscinny put him to work on l extraordinaire et aventure de mr august faust extraordinary and troubling adventure of mr august faust written by fred this would be first serialised strip that mezieres would work on due to lack of artistic freedom he was given because fred s script came with all strip panels already blocked out mezieres found this a difficult assignment by this time pierre christin was dividing his time between paris and bordeaux where he was working on founding school of journalism at institut universitaire de technologie iut meeting up with mezieres one day christin suggested that they work on creating a comic strip together both had their experiences in american west to draw upon but felt thanks to lucky luke jerry spring and blueberry that market for westerns was already crowded instead christin suggested that they turn their hands to science fiction a genre that at that time was not prevalent in french comics although goscinny was not a science fiction fan he wanted to promote innovation and originality in pilote and so commissioned them to produce a strip frame left valerian and laureline jean claude mezieres most famous creations drawing on influences from literary science fiction mezieres and christin devised character of valerian a spatio temporal agent from 28th century employed by capital of future earth to protect space and time from interference neither mezieres nor christin had any interest in making valerian into a clean cut hero of type that appeared in french comics of time instead they sought to create an anti hero a banal character without any extraordinary means of action first valerian adventure les mauvais reves bad dreams appeared in pilote in 1967 with first installment of story published on 9 november in issue 420 and ran for fifteen issues concluding in issue 434 on 15 february 1968 bad dreams shares an artistic style similar to that of mezieres and christin s earlier collaborations for pilote with influences from franquin morris and mad magazine artist jack davis also introduced in this story was laureline a peasant girl from middle ages originally intended to appear in only one story popular reaction to character meant that she was retained for subsequent stories and she has since become elevated to main star of series bad dreams was followed by la cite des eaux city of moving waters and its sequel terre en earth in flames in 1968 and 1969 respectively these two stories show some evolution in mezieres art but also retain cartoonish influences of bad dreams jean pierre best sums up mezieres style at this time in his 1970 review of story where he describes valerian as a kind of lucky luke of space time city of shifting waters and earth in flames were collected together in one volume in 1970 under title city of shifting waters this became first valerian album bad dreams was skipped because of its short length thirty pages relative to usual album length of around 46 pages every valerian story up to and including rage of in 1985 would debut in serial form in pilote before being published as an album l empire des mille planetes empire of a thousand planets premiered in pilote in 1969 and marked a further development for valerian series and for mezieres art this story was series first full blown attempt at space opera and it set out for first time two main signature elements of valerian use of science fiction as a political allegory and mezieres meticulously detailed depictions of alien worlds follow up story world without stars saw final evolution of mezieres art into style that became prevalent in valerian stories of 1970s and 1980s with first realistic renderings of valerian and laureline as opposed to caricatures of earlier stories mezieres style on valerian remained fairly consistent until 1980s metro chatelet direction cassiopeia which mixed space opera with scenes set on contemporary earth this style continued for five albums until 1990s living weapons which saw a change in mezieres style back towards cartoonish style of earlier stories valerian is mezieres best known work translated into at least thirteen languages last album l ouvre temps was published in january 2010 it is one of publisher s top five best selling comics series various attempts were made from late 1970s onwards to adapt valerian for film or television and an animated series titled time jam valerian laureline made its debut in 2007 work in film and television mezieres was always as interested in cinema as he was in drawing in 1957 he began work with jean giraud on creating an animated western dissatisfied with results project was abandoned after 45 seconds of animation had been completed same year he shot a short ten minute 8mm film la vie d un reve life is a dream with pierre christin success of valerian however has led to mezieres becoming involved in a number of mainly science fiction film and television projects first of these was billet doux love letter a 1984 television series starring pierre mondy as a comic strip editor for which mezieres mocked up comic book covers and characters also in 1984 he produced designs for director jeremy kagan who was attempting to adapt rene s novel la nuit des temps ice people due to difficulties experienced by film s iranian producer as a result of
