day by then almost every dutch town and city was marking holiday celebration proved popular and when queen came of age in 1898 her inauguration was postponed a week to 6 september so as not to interfere with koninginnedag annual holiday fell on final day of school summer vacation which made it popular among schoolchildren it is uncertain how much wilhelmina enjoyed festivities although

birthday but was celebrated with increased enthusiasm as it marked her recovery from serious illness wilhelmina rarely attended koninginnedag festivities after reaching adulthood she attended
