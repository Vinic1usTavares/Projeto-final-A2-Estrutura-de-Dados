house sparrow passer domesticus is a bird of sparrow family passeridae found in most parts of world it is a small bird that has a typical length of and a mass of females and young birds are coloured pale brown and grey and males have brighter black white and brown markings one of about 25 species in genus passer house sparrow is native to most of europe mediterranean basin and a large part of asia its intentional or accidental introductions to many regions including parts of australasia africa and americas make it most widely distributed wild bird house sparrow is strongly associated with human habitation and can live in urban or rural settings though found in widely varied habitats and climates it typically avoids extensive woodlands grasslands and deserts away from human development it feeds mostly on seeds of grains and weeds but it is an opportunistic eater and commonly eats insects and many other foods its predators include domestic cats hawks owls and many other predatory birds and mammals because of its numbers ubiquity and association with human settlements house sparrow is culturally prominent it is extensively and usually unsuccessfully persecuted as an agricultural pest it has also often been kept as a pet as well as being a food item and a symbol of lust sexual potency commonness and vulgarity though it is widespread and abundant its numbers have declined in some areas animal s conservation status is listed as least concern on iucn red list description measurements and shape house sparrow is typically about long ranging from it is a compact bird with a full chest and a large rounded head its bill is stout and conical with a culmen length of strongly built as an adaptation for eating seeds its tail is short at long wing chord is and tarsus is in mass house sparrow ranges from females usually are slightly smaller than males median mass on european continent for both sexes is about and in more southerly subspecies is around younger birds are smaller males are larger during winter and females are larger during breeding season birds at higher latitudes colder climates and sometimes higher altitudes are larger under bergmann s rule both between and within subspecies plumage plumage of house sparrow is mostly different shades of grey and brown sexes exhibit strong dimorphism female is mostly buffish above and below while male has boldly coloured head markings a reddish back and grey underparts male has a dark grey crown from top of its bill to its back and chestnut brown flanking its crown on sides of its head it has black around its bill on its throat and on spaces between its bill and eyes lores it has a small white stripe between lores and crown and small white spots immediately behind eyes postoculars with black patches below and above them underparts are pale grey or white as are cheeks ear coverts and stripes at base of head upper back and mantle are a warm brown with broad black streaks while lower back rump and upper tail coverts are greyish brown right thumb detail of wing of a male male is duller in fresh nonbreeding plumage with whitish tips on many feathers wear and preening expose many of bright brown and black markings including most of black throat and chest patch called bib or badge badge is variable in width and general size and may signal social status or fitness this hypothesis has led to a veritable cottage industry of studies which have only conclusively shown that patches increase in size with age male s bill is black in breeding season and dark grey during rest of year female has no black markings or grey crown its upperparts and head are brown with darker streaks around mantle and a distinct pale supercilium its underparts are pale grey brown female s bill is brownish grey and becomes darker in breeding plumage approaching black of male s bill juveniles are similar to adult female but deeper brown below and paler above with paler and less defined juveniles have broader buff feather edges and tend to have looser plumage like moulting adults juvenile males tend to have darker throats and white postoculars like adult males while juvenile females tend to have white throats however juveniles cannot be reliably sexed by plumage some juvenile males lack any markings of adult male and some juvenile females have male features bills of young birds are light yellow to straw paler than female s bill immature males have paler versions of adult male s markings which can be very indistinct in fresh plumage by their first breeding season young birds generally are indistinguishable from other adults though they may still be paler during their first year voice thumb left a male calling in san francisco thumb short chirps of a house sparrow hyderabad india most house sparrow vocalisations are variations on its short and incessant chirping call transcribed as chirrup or philip this note is made as a contact call by flocking or resting birds or by males to proclaim nest ownership and invite pairing in breeding season male gives this call repetitively with emphasis and speed but not much rhythm forming what is described either as a song or an ecstatic call similar to a song young birds also give a true song especially in captivity a warbling similar to that of european aggressive males give a trilled version of their call transcribed as chur chur r r it it it it this call is also used by females in breeding season to establish dominance over males while displacing them to feed young or incubate eggs house sparrows give a nasal alarm call basic sound of which is transcribed as and a shrill chree call in great distress another vocalisation is appeasement call a soft quee given to inhibit aggression usually given between birds of a mated pair these vocalisations are not unique to house sparrow but are shared with small variations by all sparrows variation thumb a male of subspecies p d indicus in kolkata india thumb upright an immature of subspecies p d indicus in rajasthan india some variation is seen in 12 subspecies of house sparrows which are divided into two groups oriental p d indicus group and palaearctic p d domesticus group birds of p d domesticus group have grey cheeks while p d indicus group birds have white cheeks as well as bright colouration on crown a smaller bill and a longer black bib subspecies p d tingitanus differs little from nominate subspecies except in worn breeding plumage of male in which head is speckled with black and underparts are paler p d balearoibericus is slightly paler than nominate but darker than p d bibilicus p d bibilicus is paler than most subspecies but has grey cheeks of p d domesticus group birds similar p d persicus is paler and smaller and p d niloticus is nearly identical but smaller of less widespread p d indicus group subspecies p d hyrcanus is larger than p d indicus p d hufufae is paler p d bactrianus is larger and paler and p d parkini is larger and darker with more black on breast than any other subspecies identification house sparrow can be confused with a number of other seed eating birds especially its relatives in genus passer many of these relatives are smaller with an appearance that is neater or cuter as with dead sea sparrow dull coloured female can often not be distinguished from other females and is nearly identical to those of spanish and italian sparrows eurasian tree sparrow is smaller and more slender with a chestnut crown and a black patch on each cheek male spanish sparrow and italian sparrow are distinguished by their chestnut crowns sind sparrow is very similar but smaller with less black on male s throat and a distinct pale supercilium on female taxonomy and systematics names house sparrow was among first animals to be given a scientific name in modern system of biological classification since it was described by carl linnaeus in 1758 10th edition of systema naturae it was described from a type specimen collected in sweden with name fringilla domestica later genus name fringilla came to be used only for common chaffinch and its relatives and house sparrow has usually been placed in genus passer created by french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson in 1760 bird s scientific name and its usual english name have same meaning latin word passer like english word sparrow is a term for small active birds coming from a root word referring to speed latin word domesticus means belonging to house like common name a reference to its association with humans house sparrow is also called by a number of alternative english names including english sparrow chiefly in north america and indian sparrow or indian house sparrow for birds of indian subcontinent and central asia dialectal names include and philip mainly in southern england and mainly in northern england spur and sprig mainly in scotland and or from german spatz in north america taxonomy thumb left a pair of italian sparrows in rome genus passer contains about 25 species depending on authority 26 according to handbook of birds of world most passer species are dull coloured birds with short square tails and stubby conical beaks between long mitochondrial dna studies suggest that speciation in genus occurred during pleistocene and earlier while other evidence suggests speciation occurred 25 000 to 15 000 years ago within passer house sparrow is part of palaearctic black bibbed sparrows group and a close relative of mediterranean willow sparrows taxonomy of house sparrow and its mediterranean relatives is complicated common type of willow sparrow is spanish sparrow which resembles house sparrow in many respects it frequently prefers wetter habitats than house sparrow and it is often colonial and nomadic in most of mediterranean one or both species occur with some degree of hybridisation in north africa two species hybridise extensively forming highly variable mixed populations with a full range of characters from pure house sparrows to pure spanish sparrows in most of italy breeding species is italian sparrow which has an appearance intermediate between those of house and spanish sparrows its specific status and origin are subject of much debate but it may be a case of long ago hybrid speciation in alps italian sparrow intergrades over a narrow roughly strip with house sparrow and some house sparrows migrate into italian sparrow s range in winter on mediterranean islands of malta gozo crete rhodes and other apparently intermediate birds are of unknown status subspecies thumb a male of subspecies p d balearoibericus in istanbul thumb a male of migratory subspecies p d bactrianus with a eurasian tree sparrow and young house or spanish sparrows in baikonur kazakhstan a large number of subspecies have been named of which 12 were recognised in handbook of birds of world these subspecies are divided into two groups palaearctic p d domesticus group and oriental p d indicus group several middle eastern subspecies including p d biblicus are sometimes considered a third intermediate group subspecies p d indicus was described as a species and was considered to be distinct by many ornithologists during 19th century migratory birds of subspecies p d bactrianus in p d indicus group were recorded overlapping with p d domesticus birds without hybridising in 1970s so soviet scientists edward i gavrilov and m n proposed separation of p d indicus group as a separate species however p d indicus group and p d domesticus group birds intergrade in a large part of iran so this split is rarely recognised in north america house sparrow populations are more differentiated than those in europe this variation follows predictable patterns with birds at higher latitudes being larger and those in arid areas being paler however how much this is caused by evolution or by environment is not clear similar observations have been made in new zealand and in south africa introduced house sparrow populations may be distinct enough to merit subspecies status especially in north america and southern africa and american ornithologist harry church oberholser even gave subspecies name p d to paler birds of western north america p d domesticus group p d domesticus linnaeus 1758 nominate subspecies is found in most of europe across northern asia to sakhalin and kamchatka it is most widely introduced subspecies p d balearoibericus von jordans 1923 described from majorca is found in balearic islands southern france balkans and anatolia p d tingitanus loche 1867 described from algeria is found in maghreb from ajdabiya in libya to beni in algeria and to morocco s atlantic coast it hybridises extensively with spanish sparrow especially in eastern part of its range p d niloticus nicoll and bonhote 1909 described from faiyum egypt is found along nile north of wadi halfa sudan it intergrades with bibilicus in sinai and with rufidorsalis in a narrow zone around wadi halfa it has been recorded in somaliland p d persicus zarudny and kudashev 1916 described from karun river in khuzestan iran is found in western and central iran south of alborz mountains with indicus in eastern iran and afghanistan p d biblicus hartert 1910 described from palestine is found in middle east from cyprus and southeastern turkey to sinai in west and from azerbaijan to kuwait in east p d indicus group p d hyrcanus zarudny and kudashev 1916 described from gorgan iran is found along southern coast of caspian sea from gorgan to southeastern azerbaijan it intergrades with p d persicus in alborz mountains and with p d bibilicus to west it is subspecies with smallest range p d bactrianus zarudny and kudashev 1916 described from tashkent is found in southern kazakhstan to tian shan and northern iran and afghanistan it intergrades with persicus in baluchistan and with indicus across central afghanistan unlike most other house sparrow subspecies it is almost entirely migratory wintering in plains of northern indian subcontinent it is found in open country rather than in settlements which are occupied by eurasian tree sparrow in its range there is an exceptional record from sudan p d parkini whistler 1920 described from srinagar kashmir is found in western himalayas from pamir mountains to southeastern nepal it is migratory like p d bactrianus p d indicus jardine and selby 1831

south sudan and in eastern sudan northern ethiopia to red sea coast in eritrea it has also been introduced to in comoros distribution and habitat thumb upright by a nest in a saguaro cactus in arizona thumb house sparrows perching on a roof during winter in southern alps of new zealand house sparrow originated in middle east and spread along with agriculture to most of eurasia and parts of north africa since mid 19th century it has reached most of world chiefly due to deliberate introductions but also through natural and shipborne dispersal its introduced range encompasses most of north america central america southern south america southern africa part of west africa australia new zealand and islands throughout world it has greatly extended its range in northern eurasia since 1850s and continues to do so as was shown by its colonisation around 1990 of iceland and island japan extent of its range makes it most widely distributed wild bird on planet introductions house sparrow has become highly successful in most parts of world where it has been introduced this is mostly due to its early adaptation to living with humans and its adaptability to a wide range of conditions other factors may include its robust immune response compared to eurasian tree sparrow where introduced it can extend its range quickly sometimes at a rate over per year in many parts of world it has been characterised as a pest and poses a threat to native birds a few introductions have died out or been of limited success such as those to greenland and cape verde first of many successful introductions to north america occurred when birds from england were released in new york city in 1852 intended to control ravages of linden moth in north america house sparrow now occurs from northwest territories of canada to southern panama and it is one of most abundant birds of continent house sparrow was first introduced to australia in 1863 at melbourne and is common throughout eastern part of continent as far north as cape york but has been prevented from establishing itself in western australia where every house sparrow found in state is killed house sparrows were introduced in new zealand in 1859 and from there reached many of pacific islands including hawaii in southern africa birds of both european subspecies p d domesticus and indian subspecies p d indicus were introduced around 1900 birds of p d domesticus ancestry are confined to a few towns while p d indicus birds have spread rapidly reaching tanzania in 1980s despite this rapid spread native relatives such as cape sparrow also occur and thrive in urban habitats in south america it was first introduced near buenos aires around 1870 and quickly became common in most of southern part of continent it now occurs almost continuously from tierra del fuego to fringes of amazon basin with isolated populations as far north as coastal venezuela habitat house sparrow is closely associated with human habitation and cultivation it is not an obligate commensal of humans as some have suggested birds of migratory central asian subspecies usually breed away from humans in open country and birds elsewhere are occasionally found away from humans only terrestrial habitats that house sparrow does not inhabit are dense forest and tundra well adapted to living around humans it frequently lives and even breeds indoors especially in factories warehouses and zoos it has been recorded breeding in an english coal mine below ground and feeding on empire state building s observation deck at night it reaches its greatest densities in urban centres but its reproductive success is greater in suburbs where insects are more abundant on a larger scale it is most abundant in wheat growing areas such as midwestern united states it tolerates a variety of climates but prefers drier conditions especially in moist tropical climates it has several adaptations to dry areas including a high salt tolerance and an ability to survive without water by ingesting berries in most of eastern asia house sparrow is entirely absent replaced by eurasian tree sparrow where these two species overlap house sparrow is usually more common than eurasian tree sparrow but one species may replace other in a manner that ornithologist maud doria haviland described as random or even capricious in most of its range house sparrow is extremely common despite some declines but in marginal habitats such as rainforest or mountain ranges its distribution can be spotty behaviour social behaviour house sparrow is a very social bird it is gregarious during all seasons when feeding often forming flocks with other species of birds it roosts communally its nests are usually grouped together in clumps and it engages in social activities such as dust or water bathing and social singing in which birds call together in bushes house sparrow feeds mostly on ground but it flocks in trees and bushes at feeding stations and nests female house sparrows are dominant despite their smaller size and they can fight over males in breeding season sleep and roosting house sparrows sleep with bill tucked underneath scapular feathers outside of reproductive season they often roost communally in trees or shrubs much communal chirping occurs before and after birds settle in roost in evening as well as before birds leave roost in morning some congregating sites separate from roost may be visited by birds prior to settling in for night body maintenance dust or water bathing is common and often occurs in groups anting is rare head scratching is done with leg over drooped wing feeding thumb a female house sparrow feeding on rice grains thumb right female foraging in germany thumb right two females feeding on leftover food at a cafe in new zealand as an adult house sparrow mostly feeds on seeds of grains and weeds but it is opportunistic and adaptable and eats whatever foods are available in towns and cities it often scavenges for food in garbage containers and congregates in outdoors of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on leftover food and crumbs it can perform complex tasks to obtain food such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets clinging to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies and nectar robbing flowers in common with many other birds house sparrow requires grit to digest harder items in its diet grit can be either stone often grains of masonry or shells of eggs or snails oblong and rough grains are preferred several studies of house sparrow in temperate agricultural areas have found proportion of seeds in its diet to be about 90 it will eat almost any seeds but where it has a choice it prefers oats and wheat in urban areas house sparrow feeds largely on food provided directly or indirectly by humans such as bread though it prefers raw seeds house sparrow also eats some plant matter besides seeds including buds berries and fruits such as grapes and cherries in temperate areas house sparrow has an unusual habit of tearing flowers especially yellow ones in spring animals form another important part of house sparrow s diet chiefly insects of which beetles caterpillars dipteran flies and aphids are especially important various arthropods are eaten as are molluscs and crustaceans where available earthworms and even vertebrates such as lizards and frogs young house sparrows are fed mostly on insects until about 15 days after hatching they are also given small quantities of seeds spiders and grit in most places grasshoppers and crickets are most abundant foods of nestlings true bugs ants sawflies and beetles are also important but house sparrows take advantage of whatever foods are abundant to feed their young house sparrows have been observed stealing prey from other birds including american robins gut microbiota of house sparrows differs between chicks and adults with decreasing in chicks when they get to around 9 days old whilst relative abundance of increase locomotion thumb hopping movements of a house sparrow house sparrow s flight is direct not undulating and flapping averaging and about 15 wingbeats per second on ground house sparrow typically hops rather than walks it can swim when pressed to do so by pursuit from predators captive birds have been recorded diving and swimming short distances under water dispersal and migration most house sparrows do not move more than a few kilometres during their lifetimes however limited migration occurs in all regions some young birds disperse long distances especially on coasts and mountain birds move to lower elevations in winter two subspecies p d bactrianus and p d parkini are predominantly migratory unlike birds in sedentary populations that migrate birds of migratory subspecies prepare for migration by putting on weight breeding thumb a pair of subspecies p d indicus mating in kolkata house sparrows can breed in breeding season immediately following their hatching and sometimes attempt to do so some birds breeding for first time in tropical areas are only a few months old and still have juvenile plumage birds breeding for first time are rarely successful in raising young and reproductive success increases with age as older birds breed earlier in breeding season and fledge more young as breeding season approaches hormone releases trigger enormous increases in size of sexual organs and changes in day length lead males to start calling by nesting sites timing of mating and egg laying varies geographically and between specific locations and years because a sufficient supply of insects is needed for egg formation and feeding nestlings males take up nesting sites before breeding season by frequently calling beside them unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females when a female approaches a male during this period male displays by moving up and down while drooping and shivering his wings pushing up his head raising and spreading his tail and showing his bib males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying in response a female will adopt a threatening posture and attack a male before flying away pursued by male male displays in front of her attracting other males which also pursue and display to female this group display usually does not immediately result in copulations other males usually do not copulate with female copulation is typically initiated by female giving a soft dee dee dee call to male birds of a pair copulate frequently until female is laying eggs and male mounts female repeatedly each time a pair mates house sparrow is monogamous and typically mates for life but birds from pairs often engage in extra pair copulations so about 15 of house sparrow fledglings are unrelated to their mother s mate male house sparrows guard their mates carefully to avoid being cuckolded and most extra pair copulation occurs away from nest sites males may sometimes have multiple mates and bigamy is mostly limited by aggression between females many birds do not find a nest and a mate and instead may serve as helpers around nest for mated pairs a role which increases chances of being chosen to replace a lost mate lost mates of both sexes can be replaced quickly during breeding season formation of a pair and bond between two birds is tied to holding of a nest site though paired house sparrows can recognise each other away from nest nesting left thumb female bringing food for young in a nest made in a tree hole in california nest sites are varied though cavities are preferred nests are most frequently built in eaves and other crevices of houses holes in cliffs and banks or tree hollows are also used a sparrow sometimes excavates its own nests in sandy banks or rotten branches but more frequently uses nests of other birds such as those of swallows in banks and cliffs and old tree cavity nests it usually uses deserted nests though sometimes it usurps active ones by driving away or killing occupants tree hollows are more commonly used in north america than in europe putting sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other north american cavity nesters and thereby contributing to their population declines especially in warmer areas house sparrow may build its nests in open on branches of trees especially evergreens and hawthorns or in nests of large birds such as storks or magpies in open nesting sites breeding success tends to be lower since breeding begins late and nest can easily be destroyed or damaged by storms less common nesting sites include street lights and neon signs favoured for their warmth and old open topped nests of other songbirds which are then domed over nest is usually domed though it may lack a roof in enclosed sites it has an outer layer of stems and roots a middle layer of dead grass and leaves and a lining of feathers as well as of paper and other soft materials nests typically have external dimensions of 20 x 30 cm 8 x 12 in but their size varies greatly building of nest is initiated by unmated male while displaying to females female assists in building but is less active than male some nest building occurs throughout year especially after moult in autumn in colder areas house sparrows build specially created roost nests or roost in street lights to avoid losing heat during winter house sparrows do not hold territories but they defend their nests aggressively against intruders of same sex house sparrows nests support a wide range of scavenging insects including nest flies such as protocalliphora blowflies and over 1 400 species of beetle eggs and young thumb left eggs in a nest clutches usually comprise four or five eggs though numbers from one to 10 have been recorded at least two clutches are usually laid and up to seven a year may be laid in tropics or four a year in temperate latitudes when fewer clutches are laid in a year especially at higher latitudes number of eggs per clutch is greater central asian house sparrows which migrate and have only one clutch a year average 6 5 eggs in a clutch clutch size is also affected by environmental and seasonal conditions female age and breeding density thumb alt naked and blind chick a hatchling some intraspecific brood parasitism occurs and instances of unusually large numbers of eggs in a nest may be result of females laying eggs in nests of their neighbours such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites but only rarely since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites in turn house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of american cliff swallow thumb left a juvenile showing its pink bill and obvious nestling gape soft swollen base which becomes harder and less swollen as bird matures eggs are white bluish white or greenish white spotted with brown or grey subelliptical in shape they range from in length and in width have an average mass of and an average surface area of eggs from tropical subspecies are distinctly smaller eggs begin to develop with deposition of yolk in ovary a few days before ovulation in day between ovulation and laying egg white forms followed by eggshell eggs laid later in a clutch are larger as are those laid by larger females and egg size is hereditary eggs decrease slightly in size from laying to hatching yolk comprises 25 of egg egg white 68 and shell 7 eggs are watery being 79 liquid and otherwise mostly protein female develops a brood patch of bare skin and plays main part in incubating eggs male helps but can only cover eggs rather than truly incubate them female spends night incubating during this period while male roosts near nest eggs hatch at same time after a short incubation period lasting 11 14 days and exceptionally for as many as 17 or as few as 9 length of incubation period decreases as ambient temperature increases later in breeding season thumb a female feeding a fledgling young house sparrows remain in nest for 11 to 23 days normally 14 to 16 days during this time they are fed by both parents as newly hatched house sparrows do not have sufficient insulation they are brooded for a few days or longer in cold conditions parents swallow droppings produced by hatchlings during first few days later droppings are moved up to away from nest chicks eyes open after about 4 days and at an age of about 8 days young birds get their first down if both parents perish ensuing intensive begging sounds of young often attract replacement parents which feed them until they can sustain themselves all young in nest leave it during same period of a few hours at this stage they are normally able to fly they start feeding themselves partly after 1 or 2 days and sustain themselves completely after 7 to 10 days 14 at latest survival in adult house sparrows annual survival is 45 65 after fledging and leaving care of their parents young sparrows have a high mortality rate which lessens as they grow older and more experienced only about 20 25 of birds hatched survive to their first breeding season oldest known wild house sparrow lived for nearly two decades it was found dead 19 years and 9 months after it was ringed in denmark oldest recorded captive house sparrow lived for 23 years typical ratio of males to females in a population is uncertain due to problems in collecting data but a very slight preponderance of males at all ages is usual predation thumb a male being eaten by a cat domestic cats are one of main predators of house sparrow house sparrow s main predators are cats and birds of prey but many other animals prey on them including corvids squirrels and even humans house sparrow has been consumed in past by people in many parts of world and it still is in parts of mediterranean most species of birds of prey have been recorded preying on house sparrow in places where records are extensive accipiters and merlin in particular are major predators though cats are likely to have a greater impact on house sparrow populations house sparrow is also a common victim of roadkill on european roads it is bird most frequently found dead parasites and disease house sparrow is host to a huge number of parasites and diseases and effect of most is unknown ornithologist ted r anderson listed thousands noting that his list was incomplete commonly recorded bacterial pathogens of house sparrow are often those common in humans and include salmonella and escherichia coli salmonella is common in house sparrow and a comprehensive study of house sparrow disease found it in 13 of sparrows tested salmonella epidemics in spring and winter can kill large numbers of sparrows house sparrow hosts avian pox and avian malaria which it has spread to native forest birds of hawaii many of diseases hosted by house sparrow are also present in humans and domestic animals for which house sparrow acts as a reservoir host arboviruses such as west nile virus which most commonly infect insects and mammals survive winters in temperate areas by going dormant in birds such as house sparrow a few records indicate disease extirpating house sparrow populations especially from scottish islands but this seems to be rare house sparrow is infested by a number of external parasites which usually cause little harm to adult sparrows in europe most common mite found on sparrows is proctophyllodes most common ticks are argas and ixodes and most common flea on house sparrow is ceratophyllus gallinae blood feeding mites are also common ectoparasites of house sparrows and these mites can enter human habitation and bite humans causing a condition known as gamasoidosis a number of chewing lice occupy different niches on house sparrow s body menacanthus lice occur across house sparrow s body where they feed on blood and feathers while brueelia lice feed on feathers and occurs on head physiology thumb an immature house sparrow sleeping house sparrows express strong circadian rhythms of activity in laboratory they were among first bird species to be seriously studied in terms of their circadian activity and photoperiodism in part because of their availability and adaptability in captivity but also because they can find their way and remain rhythmic in constant darkness such studies have found that pineal gland is a central part of house sparrow s circadian system removal of pineal eliminates circadian rhythm of activity and transplant of pineal into another individual confers to this individual rhythm phase of donor bird suprachiasmatic nuclei of hypothalamus have also been shown to be an important component of circadian system of house sparrows photoreceptors involved in synchronisation of circadian clock to external light dark cycle are located in brain and can be stimulated by light reaching them directly though skull as revealed by experiments in which blind sparrows which normally can still synchronise to light dark cycle failed to do so once india ink was injected as a screen under skin on top of their skulls similarly even when blind house sparrows continue to be photoperiodic i e show reproductive development when days are long but not when days are short this response is stronger when feathers on top of head are plucked and is eliminated when india ink is injected under skin at top of head showing that photoreceptors involved in photoperiodic response to day length are located inside brain house sparrows have also been used in studies of entrainment i e synchronisation to an external cycle other than light and dark for example in constant darkness a situation in which birds would normally reveal their endogenous non 24 hour free running rhythms of activity they instead show 24 hour periodicity if they are exposed to two hours of chirp playbacks every 24 hours matching their daily activity onsets with daily playback onsets house sparrows in constant dim light can also be entrained to a daily cycle based on presence of food finally house sparrows in constant darkness could be entrained to a cycle of high and low temperature but only if difference in temperature was large 38 degc versus 6 degc some of tested sparrows matched their activity to warm phase and others to cold phase relationships with humans thumb flocking and chirping together beneath a fluorescent tube light in germany house sparrow is closely associated with humans they are believed to have become associated with humans around 10 000 years ago subspecies p d bactrianus is least associated with humans and considered to be evolutionarily closer to ancestral populations usually house sparrow is regarded as a pest since it consumes agricultural products and spreads disease to humans and their domestic animals even birdwatchers often hold it in little regard because of its molestation of other birds in most of world house sparrow is not protected by law attempts to control house sparrows include trapping poisoning or shooting of adults destruction of their nests and eggs or less directly blocking nest holes and scaring off sparrows with noise glue or porcupine wire however house sparrow can be beneficial to humans as well especially by eating insect pests and attempts at large scale control of house sparrow have failed house sparrow has long been used as a food item from around 1560 to at least 19th century in northern europe earthenware sparrow pots were hung from eaves to attract nesting birds so young could be readily harvested wild birds were trapped in nets in large numbers and sparrow pie was a traditional dish thought because of association of sparrows with lechery to have aphrodisiac properties sparrows were also trapped as food for falconers birds and zoo animals during 1870s there were debates on damaging effects of sparrows in house of commons in england in early part of 20th century sparrow clubs culled many millions of birds and eggs in an attempt to control numbers of this perceived pest but with only a localised impact on numbers house sparrows have been kept as pets at many times in history though they have no bright plumage or attractive songs and raising them is difficult status house sparrow has an extremely large range and population and is not seriously threatened by human activities so it is assessed as least concern for conservation on iucn red list iucn estimates for global population runs up to nearly 1 4 billion individuals second among all birds perhaps only to red billed quelea in abundance although quelea is unlike sparrow restricted to a single continent and has never been subject to human introductions however populations have been declining in many parts of world especially near its eurasian places of origin these declines were first noticed in north america where they were initially attributed to spread of house finch but have been most severe in western europe declines have not been universal as no serious declines have been reported from eastern europe but have even occurred in australia where house sparrow was introduced recently in great britain populations peaked in early 1970s but have since declined by 68 overall and about 90 in some regions rspb lists house sparrow s uk conservation status as red in london house sparrow almost disappeared from central city numbers of house sparrows in netherlands have dropped in half since 1980s so house sparrow is even considered an endangered species this status came to widespread attention after a female house sparrow referred to as was killed after knocking down dominoes arranged as part of an attempt to set a world record these declines are not unprecedented as similar reductions in population occurred when internal combustion engine replaced horses in 1920s and a major source of food in form of grain spillage was lost various causes for dramatic decreases in population have been proposed including predation in particular by eurasian sparrowhawks electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones and diseases such as avian malaria a shortage of nesting sites caused by changes in urban building design is probably a factor and conservation organisations have encouraged use of special nest boxes for sparrows a primary cause of decline seems to be an insufficient supply of insect food for nestling sparrows declines in insect populations result from an increase of monoculture crops heavy use of pesticides replacement of native plants in cities with introduced plants and parking areas and possibly introduction of unleaded petrol which produces toxic compounds such as methyl protecting insect habitats on
