a7 motorway is a motorway in croatia it connects nation s largest port in rijeka to croatian motorway network as well as to rupa and pasjak border crossings to slovenia motorway forms part of a longitudinal transportation corridor in croatia and it is a part of european route e61 ljubljana trieste rijeka a7 motorway route south of orehovica interchange where it also intersects pan european corridor vb is a part of european route e65 a7 motorway runs near a number of croatian cities and provides access to ucka nature park and indirectly to numerous resorts in istria and kvarner gulf regions motorway is nationally significant because of its positive economic impact on cities and towns it connects and because of its contribution to tourism in croatia importance of motorway as a transit route will be further increased upon completion of a proposed expansion of port of rijeka and rijeka transport node motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a central reservation there are no emergency lanes in tunnels all intersections of a7 motorway are grade separated numerous bridges viaducts tunnels and other structures were required as route traverses rugged terrain as of 2010 there are ten exits and two rest areas situated along route most of motorway is not tolled but a single section is tolled using an open toll system with pricing tied to vehicle classification plans for motorway were officially formulated in 1974 and construction was started in 1977 first sections were completed as a two lane expressway with grade separated intersections in 1988 and 1990 comprising western arm of rijeka bypass as first stage of a6 motorway construction spanning between zagreb and rijeka neared completion in 2000s construction of a proper motorway along a7 route started in december 2009 diracje orehovica section was upgraded to a six lane motorway bringing entire route between rupa border crossing and sveti kuzam interchange to a uniform standard two new sections of a7 motorway are currently under construction extending route eastward into vicinity of kraljevica crikvenica and krk bridge two sections are scheduled to be completed by 2012 current long term plans for developing a7 motorway define its ultimate southern terminus in zuta lokva at interchange of a1 motorway this section is no longer part of any short term plans as no funding until 2012 is currently scheduled for section further long term plans specify an outer rijeka bypass and a new interchange with a8 expressway route description thumb left alt trumpet interchange of a six lane motorway draga interchange near rijeka a7 motorway is an important north south motorway in western croatia connecting nation s largest port and city of rijeka to slovenian road network at rupa border crossing a7 motorway currently connects to rest of croatian motorway network via a6 motorway in orehovica interchange motorway is a part of international e road network routes e65 and e61 sections south of orehovica interchange are a part of e65 while remaining sections are a part of e61 motorway is of major importance to croatia in terms of its development of economy of croatia most notably in tourism as it represents shortest and most convenient route between trieste italy or ljubljana slovenia and adriatic sea this particularly applies to tourist resorts in kvarner gulf area and to port of rijeka but it is also true for resorts in istria served via a8 expressway genuine importance of motorway as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of a7 route to zuta lokva interchange of a1 motorway and proposed expansion of port of rijeka and rijeka transport node former is planned as a part of completion of adriatic ionian motorway while latter is planned to encompass growth of port of rijeka s cargo handling capacity improved railroad links and a new rijeka bypass motorway linking a7 via a number of new interchanges to a6 and a8 motorways project is among other goals aiming to increase traffic along croatian part of pan european corridor vb which connects to a7 near rijeka thumb right alt noise protection barrier enveloping a motorway carriageway noise protection barrier at a7 near rijeka motorway spans between rupa border crossing to slovenia and krizisce where southbound a7 traffic currently ends at a roundabout connecting to state roads d8 and it connects to rijeka as it forms rijeka bypass a8 expressway of istrian y and a6 which represents motorway connection to zagreb and split future development of motorway will include southward extensions of motorway towards crikvenica novi vinodolski senj and ultimately zuta lokva interchange on a1 motorway a7 motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction along its entire length except in tunnels where there are emergency bays rather than lanes all existing interchanges are trumpet interchanges there are two rest areas along motorway providing various types of services ranging from parking spaces and restrooms to filling stations and restaurants as of october 2010 motorway has 10 interchanges providing access to a number of towns and cities and to croatian state road network motorway is operated by autocesta rijeka zagreb an automatic traffic monitoring and guidance system is in place along motorway it consists of measuring control and signaling devices located in zones where driving conditions may vary at interchanges near viaducts beside bridges in tunnels and in zones where fog and strong winds are known to occur system consists of variable traffic signs used to communicate changing driving conditions possible restrictions and other information to motorway users a7 motorway runs through hills rugged coastal terrain and urban areas requiring a substantial number of bridges viaducts and tunnels along route particular attention to environment is also required since route is situated in karst topography which is particularly susceptible to water pollution and urbanized areas requiring special attention to be paid to noise pollution noise pollution was assessed as especially severe in neighborhood of rijeka where residential buildings are particularly close to motorway route most notably a 26 story high rise only away from route noise pollution was addressed by building a noise barrier long which largely encloses that motorway section like a tunnel curved overhead sections of noise barrier are covered with of solar panels with annual electricity production capacity of 248 000 kwh toll thumb right alt side view of trumpet interchange entirely executed on viaducts sveti kuzam interchange southern terminus of one section of a7 motorway is tolled based on vehicle classification in croatia using an open toll system in place between rupa and jurdani interchanges toll is payable in croatian kuna euros and major credit and debit cards a number of prepaid toll collection systems are also used including various types of smart cards issued by motorway operator and enc an electronic toll collection etc system which is shared by most motorways in croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas as of december 2010 autocesta rijeka zagreb collects toll on a single section of motorway between rupa and jurdani interchanges close to northern terminus of motorway unlike those sections further south which are used as bypass road of city of rijeka therefore carrying substantial suburban and commuter traffic tolled section carries almost exclusively transit traffic rupa toll plaza located on section reported 240 975 kuna eur 32 400 collected during a single peak season weekend in july even though motorway traffic volume and thus toll revenue decreased slightly elsewhere in country this particular tolled section reported virtually no change in income by 2010 notable structures thumb left alt prestressed rigid strut frame structure bridge carrying a road across a steep river canyon between two tunnels rjecina bridge prior to construction of parallel structure in 2009 as a7 motorway route runs through rugged terrain it utilizes a substantial number of major structures bridges viaducts tunnels underpasses flyovers and culverts a significant number of interchanges present along rijeka bypass a7 section between matulji and sveti kuzam which consists of seven interchanges including orehovica interchange with a6 motorway thus yielding an average distance of only between them longest structures on a7 motorway are tunnel located on orehovica interchange skurinje section skurinje ii tunnel situated between skurinje and rujevica exits and vezica viaduct built on orehovica draga section of motorway rjecina bridge a inclined strut reinforced concrete bridge spanning rjecina river canyon is also noteworthy because its design and construction conditions are different from normal since it spans a protected water supply zone bridge consists of two parallel structures and first one to be completed was northern span in 1984 southern span was last structure completed on present a7 motorway route and it was opened to traffic in 2009 25 years after original span history rijeka bypass thumb right alt a trumpet motorway interchange orehovica interchange most significant interchange of a7 motorway development of city of rijeka and surrounding region particularly in relation to development of port of rijeka associated transit transport of cargo tourism and associated passenger traffic to northern adriatic resorts rugged coastal topography and existing road routes running through city of rijeka itself necessitated development of a high capacity bypass road to further development and relieve congestion on city streets this was first officially formulated in spatial planning documents in 1974 and construction started in 1977 first section was completed in july 1988 between diracje and orehovica interchange executed as a two lane expressway with grade separated intersections diracje matulji and matulji jusici sections completed in 1990 and 1991 respectively were built as four lane expressways without emergency lanes those completed western arm of rijeka bypass but traffic proceeding east from orehovica interchange to krk island crikvenica and senj still had to switch to streets of rijeka modern motorway in 2000s as first stage of a6 motorway construction spanning between zagreb and rijeka neared completion construction of a proper motorway along a7 route started in 2004 when first stage of rijeka zagreb motorway was completed a7 route was extended by to jurdani and in 2005 another section was completed between jurdani and slovenian border two new sections were first ones built as a six lane motorway in may 2006 motorway extended east to sveti kuzam forming eastern arm of rijeka bypass relieving that part of city from transit traffic finally after rijeka zagreb motorway was completed in 2008 works on remaining single carriageway section of route intensified in december 2009 diracje orehovica section was upgraded to six lane motorway thus bringing entire route between rupa border crossing and sveti kuzam interchange to a uniform standard even though hrvatske autoceste normally develops motorways in croatia as of september 2007 autocesta rijeka zagreb was granted expansion of concession previously awarded new concession contract included development and maintenance of a7 motorway north of krizisce interchange krk bridge and a number of motorway access roads at same time concession period was extended to 32 years and 11 months starting on date of original concession contract therefore concession in its present form will expire on may 28 2031 construction costs incurred after 2007 when autocesta rijeka zagreb took over motorway development were estimated at 105 million euros future long term plans of development of a7 motorway published in 2000s involved an extension of southern terminus to interchange with a1 motorway at zuta lokva section between krizisce and zuta lokva was initially planned to be opened as an expressway by 2009 but those plans have been put on hold and section is no longer included in any short term plans as no funding is going to be appropriated for it until 2012 in 2012 croatian government announced that no funds shall be made available in near future for construction of a7 south of krizisce further long term plans specify an outer rijeka bypass which is planned on route jurdani kikovica kraljevica and it would be wider and longer similarly a new interchange of a8 and a7 motorways is planned near jusici however these long term plans even though they are well documented in government studies still have no funding approved traffic volume traffic is regularly counted by means of a traffic census at rupa mainline toll plaza as well as at two other sections of motorway which are not tolled traffic volume is reported by autocesta rijeka zagreb operator of motorway and are published by hrvatske ceste traffic is heaviest along western arm of rijeka bypass as section serves city and acts as a link between a8 and a6 motorways while carrying regular a7 traffic that part of a7 motorway carries a 20 100 vehicle annual average daily traffic aadt and a 31 700 vehicle average summer daily traffic asdt figure substantial variations observed between aadt and asdt are normally attributed to fact that motorway carries significant tourist traffic to istria and kvarner gulf area seasonal increase in traffic volume ranges from 10 on south of ostrovica interchange to 120 as measured on rupa matulji section central part of motorway
