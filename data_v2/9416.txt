casting directors kim davis and justine baddeley who had worked with them on previous music videos directors had initially settled on greg kinnear to portray richard hoover however for character of sheryl hoover they considered several actresses before deciding on australian actress toni collette davis and baddeley traveled to every english speaking country to search for actress to portray olive hoover and they finally chose actress abigail breslin through an audition when she was six paul dano was cast as dwayne two years before production began and in preparation for portraying his character spent a few days taking his own vow of silence alan arkin who portrayed edwin hoover was initially considered too young for role role of frank suicidal proust scholar was originally written for bill murray and there was also studio pressure for robin williams directing duo chose steve carell for role a few months before filming began and in an interview revealed when we met with steve carell we didn t know he could do this based upon what he had done but when we met with him and talked to him about character tone of movie and way we were approaching it he was right on same page with us although known to comedy central viewers for many years as a correspondent on highly rated satirical news program daily show with jon stewart at time carell was cast for little miss sunshine he was relatively unknown in hollywood producers of film were worried that he was not a big enough star and did not have much acting experience script and development script was written by michael arndt and was originally about an east coast road trip from maryland to florida but was shifted to a journey from new mexico to california because of budget issues arndt started script on may 23 2000 and completed first rough draft by may 26 he had initially planned on shooting film himself by raising several thousand dollars and using a camcorder instead he gave screenplay to producers ron yerxa and albert berger who teamed up with deep river productions to find a potential director producers met directors dayton and faris while producing election and in turn gave script to them to read in 2001 directors commented later on script stating this film really struck a chord we felt like it was written for us script was purchased from first time screenwriter arndt for 250 000 by marc turtletaub one of film s producers on december 21 2001 yerxa and berger remained as producers as they were responsible for finding directors and cinematographer assisting in ending re shoot and helping bring film to sundance film festival film was pitched to several studios and only interested studio was focus features who wanted to film it in canada after studio attempted to have film be centered on character richard hoover and arndt disagreed he was fired and replaced by another writer new writer added several scenes including richard s confrontation with character who dismisses his motivational technique business a corporate change brought in a new studio head and arndt was rehired when new writer left after four weeks of rewriting script after two years of pre production focus features dropped film in august 2004 marc turtletaub paid 400 000 to focus features to buy back rights to film and for development costs he also paid for 8 million budget allowing little miss sunshine to then be filmed filming principal photography began on june 6 2005 filming took place over 30 days in arizona and southern california with scenes shot in keeping with chronological order of script arndt re wrote ending to film six weeks before film s release at sundance film festival and this was filmed in december 2005 post production was completed four days before its screening on nine screens at sundance film festival where it had its premiere film was dedicated to rebecca niece of producer peter saraf and an extra in scenes set in diner and convenience store who was killed in a

his father s head due to angle in background other vehicles can be seen driving on highway five modified vans were used during filming to capture various angles of characters including this one through windshield when writing script arndt chose volkswagen t2 microbus to use for road trip based on his experience with vehicle and its practicality for filming i remember thinking it s a road trip what vehicle are you going to put them in and vw bus just seems logical just because you have these high ceilings and these clean sight lines where you can put camera in front windshield looking back and seeing everybody five vw microbuses were used for family car as some were modified for different filming techniques three of vans had engines and two without were mounted on trailers during pre production cinematographer used a basic video camera and set it up at angles inside van to determine best locations to shoot from during filming many of problems associated with van that was included in plot a broken clutch a stuck horn and a detached door were based on similar problems that writer arndt experienced during a childhood trip that involved same type of vehicle while filming scenes where family pushes van to get it started a stunt coordinator was used to ensure safety of actors in an interview actor greg kinnear jokingly described how scenes were filmed when he was driving i was going like 50 miles an hour in this 71 vw van that doesn t have side airbags basically you d wait for this huge camera truck to come whizzing in front of us with camera okay go i mean it was insanity it s most dangerous movie i ve ever made while filming scenes in van actors would at times remain in vehicle for three or four hours a day for scenes in which alan arkin s character was swearing excessively breslin had her headphones on and could not hear dialogue just like her character in film only when she saw film did she know what was being said on july 25 2006 fox searchlight

to make abigail breslin s character centre appear larger than other girls she wore a padded suit much of equipment and costumes exhibited during pageant were provided by actual contestants parents prior to writing script arndt read in a newspaper about arnold schwarzenegger speaking to a group of high school students and saying if there s one thing in this world i hate it s losers i despise them as a result arndt developed his script lampooning thought process and i thought there s something so wrong with that attitude i wanted to attack that idea that in life you re going up or you re going down so to a degree a child beauty pageant is epitome of ultimate stupid meaningless competition people put themselves through co director jonathan dayton also commented on importance of pageant to film as far as pageant goes it was very important to us that film not be about pageants it s about being out of place it s about not knowing where you re going to end up all girls acting as participants in beauty pageant except abigail breslin were veterans of real beauty pageants they looked same and performed same acts as they had in their real life pageants to prepare for filming directors attended several pageants in southern california and met with a coordinator to learn more about pageant process a mother of a contestant in film claimed that film overplayed practices that contestants go through most pageants aren t quite like that with shaving girls legs spraying them with fake tans and putting on so much makeup when focus features initially wanted to film in canada directors opposed it believing costs of flying all of pageant girls and their families would be excessive contestants and their families instead spent two weeks filming in a hotel in ventura with most of equipment and costumes being provided by contestants parents to make breslin s character plump figure as shown in film she had to wear a padded suit during filming for olive s final scene involving her dancing routine breslin spent two weeks preparing with a choreographer release sundance film festival alt upright thumb film debuted at sundance film festival in utah following film s premiere at

producers work as a collective effort academy refused to consider either berger or yerxa for award producer david hoberman commented on support for honoring all five producers stating if there are five people actually involved in producing a movie there s no reason why someone who s made a good enough film to be nominated for an academy award should be precluded from being rewarded for work they did lynda obst who was affiliated with an academy award producer committee also commented by and large five people don t make a movie if this is an exception then it s a sad situation but you don t destroy a rule for an exception pga had previously honored all five of producers albert berger reacting to academy s decision while at a panel for film stated no matter what academy decided we produced this movie in june 2007 academy announced that they would allow exceptions for films that had more than three producers in future stating committee has right in what it determines to be a
