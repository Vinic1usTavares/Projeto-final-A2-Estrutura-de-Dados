editor for lynch s 1986 film blue velvet dunham 01 55 02 26 dunham then edited pilot and was about to look for another editing job elsewhere when he asked lynch if director had another film planned a week later lynch decided to film wild at heart and asked dunham to edit that as well dunham 02 45 03 36 however dunham had committed to another project and felt uncomfortable leaving one editing job for another lynch then offered him a directing position on twin peaks in interim to justify cancelling his other project dunham 03 37 04 23 dunham finished principal photography on episode 1 same day

both characters dunham felt that central mystery in series murder of schoolgirl laura palmer was simply a macguffin to compel what he saw as real focus interaction of large ensemble cast as such he took care to introduce meaningful interactions between characters wherever possible dunham 05 02 06 47 dunham also spent time with each of cast to help them develop their characters having studied scripts involved and basing his take on characters on his experience with pilot dunham 12 29 13 13 dunham retained frequent use of static cameras seen in pilot something he saw as a hallmark of lynch s directing style dunham 10 01 10 28 describing result as like framed pictures dunham 10 38 10 40 he also continued use of a warm reddish tint to footage using soft coral filters and carefully selected props and costumes to obtain this coloring dunham 19 40 20 18 this tint was considered important enough that lynch sent a representative to network to ensure they understood it was deliberate and not a mistake for fear that they might correct saturation to be more realistic before broadcasting it dunham 22 01 22 36 broadcast and reception episode 1 was first broadcast on american

impressive commenting positively on blurred distinction between diegetic and non diegetic music writing for allrovi andrea levasseur rated episode four stars out of five television without pity s daniel j blau felt that episode showed series composer angelo badalamenti to have limited range repeating several similar musical cues throughout he also considered eric da re s performance as leo johnson to be unconvincing finding it difficult to believe that character was as feared and menacing as was implied however blau described introduction of killer bob as still seeming powerful and frightening even several years after first being seen considering it a potent and disturbing scene notes footnotes bibliography external links traces to nowhere at showtime category 1990 american
