in extra time when giggs ran length of pitch and evaded several arsenal players to score winning goal in close season anelka was involved in a protracted transfer saga and vowed to never play for arsenal again he cited media in england as a reason for wanting to leave club one thing i can tell you is that i can t stand english press who cause me enormous problems on a personal level but it was implied that his gold digging brothers wanted anelka to move abroad to make more money they served as his agents in june 1999 united accepted an offer from fa to withdraw from fa cup in order to participate in 2000 fifa club world championship staged in brazil it was criticised by new sports minister kate hoey who suggested club were treating its supporters in a shabby way manchester united manager sir alex ferguson however replied that united had been pressurised to make decision which aimed to solidify england s 2006 fifa world cup bid government are saying that we should be in fa cup but they are very people that were saying originally that we have to go to brazil they could tell us quite clearly do not bother about world cup bid leave that to us it should not be manchester united s responsibility pre match arsenal manager arsene wenger revealed before charity shield game that he was not overly concerned with anelka leaving rather injuries that were depleting his squad i cannot forget that it was because of a poor start to last season that we lost championship to manchester united he refused to categorise match as a friendly much like it is traditionally viewed as there is a trophy and medals at stake we won it last season and our players want to win it again ferguson described 3 0 defeat in previous season s shield as a humiliation before discussing how it made team prepare for challenges ahead i have reminded players how hard it is to lose when you are playing for united these days it makes so many other people happy indeed united only lost five matches of whole of last season with their last defeat coming at home to middlesbrough in december 1998 match team selection both teams were without several first team players because of injury problems manchester united midfielder roy keane was absent which meant defender denis irwin took responsibility as team captain ryan giggs was also ruled out of game though his injury was unspecified forwards andy cole and dwight yorke started upfront for united in a 4 4 2 formation where david beckham and jordi cruyff acted as two wide midfield players goalkeeper mark bosnich signed as a replacement for peter schmeichel also started having rejoined club after a nine year spell with aston villa for arsenal defender tony adams was ruled out with injury as was dennis bergkamp marc overmars and goalkeeper david seaman anelka did not partake given his transfer to real madrid was on verge of being completed new signings oleh luzhny and sylvinho were both named in squad but whereas sylvinho started game luzhny was selected as a substitute arsenal like united lined up in a 4 4 2 formation up front freddie ljungberg was paired with club s only available recognised striker nwankwo kanu summary severe heat meant manchester united and arsenal found it hard to find any rhythm early on sylvinho fashioned an early chance for arsenal though his shot was deflected over although midfield pair patrick vieira and emmanuel petit did well to contain their opponents in opening half hour arsenal s lack of pace and incisiveness upfront was evident ljungberg missed three chances before half time midway through first half beckham was booked by referee graham barber for dissent moments later nicky butt was involved in a brawl with martin keown after defender nearly caught butt s face with his boot both players were booked for confronting each other as was vieira for getting involved united performed better longer match went on and scored opening goal beckham s free kick hit underside of crossbar and bounced out yorke headed rebounded ball past goalkeeper alex manninger although replays suggested goal was beckham s as his free kick crossed goal line it was given to yorke arsenal responded for a short while but missed three half chances defender jaap stam nursing an achilles injury all summer was substituted in second half for david may arsenal began half better of two teams and vieira believed he earnt his team a penalty in 49th minute it was turned down by barber substitution of sylvinho for luis boa morte in 64th minute allowed ljungberg to play in a natural midfield role two minutes later arsenal were awarded a penalty vieira chasing down ball was adjudged to have his shirt tugged by irwin in 18 yard box kanu converted penalty sending bosnich wrong way yorke soon after mistimed his goal effort after being sent clear by cole substitute ole gunnar solskjaer then put cole through only for manninger to produce a one handed save arsenal scored what proved to be match winner in 78th minute a goal kick by bosnich was headed back into united s half by vieira kanu controlled ball deftly and set up parlour whose shot went into net teddy sheringham was brought on by ferguson for butt with nine minutes of normal time remaining but with a fourth striker on field united were unable to score an equaliser luzhny later came on for parlour final substitution of match

calendar year ending a 33 match unbeaten run wenger believed result showed that arsenal were ready for season albeit admitting that defence had trouble coping with yorke he thought it was psychologically important to beat united especially after great run they have had wenger confirmed afterwards that anelka would sign for real madrid i hope everything will be finalised in next couple of days in any case he is not coming back here and although contract is not signed yet i hope it will be after his medical and that is end of it kanu who scored arsenal s equaliser and set up match winner was pleased with his performance and relished opportunity of establishing himself in first team after anelka s departure ferguson said defeat showed that manchester united needed more games to be ready particularly in second half and felt travelling half way across world for pre season did not aid their preparation in terms of result he said it was about as significant as it was last year bosnich s performance in goal received mixed reviews in english press sun questioned his positioning and said his kicking was poor player himself assessed my kicking has been atrocious and generally my distribution from back has to improve see also 1999 2000 fa premier league 1999 2000 fa cup notes references 1999 charity shield charity shield 1999 charity shield 1999 charity shield fa charity
