garage for rest of race he said it s frustrating i know if we had reliability that we could win this championship and odds would be pretty good to win championship if i can just keep it together for 10 weeks in subsequent press conference stewart said it s been a long time since we have been in victory lane so it s something we are not used to luckily we have had good fortune to not normally go this long without a win but we had an awesome race car tonight this thing it was balanced off start of race and you know i knew first run when we were a little bit off and leaders were not getting away from us i thought we have probably got a shot at this thing tonight and a shot at a solid top 5 or top 3 but once we got a couple of runs in there and it was denny and i trading spots back and forth he continued by saying thumb 200px right carl edwards finished in second position during race ryan newman discussed his contact with kahne by explaining yeah no 18 kyle busch hit me same time i hit no 9 kahne it was within a millisecond i was trying to push him to get ahead of no 2 car kurt busch and it didn t work out we ve seen this several times this year and it was me trying to help him out it causes accidents once in a while it hurt him but in grand scheme of things he tried to hurt me and it didn t hurt us as bad so we ll just go on stewart also stated when you have a car that s that good it s not good to lose those spots like that we got caught back there one time and we struggled getting that track position back but when you have a car that s that fast it s nice you don t feel like you re in too much trouble when you lose a couple of spots on a restart like that race result left kevin harvick leading driver s championship with 3 585 points jeff gordon who finished
