ding dong ding dong is a song by english musician george harrison written as a new year s eve singalong and released in december 1974 on his album dark horse it was album s lead single in britain and some other european countries and second single after dark horse in north america a large scale production song incorporates aspects of phil spector s wall of sound technique particularly his christmas recordings from 1963 in addition some harrison biographers view ding dong as an attempt to emulate success of two glam rock anthems from 1973 74 holiday season merry xmas everybody by slade and wizzard s i wish it could be christmas everyday song became only a minor hit in britain and united states although it was a top twenty hit elsewhere in world harrison took lyrics to ding dong from engravings he found at his nineteenth century home friar park in oxfordshire a legacy of its eccentric founder frank crisp song s ring out old ring in new refrain has invited interpretation as harrison distancing himself from his past as a member of beatles and as singer farewelling his first marriage to pattie boyd as on much of dark horse album harrison s vocals on recording were hampered by a throat condition due partly to his having overextended himself on business projects such as his recently launched record label dark horse records recorded at his friar park studio track includes musical contributions from tom scott ringo starr alvin lee ron wood and jim keltner on release song met with an unfavourable response from many music critics while others considered its musical and
