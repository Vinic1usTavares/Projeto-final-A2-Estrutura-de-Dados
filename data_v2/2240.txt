era we need that energy but digitally m i a herself picked out steppin up space and teqkilla as her favourite tracks on album she said that she contemplated using only sound of drills as backing for steppin up but concluded that this was too experimental an approach according to jim farber of new york daily news maya is an avant pop album that takes influence from most maddeningly catchy bits of electro clash hip hop bollywood dub and dance music farber also noted significant industrial rock influence on album likening it to late 80s work of ministry julianne escobedo shepherd of fader commented on increasingly industrial feel of tracks made available prior to album s release a style which had not previously been incorporated into her music on a similar note michael saba of paste

slashes due to their ease at being typed and because she liked way album title looked on music players such as itunes she also suggested that it was a deliberate attempt to avoid detection by internet search engines guardian sian rowe commented that m i a s deliberate shrinking away from a mainstream audience by use of difficult symbols was part of a growing new underground scene perhaps trying to create a generation gap where only youngest and most enthusiastic would seek out such band names by reading right online sources promotion on 12 january 2010 m i a posted a video clip on twitter which

aaron writing in spin gave album four and a half out of five stars his review deeming song lovalot her riskiest gambit yet matthew bennett of clash gave a similar score calling it a towering work mojo

lighter tracks such as teqkilla which he called enjoyably demented but utterly catchy rolling stone writer rob sheffield said album was m i a s most aggressive confrontational and passionate yet praising her voracious ear for alarms sirens explosions turning every jolt into a breakbeat and her consequent lyrics as expansive los angeles times writer ann powers commended album as an attempt by an artist who s defined herself through opposition to engage with system that she has entered for better or worse and to still remain recognizable to herself characterising mayas foregrounded ideas as a struggle worthy of a revolutionary in his consumer guide for msn music critic robert christgau gave album an a rating and complimented its beats and spunky shape shifting stubbornly political nouveau riche bundle of nerves who holds them together other critics were not as complimentary towards album charlotte heathcote of british newspaper daily express said that while m i a could still

expressed a mixed response towards m i a s embracing pop more fervently than ever entertainment weeklys leah greenblatt was critical of album stating that it sounded murky and almost punishingly discordant as if album has been submerged underwater and then set upon by an arsenal of exceptionally peeved power tools she went on to state that nothing on album sounded truly vital or as revolutionary as m i a wanted public to believe stephen trousse writing in uncut described album as anti climactic and self satisfied and said that it suffered from diminished horizons mehan jayasuriya of popmatters noted m i a s self aggrandizing as a weakness adding that maya lacks focus and confidence of m i a s previous albums jesse cataldo of slant magazine noted that album has feel of a vanity project and wrote it may be an above average album but its aesthetic matches her persona only at its shallowest levels in thinness of its ideas and often forceful ugliness of its message
