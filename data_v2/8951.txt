thumb looking west on henday toward gateway blvd from 91 street at left eastbound traffic from highway 2 mixes with traffic destined to 91 street before joining freeway anthony henday drive highway 216 is a freeway that encircles edmonton alberta it is a heavily travelled commuter and truck bypass route with southwest quadrant serving as a portion of canamex corridor that links canada to united states and mexico henday is one of busiest highways in western canada carrying over 106 000 vehicles per day near west edmonton mall in 2018 rush hour congestion is common on four lane section in southwest edmonton where traffic levels have doubled alberta transportation estimates due to rapid suburban development alberta has committed to widening this section to six lanes by 2022 work will begin in fall 2019 calgary trail in south edmonton is designated as starting point of ring with exit numbers increasing clockwise as freeway proceeds across north saskatchewan river to cameron heights neighbourhood then north past whitemud drive stony plain road and yellowhead trail to st albert it continues east past 97 street to manning drive then south across north saskatchewan river a second time entering strathcona county it again crosses yellowhead trail and whitemud drive passing community of sherwood park continuing south to highway 14 road re enters southeast edmonton and turns west to complete ring freeway was named after 18th century explorer anthony henday one of first european men to explore central alberta its designation of 216 is derived from its bypass linkages to edmonton s two major crossroads highways 2 and 16 constructed over 26 years at a cost of 4 3 billion henday became first freeway to surround a major canadian city when final segment opened on october 1 2016 planning of ring began in 1950s followed by design work and initial land acquisition in 1970s and construction of first expressway segment beginning in 1990 plans for henday were developed in tandem with stoney trail a similar ring road freeway around calgary route description overview alberta transportation describes anthony henday drive as a barrier free illuminated high speed free flow fully access controlled facility with a posted speed limit of for its entire length around edmonton first ring road of its type in canada majority of capital region residents reside within approximate diameter of ring and there is extensive suburban development in close proximity to henday by physical size edmonton is larger than both toronto and montreal but has a relatively low population density some have argued that freeway is a significant contributor to urban sprawl in region city also lacks a free flowing north south route further increasing traffic levels on anthony henday drive road travels primarily through suburban residential areas in south and west of city and rural farm lands and wetlands in north eastern section of road separates sherwood park portion of refinery row and other industrial and commercial developments in edmonton to west from balance of sherwood park to east at its widest point east of edmonton between whitemud drive and sherwood park freeway anthony henday drive is eight total lanes wide which includes three main travel lanes in each direction plus a fourth lane allowing traffic to merge onto and exit from roadway highest number of through lanes is seven between aurum road and 153 avenue in northeast edmonton most of road is paved with asphalt except for an experimental concrete segment in southwest edmonton first of its type in province alberta transportation intended for section to have lower long term maintenance costs but only six years after construction it required significant repairs concrete was not considered for subsequent sections of road but overall it was deemed to be a successful experiment that would net long term savings west and north edmonton alberta transportation considers starting point of anthony henday drive to be at calgary trail gateway boulevard in south edmonton with mileage increasing clockwise around ring at this major interchange two westbound lanes of freeway are joined by two lanes from northbound gateway boulevard and a third from southbound calgary trail all five lanes merge into two over a short distance creating congestion in afternoon rush hour two westbound lanes continue across blackmud creek past 111 street to 119 street curving slightly to southwest through suburbs of south edmonton henday crosses whitemud creek to an interchange at rabbit hill road veering back to northwest freeway passes beneath terwillegar drive before descending to cross north saskatchewan river on twin bridges alt anthony henday drive south through west edmonton between callingwood road exit and whitemud drive interchange thumb anthony henday drive south through west edmonton after whitemud drive interchange this four lane section has reached above its designed capacity and alberta transportation proposes widening section from calgary trail to whitemud drive to six lanes west of river four lane freeway passes trail and cameron heights drive on its way to lessard road and callingwood road curving north traffic volume increases as freeway reaches a major interchange at whitemud drive and widens to six lanes a northbound braided ramp helps reduce congestion between whitemud drive and 87 avenue with which an interchange immediately follows henday continues north to major interchanges at stony plain road and yellowhead trail providing access to spruce grove and jasper respectively before curving northeast toward city of st albert between whitemud drive and yellowhead trail henday is officially concurrent with highway 2 but this is not indicated on any road signs in northwest edmonton anthony henday drive first crosses ray gibbon drive before continuing northeast to pass st albert to southeast after ray gibbon drive freeway serves as boundary between cities of edmonton and st albert six lane road continues over 137 avenue and under 170 street to campbell road where it reduces from three lanes each way to two it continues curving east across 127 street to highway 28 most northerly point on ring road now forming approximate boundary between edmonton and sturgeon county freeway passes south of cfb edmonton before reaching 66 street and a major interchange at manning drive highway 15 former terminus of freeway until final section was completed in 2016 east and south edmonton after manning drive freeway widens to six lanes and continues clockwise through northeast edmonton past 153 avenue to a second crossing of north saskatchewan river four lanes cross river southbound and three northbound on bridges a pedestrian crossing was again included it is slung underneath southbound bridge and ties into existing pathway system seven lane freeway rises from river valley into clover bar area crossing aurum road to a major interchange at yellowhead trail crossing into strathcona county in strathcona county fourth southbound lane is dropped and six lane freeway immediately crosses over petroleum way en route to interchanges at baseline road and sherwood park freeway passing refinery row to east south of sherwood park freeway anthony henday drive forms boundary between strathcona county and city of edmonton freeway continues to a second interchange at whitemud drive after which it is briefly concurrent with highway 14 until that route branches southeast later four lanes of anthony henday drive re enter city of edmonton and turns west toward starting point of loop before straightening out to a westerly heading freeway interchanges with 17 street then 50 street after which it returns to a six lane freeway crosses 91 street and returns to its starting point at calgary trail gateway boulevard interchange design alberta transportation used several different interchange designs for freeway most common being partial cloverleaf with between four and six ramps this type of interchange is ideal for connections between freeways and arterial roads they have a higher capacity than diamond interchanges but do not have weaving and merging problems of full cloverleaf interchanges loop ramps are also used to better conform to existing terrain or structures or to increase merge weave distances between closely spaced interchanges for example they were used at 91 street to achieve at least of separation to gateway boulevard which would not have been possible with a conventional diamond anthony henday drive features several variations of cloverstack a common name for hybrid designs that allow for high speed left turns on elevated directional ramps they retain loop ramps for lesser used left turn movements significantly reducing cost and overall size of interchange because fourth level flyovers are not required as they are in a stack interchange henday features two three level interchanges cloverstack at calgary trail gateway boulevard was first three level interchange to be constructed in alberta several of bridges in this interchange use a trellis beam concept in which many perpendicular girders are used to carry upper roadway at a high degree of skew for henday s junction with yellowhead highway east of edmonton there was already an existing semi directional ramp for westbound to southbound movement prior to completion of northeast leg it ran parallel to railway line that bisects interchange it was retained while existing interchange was reconstructed into a cloverstack with two new two semi directional flyovers and one loop ramp for eastbound to northbound movement traffic busiest section of anthony henday drive is in west edmonton between 87 avenue and stony plain road where it carried over 106 000 vehicles per day in 2018 second only to whitemud drive among edmonton roadways section carried over 114 000 vehicles per day during summer months of 2018 4 lane section of southwest quadrant between calgary trail and whitemud drive is significantly over capacity and sees major delays during peak periods a contributing factor is close proximity of interchanges between north saskatchewan river and yellowhead trail which creates a problem known as weaving in which traffic is trying to simultaneously enter and exit within same stretch of roadway traffic levels on henday have risen much more quickly than anticipated alberta transportation concedes that in 2001 southwest section was projected to reach 40 000 vehicles per day by 2020 but reached that mark in 2009 it carries over 80 000 vehicles per day in vicinity of 111 street and alberta committed to widening section to six lanes by 2022 with work beginning in fall 2019 prior to announcement project manager bill van der meer had stated that henday is operating efficiently aside from peak hour congestion alberta transportation generally considers widening four lane highways when volumes reach between 30 000 and 50 000 cars per day with exception of a section in north edmonton between highway 28 and manning drive by 2015 all four lane sections of henday each carried more than 40 000 vehicles per day

18th century on a mission for hudson s bay company plans for a ring road around edmonton began developing in 1950s when edmonton regional planning commission identified a need for road to support future development in edmonton area and movement of goods and services around province areas around city that could potentially interfere with this growth were retained by province and called restricted development areas in 1972 edmonton city council recommended that city ask for province to pay for ring road shortly thereafter in addition to restricted development areas that had already been retained alberta government led by premier peter lougheed continued land acquisitions to assemble a transportation utility corridor tuc for edmonton and calgary ring roads plans had evolved to provide right of way for future overhead high voltage transmission lines underground gas and oil pipelines and water storm sewer lines by 1985 a study had been completed to plot an exact alignment of anthony henday drive through tuc and by end of decade most of required land had been purchased from land owners unused land within corridor may be leased out by government as a source of revenue but some landowners were unhappy that province did not have a firm timeline for henday s construction thumb left unique structure over whitemud creek in southwest edmonton was constructed with wildlife in mind and to allow for a pedestrian and bicycle path south construction southwest quadrant of anthony henday drive bypasses edmonton to southwest connecting highways 2 and 16 it was deemed to be highest priority for construction because of its designation as part of canamex corridor a trade route through alberta that links alaska to mexico first section of bypass to be completed was from whitemud drive north to stony plain road constructed by city of edmonton beginning in 1990 and completed in 1992 prior to province taking over responsibility of henday an additional extending road north to yellowhead trail was completed by 1998 construction then shifted south with completion from whitemud drive south to 45 avenue just north of what is currently lessard road interchange next section extended road on twin bridge structures across north saskatchewan river to terwillegar drive opening on november 8 2005 in december 2003 during construction of southbound bridge a girder collapsed and had to be replaced delaying construction an extension further east to calgary trail was completed by october 2006 creating a full southwest bypass of edmonton it includes a semi circular arch structure that spans whitemud creek and three arch bridges over blackmud creek a 168 million interchange that included seven bridges was constructed at stony plain road and entire quadrant became free flowing in late 2011 after completion of smaller interchanges at lessard road callingwood road and cameron heights drive a flyover was originally planned on western leg at 69 avenue before it was ultimately scrapped by alberta transportation total cost of entire southwest quadrant from yellowhead trail to gateway boulevard was 577 million through lane count excluding exit only lanes section

partnership p3 also known as a design build operate project this method of construction presented millions of dollars in savings to alberta taxpayers and allowed project to be completed on an accelerated timeline because consolidation of various sub contracts is managed by one entity allowing for increased efficiencies on january 25 2005 alberta signed a 493 million contract with a consortium called access roads to build road and maintain it for 30 years construction began in april and was completed in october 2007 new segment included 24 bridge structures and 5 interchanges and connected highway 14 to yellowhead trail in west effectively creating a full southern bypass of edmonton it also provided an important link for quickly growing southern communities of ellerslie and to rest of edmonton s road network north construction and completion construction of an interim segment from yellowhead trail in west to 137 avenue was first to be completed as part of st albert s ray gibbon drive project full work on entire of northwest leg from yellowhead trail to manning drive highway 15 was initiated in early 2008 after alberta s signing of a 1 42 billion p3 agreement with general partnership to build and maintain road for 30 years construction began in september 2008 described by then premier ed stelmach as an important step in meeting our provincial goal of completing ring roads to a freeway status by 2015 project included construction of two large cloverstack interchanges one each at yellowhead trail and manning drive seven other smaller interchanges were also constructed as well as five flyovers and two rail crossings three lanes each way were built from yellowhead trail to campbell road and two lanes each way from campbell road to manning drive all work was completed on time and leg opened to traffic on november 1 2011 thumb left berms were used for construction of bridges over environmentally sensitive north saskatchewan river in northeast edmonton first on river s south bank then north bank seen here in 2014 alt berms were used for construction of two steel bridges carrying anthony henday drive over north saskatchewan river in northeast edmonton first on river s south bank then north bank seen here in 2014 bridges carry three lanes northbound and four lanes southbound in may 2012 alberta signed a 1 81 billion p3 contract with capital city link general partnership to build and maintain final northeast segment of anthony henday drive for 30 years after construction from manning drive to yellowhead trail east of edmonton in strathcona county a sod turning ceremony was held on july 16 and construction was underway at time largest transportation project in history of province significant reconstruction was done to existing section of road east of edmonton from yellowhead trail south to highway 14 that had been in place since at least early 1960s it was formerly known as highway 14x x denoting that route was an extension of highway 14 prior to completion of whitemud drive at end of 1990s highway 14 followed a more northerly alignment through edmonton on sherwood park freeway as part of reconstruction several bridges constructed between 1965 and 1974 were demolished they spanned anthony henday drive at yellowhead trail baseline road and sherwood park freeway and were removed to make way for updated structures that would allow freeway underneath to be widened to six lanes and further expanded to eight lanes or more in future a bridge built in 1969 carrying broadmoor boulevard over yellowhead trail was also demolished because it was not at required elevation for new interchange configuration yellowhead trail from north saskatchewan river to clover bar road was significantly improved and widened as was sherwood park freeway from 17 street to road crescent in sherwood park thumb upright 1 1 interchange of anthony henday drive and yellowhead trail east of edmonton is a complex three level cloverstack it includes several braided ramps connections to adjacent roads and is bisected by a railway line overall project included construction of nine interchanges two road flyovers eight rail flyovers and twin bridges over north saskatchewan river for a total of 47 bridge structures and demolition of 13 existing bridges an extensive environmental assessment was also completed which identified need for a wildlife crossing at river which was constructed noise analysis based on projected traffic volumes was also completed complex interchange at yellowhead trail includes several braided ramps connections to adjacent roads and is bisected by a railway line on october 1 2016 northeast leg of freeway was officially opened to traffic major construction on sherwood park freeway and yellowhead trail was also largely complete including all new lanes and ramps only minor aesthetic work remained such as landscaping completion of mechanically stabilized earth walls and painting of wing walls piers and abutments future entire freeway road was built with expansion in mind almost all bridges were built wide enough for expansion to ultimate stage which includes as many as six main travel lanes in one direction depending on location in june 2018 alberta committed 100 million to widening of southwest leg of road plans included widening both directions from two to three travel lanes in congested southwest section between 111 street and whitemud drive and more extensive work required to widen bridges over north saskatchewan river and wedgewood ravine which are currently two lanes of travel per bridge each way in september 2019 minister of transportation ric mciver announced that a contract for work had been awarded with work set to begin in fall 2019 capacity of section will be increased to 120 000 vehicles per day in 2015 city councillor michael oshry had stated that he was unhappy with way road was initially constructed and alberta should have done a better job of anticipating rapid growth in southwest edmonton project manager bill van der meer disagreed saying if we built a six lane divided road that was virtually empty for 10 years that wouldn t be money well spent upright 1 2 left thumb final section of anthony henday drive to be completed is widest carrying no less than six lanes from manning drive to highway 14 between aurum rd and 153 ave it is seven lanes wide as part of initial construction grading has been completed for several future interchanges flyovers and higher capacity directional ramps at existing interchanges to reduce construction time and costs for those structures when traffic volumes require them for example directional ramps constructed at northwest henday yellowhead trail interchange were built one lane wide initially but all bridge decks are wide enough to accommodate a second lane edmonton proposes to upgrade terwillegar drive to a freeway at an estimated cost of 1 billion after which two directional ramps are proposed they would carry traffic from northbound terwillegar drive to westbound anthony henday drive and from southbound to eastbound on november 1 2016 alberta announced intended closure of right in right out access at 127 street in southwest edmonton citing safety concerns however in following days city requested that access remain open indefinitely until alternatives were explored and province agreed an interchange to replace this access is planned for future but has no funding nor an estimated completion date in southeast a directional ramp from eastbound whitemud drive to northbound anthony henday drive is proposed when traffic volumes warrant its construction to meet long term requirements alberta transportation also proposes to construct a high capacity directional ramp carrying traffic from eastbound anthony henday dive to northbound ray gibbon drive after latter is twinned and upgraded to a freeway ray gibbon drive is proposed as a major corridor that will carry highway 2 designation in future one kilometre further down road at 137 avenue grading was initially completed for a partial cloverleaf interchange but in 2008 alberta elected not to spend 7 million to complete paving of ramps because development did not yet require it st albert mayor nolan crouse was unhappy with decision stating that his city would not pay for it either it s going to sit there until there s another plan and right now we don t have a plan we have taken position that we think it s province s responsibility and they say they won t crouse said there is no timeline for completion of interchange alberta proposes to construct a second ring road around edmonton to support future growth approximately beyond anthony henday drive road would not be constructed for roughly 40 years and could cost upwards of 11 billion parkland county mayor rod voiced his support for plan in 2014 stating if we don t implement and have another ring road it s going to be further traffic congestion and have environmental impacts as well edmonton mayor don called plan a bad idea instead favouring expansion to light rail transit and upgrades to existing roadways in edmonton area such as yellowhead trail both projects could be completed for cost of proposed outer ring road he argued and in 2016 city announced that yellowhead trail would be upgraded to a freeway after federal and provincial governments agreed to fund half of 1 billion project in may 2017 edmonton police chief rod knecht expressed his support for an increase in speed limit on anthony henday drive from 100 km h
