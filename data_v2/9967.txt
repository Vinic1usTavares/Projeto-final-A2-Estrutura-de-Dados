north to south and so deeper mining became necessary during 17th century with onset of industrial revolution and growing use of steam power there was a rapid increase in demand for coal duke s mines were among those supplying surrounding districts but transport was both inefficient and expensive and mines also suffered from persistent flooding his solution to these problems was to build a canal from worsley to salford and an underground canal into mines from worsley delph canal boats would carry at a time more than ten times amount of cargo per horse that was possible with a cart duke and his estate manager obtained an act of parliament empowering them to begin construction on a planned route directly to salford avoiding river irwell james brindley was brought in for his technical expertise and suggested varying route of proposed canal away from salford and across irwell into manchester a second act was secured for this variance which included an aqueduct to cross irwell this was built relatively quickly for time work commenced in september 1760 and first boat crossed on 17 july 1761 canal opened in 1761 and along with stone aqueduct at barton upon irwell was considered a
