karl plagge 10 july 1897 19 june 1957 was a german engineer who rescued jews during holocaust in lithuania by issuing work permits to non essential workers a partially disabled veteran of world war i plagge studied engineering and joined nazi party in 1931 in hopes of helping germany rebuild from economic collapse caused by draconian terms of treaty of versailles after being dismissed from a position of lecturer for being unwilling to teach racism and his opposition to nazi racist policies he stopped participating in party activities in 1935 and left party when war broke out during world war ii he used his position as a staff officer in german army to employ and protect jews in vilna ghetto at first plagge employed jews who lived inside ghetto but when it was due to be terminated in september 1943 he set up hkp 562 forced labor camp where he saved many male jews by issuing them official work permits on false premise that their holders skills were vital for german war effort and their wives and children by claiming they would work better if their families were alive although unable to stop ss from liquidating remaining prisoners in july 1944 plagge managed to warn prisoners in advance allowing about 200 to hide from ss and survive until red army s liberation of vilnius of 100 000 pre war jews in vilnius only 2 000 survived of which largest single group were saved by plagge plagge was tried before an allied denazification court in 1947 which accepted his plea to be classified as a fellow traveler of nazi party whose rescue activities were undertaken for humanitarian reasons rather than overt opposition to nazism survivors he rescued testified on his behalf plagge died ten years after trial according to historian kim priemel success of plagge s rescue efforts was due to working within system to save jews a position which required him to enter a grey zone of moral compromise in 2000 story of his rescues was uncovered by son of a survivor of hkp 562 in 2005 after two unsuccessful petitions holocaust memorial yad vashem recognized him as one of righteous among nations early life and education plagge was born to a prussian family in darmstadt germany on 10 july 1897 many of his ancestors had been military doctors plagge s father died in 1904 leaving plagge his mother and his older sister after graduating from ludwig georgs gymnasium a secondary school that focused on classics plagge was drafted into imperial german army he fought as a lieutenant in world war i on western front participating in battles of somme verdun and flanders imprisoned in a british pow camp from 1917 to 1920 he caught polio and became disabled in his left leg upon his release plagge studied chemical engineering at technische universitat darmstadt graduating in 1924 he had wanted to study medicine but was prevented from longer study program required due to his family s financial problems after graduating he married anke madsen but couple had to live with his mother due to their finances unemployed he ran a pharmaceutical laboratory from house interwar period political convictions and career originally a lutheran plagge lost his belief in god because of atrocities that he witnessed during holocaust he was ideologically a national conservative but joined nazi party on 1 december 1931 during his denazification trial plagge stated that he was initially drawn to promises of adolf hitler and nazi party to rebuild german economy and national pride which suffered during years that germany experienced after signing of treaty of versailles between 1931 and 1933 plagge worked as a local organizer for party he came into conflict with leadership of party after 1933 when hitler seized power according to his later testimony plagge refused to accept nazi racial theories which he considered unscientific and was disgusted by persecution of political opponents and corruption of many nazi functionaries instead of leaving party he attempted to effect change from within accepting a position as a scientific lecturer and leader of a nazi educational institute in darmstadt because of his refusal to teach nazi racial ideology he was dismissed from his position in 1935 a local party official accused plagge of being on good terms with jews and freemasons treating jews in his home laboratory and opposing nazi boycott of jewish businesses threatening to bring plagge before a party tribunal instead plagge ceased his activity with party disenchanted with nazism in 1934 plagge began to work at hessenwerks an engineering company run by kurt hesse whose wife erica was half jewish by hiring a nominal nazi hesse hoped to prevent of his business after kristallnacht in 1938 plagge became godfather of hesse s son konrad same year plagge took over as chief engineer of hessenwerks service in lithuania hkp 562 thumb left lithuanian collaborator with jewish prisoners july 1941 plagge was drafted into wehrmacht german army as a captain in reserve at beginning of world war ii and stopped paying nazi party membership fees at same time serving initially in poland after german invasion he witnessed atrocities that caused him to decide to work against nazis in 1941 he was put in command of an engineering unit 562 vehicle maintenance unit 562 or hkp 562 literally army motor vehicle park which maintained and repaired military vehicles after german invasion of soviet union hkp 562 was deployed to vilna lithuania in early july 1941 plagge witnessed genocide being carried out against jews of area plagge helped jews by giving work certificates to jewish men certifying them as essential and skilled workers regardless of their actual backgrounds this kind of work permit protected worker his wife and up to two of his children from ss sweeps carried out in vilna ghetto in which jews without work papers were captured and killed at nearby ponary execution grounds as a work assignment hkp 562 was particularly sought after by jews because of plagge s efforts to treat his workers well plagge also made efforts to help poles and soviet prisoners of war forced to work for wehrmacht plagge was quasi sovereign of his unit retaining his independence so long as repair work got done and worked to insulate his workers from genocide perpetrated by ss he reassigned antisemitic or violent subordinates so that they did not interact with jewish workers and turned a blind eye to smuggling and black market that kept workers alive during autumn of 1941 when many jews were rounded up and shot in aktions plagge s workshop was fourth largest employer of jews in vilnius with 261 work permits allocated when his workers were captured during sweeps plagge attempted to free them from prison before they could be executed at ponary if only a few jews were arrested he sent a subordinate however in late 1941 70 jewish workers and their families were arrested plagge exaggerated their importance to war effort and managed to secure release of them all in 1942 200 jews working for plagge were rounded up for deportation plagge argued with ss obersturmfuhrer rolf neugebauer in an attempt to secure their release but was unable to save them during 1943 after negotiations with ss plagge was able to expand his workforce from 394 jews in july to more than 1 000 when ghetto was liquidated in september labour camp thumb aerial photograph of former hkp 562 camp in aftermath of april 1943 warsaw ghetto uprising and an increase in soviet partisan activity heinrich himmler head of ss decided to liquidate all nazi ghettos regardless of slave labor they provided to wehrmacht s war effort in particular vilna ghetto was seen as a threat because of its extensive underground movement and proximity of partisans in woods around city plagge who had been promoted to major secured permission from ss to establish a juden kz for hkp 562 on subocz street on outskirts of vilnius hkp 562 was only wehrmacht unit allowed to retain jewish workers on 1 september about 300 of plagge s workers were seized by ss for transportation to klooga concentration camp plagge went to train station to argue with an ss nco bruno kittel who was in charge of liquidation initially able to secure their release plagge left jews with subordinates but kittel s superior officer ss obersturmfuhrer rolf neugebauer ordered them to be deported anyway plagge attempted to contact neugebauer but was unable to and jews were all deported to klooga he then ordered his subordinates to recruit other jewish workers to replace those who had been deported on 16 september 1943 plagge transported over 1 000 of his jewish workers and their families from vilna ghetto to newly built hkp camp at 37 subocz street where they remained in relative safety plagge saved not only skilled male workers but also their wives and children arguing that workers would not be motivated without their families less than a week later on 23 september ss liquidated vilna ghetto rest of vilna s jews were either executed immediately at ponary or sent to concentration camps in nazi occupied europe a few jews hid in ruins of ghetto arguing that he needed more workers plagge brought 100 arrested jews into hkp another 100 jews were smuggled in by resistance movement with plagge s acquiescence and population peaked at 1 250 early in 1944 camp which consisted of two multistory tenements originally constructed to house jews on welfare was surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by lithuanian collaborators and ss men about 60 of jews worked at vehicle repair depot or a shop for repairing wehrmacht uniforms plagge established various industries for rest of his workers including a rabbit farm a nursery and a carpenter s shop declaring all of his workers essential to war effort he strongly resisted ss efforts to remove these nonessential workers thumb a yiddish slang for hiding place where jews hid during liquidation of camp on certain occasions plagge s policy of non confrontation with ss put him in a catch 22 situation with serious moral implications according to historian kim priemel on multiple occasions hkp 562 loaned trucks and drivers to ss for purpose of transporting jews to ponary for execution in november 1943 a jewish prisoner named david zalkind his wife and child attempted to escape from camp and were caught by gestapo they were executed in camp courtyard in front of other prisoners ss officer who ordered killing reported that it was done in accord with park leader major plagge following zalkind s execution thirty six jewish women were executed by bruno kittel and ss soldiers on 27 march 1944 while plagge was away on home leave in germany ss carried out a children operation they entered camp rounded up about 250 children and elderly jews and took them to ponary for execution although plagge claimed upon his return that he would have saved children if he had been present it is doubtful that he could have done so plagge s acquiescence to these killings made him in moral terms as much a collaborator as a rescuer according to priemel however plagge s collaboration was arguably a rational choice because he was able to save more jews than any other wehrmacht rescuer in vilnius dissolution during summer of 1944 red army advanced to outskirts of vilnius and wehrmacht withdrew abruptly in early july camp was to be dissolved accused of being soft on jews plagge was forbidden to take them with his unit knowing that camp would be liquidated before red army arrived jews made hiding places in camp in secret bunkers in walls and in rafters of attic however they needed to know when camp would be liquidated so they could implement their plans to escape or hide on 1 july plagge made an informal speech to jewish prisoners in presence of ss oberscharfuhrer richter in response to a question from assembled jews plagge added that there was no need to bring their luggage when ss came to camp on 4 july 500 jews appeared at roll call and were executed at ponary rest either tried to escape or hid inside camp about 150 or 200 jews survived searches and were liberated by red army on 13 july of 100 000 jews in vilnius only 2 000 survived holocaust survivors of hkp camp constituted largest single group post war after leaving vilnius plagge led his unit westward and surrendered to united states army on 2 may 1945 without suffering a single casualty because he had joined nazi party so early and commanded a labor camp where many prisoners were murdered he was tried in 1947 as part of postwar denazification process and hired a lawyer to defend himself plagge and his former subordinates told court about his efforts to help jewish forced laborers plagge s lawyer asked for him to be classified as a fellow traveler rather than an active nazi former prisoners of hkp 562 in a displaced persons camp in ludwigsburg told maria eichamueller about plagge s actions after reading about trial in a local newspaper eichamueller appeared to testify on plagge s behalf which influenced trial result in his favor court did not exonerate plagge completely because it believed that his actions had been motivated by humanitarianism rather than opposition to nazism judges may have been reluctant to recognize extent of plagge s humanitarian achievements because they cast a bad light on indifference of ordinary germans to holocaust and retention of nazi judges in postwar judicial system after trial plagge lived final decade of his life quietly and died of a heart attack in darmstadt on 19 june 1957 in a letter to a jewish lawyer r strauss dated 26 april 1956 plagge compared himself to dr rieux a character in albert camus s novel plague in novel which was written while camus was living under nazi occupation in france rieux risks his life to save people from plague but his efforts cannot save very many people and often appear useless like plagge rieux does not see himself as a hero assessment and legacy thumb left hkp survivor pearl good points to plagge s name on wall of righteous at yad vashem in 1999 hkp 562 survivor pearl good traveled to vilnius with her family good s son michael decided to investigate story of plagge but he had trouble locating him because survivors knew him only as major plagge and did not know his full name or place of birth after fourteen months good was able to locate plagge s wehrmacht personnel file he eventually published results of his research in 2005 as search for major plagge nazi who saved jews good formed an organization of researchers and friends that he called plagge group and along with hkp survivors petitioned yad vashem israel s official memorial to holocaust to have plagge recognized as righteous among nations their first petition in 2002 was rejected they applied again next year and received a reply stating that we fail to understand what possible risks he had to fear from his superiors in yad vashem s view plagge s efforts to save jewish workers and treat them humanely were probably related to serving german war effort plagge group disagreed pointing out that wehrmacht soldiers associating with jews were threatened with being treated as jews indeed wehrmacht sergeant anton schmid had been executed in 1942 for helping jews in vilna ghetto in 2004 letter that plagge had written in 1956 to strauss was discovered letters between plagge and ss obersturmbannfuhrer wilhelm which persuaded latter to spare female forced laborers in hkp 562 camp were uncovered that same year yad vashem committee voted on 22 july 2004 to recognize plagge as righteous among nations ceremony held in jerusalem on 11 april 2005 was attended by many survivors konrad hesse and a few members of plagge s extended family mordecai director of committee thanked pearl good for making trip to vilnius with her family and sparking chain of events which uncovered plagge s actions during war because plagge had left no descendants president of technische universitat darmstadt accepted award on his behalf in february 2006 former a bundeswehr base in germany was renamed karl plagge kaserne a bust of plagge was placed in schoolyard of ludwig georgs gymnasium in darmstadt following archaeological work done at hkp 562 site in 2017 a documentary about plagge and camp good nazi premiered in vilnius following year plagge s actions were very unusual very few wehrmacht soldiers helped jews during holocaust however soldiers under his command and other wehrmacht officials including hans christian hingst civilian administrator of german occupied vilnius were aware of plagge s rescue activities and did not denounce him historian kim priemel examining wehrmacht rescuers in vilnius concludes that plagge remained within a grey zone of moral compromise which however was vital to success of his rescue efforts references citations print sources web sources category 1897 births category 1957 deaths
