polygonia c album comma is a food generalist polyphagous butterfly species belonging to family nymphalidae angular notches on edges of forewings are characteristic of genus polygonia which is why species in genus are commonly referred to as butterflies comma butterflies can be identified by their prominent orange and dark brown black dorsal wings to reduce predation both larval and adult stages exhibit protective camouflage mimicking bird droppings and fallen leaves respectively during later stage of development larvae also develop strong spines along their backs species is commonly found in europe north africa and asia and contains several subspecies although species is not migratory butterflies are strong fliers resulting in an open population structure with high gene flow and increased genetic variation description outer margins of wings are strongly and irregularly dentate excavated and angulated upper side of wings has a bright orange ground colour decorated with brown marks and light spots on edge reverse is marbled with brown folded butterfly looks like a dead leaf hindwings have on reverse side a white spot usually in shape of c sexual dimorphism is slight and concerns intensity of coloration silhouette and size male having a wingspan of 22 to 24 mm and female of 25 to 26 mm seasonal dimorphism is more marked first generation hutchinsoni form may june has upperside fawn orange and underside brown gold and hindwing bears distally a broad dark red brown area in which is situated a row of light brown hastate spots underside is dark being either or prominently marmorated while second generation form c album july in autumn and spring after overwintering has a more reddish upper and dark brown underside ground colour is less bright in summer form wings are less dentate and hindwing has a narrow dark band near which stands a row of light lunules proximally bordered by a band of brown arcs underside is of a paler colour being less distinctly sometimes however very prominently marmorated and shaded taxonomy and phylogeny comma belongs to family nymphalidae largest family of butterflies with 13 subfamilies within genus polygonia a sister group relationship between p c album and p faunus is strongly supported by larval development analysis and synapomorphies in both species adults and larvae have similar polyphagous habits genus polygonia is also closely related to genera and each containing a single species k and r l album geographic range and habitat comma inhabits areas including europe north africa and asia it is

primary source of nitrogen and protein during adulthood because they feed exclusively on plants making them a phytophagous species quality of plants upon which larvae feed is strongly correlated with their future fitness larval form is often divided into five developmental stages known as instars although during first three instars larvae are observed to remain almost entirely upon underside of leaves fourth and fifth instar larvae are more active in obtaining food resources later instar larvae are specialized feeders and favor several host plants during larval stage urtica dioica ulmus glabra salix caprea r uva crispa and betula pubescens while pupal weight and overall larval survival rates are similar among larvae regardless of host plant larval development times differ significantly as a result larvae prefer feeding on plants that allow them to develop in shortest amount of time larvae reared on u dioica demand shortest development time and is thus favored over other plants on other hand b pubescens is at bottom of host plant preference hierarchy favoring plants in family is speculated to have originated from species ancestors providing an explanation for larval preference for u dioica within u dioica plant larvae are not shown to differentiate between high quality fresher and low quality wilting nettles a pattern expected of a polyphagous species reproduction and life history mating mating system comma butterflies have a polyandrous mating system where females mate with multiple males to receive necessary amount of sperm to fertilize their eggs polyandrous female distributes her matings equally over her lifetime so males mating success increases proportionally to their lifespan mating success of both sexes is correlated to duration of an individual s life so no difference in mortality rates is observed between males and females female mate choice females exercise mate choice before during and after mating and can distinguish between males who were reared on high quality versus low quality host plants ability to recognize adults reared on higher quality host plants is selected for because males fed better plants during development provide superior nuptial gifts in comma butterflies nuptial gifts are edible spermatophores containing spermatozoa and nutrients when comparing two common host plants u dioica and s caprea females preferentially choose to mate with males reared on u dioica because these males have higher protein content and increased spermatophore production females preferentially mate with males which provide larger investments in form of nuptial gifts when females mated with males with higher quality nuptial gifts they not only allocate more resources to egg production but also use resources to improve their own reproductive success investments can be used to increase female life expectancy female maintenance and future reproduction during each mating males allocate a constant amount of investment towards each nuptial gift indicating that male mate choice does not play a role in allocation of resources oviposition females recognize and select a host plant carefully before laying their eggs upon it generally favoring host plants where larval development time is minimized akin to preferred host plants for larvae females prefer plants in order despite overall preference for plants leading to short larval development host plant preference variation between females exists although partiality for certain plant species appears to be inherited across populations pattern is not significant within a single population this pattern of deviation results from open population structure with high gene flow parent offspring conflict in theory females would prefer host plants where their offspring performance is maximized and larvae would benefit from being able to feed on best resources nearby their hatch site however this is not always observed in nature due to external factors such as predators parasites and pathogens instead there is a trade off between female host plant preference and larval fitness in many species of butterfly in p c album instead of accepting host plant that female selected first instar larvae leave their hatch site in search of alternative food sources larvae that stay on inferior host are not only smaller but also have lower survival and growth rates egg mass unlike female host plant preference egg mass is not shown to be sex linked instead egg mass is most likely controlled by additive autosomal genes where egg sizes of offspring are intermediate compared to its parents type of host plant chosen during larval stage is not correlated with their offspring s egg mass indicating that egg size is not related to fitness life history thumb egg egg females lay their eggs on a variety of host plants preferring those that minimize larval development time unlike some butterflies who lay their eggs in batches comma females often lay their eggs singly after each egg is laid female scouts out other possible host plants before determining site of her next egg eggs are green when first laid and gradually turn yellow and ultimately grey before hatching 2 which generally takes four to five days although female can allocate more resources into egg production based on nuptial gifts received by mates total number of eggs laid or mass of eggs are altered based on host plant a lack of correlation suggests that neither egg quantity nor egg mass indicate future fitness for offspring larva thumb larva larval period is separated into five distinct stages or instars during first three instars comma larvae have a cryptic appearance to avoid detection while they primarily stay on underside of leaves fourth and fifth instar larvae search for food more actively however beginning of fourth instar also marks development of black white and orange patterns to avoid predation despite its conspicuous appearance larva develops strong spines along its body larvae have a continuous white marking along their backs to mimic bird droppings in its final instar white colouration disappears but spines persist three possibilities describing why spines may develop during later instars are as follows smaller larvae cannot sustain spines larger larvae benefit more from spines as their predators shift from invertebrates to vertebrates or because an effective spine pattern cannot be achieved upon surface area of smaller larvae aside from formation of spines no other defence against predators appears to be present while fourth and fifth instar larvae are rarely preyed upon by same predator removal of spines leads to repeated predation indicating that no chemical defence mechanism exists to deter enemies pupa thumb pupa p c album adults undergo one of two morphs directly developing morph or diapausing delayed development morph for both males and females directly developing adults have a shorter pupal time of around 10 days whereas diapausing adults spend over 11 days pupating additionally pupae whose adult stage would enter directly developing morph had larger pupal weights consistent with notion that lighter morph allocates more resources towards maturation and reproduction adult full grown comma butterflies have a wingspan of about 45 mm or 1 8 inches name comma butterfly derives from small white c shaped marking resembling a comma on underside of its wings commas can exhibit both mimicking and polyphenism a phenomenon where multiple morphs exist in a population due to their orange and dark brown black appearance butterflies resemble fallen leaves when their wings are closed adults can also undergo one of two morphs directly developing morph or diapausing morph during directly developing morph butterflies mature sexually at a rapid rate females undergoing this morph oviposit in summer leading phase to also be referred to as summer morph butterflies portraying summer morph have light coloured undersides diapausing morph also known as spring or winter morph occurs when female enters a reproductive diapause a time when sexual maturity is postponed and hibernates before ovipositing in spring instead during diapausing morph undersides of wings are much darker predators parasites and diseases predators because of their wide distribution around world comma butterflies have a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate predators including blue tits chickens and other birds parasites two main parasites that have been known to affect comma butterflies are a type of stem borer in eupatorium and vanessae p vanessae often oviposit in larvae of butterflies such as p c album and diseases p c album are known to be infected by cytoplasmic virus diseases disease infection usually starts in cytoplasm of midgut and progresses throughout foregut and hindgut as well antipredator adaptations larva first three larval instars are camouflaged dark colours making larvae less vulnerable to detection in fourth instar appearance of larval body is relatively more colourful with white black and orange aposematic patterns a white stripe along its back mimics pattern of bird droppings further displaying protective colouration of species during transition between third and fourth instars larvae also develop strong spines along their backs decreased predation by birds on p c album third instar larvae has been shown compared to other larval stages indicating that spines increase defence however this appears to provide limited protection as some birds were able to consume larvae despite appearance of spikes adult adults also make use of camouflage underside of adult wings mimic patterns of a fallen leaf similarity is further exaggerated by irregular wing edges not resembling a typical butterfly that are characteristic of genus polygonia butterflies can also undergo one of two morphs directly developing summer or diapausing spring winter diapausing morph is triggered when resources are allocated to survival resulting in a less conspicuous darker appearance of adults to avoid predation physiology diapause under cold winter conditions adults can undergo diapause a period of delayed sexual maturation to maximize survival diapause morph is based upon length of day that larvae experienced during development stage of life cycle diapausing morph is more commonly observed in p c album butterflies inhabiting south europe north africa and asia threshold for photoperiod triggering diapause is primarily due to autosomal genes but may also be influenced by sex linked genes and or parental effects females tend to enter a diapause based on a photoperiod that is intermediate to parents and males are more likely to enter diapause than females this indicates that males and females have evolved different optimal lifecycles females profit from larger body size because it is correlated with fecundity whereas male fitness is not related to size thermoregulation although dark appearances such as early instars and diapause morph are commonly seen in species as a means of thermoregulation behaviour of commas makes theory unlikely for this species during first three instars cryptically coloured larvae spend most of their time under leaves limiting their exposure to sun although later instar larvae are more dispersive in search of food resources basking is very rarely observed thus their body temperatures do not elevate dramatically in presence of sunshine decreasing effect that dark exteriors customarily have on biological processes such as metabolism and development rate however p c album larvae are observed basking during two later instars this may be explained by resemblance that later instar larvae have to bird droppings which would limit predation despite increasing exposure to predators thermoregulatory behaviours may have a much more pronounced effect on later instar larvae but do not appear to affect first three larval stages polyphenism comma adults are dimorphic two phases are directly developing morph summer morph and diapausing morph winter spring morph two morphs are determined by autosomal genes which determine which phase adults will undergo based on length of day experienced during larval stage during winter length of day is short and butterfly survival rate is lower to allow adults to survive through cold winter and oviposit during spring adults go through diapausing morph which feature darker wings for greater protective colouration during hibernation when are longer during summertime adults go through directly developing phase with a lighter appearance lighter appearance is attributed to fewer resources allocated to producing a protective appearance and more resources used to assist reproduction interactions with humans climate change climate change has dramatically affected habitat ranges of comma encouraging range expansion and feeding upon a wider variety of host plants in britain comma butterflies have shown greatest shift in habitat and feeding resources altering its preferred host plant from h lupulus to u glabra and u dioica movement of distribution appears to be following a change in climate although not a migrating butterfly species butterflies at edges of range show much higher dispersal tendencies than those living within range population change in 19th century british population of comma crashed comma page at uk butterflies possibly as a result of reduced hop h lupulus farming from about 1930 population recovered and comma is now one of more familiar butterflies in southern england it is also found in scotland and in north wales comma page at butterfly conservation site since 1970s in britain specialist butterflies have decreased in population as their preferred habitat and host plants area becomes smaller on other hand generalist species such as p c album have started to expand their range in particular comma butterflies have expanded along
