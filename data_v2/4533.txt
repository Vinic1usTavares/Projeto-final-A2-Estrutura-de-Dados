rubble efforts shifted to official investigations investigation on march 8 2013 engineering firm norr commissioned by ontario provincial police released results of their forensic engineering investigation to elliot lake inquiry investigation found that collapse was caused by a two stage failure of welding on a connection due to extensive corrosion corrosion was caused by improper waterproofing and placement of a parking lot on roof which allowed water contaminated with road salt which accelerated corrosion to corrode structure oversights and cost cutting during planning stages report states that there were two critical errors made during planning stages firstly parking lot for mall was located on roof of building without there being sound waterproofing and secondly structural inefficiency of hollow core slabs hcs which prevented installation of effective waterproofing later on john kadlec of beta engineering originally planned use of 8 inch hcs which he specified could withstand 120 pounds per square foot a load which exceeded specifications on all 8 inch hcs during bidding process owners were advised by a bidder that specified load could not be handled by hcs without reinforcements from a composite concrete topping however kadlec advised owners that plans called for 8 inch hcs which could withstand load without reinforcement from topping contract was thus awarded to coreslab despite coreslab s design tables indicating that specified project loads were 38 higher than maximum load in 1992 over a decade after mall s construction coreslab retracted claim to be able to support load without use of a composite topping two different waterproofing systems were proposed to owner by harry s peterson co first system called for a rubberized asphalt membrane to be applied over non composite concrete topping while second one called for no membrane and simply controlling leaks with a polyurethane sealant second system reduced initial building costs by 136 000 hsp argued strongly for second option and convinced owner to install second system report called this system intrinsically flawed and leaks were noticed immediately after construction leaking leaks were noticed immediately after installation of topping harry s peterson co attempted many times to fix leaks in 1991 owners contracted trow to investigate chronic leaking and find a solution two options were provided but upon consulting with coreslab it was determined that neither plan could go forward due to hcs not being able to support additional loads these leaks allowed water to seep through topping and access steel frame of building this corroded much of building s frame during mall s three decades in operation corrosion was eventually so severe that weld on a connection failed resulting in collapse inquiry john kadlec a consulting engineer on original construction has testified that he raised concerns at time about sloppy workmanship and inadequate construction materials at site including structural columns that were already crooked steel beams that were already rusting despite being new and ultimately fateful decision to place complex s parking area on roof according to kadlec construction company opted to resolve structural issues not by redoing construction but by anchoring building s back wall to rock outcropping behind it james building s original architect testified that he also strongly objected to rooftop parking but had little choice once algocen made their decision to proceed with that plan architect of algo centre mall was against rooftop parking inquiry told toronto sun march 11 2013 son of mall s owner admitted that company had pressured engineers to remove information on leaks and corrosion from a report and that fictional repair invoices from a shell company empire roofing and restoration were used to mislead mortgage holder royal bank of canada about building s condition elliot lake rapport et compagnie ecran radio canada july 16 2013 speakers at inquiry have also testified that a significant volume of city traffic regularly cut across roof deck as a bypass of traffic lights at corner of hillside drive and ontario avenue resulting in more stress on structure than it had been designed to handle norr report speculated that a heavy vehicle might have contributed to a previously undetected partial failure of support structure a few months prior to final collapse inquiry also found that while perizzolo died almost instantly aylwin may have survived for up to 39 hours after collapse and may have been found alive if husar had not suspended its rescue operations elliot lake fatal mall collapse comes down to human failure report says cbc news october 15 2014 aftermath 250px thumbnail left by
