generally received this episode positively though some like ign robert canning thought it was merely okay he gave it a score of 6 5 out of 10 and amy reiter of los angeles times said she felt vaguely underwhelmed and that episode lacked emotional resonance in contrast a v club emily vanderwerff gave episode a b and called it a marked improvement over season premiere and complimented way it gave nearly all of storylines an emotional core anthony benigno of faster times characterized it as one of tightest best made most well acted and entertaining hours from glee in a very long time and buddytv john kubicek said that it was quintessential glee and that show is once again a magical fabulous unicorn bobby hankinson of houston chronicle was charmed moved and excited for what s to come reappearance of storylines left dangling at end of first season was noted with approval by samantha urban of dallas morning news and vanderwerff who both mentioned not only big one about quinn and puck and baby beth but also artie s love of directing and variously added rachel and shelby and movement on will and emma relationship fact that shelby had been hired to form a second glee club at mckinley however was greeted with derision by both reviewers urban called it mind idiotic and others as well reiter found idea incomprehensible and vanity fair brett berk wrote given will s ongoing struggles to fill his own crooning baker s dozen this is about as realistic a plan as michele bachmann starting a rival chapter of pflag at liberty university vicki hyman of star ledger characterized notion of shelby deciding to give up a burgeoning broadway career because she was missing her daughter grow up to take a part time job in lima as ridiculous and whole scenario as more than a little bizarre effect of shelby s advent on puck evoked most praise benigno called segment where puck meets beth best scene of this very young season hollywood reporter lesley goldberg said it was a top moment and abby west of entertainment weekly dubbed it sweetest scene of night vanderwerff also called it very sweet and expressed hope that show will come up with something for him to do after mostly relegating him to weird comic relief last season effect of her return on quinn was greeted with less enthusiasm reiter was not thrilled by possibility of a custody battle between quinn and shelby and called quinn s plan half baked and canning dismissed it as cliched drama kubicek expressed interest in seeing where this goes and vanderwerff noted that quinn has been grieving giving up her child all this time and she didn t even know it and characterized it as a fairly powerful storyline critics were divided on kurt s storyline as he faced being perceived primarily as gay both when auditioning and when running for class president vanderwerff said it was most consistent storyline and canning called it most familiar story but also described kurt as by far most interesting and most layered character his stories delivering most emotional connections and this episode s installments entertaining territory kubicek stated that there were tons of wonderful kurt moments in episode benigno called kurt learning to embrace his gayness yet again on show kind of awkward and hyman asked was this kurt accepts he s special 3 0 or 4 0 i can t keep track votta summed up kurt s audition quandary kurt is fighting typecasting and while fingerless gloves and climbing routine might have been an attempt to butch it up instead kurt played right into expectations with over top funny girl piece his attempt to rescue situation by via performing a romeo and juliet scene with rachel evoked laughter from three directors and rachel herself but as votta points out kurt was not actually being bad as romeo jayma mays who plays emma one of directors in that scene stated in an interview that she thought kurt was good kurt finding himself in competition with blaine was also touched on but several reviewers were unhappy with revelation that blaine was not a senior like kurt as had been implied in previous season vanderwerff wrote that blaine seems to have simultaneously gotten younger and had a complete personality transplant over summer votta noted continuity bending plot point that he s somehow a junior and not a senior like his boyfriend and urban allowed her exasperation to show oh really glee blaine s a junior blaine s younger than kurt fine fine mtv jim cantiello went into rhyme to express his dismay it s hard to keep my bearings straight and oh how it makes my heart ache kurt and blaine were gonna move to new york together but now they ll have to wait referring to a scene in new york episode where kurt discussed planned move with rachel goldberg was pleased that having brittany volunteer to run kurt s campaign included an acknowledgment that he went through hell previous year and praised brittany logic in general respers france loved that brittany in helping kurt find his magical inner unicorn was able to find her own reiter enjoyed delicious dose of brittany isms which she called best part of episode and kubicek said that there were tons of wonderful brittany moments for hyman one sit up and take notice moment was confrontation between will and quinn where he told her to grow up respers france thought sue sylvester s attempt to use quinn against glee club was hilarious but vanderwerff was unhappy with quinn being into sue s ridiculous run for congress reiter wrote that it was hard to muster much sympathy for quinn in episode given scene with quinn and skanks flushing someone s head in a public toilet threatening to cut them and shaking them down for their lunch money are orders of magnitude more chilling than face full of slushy bullying we re used to seeing music and performances episode s musical performances were well received by most reviewers all three were broadway songs two from west side story and one from funny girl concentration on show tunes disappointed reiter and canning felt they were all too bland but others were happy with selections including hankinson who said he was loving broadway bend to these first two episodes and added all three of tonight s numbers were hands down fantastic duet of somewhere featuring rachel and shelby was generally complimented both benigno and rae votta of billboard compared it favorably to their previous duet lady gaga s poker face from season one benigno gave performance a b while michael slezak of tvline gave it an a and praised their powerful evocative voices rolling stone erica futterman was not impressed and characterized it as lite fm snooze that does nothing to showcase these broadway belters in a new and exciting way amy lee of huffington post called it pretty bland and said it was getting annoying that rachel sings every song as if she s barbra streisand wall street journal raymund flandez however called duet pitch perfect and so sublime it makes you catch your breath kurt s choice of i m greatest star to audition for role of tony one song not from west side story drew comment benigno ascribed it to kurt s ability to make a talented ass of himself while slezak was of opinion that kurt was way too savvy and way too hungry for role for that kind of misstep despite these plot related issues both reviewers gave performance an a and benigno noted both that he nails it and last half of song is a singing clinic vanderwerff was not fond of reliance on gimmicky staging though futterman called it an impressive physical performance votta stated that kurt sounds flawless and performance is captivating and flandez complimented his captivating high notes after high notes and added he s a star unicorn and he knows it lisa respers france of cnn wrote that kurt was amazing singing streisand and for first time i realized that he really is as big a star as rachel blaine s rendition of something s coming was most enthusiastically welcomed it was favorite number of lee vanderwerff and futterman lee said it was best song and added he s kinetic impassioned and generally delightful as blaine playing tony vanderwerff was even more complimentary with by far best performance and futterman called it winning musical number of episode both slezak and benigno gave it a b and former complimented criss s breathless charm and boyish enthusiasm while latter maintained that actor is at his best when he s doing goofy pop numbers with kind of an off beat twist west gave song an a and said blaine just knows how to own stage and your tv screen while both votta and respers france wrote that he was perfect tony chart history one of three cover versions released as singles debuted on billboard hot 100 and none charted on canadian hot 100 or in england or australia duet version of somewhere appeared at number seventy five fourth time song charted in hot 100 by contrast something s coming episode s other song from west side story has never appeared in
