severe tropical cyclone alby was regarded as most devastating tropical cyclone to impact southwestern western australia on record forming out of an area of low pressure on 27 march 1978 alby steadily developed as it tracked southwestward parallel to western australia between 1 and 2 april storm quickly intensified and attained its peak intensity as a category 5 cyclone on australian cyclone intensity scale after turning to southeast storm underwent an extratropical transition as it neared cape leeuwin storm brushed cape on 4 april bringing hurricane force winds before rapidly losing its identity following day in western australia combination of alby s fast movement and hurricane force winds caused widespread damage along coast large swells flooded low lying areas and numerous homes lost their roofs from high winds further inland bushfires were worsened by storm as it brought little rain generally less than along coast these fires burned roughly 114 000 hectares 281 700 acres and destroyed two towns five fatalities are directly attributed to alby while two more resulted from fires resulting damage was extensive with monetary losses reaching a 50 million us 45 million meteorological history severe tropical cyclone alby was first identified on 27 march 1978 as a disorganized area of low pressure situated roughly north northwest of karratha at this time system was characterised as a large cluster of convection converging around low notable development took place over following three days as system drifted towards southwest convection began wrapping around storm forming banding features early on 29 march joint typhoon warning center jtwc classified system as a tropical storm shortly thereafter bureau of meteorology in perth classified it as a tropical cyclone assigning it with name alby gale force winds were later confirmed on 30 march by martha bakke located west northwest of storm s centre by then a large ragged eye developed and alby steadily intensified through 2 april at end of this strengthening cyclone alby attained its peak intensity as a category 5 on australian cyclone intensity scale a barometric pressure of 930 mbar hpa 27 46 inhg was measured at time and peak winds were estimated to be 205 km h 125 mph based on dvorak technique additionally jtwc assessed storm to have attained winds of 215 km h 135 mph a low range category 4 on saffir simpson hurricane scale shortly after reaching this intensity alby slowed as it began turning towards southeast by 3 april storm rapidly accelerated and attained a forward speed of this rapid acceleration was due to cyclone s interaction with a cold front to its south gradually weakening alby also underwent an extratropical transition as storm s structure became asymmetrical around 1300 utc on 4 april storm passed within 100 km 65 mi of cape leeuwin as an extratropical storm due to rapid movement of alby system maintained winds of 120 km h 75 mph as it reached this point making it one of most intense storms to strike region by 5 april cyclone rapidly lost its identity as it became caught up in a northwesterly flow before merging with cold front over great australian bight impact and aftermath retaining winds in excess of 120 km h 75 mph cyclone alby brought damaging winds to much of region in and around cape leeuwin highest winds reached 150 km h 90 mph in albany in perth a peak gust of 130 km h 80 mph was measured third highest in city s history intense winds considered unprecedented for many in region were attributed to fast movement of storm and its location in relation to land moving at speeds up to winds along northeastern edge of storm were increased by that amount due to alby s clockwise rotation it also allowed for winds to cover a large area northeast of centre impacting many areas far from storm in general rainfall was limited and generally less than this was due to fast movement as well as asymmetrical structure with most of thunderstorms south of center thumb right satellite image of remnants of alby near australia on 4 april these winds resulted in widespread agricultural environmental and structural damage hundreds of structures sustained severe damage mostly consisting of roofs blowing off most severe losses took place in albany where most homes had partial or complete roof failure air borne debris also damaged buildings during storm nearly 80 of apple crop was lost in donnybrook manjimup area a total of 154 400 m3 5 4 million ft3 of timber was lost as well as a potential 200 000 m3 7 million ft3 of future growth on established trees widespread dust storms also ruined crops and removed topsoil from many areas near coast combined effects of strong onshore winds and little rain led to significant inland sea spray numerous power lines and stations failed during storm due to winds as well as dust and salt accretion large portions of south west land division were without electricity due to cyclone alby perth nearly sustained a complete breakdown of power services this led to secondary losses attributable to storm such as production failure large expanse of gale force winds without precipitation exacerbated 92 ongoing brush fires in region these fires erupted into full fledged wildfires expanding at a rate of a total of 114 000 hectares 281 700 acres of land was burned throughout western australia as a result of fires within this area more than 10 000 sheep and 500 cattle and horses were killed over 100 structures of fencing and tens of thousands of hay bales were destroyed according to newspaper reports two towns were leveled by wildfires at least 50 individual fires were fanned by storm across region prompting more than 1 000 firefighters to assist in putting them out two fatalities were attributed to these fires along coast large swells produced by storm resulted in two fatalities in albany harbour as well as significant coastal damage tides across region were expected to increase unexpectedly all forecast values were exceeded by at least highest storm tide was in busselton at leading to a storm surge of here surge penetrated roughly inland forcing several evacuations this led to significant coastal flooding that damaged dozens of structures including busselton jetty in bunbury water breached sea wall inundating 100 homes and prompting evacuation of 130 residents throughout western australia cyclone alby was responsible for seven fatalities and a 50 million a 213 million 2011 284 million 2011 usd in damage there was also severe beach erosion associated with storm with some areas losing of land due to extensive damage name alby was retired from list of western australian cyclone names following its usage in wake of cyclone alby an appeal for relief in affected region was made by lord mayor s distress relief fund unprecedented scale of damage prompted meteorologists to vastly improve forecasting in region to be better prepared for a similar storm in future at time little to no warning was given to residents in south west land division this was result of alby s abrupt acceleration along a cold front a complex forecasting situation it was also regarded as a wake up call for region reminding residents that they are not immune to effects of tropical cyclones cyclone alby has been used as a benchmark to compare future storms in region to such as severe tropical cyclone bianca in 2011 see also list of cyclones in western australia list of retired australian cyclone names references notes external links alby 1978 alby alby
