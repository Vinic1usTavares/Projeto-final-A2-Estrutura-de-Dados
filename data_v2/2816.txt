to break up with him because they never fought and everything seemed to be going perfectly smoothly ann explains that their lack of fighting was actually a bad thing because it meant their relationship had no passion and she adds that mark isn t used to dating anyone for a long period of time and over stated relationship s strength for that reason state auditors chris traeger rob lowe

efforts to pick up women two get along and lucy gives tom her phone number to his immense pleasure leslie decides to apologize to ben and he invites her out for a beer as they finally start to get along leslie realizes ben was mayor of a small town called partridge minnesota it was national news because he was only 18 when elected and he promptly drove entire government into ground ben became a state auditor to prove he can be responsible and restart his political career later at parks department budget meeting chris and ben reveal pawnee s budget crisis was far worse than previously thought and that pawnee government will shut down until further notice horrifying leslie and delighting ron production writing master plan was written by parks and recreation co creator michael schur it was his fifth writing credit for series after pilot greg pikitis christmas scandal and galentine s day idea of state auditors visiting pawnee and subsequent government shutdown was inspired by news reports at time of a number of states considering shutting down schools parks and other services due to global recession in particular schur cited stories about kansas city closing down several of their public schools and idaho threatening to shut down state parks department similar measures were being discussed in such states as new york new jersey and california this was in keeping with efforts by parks and recreation writers to be more topical with second season episodes upon learning of spending freeze ron and leslie engage in heated arguments over function of government with leslie insisting government is meant to provide social services and ron advocating as little government intervention as possible throughout most of second season much of relationship between leslie and ron focused on two developing a mutual respect for each other however with introduction of ben wyatt character and conflict over budget problems in pawnee writers included these arguments between leslie and ron to illustrate their conflicting political ideologies and develop tension amid character and city hall setting master plan marked end of romantic relationship between mark and ann which had lasted throughout entire second season this allowed for eventual departure of paul schneider who was leaving series at end of second season title of master plan stemmed from fact that real life municipal planning documents in small american towns are often called master plan like one leslie refers to in episode schur said of this it seems so funny to call municipal budgets and planning documents for a small city in indiana master plan schur said parks and recreation writing staff believed title of episode was appropriate because subplots of master plan revolved around various plans of characters while leslie is dealing with literal master plan for pawnee budget proposal april s plan is to seek a romantic relationship with andy and tom s plan is to find a girlfriend at april s birthday party idea of ann making out with chris traeger was not part of original screenplay but was added after first cast read through of script writing staff felt that while ben was immediately connected to leslie and other characters through his role in eliminating wasteful spending at pawnee chris still needed something to more strongly connect to cast and subplot with ann was determined to be a funny way to do it in one scene after ben explains need for severe budget cuts at pawnee ron asks leslie what s a not gay way to ask him to go camping with me that line was not in first draft of script but was added during filming as a possible alternative line for editors to choose from later staff found it so funny however that they chose to use it and original line was never filmed during another scene at snakehole lounge a drunken leslie angrily yells to ben i just talked to everybody in this bar and nobody wants you here that line was written by harris wittels who wrote past screenplays for other parks and recreation episodes during end credits andy sings a song he wrote for april called november which includes lyrics let s spread our wings and fly on a date this is also a reference to woman of year in which andy explained every song he writes includes either lyrics spread your wings and fly or you deserve to be a champion schur who wrote words to november said it was especially challenging working one of those phrases into a love song casting master plan marked first appearance of adam scott who also appeared in subsequent season finale freddy spaghetti and became a regular cast member during third season scott left starz comedy party down to join parks and recreation cast a decision he made in part because it was unclear whether starz would renew series it was a matter of me asking starz if it was going to continue and them saying they weren t ready to make that decision i couldn t pass up opportunity on parks and rec for a show that could possibly not exist anymore schur said when ben wyatt character was written scott was envisioned as dream scenario for casting schur described scott as brilliant and funny and praised his comedic range there just aren t that many people with a comedic range that spans step brothers to party down several commentators said ben wyatt closely resembles character scott played on party down henry pollard while ben was a politician who found great success at a young age then suffered a downfall henry was an actor who became a caterer after his acting career declined scott however said he feels they are vastly different characters and circumstances idea of a character trying to rebuild a government career following a humiliating public failure was one of original ideas for series of parks and recreation in general but one that was ultimately not used until ben wyatt character was introduced during scene when ben explains his failed mayoral tenure shots of a newspaper clip with images of character s prom pictures are shown those pictures are actual high school prom photos of actor adam scott episode also featured first in a string of guest appearances by actor rob lowe who had recently departed from abc drama series brothers sisters as a joke rob lowe s credit during opening credits reads and introducing rob lowe unlike scott lowe was originally not expected to join regular cast but rather make guest appearances in freddy spaghetti and six third season episodes before departing show however after those episodes were filmed lowe later joined show as a regular cast member lowe said he loved playing part which he described as a big fat nerd and most positive person in world with unrelenting enthusiasm adding he is also very very intense and specific so whether he s ordering how he would like his water or describing kind of colors he wants on a graph everything means world to him throughout episode whenever he meets someone new chris traeger points directly at their face and slowly repeats their name schur said this habit was first element writers conceived for character in one line of episode while describing his exercise regimen and supplements scientists believe that first human being who will live 150 years has already been born i believe i am that human being that line was inspired by schur s wife j j philbin who had recently read an article about that scientific prediction and felt it applied to character parks and recreation was suffering in nielsen ratings when master plan aired and it was hoped lowe s appearance would help increase viewership lowe s performance was heavily publicized in advance of episode s original broadcast thumb upright 1 05 right alt a brown haired woman wearing a gray hat and blue tank top shirt leans her face into her left hand master plan marked first of several performances by natalie morales as lucy romantic interest for tom haverford master plan featured several other guest appearances ben schwartz returned to his recurring role as tom s fast talking friend jean ralphio natalie morales best known for her role in abc family science fiction dramedy middleman made her first parks and recreation appearance in episode as lucy a pawnee bartender and romantic interest for tom scene between lucy and tom at snakehole lounge was same scene natalie morales read during her audition for part although dialogue was rewritten slightly before filming line with lucy asking tom if he flirted with so many women because he was expected to have a 43 way was added during rewrite ralph richeson best known for playing unkempt hotel employee richardson in hbo drama series deadwood briefly appeared as an unkempt man seeking a marriage license in pawnee town hall richeson is credited as ghoulish man in episode s end credits april marie eden who played beauty contest winner trish in episode beauty pageant reprised that role in master plan in scenes where tom flirted with her relentlessly at snakehole lounge alison becker who played local reporter shauna malwae tweep in several past episodes filmed several scenes where she and andy flirt but he ultimately rejects her due to his feelings for april all of these scenes were cut from final episode due to length restrictions which schur said he regretted because he found becker very funny filming master plan was directed by dean holland his third directorial credit after greg pikitis and sweetums script read through and filming took place in march 2010 rob lowe s first day of filming took place on his birthday march 17 which was same day scene where he kissed rashida jones was shot original cut of master plan was a full 30 minutes and had to be cut down to 22 minutes for broadcast staff of parks and recreation had difficulty editing episode down because script involved so many interconnected subplots between characters screenwriter harris wittels said as soon as you d cut one thing you had to cut something else because it was tied to another piece among scenes cut were an extended cold open in which ron gives april a handgun for her 21st birthday much to chagrin of leslie also cut was a scene in which ron chastises leslie for yelling at ben at snakehole lounge and orders her to apologize to him so she will not be fired instead episode was changed to reflect that leslie decided to apologize to ben herself with line from leslie i have to go swallow my pride added just before she spoke to ben during one scene ann and mark have a discussion at j j s diner a pawnee restaurant that had previously been featured in episodes reporter and summer catalog in all three episodes a different interior set is used although exterior building shots are same at snakehole lounge tom flirts with a woman by giving her a bottle cap to remember him by then later unsuccessfully tries to find her again in nightclub this was not part of script and was conceived and added to episode about 10 minutes before scene was shot during one of final scenes when ben informs leslie and ron that pawnee government will be shut down ron looks directly at camera and makes a comical grin although leslie is supposed to be horrified by news scene had to be re shot many times because she kept laughing at ron s facial expression cultural references andy says of jean ralphio that ralph macchio guy s a total douche this is a reference to ralph macchio an actor who appeared in 1983 drama film outsiders which also starred rob lowe line was improvised by actor chris pratt in another scene ben tells leslie song he played after getting sworn in as an 18 year old mayor was there it is a 1993 hip hop song by duo tag team episode features several quotes from author and outdoorsman jack london among them which leslie reads from her master plan proposal is you can t wait for inspiration you have to go after it with a club and so i say function of man is to live not to exist i would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry rot original script included about one dozen different london quotes but most were cut from final draft schur said he used london quotes because he believed author was one both leslie and ron would admire at one point in episode while discussing april s birthday leslie says damn wheel of world why must it continually turn over to which ron replied approvingly jack london line was improvised by actor nick offerman reception in its original american broadcast master plan was seen by an estimated 4 28 million household viewers according to nielsen media research it marked a five percent increase in viewership compared to previous episode telethon and was only nbc series on may 13 to show an improvement in ratings over previous week comedies office community 30 rock and marriage ref all saw declines hitfix writer daniel fienberg did not believe rob lowe s guest appearance significantly helped parks and recreation ratings calling increase a statistically irrelevant bump master plan received a 2 7 rating 5 share among overall viewers and a 2 0 rating 6 share among viewers between ages 18 and 49 parks and recreation ranked third in its timeslot behind cbs reality series survivor heroes vs villains and fox crime drama bones but received higher ratings than abc science fiction drama flashforward and first season finale of cw network supernatural fantasy series vampire diaries master plan received generally positive reviews matt fowler of ign said budget problems created strong character development potential for leslie and comedic opportunities for ron fowler also enjoyed that normally dissolute tom formed an authentic romantic connection and said chris pratt brought a certain naturalness to a role that could otherwise have been overly idiotic emily vanderwerff of a v club strongly praised episode praising rob lowe and entire regular cast she declared parks and recreation best television show since arrested development and said as much as i like 50 jokes a minute style of comedies i m a sucker for a show where characters are as well wrought and as purely funny as they are on this show hitfix writer alan sepinwall praised implementation of new characters particularly fact that script did not rely too heavily on them sepinwall also said episode balanced well workplace humor with romantic subplots between leslie and ben april and andy and ann and chris new york daily news writer david hinckley said lowe and scott were strong additions to show and that scott s character in parks was better than his character in party down hinckley said humor remains happily rooted in show s eccentric characters although he said some of jokes like andy s november song sometimes feels like a series of short sketches instead of a show new york magazine writer steve kandell described lowe as entertaining but one note but said adam scott was much more promising and nuanced with better potential for a romantic interest for leslie than previous guest stars like will arnett and justin theroux kandell felt schneider s imminent departure from series seemed unceremonious and praised nick offerman s reactions of unbridled ecstasy at idea of cutbacks and government shutdown eric hochberger of tv fanatic expressed doubt about long term effectiveness of lowe s character and said april and andy subplot felt dragged out for yet another week however he praised script addition of scott and performance of entire cast especially rashida jones and aziz ansari hochberger said i m not convinced parks and recreation could have a bad episode at this point in season tv squad writer kona gallagher felt master plan was an especially important episode due to addition of lowe and scott characters beginning of mark s exit from series and economic problems for pawnee however gallagher also said episode felt mostly like a preparation for third season dvd release after master plan aired a producer s cut of episode was featured on official nbc website it included eight extra minutes which consisted of deleted scenes an extended ending and additional footage with lowe and scott this version of episode along with 22 minute television version and other
