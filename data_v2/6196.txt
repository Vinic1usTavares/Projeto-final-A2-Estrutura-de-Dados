macbeth medieval gaelic mac bethad mac findlaich modern gaelic mac nicknamed red king william forbes skene chronicles p 102 15 august 1057 was king of scots from 1040 until his death he ruled over only a portion of present day scotland little is known about macbeth s early life although he was son of findlaech of moray and may have been a grandson of malcolm ii he became mormaer of moray a semi autonomous lordship in 1032 and was probably responsible for death of previous mormaer gille coemgain he subsequently married gille coemgain s widow gruoch although they had no children together in 1040 duncan i launched an attack into moray and was killed in action by macbeth s troops macbeth succeeded him as king of alba apparently with little opposition his 17 year reign was mostly peaceful although in 1054 he was faced with an english invasion led by siward earl of northumbria on behalf of edward confessor macbeth was killed at battle of lumphanan in 1057 by forces loyal to future malcolm iii he was buried on iona traditional resting place of scottish kings macbeth was initially succeeded by his stepson lulach but lulach ruled for only a few months before also being killed by malcolm iii whose descendants would rule scotland until late 13th century macbeth is today best known as main character of william shakespeare s tragedy macbeth and many works it has inspired however shakespeare s macbeth is based on holinshed s chronicles published in 1577 and is not historically accurate name macbeth s full name in medieval gaelic was this is realised as in modern gaelic and anglicised as macbeth also spelled findlay findley or finley name mac bethad from which anglicised macbeth is derived means son of life although it has appearance of a gaelic patronymic it does not have any meaning of filiation but instead carries an implication of righteous man or religious man an alternative proposed derivation is that it is a corruption of macc bethad meaning one of elect royal ancestry some sources make macbeth a grandson of king malcolm ii and thus a cousin to duncan i whom he succeeded he was possibly also a cousin to thorfinn mighty earl of orkney and caithness nigel tranter in his novel macbeth king went so far as to portray macbeth as thorfinn s half brother however this is speculation arising from lack of historical certainty regarding number of daughters malcolm had mormaer and dux when cnut great came north in 1031 to accept submission of king malcolm ii macbeth too submitted to him some have seen this as a sign of macbeth s power others have seen his presence together with iehmarc who may be echmarcach mac ragnaill as proof that malcolm ii was overlord of moray and of kingdom of isles compare duncan kingship of scots pp 29 30 with hudson prophecy of berchan pp 222 223 whatever true state of affairs in early 1030s it seems more probable that macbeth was subject to king of alba malcolm ii who died at glamis on 25 november 1034 prophecy of berchan apparently alone in near contemporary sources says malcolm died a violent death calling it a without actually naming his killers hudson prophecy of berchan p 223 duncan kingship of scots p 33 tigernach s chronicle says only malcolm ii s grandson duncan donnchad mac crinain later king duncan i was acclaimed as king of alba on 30 november 1034 apparently without opposition duncan appears to have been tanaise rig king in waiting so that far from being an abandonment of tanistry as has sometimes been argued his kingship was a vindication of practice previous successions had involved strife between various men of royal blood duncan i as tanaise rig chosen heir see duncan kingship of scots pp 33 35 hudson prophecy of berchan pp 223 224 where it is accepted that duncan was king of strathclyde for tanistry etc in ireland see o croinin early medieval ireland 63 71 byrne irish kings and high kings pp 35 39 offers a different perspective far from being aged king duncan of shakespeare s play real king duncan was a young man in 1034 and even at his death in 1040 his youthfulness is remarked upon annals of tigernach 1040 1 duncan s early reign was apparently uneventful his later reign in line with his description as man of many sorrows in prophecy of berchan was not successful in 1039 strathclyde was attacked by northumbrians and a retaliatory raid led by duncan against durham turned into a disaster duncan survived defeat but following year he led an army north into moray macbeth s domain apparently on a punitive expedition against moray g w s barrow kingship

is from marianus scotus and killing is recorded by annals of tigernach hudson prophecy of berchan pp 223 224 duncan kingship of scots pp 33 34 high king of alba on duncan s death macbeth became king no resistance is known at that time but it would have been entirely normal if his reign were not universally accepted in 1045 duncan s father crinan of dunkeld a scion of scottish branch of cenel conaill and hereditary abbot of iona was killed in a battle between two scottish armies annals of tigernach 1045 10 annals of ulster 1045 6 john of fordun wrote that duncan s wife fled scotland taking her children including future kings malcolm iii mael coluim mac donnchada and donald iii domnall ban mac donnchada or donalbane with her on basis of author s beliefs as to whom duncan married various places of exile northumbria and orkney among them have been proposed however e william robertson proposes safest place for duncan s widow and her children would be with her or duncan s kin and supporters in atholl robertson scotland under her early kings p 122 hudson prophecy of berchan p 224 refers to earl siward as malcolm iii s patron duncan kingship of scots pp 40 42 favours orkney woolf offers no opinion northumbria is evidently a misapprehension further than that cannot be said with certainty after defeat of crinan macbeth was evidently unchallenged marianus scotus tells how king made a pilgrimage to rome in 1050 where marianus says he gave money to poor as if it were seed karl hundason orkneyinga saga says that a dispute between thorfinn sigurdsson earl of orkney and karl hundason began when karl hundason became king of scots and claimed caithness identity of karl hundason unknown to scots and irish sources has long been a matter of dispute and it is far from clear that matter is settled most common assumption is that karl hundason was an insulting byname old norse for churl son of a dog given to macbeth by his enemies however macbeth s father may be called jarl hundi in njal s saga crawford p 72 william forbes skene s suggestion that he was duncan i of scotland has been revived in recent years lastly idea that whole affair is a poetic invention has been raised anderson essh p 576 note 7 refers to account as a fabulous story and concludes that n o solution to riddle seems to be justified according to orkneyinga saga in war which followed thorfinn defeated karl in a sea battle off deerness at east end of orkney mainland then karl s nephew mutatan or muddan appointed to rule caithness for him was killed at thurso by thorkel fosterer finally a great battle at tarbat ness on south side of dornoch firth ended with karl defeated and fugitive or dead thorfinn saga says then marched south through scotland as far as fife burning and plundering as he passed a later note in saga claims that thorfinn won nine scottish earldoms orkneyinga saga cc 20 32 whoever karl hundason may have been it appears that saga is reporting a local conflict with a scots ruler of moray or ross final years in 1052 macbeth was involved indirectly in strife in kingdom of england between godwin earl of wessex and edward confessor when he received a number of norman exiles from england in his court perhaps becoming first king of scots to introduce feudalism to scotland in 1054 edward s earl of northumbria siward led a very large invasion of scotland duncan s widow and malcolm s mother was northumbrian born it is probable but not proven that there was a family tie between siward and malcolm campaign led to a bloody battle in which annals of ulster reported 3 000 scots and 1 500 english dead which can be taken as meaning very many on both sides and one of siward s sons and a son in law were among dead result of invasion was that one mael coluim son of king of cumbrians not to be confused with mael coluim mac donnchada future malcolm iii of scotland was restored to his throne i e as ruler of kingdom of strathclyde florence of

remarks on macbeth as a tyrant duan which survives in a form dating to reign of malcolm iii calls him mac bethad renowned prophecy of berchan a verse history which purports to be a prophecy describes him as generous king of fortriu and says life to legend thumb macbeth and banquo encounter witches illustration from holinshed s chronicles 1577 macbeth s life like that of king duncan i had progressed far towards legend by end of 14th century when john of fordun and andrew of wyntoun wrote their histories hector boece walter bower and george buchanan all contributed to legend william shakespeare s depiction and its influence thumb left 150px macbeth and witches by henry fuseli johann heinrich 1741 1825 in shakespeare s play which is based mainly upon raphael holinshed s account macbeth is initially a valorous and loyal general to elderly king duncan after being flattered by three witches and his own wife macbeth rationalizes that murdering his king and usurping throne is right thing to do ultimately however prophecies of witches prove misleading and macbeth alienates nobility of scotland and is defeated in battle by prince malcolm as king s armies disintegrate he encounters macduff a refugee nobleman whose wife and children had earlier been murdered by macbeth s death squads upon realizing that he will die if he duels macduff macbeth at first refuses to do so but when macduff explains that if macbeth surrenders he will be subjected to ridicule by his former subjects macbeth vows i will not yield to kiss ground before young malcolm s feet to be baited by a rabble s curse he chooses instead to fight macduff to death macbeth is then slain and beheaded and play ends with prince malcolm planning his coronation at scone likely reason for shakespeare s unflattering depiction of macbeth is that king james vi and i was descended from malcolm iii via house of bruce and his own house of stewart whereas macbeth s line died out with death of lulach six months after his step father king james was also thought to be a descendant of banquo through walter stewart 6th high steward of scotland thumb macbeth at fort of macduff in a 1959 essay boris pasternak compared shakespeare s macbeth to raskolnikov protagonist of crime and punishment by fyodor dostoevsky pasternak explained that neither character begins as a murderer but becomes one by a set of faulty and a belief that he is above law lady macbeth has gained fame along way in his 1865 novel lady macbeth of mtsensk district nikolai leskov updated tragedy of macbeth so that it takes place among imperial russian merchant class in an ironic twist however leskov reverses gender roles woman is murderer and man is instigator leskov s novel was basis for dmitri shostakovich s 1936 opera of same name other depictions in modern times dorothy dunnett s novel king hereafter aims to portray a historical macbeth but proposes that macbeth and his rival and sometime ally thorfinn of orkney are one and same thorfinn is his birth name and macbeth his baptismal name john cargill thompson s play macbeth speaks 1997 a reworking of his earlier macbeth speaks is a monologue delivered by historical macbeth aware of what shakespeare and posterity have done to him scottish author nigel tranter based one of his historical novels macbeth king on historical figure david greig s 2010 play dunsinane takes macbeth s downfall at dunsinane as its starting point with his just ended reign portrayed as long and stable in contrast to malcolm s british touring shakespeare also produced in 2010
