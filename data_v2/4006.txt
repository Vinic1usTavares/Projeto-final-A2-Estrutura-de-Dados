history is acknowledged by a mention of his name in polish national anthem czarniecki made significant contributions fighting khmelnytsky uprising during russo polish war and polish swedish war deluge his use of guerrilla warfare against swedes is credited as one of main reasons for eventual polish victory in this war biography early career stefan czarniecki was born in 1599 on family estate of czarnca near wloszczowa in southern poland into szlachta nobility czarniecki family date of his birth is only an assumption as no documents exist to prove it without a doubt most historians as noted by historians leszek podhorodecki and adam kersten accept 1599 date although historian zdzislaw spieralski argued for 1604 his father krzysztof czarniecki was a soldier who participated in several wars in late 16th and early 17th century and eventually became a courtier to polish queen constance of austria whereas historian miroslaw nagielski notes that czarniecki family was not well off which limited some of stefan s life chances podhorecki points out that they owned several villages and even a small town and family wealth was not small however stefan had ten siblings he himself was sixth out of nine brothers and divided into that many parts family resources would be stretched rather thinly however involvement with queen s court allowed krzysztof to boost his sons careers with his court influence where they were often able to serve as young courtiers themselves nothing is known about stefan s childhood his family could not afford to send him to a university abroad only one of his brothers would do so therefore he embarked on a military career at an early age before that he attended a jesuit college either in krakow or sandomierz achieving a solid secondary education after

any means necessary including mistreatment of civilians to achieve victory next time he took arms was in 1623 when his brother pawel received a nomination as a rotmistrz of light cossack cavalry of regular army and recruited some of his siblings including stefan into his unit they served under hetman stanislaw koniecpolski in campaigns against tatars in 1624 participating in battle of in 1625

raiding enemy territory in 1627 stefan serving in his brother s choragiew was promoted to chorazy on 6 7 august that year he participated in battle of tczew where gustavus adolphus was nearly killed during those years he learned much from observing a master of military arts hetman koniecpolski who often commanded polish army in which he served and from poland s swedish opponents and earlier from cossacks and tatars they fought as polish swedish war ended in 1630 czarniecki enlisted in habsburg forces and continued to fight against swedes participating in battle of breitenfeld in 1633 he

achievements in that war in which he advanced to a porucznik rank in light cossack cavalry unit under hetman marcin kazanowski he received some land in smolensk voivodeship near after that war he moved to a more prestigious hussar unit rota and likely due to a reduction of royal army he served in private formation of wladyslaw and later voivode stanislaw lubomirski in 1635 he might have served as a military adviser to john ii casimir vasa and possibly accompanied king to vienna in 1637 he married zofia and later that year he fought in uprising against rebellious cossacks under pavel mikhnovych participating in battle of kumejki he led a cavalry charge at kumejki which was instrumental in polish victory there earlier that year he served as a military delegate to sejm parliament in

koniecpolski he took part in battle of where commonwealth forces dealt a crushing defeat to bey s tatars he served as one of seven in koniecpolski s army and once again his cavalry unit charge proved to be a decisive moment of battle bringing him much fame that year he also became a regimentarz in his own light cavalry unit but he still held rank of a porucznik of hussars he took an active part in battles against cossacks in khmelnytsky uprising on 16 may 1648 he was one of many noble polish prisoners who fell into hands of bohdan khmelnytsky at battle of but he was quickly ransomed he

massacre of polish prisoners in aftermath of battle of batoh this scene made him reject notions that a compromise with enemies of commonwealth was a likely or desired outcome podhorodecki however notes that another historian wojciech jacek questions czarniecki s presence there and concludes that we have no conclusive proof whether czarniecki was present at batoh massacre further escalated hostilities and surrounding hatred illustrating that is a letter wrote soon after battle in which he promised that if enough military forces are gathered and given to him he will leave few ruthenians alive later that year czarniecki received territories from king along with office of crown in 1653 he led a unit to ukraine ransacking much of cossack held lands although attrition among troops was high during that campaign czarniecki was wounded at he continued his suppression campaign in 1654 and following january took part in battle of okhmativ in may 1655 he was called from ukraine to warsaw as king john casimir vasa respected his experience and requested his presence at a new war council convened to discuss looming thread of war with sweden at that time his reputation was significant sejm often passed resolutions applauding him for his efforts to reclaim ukraine and he was even held in much consideration by ottomans then temporarily allied with commonwealth on 14 may 1655 he received office of castellan of kiev a position that made him a member of senate of poland swedish deluge thumb 225px right czarniecki near plock painting by juliusz kossak when charles x of sweden invaded poland in 1655 czarniecki distinguished himself by his defence of krakow which he eventually surrendered on good terms retreating with his army he remained loyal to polish king even when much of army including most of senators and hetmans temporarily joined swedes his vocal support for wavering king which at that time found refuge abroad and was considering abdication was instrumental for his continuing support polish king rewarded him with more lands and office of royal army regimentarz he led guerrilla warfare against swedish troops of charles x a type of a campaign he authored despite objections of hetmans who by that time returned to serve under john vasa mobile swedish forces even with their significant firepower proved to be rather vulnerable to czarniecki s guerrilla style warfare czarniecki was defeated at battle of golab in mid february 1656 but later inflicted serious defeats upon swedes notably at battle of warka in april that year tide of war turned several times that year and he was again defeated at battle of and battle of his defeats however were limited and in most cases he was able to retreat with most of his army in good order under his direction popular rising against swedish troops in greater poland proved highly successful it was against his advice that battle of warsaw was fought and his subsequent strategy neutralized ill effects of this defeat despite support from king czarniecki was seen by many older established noble family as an arrogant newcomer and they prevented him from getting hetman office that year instead early next year he received office of voivode of ruthenia and an extraordinary title of general and vice commander of royal forces which put him in a position of an unofficial hetman like authority field crown went to jerzy sebastian lubomirski also an accomplished commander if not so much as czarniecki but from a magnate lubomirski family czarniecki commented famously that not of salt or fields i am but from what hurts me alluding to fact that family built its fortune on salt trade and agriculture whereas his smaller one was built through military service yet it was money and politics not military experience that decided who was to get hetman s office final battles in 1657 he was instrumental in defeating forces of george ii rakoczi at battle of in 1658 and 1659 he aided danes during danish

polonka battle of basia and battle of this campaign however marked zenith of his popularity king john ii casimir vasa attempted to involve him in unpopular plan of vivente rege to bypass traditions of royal elections in poland and instead chose next successor to polish throne john ii casimir favored louis grand conde still during life of previous king his reputation among unpaid and dissenting military took a dive and many criticized him for appropriating entire ransom that russians paid for their prisoners from polonka during sejm of 1662 some military representatives demanded sanctions and punishments to be levied on him his last campaign took place at end of 1664 he led an army against russians but siege of was not successful and a new cossack uprising of ivan forced polish troops to fall back on 22 july 1664 he received office of voivode of kiev and on 2 january 1665 he was appointed field crown hetman before receiving news of nomination he desired for years he was wounded at

deluge although he was even more successful in his battles against russians his career rising from a simple noble family to rank of a hetman and a wealthy magnate was unprecedented in commonwealth s history his legend had begun growing even during his lifetime as he became a hero of poems and songs few negative rumors about him popular in last few years of his life survived after his death during period of enlightenment in poland he was written about by poets and writers such as stanislaw potocki franciszek karpinski julian ursyn niemcewicz and franciszek ksawery dmowski a biography by michal krajewski cemented his legend of a hero rescuing poland from anarchy and invasion that legend that became even stronger during times of partitions of poland in 19th century where artists of polish romanticism period used him as a symbol of patriotism and a reminder of military successes he appears in poem of zygmunt krasinski but much more significant was his portrayal in trilogy of henryk sienkiewicz particularly second book deluge it was during that time that his pursuit of retreating swedes to pomerania and denmark 1658 1659 particularly his crossing with his entire army to danish isle of alsen was commemorated in song of polish napoleonic legions that would eventually become polish national anthem dabrowski s mazurka with words commemorating his marine excursion to island of als it was only during time of second polish republic when more modern serious historical work begun analyzing his history that a less hagiographic account begun emerging wladyslaw czaplinski wrote that czarniecki was first and foremost a soldier and noted his faults such as brutality and greed modern historiography of czarniecki includes works of czaplinski stanislaw herbst adam kersten and zdzislaw spieralski however podhorecki notes that while he has been a major figure in polish history and is discussed extensively in polish historiography he has never been a subject of much interest
