french sudan was a french colonial territory in federation of french west africa from around 1880 until 1960 when it became independent state of mali colony was formally called french sudan from 1890 until 1899 and then again from 1921 until 1958 and had a variety of different names over course of its existence colony was initially established largely as a military project led by french troops but in mid 1890s it came under civilian administration a number of administrative reorganizations in early 1900s brought increasing french administration over issues like agriculture religion and slavery following world war ii african democratic rally rda under modibo keita became most significant political force pushing for independence french sudan initially retained close connections with france and joined in a short lived federation with senegal in 1959 but ties to both countries quickly weakened in 1960 french sudan formally became republic of mali and began to distance itself further from senegal and france colonial establishment thumbnail left wealth of mali empire here mansa musa is depicted holding a gold nugget from 1375 catalan atlas which led french to pursue colonization of area french sudan originally formed as a set of military outposts as an extension of french colony in senegal though area offered france little economic or strategic gain military effectively advocated greater conquest in region this was partly due to a fascination with great empires such as mali empire and empire that rose to prominence in area and partly due to promotional opportunities that military conquest offered for french military personnel french conquest began in 1879 when joseph gallieni was dispatched to area to establish a fort and survey land for a railroad from dakar in senegal to niger river this was followed with establishment of a number of french forts and political alliances with specific leaders in region in early 1880s administrative structure of area was still largely under control of french governor of senegal and most significant colonization were simply military forts and outposts including important one established at kayes in 1881 by gustave desbordes though civilian administration of french governor of senegal formally ruled area military officers in region largely bypassed these leaders and answered directly to commanding officers in paris desbordes gradually took over more territory often using inter ethnic rivalries and political tension among leaders in area to appoint french supportive leaders french civilian administrators struggled with military leaders and two forces went through a number of leadership changes over territory until louis archinard was appointed military governor in 1892 archinard led military campaigns against ture tall and other resistant leaders in region with varying success archinard s campaigns were often executed through direct military control without civilian oversight as costs increased french administration decided to replace archinard s control over area with a civilian governor louis albert administration and jurisdiction names of into two administrative districts middle niger and upper and senegal and as mali federation june september republic of mali after 22 september thumb map of french colonies in west africa in 1889 region was governed under a number of different names between 1880 and 1960 area was upper river from 1880 until 18 august 1890 when it was renamed french sudan with its capital at kayes on 10 october 1899 french sudan was divided with southern cercles joining coastal colonies and rest split into two administrative areas called middle niger and upper senegal in 1902 region again was organized as a unified colony under name senegambia and niger et niger name changed again in 1904 to upper senegal and niger haut senegal et niger finally in 1921 name changed back to french sudan soudan francais borders and administration of colony similarly changed a number of times originally and for initial period colony vacillated between military administration and civilian administration from senegal in 1893 french sudan formally came under civilian administration which lasted until 1899 at that point a reorganization of colony split 11 southern provinces to other french colonies like french guinea ivory coast and dahomey area that was not reorganized was governed in two administrations linked to other french colonies following this territory of colony was reestablished in 1902 though borders shifted slightly there was little territorial change until 1933 at that point colony of french upper volta haute volta modern burkina faso dissolved and northern territory was added to french sudan in 1947 upper volta was reestablished and french sudan borders became those that eventually became borders of mali kayes was original capital city from 1890s until 1908 when capital moved to bamako where it remains agriculture colony supported mostly rain fed agriculture with limited irrigation for its first 30 years only cash crops were nuts gathered close to railroad between kayes and bamako however following successful tests of growing egyptian cotton in west africa during world war i emile began to campaign for construction of a large irrigation system along niger river starting in 1921 significant irrigation projects around and later at camp and cercle began to bring water french believed this project could rival major cotton growing centers of egypt and united states unlike other agricultural projects in french west africa french sudan irrigation project initially relied on families voluntarily resettling along lines established by colonial authority unable to attract enough volunteers colonial authorities began to try forced resettlement to cotton project office du niger was founded in 1926 as main organization facilitating planned irrigated agricultural projects farmers resisted forced resettlement and petitioned for permanent land rights to irrigated land which was usually held as property of office du niger despite these efforts a significant cash crop economy did not develop in french sudan religious policy like much of rest of french west africa colony had a number of policies regarding islam and muslim communities arabic language and islamic law were preferred in colony by french in establishment of colonial government largely because both were codified and thus easy to standardize though they maintained a formal neutrality policy in regards to religion french colonial administration began to regulate islamic education in early 1900s in addition fear of a pan islamism political rise throughout north africa and sahel led french to adopt policies that aimed to prevent spread of islam beyond where it already existed and to prevent muslim leaders from governing non muslim communities indigenous religions and christianity existed under less formal policies and french efforts often used these to balance spread of islam in region in 1940s a religious movement called allah koura began in san cercle based upon visions of a single person local administrators allowed allah koura movement to spread and practice seeing it as a potential limiting influence on spread of islam farther south in late 1950s muslim protests and riots throughout colony further contributed to a growing independence movement slavery policy like much of rest of french west africa authorities enforced explicit rules in an attempt to end slavery in region in 1903 government instructed french administrators to not use slave as an administrative category anymore this was followed in 1905 by a formal french decree that ended slavery throughout french west africa almost a million slaves in french west africa responded to this by moving away from their masters and settling elsewhere french supported these efforts by creating settlements around niger river and digging wells for communities elsewhere so they could farm away from their former masters this process affected southern and western parts of present day mali most significantly but in northern and eastern parts of colony large numbers of slaves remained in servitude to their masters according to rough estimates throughout area of present day mali about one third of former slaves moved away from slavery relationship while two thirds remained with their masters in 1920s most tuareg households still had slaves who tended to house and animals though slavery persisted some aspects of relationship changed with french administration escaped slaves could find official protection by french authorities in cities for a limited time slaves could sometimes renegotiate terms of their servitude in changed political situation some were willing to agree to remain in servitude if they received control over their family life and some land to pass to their children in addition french administration actively worked to end slave raiding and most clear manifestations of slave trade greatly reducing those means of acquiring slaves however for many decades after 1905 abolition of slavery practice continued in much of french sudan independence thumbnail printed textiles commemorating modibo keita first president of mali who led french sudan to independence following passage of loi cadre by french national assembly in 1956 many of colonies in french west african began to hold elections to increase self determination of their territories in first elections held in french sudan in 1957 african democratic rally rassemblement democratique africain commonly known as rda won elections in french sudan as well as winning majorities in neighboring ivory coast french guinea and upper volta following french constitutional referendum of 1958 of which received an overwhelming majority in support republique declared itself a republic with internal autonomy on 24 november 1958 sudanese republic as area was now called was second colony after madagascar to join french community which provided it internal autonomy while linking its currency foreign policy and defense with france in early january 1959 there were plans for a federation linking sudanese republic with senegal dahomey and upper volta in a federation of autonomous states by april however neither dahomey s nor upper volta s legislatures had ratified federation and so mali federation was formed with only sudanese republic and senegal in 1959 modibo keita s rda party won all 70 seats in legislative elections in sudanese republic and joined forces with dominant party in senegal headed by leopold sedar senghor federation achieved independence on 20 june 1960 within french community however divisions between senghor and keita on governance of federation resulted in its dissolution on 20 august 1960 area of french sudan formally proclaimed itself republic of mali and with increasing radicalization of keita
