lived in november deller called storyline between sunny zeke and robin ludicrous and she was placed at number one of soap characters we love to hate list deller cited her continued presence in general as another reason for her being there during a feature on best and worst soap characters of decade sunny was placed at number eight on worst soap characters list deller stated neighbours doesn t have a great reputation for ethnic diversity and when they finally decide to introduce a non white main character for first time in years they have to make her most wooden annoying drippy character since ned let s hope sunny s failure isn t an excuse for avoiding ethnic minority casting in future jaci stephen from british newspaper daily mail was also negative towards character calling her dreadful and awful stephen also expressed her desire for character s departure from show and asked when are they going to dispense with this hopeless character during storyline involving robin and sunny
