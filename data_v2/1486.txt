world peace he had not attained victory in his two wars at same time book largely supports surge strategy and lauds president for adopting it book describes bush as largely leaving management of war to generals george casey and john and deferring to their judgment based on bush s perception of lyndon johnson s micromanagement during vietnam war as generals strategy of drawing down u s forces and transferring control to iraqis begins to fail book argues bush grows more disillusioned and sought other ideas book alleges that nevertheless president delayed serious investigation because of his

its reporting as wonderfully illuminating final days by jill abramson new york times published september 26 2008 its review concluded woodward s own judgment of war and of bush doesn t really matter in course of four books he has given readers conversations and documents we need to reach our own judgments he has also however unevenly and imperfectly supplied enough synthesis and analysis to make that judgment genuinely informed sure these books can be a slog but they stand as fullest story yet of bush presidency and of war that is likely to be its most important legacy new york sun gave a critical review stating that mr woodward so drowns reader in clutter that few arguments except obvious emerge as well new republic alleged that figures in book were portrayed better if they had talked
