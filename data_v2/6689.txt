subarachnoid hemorrhage sah is bleeding into subarachnoid space area between arachnoid membrane and pia mater surrounding brain symptoms may include a severe headache of rapid onset vomiting decreased level of consciousness fever and sometimes seizures neck stiffness or neck pain are also relatively common in about a quarter of people a small bleed with resolving symptoms occurs within a month of a larger bleed sah may occur as a result of a head injury or spontaneously usually from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm risk factors for spontaneous cases included high blood pressure smoking family history alcoholism and cocaine use generally diagnosis can be determined by a ct scan of head if done within six hours of symptom onset occasionally a lumbar puncture is also required after confirmation further tests are usually performed to determine underlying cause treatment is by prompt neurosurgery or guided interventions medications such as labetalol may be required to lower blood pressure until repair can occur efforts to treat fevers are also recommended nimodipine a calcium channel blocker is frequently used to prevent vasospasm routine use medications to prevent further seizures is of unclear benefit nearly half of people with a sah due to an underlying aneurysm die within 30 days and about a third who survive have ongoing problems 10 15 percent die before reaching a hospital spontaneous sah occurs in about one per 10 000 people per year females are more commonly affected than males while it becomes more common with age about 50 of people present under 55 years old it is a form of stroke and comprises about 5 percent of all strokes surgery for aneurysms was introduced in 1930s since 1990s many aneurysms are treated by a less invasive procedure called endovascular coiling which is carried out through a large blood vessel signs and symptoms classic symptom of subarachnoid hemorrhage is thunderclap headache a headache described as like being kicked in head or worst ever developing over seconds to minutes this headache often pulsates towards occiput back of head about one third of people have no symptoms apart from characteristic headache and about one in ten people who seek medical care with this symptom are later diagnosed with a subarachnoid hemorrhage vomiting may be present and 1 in 14 have seizures confusion decreased level of consciousness or coma may be present as may neck stiffness and other signs of neck stiffness usually presents six hours after initial onset of sah isolated dilation of a pupil and loss of pupillary light reflex may reflect brain herniation as a result of rising intracranial pressure pressure inside skull hemorrhage bleeding into eyeball may occur in response to raised pressure hemorrhage bleeding under membrane which envelops vitreous body of eye and vitreous hemorrhage may be visible on this is known as syndrome occurring in 3 13 percent of cases and is more common in more severe sah oculomotor nerve abnormalities affected eye looking downward and outward and inability to lift eyelid on same side or palsy loss of movement may indicate bleeding from posterior communicating artery seizures are more common if hemorrhage is from an aneurysm it is otherwise difficult to predict site and origin of hemorrhage from symptoms sah in a person known to have seizures is often diagnostic of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation combination of intracerebral hemorrhage and raised intracranial pressure if present leads to a sympathetic surge i e over activation of sympathetic system this is thought to occur through two mechanisms a direct effect on medulla that leads to activation of descending sympathetic nervous system and a local release of inflammatory mediators that circulate to peripheral circulation where they activate sympathetic system as a consequence of sympathetic surge there is a sudden increase in blood pressure mediated by increased contractility of ventricle and increased vasoconstriction leading to increased systemic vascular resistance consequences of this sympathetic surge can be sudden severe and are frequently life threatening high plasma concentrations of adrenaline also may cause cardiac arrhythmias irregularities in heart rate and rhythm electrocardiographic changes in 27 percent of cases and cardiac arrest in 3 percent of cases may occur rapidly after onset of hemorrhage a further consequence of this process is neurogenic pulmonary edema where a process of increased pressure within pulmonary circulation causes leaking of fluid from pulmonary capillaries into air spaces alveoli of lung subarachnoid hemorrhage may also occur in people who have had a head injury symptoms may include headache decreased level of consciousness and hemiparesis weakness of one side of body sah is a frequent occurrence in traumatic brain injury and carries a poor prognosis if it is associated with deterioration in level of consciousness while thunderclap headache is characteristic symptom of subarachnoid hemorrhage less than 10 of those with concerning symptoms have sah on investigations a number of other causes may need to be considered causes thumb circle of willis with most common locations of ruptured aneurysms marked most cases of sah are due to trauma such as a blow to head traumatic sah usually occurs near site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion it often happens in setting of other forms of traumatic brain injury in these cases prognosis is poorer however it is unclear if this is a direct result of sah or whether presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of a more severe head injury in 85 percent of spontaneous cases cause is a cerebral aneurysm a weakness in wall of one of arteries in brain that becomes enlarged they tend to be located in circle of willis and its branches while most cases are due to bleeding from small aneurysms larger aneurysms which are less common are more likely to rupture aspirin also appears to increase risk in 15 20 percent of cases of spontaneous sah no aneurysm is detected on first angiogram about half of these are attributed to non aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage in which blood is limited to subarachnoid spaces around midbrain i e mesencephalon in these origin of blood is uncertain remainder are due to other disorders affecting blood vessels such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations disorders of blood vessels in spinal cord and bleeding into various tumors cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia usually in children and rarely anticoagulant therapy problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in sah dissection of vertebral artery usually caused by trauma can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if dissection involves part of vessel inside skull pathophysiology cerebral vasospasm is one of complications caused by subarachnoid haemorrhage it usually happens from third day after aneurysm event and reaches its peak on 5th to 7th day there are several mechanisms proposed for this complication blood products released from subarachnoid haemorrhage stimulates tyrosine kinase pathway causing release of calcium ions from intracellular storage resulting in smooth muscle contraction of cerebral arteries in cerebrospinal fluid csf causes vasoconstriction by increasing free radicals 1 prostaglandin and reducing level of nitric oxide and besides disturbances of autonomic nervous system innervating cerebral arteries is also thought to cause vasospasm diagnosis thumb upright 1 3 left a lumbar puncture in progress a large area on back has been washed with an iodine based disinfectant leaving brown coloration as only 10 percent of people admitted to emergency department with a thunderclap headache are having an sah other possible causes are usually considered simultaneously such as meningitis migraine and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis intracerebral hemorrhage in which bleeding occurs within brain itself is twice as common as sah and is often misdiagnosed as latter it is not unusual for sah to be initially misdiagnosed as a migraine or tension headache which can lead to a delay in obtaining a ct scan in a 2004 study this occurred in 12 percent of all cases and was more likely in people who had smaller hemorrhages and no impairment in their mental status delay in diagnosis led to a worse outcome in some people headache resolves by itself and no other symptoms are present this type of headache is referred to as sentinel headache because it is presumed to result from a small leak a warning leak from an aneurysm a sentinel headache still warrants investigations with ct scan and lumbar puncture as further bleeding may occur in subsequent three weeks initial steps for evaluating a person with a suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage are obtaining a medical history and performing a physical examination diagnosis cannot be made on clinical grounds alone and in general medical imaging and possibly a lumbar puncture is required to confirm or exclude bleeding imaging modality of choice is computed tomography ct scan without contrast of brain this has a high sensitivity and will correctly identify 98 7 of cases within six hours of onset of symptoms its efficacy declines thereafter and magnetic resonance imaging mri may be more sensitive than ct after several days lumbar puncture lumbar puncture in which cerebrospinal fluid csf is removed from subarachnoid space of spinal canal using a hypodermic needle shows evidence of hemorrhage in three percent of people in whom ct was found normal lumbar puncture is therefore regarded as mandatory in people with suspected sah if imaging is negative at least three tubes of csf are collected if an elevated number of red blood cells is present equally in all bottles this indicates a subarachnoid hemorrhage if number of cells decreases per bottle it is more likely that it is due to damage to a small blood vessel during procedure known as a traumatic tap while there is no official cutoff for red blood cells in csf no documented cases have occurred at less than a few hundred cells per high powered field csf sample is also examined for xanthochromia yellow appearance of centrifugated fluid this can be determined by spectrophotometry measuring absorption of particular wavelengths of light or visual examination it is unclear which method is superior xanthochromia remains a reliable ways to detect sah several days after onset of headache an interval of at least 12 hours between onset of headache and lumbar puncture is required as it takes several hours for hemoglobin from red blood cells to be metabolized into bilirubin angiography after a subarachnoid hemorrhage is confirmed its origin needs to be determined if bleeding is likely to have originated from an aneurysm as determined by ct scan appearance choice is between cerebral angiography injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to brain arteries and ct angiography visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a ct scan to identify aneurysms catheter angiography also offers possibility of coiling an aneurysm see below ecg thumb upright 1 3 ecg changes resembling those of an stemi in a woman who had an acute cns injury from a subarachnoid hemorrhage electrocardiographic changes are relatively common in subarachnoid hemorrhage occurring in 40 70 percent of cases they may include qt prolongation q waves cardiac dysrhythmias and st elevation that mimics a heart attack classification there are several grading scales available for sah glasgow coma scale gcs is ubiquitously used for assessing consciousness three specialized scores are used to evaluate sah in each a higher number is associated with a worse outcome these scales have been derived by retrospectively matching characteristics of people with their outcomes first scale of severity was described by hunt and hess in 1968 grade signs and symptoms survival or minimal headache and slight neck stiffness 70 2 moderate to severe headache neck stiffness no neurologic deficit except cranial nerve palsy 60 3 drowsy minimal neurologic deficit 50 4 stuporous moderate to severe hemiparesis possibly early decerebrate rigidity and vegetative disturbances 20 5 deep coma decerebrate rigidity moribund 10 fisher grade classifies appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage on ct scan grade appearance of hemorrhage 1none less than 1 mm more than 1 mm diffuse or none with intraventricular hemorrhage or extension this scale has been modified by claassen and coworkers reflecting additive risk from sah size and accompanying intraventricular hemorrhage 0 none 1 minimal sah w o ivh 2 minimal sah with ivh 3 thick sah w o ivh 4 thick sah with ivh world federation of neurosurgeons classification uses glasgow coma score and focal neurological deficit to gauge severity of symptoms grade gcs focal neurological deficit 1 15 absent 2 13 14 absent 3 13 14 present 4 7 12 present or absent 5 7 present or absent a comprehensive classification scheme has been suggested by ogilvy and carter to predict outcome and gauge therapy system consists of five grades and it assigns one point for presence or absence of each of five factors age greater than 50 hunt and hess grade 4 or 5 fisher scale 3 or 4 aneurysm size greater than 10 mm and posterior circulation aneurysm 25 mm or more screening and prevention screening for aneurysms is not performed on a population level because they are relatively rare it would not be cost effective if someone has two or more first degree relatives who have had an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage screening may be worthwhile autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease adpkd a hereditary kidney condition is known to be associated with cerebral aneurysms in 8 percent of cases but most such aneurysms are small and therefore unlikely to rupture as a result screening is only recommended in families with adpkd where one family member has had a ruptured aneurysm an aneurysm may be detected incidentally on brain imaging this presents a conundrum as all treatments for cerebral aneurysms are associated with potential complications international study of unruptured intracranial aneurysms isuia provided prognostic data both in people having previously had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and people who had aneurysms detected by other means those having previously had a sah were more likely to bleed from other aneurysms in contrast those having never bled and had small aneurysms smaller than 10 mm were very unlikely to have a sah and were likely to sustain harm from attempts to repair these aneurysms on basis of isuia and other studies it is now recommended that people are considered for preventive treatment only if they have a reasonable life expectancy and have aneurysms that are highly likely to rupture at same time there is only limited evidence that endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms is actually beneficial treatment management involves general measures to stabilize person while also using specific investigations and treatments these include prevention of rebleeding by obliterating bleeding source prevention of a phenomenon known as vasospasm and prevention and treatment of complications stabilizing person is first priority those with a depressed level of consciousness may need to be intubated and mechanically ventilated blood pressure pulse respiratory rate and glasgow coma scale are monitored frequently once diagnosis is confirmed admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission nutrition is an early priority mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over parenteral routes in general pain control is restricted to less sedating agents such as codeine as sedation may impact on mental status and thus interfere with ability to monitor level of consciousness deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings intermittent pneumatic compression of calves or both a bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons people with poor clinical grade on admission acute neurologic deterioration or progressive enlargement of ventricles on ct scan are in general indications for placement of an external ventricular drain by a neurosurgeon external ventricular drain may be inserted at bedside or in operating room in either case strict technique must be maintained during insertion in people with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid blood and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase risk for cerebral vasospasm preventing rebleeding thumb upright 1 3 showing a partially coiled aneurysm indicated by yellow arrows of posterior cerebral artery with a residual aneurysmal sac person was a 34 year old woman initially treated for a subarachnoid hemorrhage efforts to keep a person s systolic blood pressure below somewhere between 140 and 160 mmhg is generally recommended medications to achieve this may include labetalol or people whose ct scan shows a large hematoma depressed level of consciousness or focal neurologic signs may benefit from urgent surgical removal of blood or occlusion of bleeding site remainder are stabilized more extensively and undergo a angiogram or ct angiogram later it is hard to predict who will have a yet it may happen at any time and carries a dismal prognosis after first 24 hours have passed rebleeding risk remains around 40 percent over subsequent four weeks suggesting that interventions should be aimed at reducing this risk as soon as possible some predictors of early rebleeding are high systolic blood pressure presence of a hematoma in brain or ventricles poor hunt hess grade iii iv aneurysms in posterior circulation and an aneurysm 10 mm in size if a cerebral aneurysm is identified on angiography two measures are available to reduce risk of further bleeding from same aneurysm clipping and coiling clipping requires a craniotomy opening of skull to locate aneurysm followed by placement of clips around neck of aneurysm coiling is performed through large blood vessels a catheter is inserted into femoral artery in groin and advanced through aorta to arteries both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries that supply brain when aneurysm has been located platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in aneurysm obliterating it decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon and often other health professionals in general decision between clipping and coiling is made on basis of location of aneurysm its size and condition of person aneurysms of middle cerebral artery and its related vessels are hard to reach with angiography and tend to be amenable to clipping those of basilar artery and posterior cerebral artery are hard to reach surgically and are more accessible for endovascular management these approaches are based on general experience and only randomized controlled trial directly comparing different modalities was performed in relatively well people with small less than 10 mm aneurysms of anterior cerebral artery and anterior communicating artery together anterior circulation who constitute about 20 percent of all people with aneurysmal sah this trial international subarachnoid aneurysm trial isat showed that in this group likelihood of death or being dependent on others for activities of daily living was reduced 7 4 percent absolute risk reduction 23 5 percent relative risk reduction if endovascular coiling was used as opposed to surgery main drawback of coiling is possibility that aneurysm will recur this risk is extremely small in surgical approach in isat 8 3 percent needed further treatment in longer term hence people who have undergone coiling are typically followed up for many years afterwards with angiography or other measures to ensure recurrence of aneurysms is identified early other trials have also found a higher rate of recurrence necessitating further treatments vasospasm vasospasm in which blood vessels constrict and thus restrict blood flow is a serious complication of sah it can cause ischemic brain injury referred to as delayed ischemia and permanent brain damage due to lack of oxygen in parts of brain it can be fatal if severe delayed ischemia is characterized by new neurological symptoms and can be confirmed by transcranial doppler or cerebral angiography about one third of people admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage will have delayed ischemia and half of those have permanent damage as a result it is possible to screen for development of vasospasm with transcranial doppler every 24 48 hours a blood flow velocity of more than 120 centimeters per second is suggestive of vasospasm use of calcium channel blockers thought to be able to prevent spasm of blood vessels by preventing calcium from entering smooth muscle cells has been proposed for prevention calcium channel blocker nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between fourth and twenty first day after bleeding even if it does not reduce amount of vasospasm detected on angiography it is only food and drug administration fda approved drug for treating cerebral vasospasm in traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage nimodipine does not affect long term outcome and is not recommended other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied but are not presently recommended neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously some older studies have suggested that statin therapy might reduce vasospasm but a subsequent meta analysis including further trials did not demonstrate benefit on either vasospasm or outcomes while corticosteroids with activity may help prevent vasospasm their use does not appear to change outcomes a protocol referred to as triple h is often used as a measure to treat vasospasm when it causes symptoms this is use of intravenous fluids to achieve a state of hypertension high blood pressure excess fluid in circulation and mild dilution of blood evidence for this approach is inconclusive no randomized controlled trials have been undertaken to demonstrate its effect if symptoms of delayed ischemia do not improve with medical treatment angiography may be attempted to identify sites of and administer medication drugs that relax blood vessel wall directly into artery angioplasty opening constricted area with a balloon may also be performed other complications hydrocephalus obstruction of flow of cerebrospinal fluid may complicate sah in both short and long term it is detected on ct scanning on which there is enlargement of lateral ventricles if level of consciousness is decreased drainage of excess fluid is performed by therapeutic lumbar puncture drain a temporary device inserted into one of ventricles or occasionally a permanent shunt relief of hydrocephalus can lead to an enormous improvement in a person s condition fluctuations in blood pressure and electrolyte imbalance as well as pneumonia and cardiac decompensation occur in about half hospitalized persons with sah and may worsen prognosis seizures occur during hospital stay in about a third of cases people have often been treated with preventative antiepileptic medications this is controversial and not based on good evidence in some studies use of these medications was associated with a worse prognosis although it is unclear whether this might be because drugs themselves actually cause harm or because they are used more often in persons with a poorer prognosis there is a possibility of a gastric hemorrhage due to stress ulcers prognosis short term outcomes sah is often associated with a poor outcome death rate mortality for sah is between 40 and 50 percent but trends for survival are improving of those that survive hospitalization more than a quarter have significant restrictions in their lifestyle and less than a fifth have no residual symptoms whatsoever delay in diagnosis of minor sah mistaking sudden headache for migraine contributes to poor outcome factors found on admission that are associated with poorer outcome include poorer neurological grade systolic hypertension a previous diagnosis of heart attack or sah liver disease more blood and larger aneurysm on initial ct scan location of an aneurysm in posterior circulation and higher age factors that carry a worse prognosis during hospital stay include occurrence of delayed ischemia resulting from vasospasm development of intracerebral hematoma or intraventricular hemorrhage bleeding into ventricles of brain and presence of fever on eighth day of admission so called angiogram negative subarachnoid hemorrhage sah that does not show an aneurysm with four vessel angiography carries a better prognosis than sah with aneurysm but it is still associated with a risk of ischemia rebleeding and hydrocephalus perimesencephalic sah bleeding around mesencephalon in brain however has a very low rate of rebleeding or delayed ischemia and prognosis of this subtype is excellent prognosis of head trauma is thought to be influenced in part by location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding it is difficult to isolate effects of sah from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury it is unknown whether presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred people with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have sah when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice risk of dying as those who do not they also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state and traumatic sah has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy hydrocephalus and longer stays in intensive care unit more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a glasgow coma score over 12 have a good outcome there is also modest evidence that genetic factors influence prognosis in sah for example having two copies of a variant of gene encoding e that also plays a role in alzheimer s disease seems to increase risk for delayed ischemia and a worse outcome occurrence of hyperglycemia high blood sugars after an episode of sah confers a higher risk of poor outcome long term outcomes neurocognitive symptoms such as fatigue mood disturbances and other related symptoms are common sequelae even in those who have made good neurological recovery anxiety depression posttraumatic stress disorder and cognitive impairment are common 46 percent of people who have had a subarachnoid hemorrhage have cognitive impairment that affects their quality of life over 60 percent report frequent headaches aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage may lead to damage of hypothalamus and pituitary gland two areas of brain that play a central role in hormonal regulation and production more than a quarter of people with a previous sah may develop hypopituitarism deficiencies in one or more of hypothalamic pituitary hormones such as growth hormone luteinizing hormone or follicle stimulating hormone epidemiology thumb upright 1 3 average number of people with sah per 100 000 person years broken down by age according to a review of 51 studies from 21 countries average incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage is 9 1 per 100 000 annually studies from japan and finland show higher rates in those countries 22 7 and 19 7 respectively for reasons that are not entirely understood south and central america in contrast have a rate of 4 2 per 100 000 on average although group of people at risk for sah is younger than population usually affected by stroke risk still increases with age young people are much less likely than middle age people risk ratio 0 1 or 10 percent to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in very elderly over 85 than in those between 45 and 55 risk of sah is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men same age probably reflecting hormonal changes that result from menopause such as a decrease in estrogen levels genetics may play a role in a person s disposition to sah risk is increased three to fivefold in first degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage but lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk these risk factors are smoking hypertension high blood pressure and excessive alcohol consumption having smoked in past confers a doubled risk of sah compared to those who have never smoked some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity hormone replacement therapy and diabetes mellitus there is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and risk of non traumatic sah though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with sah are bending over or lifting heavy objects at onset of their symptoms overall about 1 percent of all people have one or more cerebral aneurysms most of these are small and unlikely to rupture history while clinical picture of subarachnoid hemorrhage may have been recognized by hippocrates existence of cerebral aneurysms and fact that they could rupture was not established until 18th century associated symptoms were described in more detail in 1886 by edinburgh physician dr byrom bramwell in 1924 london neurologist sir charles p symonds 1890 1978 gave a complete account of all major symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage and he coined term spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage symonds also described use of lumbar puncture and xanthochromia in diagnosis first surgical intervention was performed by norman dott who was a pupil of harvey cushing then working in edinburgh he introduced wrapping of aneurysms in 1930s and was an early pioneer in use of angiograms american neurosurgeon dr walter dandy working in baltimore was first to introduce clips in 1938 microsurgery was applied to aneurysm treatment in 1972 in order to further improve outcomes 1980s saw introduction of triple h therapy as a treatment for delayed ischemia due to vasospasm and trials with nimodipine in an attempt to prevent this complication in 1983 russian neurosurgeon and colleagues reported first use of balloon angioplasty for vasospasm after aneurysmal sah italian
