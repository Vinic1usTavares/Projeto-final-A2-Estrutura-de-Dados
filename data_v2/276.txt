written for television by dave hill who had previously written two episodes for series sons of harpy and home as well as serving as a writing assistant since show s second season in an interview with entertainment weekly hill commented on intentions of characters decisions and writing and storylines that were involved in penning episode in writing opening sequence involving daenerys and randyll and dickon tarly hill noted difference between daenerys and other rulers in that she offered men a choice saying these lords disobeyed her and disrespected her in rebellion against rightful queen then she gives them a way out and they don t take it he also spoke about effect on jaime of being defeated by daenerys noting this was their first time facing in open field and they were so easily defeated and that s not something he s ever seen before but as hard as it is to deal with and her dragons it s much harder to deal with cersei regarding jon snow s departure from dragonstone hill mentioned that daenerys believes jon is honest and she can t continue a war and still have seven kingdoms to rule after war is done as long as white walker threat remains hill s intention in writing scene of tyrion s secret meeting with jaime was to open interaction with total antagonism and hatred and eventually change it to two being vaguely on same side he notes that although jaime may not believe tyrion it was worth exploring a possibility of a truce hill stated that writers were uncertain on when gendry should be reintroduced to story he noted that writers always intended to bring gendry back and that they had originally planned to bring him back in previous season they eventually settled on bringing him back in eastwatch in order to place him into storyline he referred to as big mission with jon snow beyond wall hill added it made sense that davos would want to save this boy who s like a surrogate son casting right thumb upright actor joe dempsie returned in role as gendry in eastwatch eastwatch saw re introduction of joe dempsie as gendry role he portrayed in first second and third seasons in an interview with hollywood reporter dempsie said about re joining cast in intervening three years i would always welcome opportunity to come back to show with open arms i have so many friends on show and have such a great time making it i learn so much when i m on that set dempsie also revealed that co creators david benioff and d b weiss were unsure when he would be returning to show noting that he was told by them look your character is going to disappear for a while we don t want you to panic we re not trying to sack you we like your performance and your character but we have plans for him further on down line dempsie learned of his return to show shortly before christmas 2015 during a meeting with his agent filming eastwatch was directed by matt shakman who also directed previous episode spoils of war prior to joining series shakman served as a television director for several other series including fargo good wife mad men and it s always sunny in philadelphia in an interview with hollywood reporter following airing of eastwatch shakman described shooting his two episodes other being spoils of war for season there isn t same massive set piece so it s really about establishing what s coming next for season it s a bit of a reset there are some major character revelations and further development of relationships especially people who are reunited and are now seeing what s happening as they navigate their new relationships with people they haven t seen in so long at beginning of episode tyrion lannister is shown walking through aftermath of loot train attack which shakman noted was intended to show tyrion s internal conflict between serving daenerys and seeing his own family s dead soldiers he also stated about scene we created things for him to look at that were evoking pompeii aftermath of dragon fire and what it does to humans all around him as well as destruction of actual wagons we walked peter through that and let him react to what he was seeing effect is pretty powerful for daenerys targaryen s return to dragonstone and interaction between drogon and jon snow shakman spoke about process that went into creating scene saying that half time kit harington who portrays jon snow was acting with a partial dragon snout and at other times nothing or a tennis ball in order to establish a proper eye line a pre viz was also created in order for harington to see a visualization of what scene would look like after post production was completed and to understand enormity of drogon he continued it s tremendous acting to be able to invent your scene partner and to be able to navigate a scene like that bravo to kit harington shakman also talked about directing harington and emilia clarke who portrays daenerys saying even though they haven t interacted much on show at all except for this season know each other very well so there s a familiarity there that helps them as actors they both have great respect for each other and are both very talented so scenes are relatively easy to craft due to familiarity between them that works shakman also spoke about direction for scene between samwell tarly and gilly at citadel noting that despite importance of information that gilly was revealing regarding rhaegar targaryen his intent was to focus primarily on john bradley as sam saying i knew information was huge and there s no need to underline it at all i put all of that information off camera and pushed in on john bradley as he was dealing with crisis of moment which was his frustration with maesters and ultimately coming to conclusion that he doesn t want to be a part of it anymore fact that it happens to be dropping a giant piece of information about jon s lineage and his claim to throne i felt it was better to have that happen without any kind of underlining he also disclosed that effect of this reveal will be felt in future episodes as daenerys and jon s relationship changes additionally shakman revealed that meeting of characters at eastwatch ice cells at end of episode was shot all in one day and that he hoped to have had more time to shoot scene he complimented actors for their performances however saying there s just so much tension happening with everybody and we re setting up this idea that this is a group of very unlikely comrades heading out to perform an impossible task all of those actors are fantastic building tension between each of them wasn t that difficult given how smart they all are as performers for closing shot of episode shakman attempted to pay homage to director sam peckinpah specifically by referencing 1969 film wild bunch for which peckinpah wrote screenplay and directed he noted scene was meant to evoke that image of wild bunch walking into town before big shoot em up begins reception ratings eastwatch was watched by 10 72 million viewers on

on review aggregator website rotten tomatoes from 63 reviews with an average score of 8 07 out of 10 site s consensus reads eastwatch traded fiery spectacle of thrones previous episode for a slow burn approach but nonetheless delivered some spectacular revelations and reunions matt fowler of ign wrote in his review of episode eastwatch may have represented a breather in action so to speak but it sure didn t lag it was a masterfully busy episode with big moments coming at you in each and every scene everyone s past connection to one another is now getting brought up noted and utilized to further plot in a meaningful natural way he continued by mentioning several of reunions and call backs that took place throughout episode saying from sam having met bran back at end of season 3 to gendry finally returning to show and meeting up with both ser davos and in same episode to jorah finding his way back to daenerys to tyrion s tense but fruitful reunion with jaime eastwatch was chock full of past becoming present and being used to inform drastic dramatic war machine he gave episode a 9 2 out of 10 myles mcnutt of a v club similarly felt episode lacked action that previous episode spoils of war had calling it a piece moving episode but noted whereas before you were seeing pieces moving into place to set up a set of four or five different climaxes to season here all of moving pieces are taking place on same continent and with an impact on same central story arc he gave episode a b kelly lawler of usa today expressed similar thoughts by stating it was best episode of season thus far and noting series has needed to reinvent itself after it brought so many major characters together and narrowed its focus accolades year award category nominee s result 2018 art directors
