context of anglo german naval arms race at time battleships of foreign navies had begun to carry increasingly heavy secondary batteries including italian and american ships with guns and british ships with guns outclassing previous german battleships of with their secondaries german designers initially considered ships equipped with secondary guns but erroneous reports in early 1904 that british s would be equipped with a secondary battery of guns prompted them to consider an even more powerful ship armed with an all big gun armament consisting of eight guns over next two years design was refined into a larger vessel with twelve of guns by which time britain had launched all big gun battleship westfalen was long wide and had a draft of she displaced with a standard load and fully laden ship design retained 3 shaft triple expansion engines instead of more advanced turbine engines steam was provided to engines by twelve coal fired water tube boilers with addition in 1915 of supplementary oil firing this machinery was chosen at request of admiral alfred von tirpitz and navy s construction department department stated in 1905 that use of turbines in heavy warships does not recommend itself this decision was based solely on cost at time parsons held a monopoly on steam turbines and required a 1 million gold mark royalty fee for every turbine engine german firms were not

building materials such as krupp ship was launched on 1 july 1908 underwent an initial fitting out and then in mid september 1909 was transferred to kiel by a crew composed of dockyard workers for a final fitting out however water level in weser river was low at this time of year so six pontoons had to be attached to ship to reduce her draft even so it took two attempts before ship cleared river
