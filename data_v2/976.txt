temperatures below 0 degrees celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality another factor that influences pupal development is soil moisture pupal mortality is high in wet soil where moisture level is

helicoverpa zea is a seasonal nocturnal migrant and adults disperse weather permitting when there are poor reproductive conditions in short range dispersal moths move within crop and low over foliage this type of dispersal is mostly independent of wind currents long range dispersal involves adults flying up to 10 meters above ground and moving downwind from crop to crop migratory flights occur up

farmers around 2 million dollars degree of damage varies on size of pest infestation timing and stage of plant however soybean plants are capable of withstanding a large amount of damage without substantial yield loss depending on soil moisture planting date and weather if damage is early in plants life then damage will mostly be to leaves plants compensate for damage by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods most damage happens in august when plants are flowering attacks that happen after august do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher walls that h zea can t penetrate infestations that affect pod formation and seed filling have potential to reduce yields and because this happens in later stages of plants they have less time to compensate female moths are attracted to flowering soybean fields most severe infestations occur between flowering and when pods become fully developed large scale outbreak is associated with time of peak flowering when most pods are developed and peak moth flight for giant moths are also attracted to drought stressed soybeans or fields with poor growth dry weather leads to quick drying of corn plants compelling moths to leave and seek other hosts heavy rainfall also decreases corn earworm populations because it drowns pupae in their soil chambers limits moth flight washes eggs from leaves and

males engage in flight to find a female they warm up by shivering major flight muscles to reach thoracic temperature optimal to sustain flight around 26 degrees celsius thermoregulatory shivering activities of males were measured as they were exposed to different sex related olfactory cues males are found to heat up more quickly in presence of a female pheromone and take off at a lower thoracic temperature than males who are exposed to other chemical scents since heating up to right temperature leads to better flight performance than flying immediately there is a trade off between sub optimal flight performance and rapid onset of directed flight helicoverpa zea males exposed to an attractive pheromone blend thus spend less time shivering and increase their heating rate
