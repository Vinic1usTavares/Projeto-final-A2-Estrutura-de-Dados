was a little rufus blast before he began work on his next pop album wainwright also said following of collection there s my old demos a lot of them were recorded in montreal when i had a very very different voice i kind of sounded like a little old man there s that and there s a lot of fabulous collaborations with my mother my father and some other great artists wainwright had originally intended to call box set rufus cycle after being told title was too sophisticated he went with house of rufus partly inspired by lady gaga s haus of gaga wainwright claimed box set s release shortly after his father s loudon wainwright iii box set 40 odd years was totally serendipitous box set s title commemorates wainwright s five night residency at london s royal opera house during july 18 23

notes by neil tennant linda thompson lenny waronker martha wainwright and rufus himself wainwright dedicated box set to publicist barbara charone without whom it wouldn t have been possible reception critical reception of box set was mostly positive though some reviewers questioned necessity for such an elaborate collection especially given wainwright s age and higher than expected price will hodgkinson of times wrote that a box set for wainwright whom he described as a not yet middle aged artist was unnecessary but that collection shine s a spotlight on its creator s rare remarkable songwriting hodgkinson called wainwright and box set charming overall but thought that excess of material stops great moments from really shining out hive magazine contributor luke hannaford complimented rufus and loudon s performance of richard thompson s down where drunkards roll which was recorded specifically for this collection describing it as achingly beautiful martin aston s review for bbc music was positive in addition to other tracks aston complimented get out of town cole porter 1938 and sweet repose both demos he considered to be unreleased stunners that betray wainwright s show tune soul though she noted higher than expected cost of box set helen brown of daily telegraph wrote that it served as an impressive array that showcased wainwright s range and hard work evening standard contributor david smyth wrote that this luxurious treasure chest will be too deep for almost anyone apart from its creator smyth found rufus family and friends album to be most charming specifically what ll i do which features whole wainwright family brian boyd of irish times considered box set to be sensory overload and thought that quality of previously unreleased material appearing on studio albums varied but called collection magnificent from a delightfully unorthodox and consistently engaging performer boyd also noted cost of box set but complimented quality of its
