lake manly was a pluvial lake in death valley california covering much of death valley with a surface area of during so called blackwelder stand water levels varied through its history and chronology is further complicated by active tectonic processes that have modified elevations of various shorelines of lake manly during blackwelder stage they reached above sea level lake received water mainly from amargosa river and at various points from mojave river and owens river lake and its substantial catchment favoured spread of a number of aquatic species including some lizards pupfish and springsnails lake probably supported a substantial ecosystem and a number of diatoms developed there in death valley lakes existed during different times in geological past after some poorly defined lake stages during miocene pliocene and early pleistocene first large lake stage occurred about 185 000 128 000 years ago during tahoe glacial stage and formed blackwelder shorelines this lake was largest known lake manly theories that lake merged with lake mojave farther south or even overflowed into colorado river close to ludlow and across several other basins are however questionable after drying of this lake a later lake stage occurred 35 000 10 000 years ago during tioga wisconsin glaciation this lake was smaller than blackwelder lake during holocene lake disappeared today only ephemeral lakes occur in death valley during strong floods this lake is one among many major lakes that formed in great basin best researched of which are lake lahontan and lake bonneville decreasing temperatures and thus decreased evaporation rates as well as increased precipitation rates during ice ages were responsible for formation of these lake systems lake manly collected overflow from a number of lakes including lake tecopa mono lake lake owens searles lake lake panamint lake mojave lake dumont and lake manix not all of them existed or drained into lake manly simultaneously discovery and naming existence of large ancient lakes in great basin of united states was already proposed by end of 19th century when existence of lake lahontan and lake bonneville was first described possibility of a former lake in death valley was also considered during that time though at first it was not universally accepted as a large lake first evidence for it was described in 1924 by geologist levi f noble earlier in 1890 another geologist grove karl gilbert already assumed a lake existed in death valley although his lake was considerably larger than actual lake manly evidence for lake s existence includes terraces observed by geologists in 1925 pebbles and tufa layers of clay and salt on its former lake bed and calcium carbonate deposits that were probably formed by algae in lake these clues are dispersed across death valley especially within more researched areas of beatty junction and desolation canyon while deposits were once attributed to a single lake stand later evidence was found of various lake cycles going back to pliocene history of lake manly is not as well understood as that of lake lahontan and lake bonneville two largest pluvial lakes recorded in great basin more recently renewed scientific interest has stemmed from fact that lake manly formerly drained area of yucca mountain a proposed nuclear waste repository lake was named in honor of william lewis manly who rescued white immigrants from death valley in 1849 name lake rogers for a potential northern lake in death valley was derived from a compatriot of manly john rogers name lake manly was coined in 1932 and is sometimes spelled as manley which is a misspelling other names for lakes in death valley are death valley pleistocene lakes and death valley lake a name first used in a publication of 1902 name is used for lakes that occupied death valley in past but occasionally name lake manly is used only for most recent middle pleistocene lake stage or general late pleistocene lake stages geography thumb drainage system of lake manly present day roads are shown for reference lake manly formed in death valley a tectonic depression framed by cottonwood mountains and panamint range to west mountains to south and black mountains funeral mountains and grapevine mountains to east death valley is about long and wide and consists of three basins badwater basin which reaches a depth of beneath sea level basin and middle basin badwater basin is deepest point in north america death valley began forming about 14 million years ago and by pliocene it was well developed valley remains deep due to vertical faulting which occurs faster there than anywhere else in us various types of rocks form surface areas of death valley some going back as far as precambrian death valley is tectonically active with faults including black mountains fault furnace creek fault grandview fault northern death valley fault southern death valley fault and towne pass fault thus shorelines from same lake stands are often not at same elevation in various parts of basin faulting has caused a progressive drop in elevation of floor of death valley keeping pace with sedimentation though exact rates are not known this deformation causes southwestern shores of lake manly to sag with respect to northeastern ones and together with sedimentation renders estimating depth of lake manly unreliable this is compounded by fact that many lake deposits are located close to active faults of death valley fault zone over last 60 000 70 000 years northern death valley fault zone has slipped by about lack of earthquakes and dates makes it difficult to estimate activity of these faults though an earthquake occurred in 1908 and death valley is actively subsiding volcanism has also affected death valley including crater in valley and distant mono inyo craters all within last 2 000 years lake lake manly was a long narrow lake with a southern sub basin named confidence flats it was about deep at highstand and about above sea level lake reached a width of and length of shores of lake were long most prominent shoreline at about elevation is known as blackwelder shoreline even higher shorelines have been identified at shoreline butte at this stand lake had a surface area of about using present day topography at that point volume would have been about absolute highest surface area lake manly could have had at overflow height was or some landforms indicative of lacustrine deposition have been found at altitudes of overflow height above sea level around death valley but they could also be consequences of non lacustrine processes southern california and southern nevada contain deserts with valleys similar to death valley that are also not formed by rivers many of them held water in past some lakes such as great salt lake mono lake pyramid lake and walker lake still exist these ancient lakes were ultimately generated by basin and range province tectonic phenomena which caused runoff to collect in closed basins various weather changes associated with last glacial maximum favored their infilling including southward shifts of storm tracks accompanying analogous shifts of jet stream which were probably forced by laurentide ice sheet currently a salt pan fills death valley with an average surface altitude of one island existed close to beatty junction with two more at shoreline butte in southernmost point of lake northern foot of avawatz mountains may have formed a peninsula on southern shore no river deltas or other embankments have been found at lake manly s shorelines their formation was likely hampered by unstable water levels only vague remnants of a delta are found where amargosa river probably entered lake manly and alluvial fan of warm springs canyon is cut by shorelines of lake manly chevrons and have been found in lake sediments a number of alluvial fans decorate former shores of lake manly shorelines thumb 400px shoreline butte close with shorelines visible landforms associated with lake manly have been identified at a number of points in death valley at beatty junction winds on lake formed several spits and barrier bars shorelines at desolation canyon also included spits and a tombolo just south of desolation canyon so called manly terraces are a group of and terraces at least 12 different terraces have been found at shoreline butte a number of bars and spits formed on shores of lake manly and are preserved to this day some rocks in shoreline deposits left by lake display evidence of honeycomb weathering southern shore of lake manly was formed by alluvial fans that had coalesced at foot of avawatz mountains these fans are still growing and displacing amargosa river eastwards some sand and gravel deposits at salt spring hills with elevations of about may have been formed by either lake manly or another paleolake south of death valley lake dumont shores of lake manly were influenced by wave action these waves probably came predominantly from north northwest causing near shore material to be transported to south this also explains why most of shore features are found on eastern shores of lake as these were most exposed to wave action it is not always clear whether a is actually a strand line or a surface expression of fault activity some supposed lower at mormon point were later reinterpreted as fault scarps hydrology thumb lacustrine system of mojave desert size of pluvial lakes such as lake manly is governed by balance between inflow by precipitation or rivers or streams and evaporation if one assumes that seepage and overflow are not important this can make surface of such lakes a useful gauge for paleoclimatic conditions principal water supplies to lake manly were amargosa river mojave river and owens river which yielded a large integrated drainage system over southwestern great basin total surface area of lake manly s catchment was about contrary to what early researchers first speculated it is however likely that three rivers never reached lake manly simultaneously thumb owens river lake manly system inflow principal river flowing into lake manly was amargosa river it originally ended in lake tecopa only more recently than 600 000 years ago did it arrive at death valley possibly as recently as 140 000 to 18 000 years ago even earlier amargosa river may have flowed towards colorado river mojave river may have reached amargosa and thus drained into lake manly but probably only during wet periods and only since most recent pleistocene breaching of intermediary lakes lake manix lake mojave and lake dumont occurred later than 18 000 years before present and earlier overflow is uncertain before time where it flowed into these lakes mojave river drained westward overflow from lake mojave may have continued until 8 000 years ago mojave river reached amargosa through silurian valley and salt creek on its way it crossed dry lake silurian lake and another pond at foot of salt spring hills currently integration of mojave river into death valley is nearly complete once basin of lake mojave has been filled completely with sediment to altitude of its own spillway even under current conditions its waters will reach death valley at least during tahoe glaciation owens river drained into lake manly after filling owens lake china lake searles lake and panamint valley this river system formed 3 2 million years ago when lava flows blocked a channel that had previously drained owens river across sierra nevada sediment data indicate that 900 000 800 000 and 700 000 600 000 years ago waters from panamint valley reached lake manly as chloride was being removed from valley at that time increased precipitation and formation of glaciers on eastern sierra nevada increased amount of water in owens river and decreased temperatures reduced evaporation at each of these lakes thus allowing water to get from lake to lake when panamint lake reached a water depth of it spilled over wingate pass into lake manly little evidence of such spillover remains such as delta like deposits at anvil spring canyon distribution of fish fossils in various waterbodies ostracod data and presence of strontium isotope data suggest that owens river system was a minor contributor to lake manly sediments in panamint valley suggest that last time that panamint valley overflowed into death valley was 95 000 55 000 years ago although dates display a lot of scatter during tioga glaciation owens river stopped in lake searles considering that lower shorelines at lake searles do not appear to correspond to any shoreline in panamint valley and death valley and no evidence has been found at wingate pass for overflow after 30 000 years ago runoff from region that owens river originates from may have contributed to lake manly during pliocene most likely through different paths however whether owens river water reached lake manly between 1 2 and 0 6 0 51 million years ago is unclear these rivers in turn received inflow from other such as lake which drained into amargosa river and shares fish with latter lake dumont lake manix lake mojave which were passed through by mojave river and after 1 6 million years ago lake russell present day mono lake through owens river this later connection is biologically significant as mono lake was variously connected with san joaquin river and lake lahontan thus it could have been a pathway for life to propagate between these water systems a notion supported by fish fossil data such as minnows and of death valley system which appear to originate in lake lahontan lake lahontan might have drained into lake manly one potential pathway would be from walker lake basin over soda springs valley fish lake valley and eureka valley where it may have been joined by overflow from deep springs valley all these valleys are at successively lower elevations connections to colorado river also existed there is evidence that amargosa river captured a tributary of latter in indian springs valley area such an event may have transferred fish along with about large catchment from colorado river to lake manly system before integrating with lake manly mojave river may have exited lake manix towards ludlow california and from then into colorado before diverting to lake mojave and then into lake manly overall this formed a large system of interconnected lakes largest of great basin and also basin s largest catchment in total runoff at time of lake manly was at least 3 5 times larger than today a southward shift of polar front may have aided formation of lake manly further water reached lake from streams in amargosa mountains and panamint mountains where water originates from snowmelt presently main inflows are from salt creek from north and amargosa river with springs around basin contributing a large proportion of present day water budget in valley other such streams include furnace creek hanaupah canyon point canyon six springs canyon and willow springs canyon springs also contributed water to lake manly especially during early lake stage these springs would have helped stabilize water levels in turn lake manly would have affected local water table brines and evaporites indicate that spring water contributed to hydrology of lake manly present day groundwater originates primarily from spring mountain outlet according to early researchers lake manly had no outlet and its water level would have been governed exclusively by balance of inflow and evaporation biological evidence however such as fossil pupfish indicates that connections to colorado river existed then ceased about 3 2 million years ago more generally evidence for miocene drainage of death valley to pacific ocean exists a major research issue remains as to whether lake manly ever drained into colorado river such a drainage may have occurred through broadwell lake across high pass close to ludlow and entered colorado close to present day parker arizona after passing through bristol lake cadiz lake and lake danby potentially such an overflow if it existed would have reached rates of overall though scientific consensus tends to view any connection between lake manly and colorado more recent than 3 million years ago as unlikely there is no evidence that lake manly reached such an elevation though shorelines may have been obscured by later alluvial fans a prominent channel deep and over ash hill pass in question may have been overflow channel but it could also be product of local runoff further there is no indication that bristol lake lake that water from an overflow would have entered into was ever filled with freshwater in last four million years though foraminifera correlated with colorado river have been found and some sedimentary and fish evolutionary data likewise support it thumb salts left behind by lake manly in badwater basin water composition as an endorheic lake lake manly was naturally a saltwater lake waters would have had less saline at highstand than during growth and regression stages further given that most water inflow occurred from south waters probably were less saline there during dry period before last lake stage salt accumulated at a rate of salinity did not exceed 10 000 ppm and sometimes did not even reach 3 000 ppm considering data taken from ostracods composition of lake deposits suggests that calcium rich springs associated with a crustal magma chamber in southern death valley contributed sizable quantities of water to lake this magma chamber is also correlated to a 700 000 years old cinder cone in southern death valley 140 000 and 135 000 years before present panamint valley drained relatively alkaline waters into lake manly this composition is also supported by presence of alkali liking ostracods in lake deposits and by patterns of erosion on lake deposits climate mean annual temperature of death valley is about due in part to its relatively low elevation july temperatures exceed on average based on plant data summer temperatures at lake manly during pleistocene were about 6 8 degc 11 14 degf lower than present day yucca was found at altitudes too cold for its development suggesting that middle altitudes winters were milder 12 000 10 000 years ago winter water temperatures may have dropped below however occasionally falling below with a maxima of during latest lake stage blackwelder stage had higher maximum temperatures maximum temperatures were depressed by 4 15 degc 7 27 degf during summers in last highstand blackwelder highstand temperatures reached however death valley has a dry climate owing to rain shadow formed by panamint range and sierra nevada which is enhanced by relative depth of valley thus less than precipitation fall every year and large year to year variations are observed much of this rainfall is transported by winter storms although summer thunderstorms and tropical storms also contribute depression of forest line in death valley suggests that during pleistocene rainfall was three or four times what it is today based on hydrological modelling a temperature drop of about and 2 5 times today s precipitation would be needed to recreate last highstand of lake manly lake manly was probably windier than present day death valley as present day winds would not be strong enough to push some of rocks that were moved along lake manly s shores wind speeds of over would be needed later research reduced this requirement to about which is consistent with estimated present day wind speeds in death valley topography of valley would have generated northerly winds over lake manly but strong southwesterly winds also contributed to formation of beach deposits wave heights have been estimated at about with heights of about needed to transport beach material enough to form and swash wave activity was most pronounced in southern and northern parts of lake manly biology some inferences on biota of lake manly can be made on basis of analogous lakes such as mono lake and great salt lake and on streams that drain into death valley shared species are considered evidence not only for integration of regional river systems but also for connections with more remote water systems such as colorado river such a connection to colorado river may have occurred through white river and las vegas valley through amargosa river or an earlier course of mojave river into bristol lake alternatively migratory birds might have dispersed animals between watersheds species dwelling in groundwater also existed in lake some tufa deposits were formed by blue green algae including and a ostracod species which existed in lake manly include candona caudata candona limnocythere limnocythere and limnocythere stromatolites were active in ponds behind beaches of lake manly species that inhabited lake probably included brine fly larvae brine shrimp and molluscs like and present day endemic aquatic fauna includes amphipods hemipterans and springtails integrated river system may have aided spread of spider incerta nineteen different species of springsnails occur within lake manly system more specifically in owens river and amargosa river valleys an early connection between amargosa river and colorado river may have propagated these animals between two river systems much research has been done on death valley fish of which about 24 species have been described minnows like and as well as desert pupfish inhabit streams and probably lived in lake manly as well lake manly drainage system facilitated spread of species of genera cyprinodon and in region and of pupfish more generally after 10 000 years before present this drainage system disappeared and distinct pupfish species evolved pupfish may have entered death valley through owens river or through an earlier pliocene river system probably forming an unified breeding population speciation of cyprinodon nevadensis and cyprinodon may have occurred in just a few thousand years after drying of lake manly it is likely that propagation of pupfish across whole system took longer than this as lake manly was never simultaneously connected to all three of its source drainages and pupfish would have had to enter death valley system from gulf of mexico over large distances cyprinodon has been present in death valley since late miocene early pliocene now extinct species existed during miocene in death valley shores of lake supported bird populations vegetation including sagebrush probably covered mountain slopes with higher slopes containing juniper pine and utah juniper forests forests during pleistocene extended down from altitude presently only land above is forested at even lower altitudes and yucca fossils have been found occurrence of lizards of genus uma is associated with paleolake systems which tend to favor their propagation one clade of uma is associated with lake manly system california vole was likewise propagated between mojave river and amargosa river systems by lake manly drainage freshwater lakes would also be suitable habitats for establishment of humans various potentially man made tools were found on manly terrace these include scrapers and lesser numbers of drills and blades this human activity probably occurred at time of last highstand of lake manly during wisconsin glaciation human origin of these artifacts has been contested however because they appear to resemble natural rocks from area chronology lake manly existed during late pleistocene and was at first considered to be an early wisconsin glaciation tahoe stage phenomenon originally it was believed that lake manly did not exist during tioga glaciation and it was assumed that lake manly existed in only one stage later evidence such as drilling core data indicates two distinct lake stages one 185 000 128 000 years ago and another 35 000 10 000 years ago this corresponds to oxygen isotope stage 6 and 2 respectively between 120 000 and 60 000 years ago there was no lake in death valley and separate saline lakes existed between 60 000 and 35 000 years ago lake levels in lake manly appear to track size of laurentide ice sheet but only very roughly so further last glacial maximum highstands of lake manly appear to precede highstands of lake lahontan and lake bonneville probably due to a northward shift of jet stream earliest highstands according to sedimentation patterns a southeastward flowing river occupied northern death valley during late miocene and was gone by 3 35 million years ago this river system started in cottonwood mountains possibly as far as last chance range and owens valley and passed through northern death valley into amargosa valley possibly into colorado river a pliocene stage is documented in southern death valley and a lake in furnace creek basin of northern death valley reached a highstand 3 35 million years ago a number of tephra layers provide controls on ages of this lake thus a very early lake existed in northern death valley between 3 5 and 1 7 million years ago or between 3 4 and 3 million years ago probably coinciding with beginning development of a glacial climate in north america at that time such a lake was connected with owens valley because coso volcanic field tuffs have been found in death valley basins occupied by early lakes were probably not same as those of lake manly tectonic deformation has lifted nova basin above current floor of death valley this lake was most likely of limited extent 1 7 1 9 million year old glass mountain tuffs formed deposits in such early lakes in early and middle pleistocene amargosa river and mojave river ended in terminal lakes before reaching death valley and it is not clear that owens river could overflow from panamint valley into death valley tephra interbedded with lake deposits indicates that a pre lake manly existed between 1 2 0 8 million and 665 000 years before present simultaneous highstands in other great basin lakes such as lake bonneville may be correlated with this lake stage which occurred during marine isotope stage 16 it is not clear whether this was one lake or several disconnected lakes other old lake stands may have occurred 510 000 years ago and 216 000 194 000 years before present shorelines from latter stand are presently at altitudes of existence of lake manly 1 000 000 600 000 years ago is possible but questionable yet older lake formations have been variously dated between 3 7 and 0 77 million years ago these formations are known as lake manly phase 1 or lake zabriskie blackwelder highstand highest shoreline at elevations of has been named blackwelder stand after a researcher who first examined fossil shorelines it appears to belong to first illinoian stage of lake but was originally thought to belong to second wisconsinian stage during oxygen isotope stage 6 additional shorelines associated with this highstand are found at elevations of uranium thorium dating has linked this shoreline to older highstand about 186 000 120 000 years before present an alternative proposal linking blackwelder stand with a wet period in lake searles 1 3 1 million years ago conflicts with other dates uranium thorium dates and others of blackwelder stand are not beyond all doubts however a brief dry period may have occurred 148 000 years ago possibly caused by a temporary damming of amargosa river ostracod data indicates two separate highstands 154 500 149 000 and 122 000 120 000 years ago depending on rate of tectonic sinking lake at early stage was and up to deep sperry terrace in amargosa canyon appears to be of same general age as blackwelder highstand during this time amargosa river and owens river reached lake manly ostracod fossils from this lake stage suggest that lake s conditions varied during this timespan this shoreline is found at mormon point shoreline butte and elsewhere in northern death valley but not in south one theory states that shorelines at elevations of salt spring and saddle springs and mesquite spring at soda lake are blackwelder shorelines that were offset by tectonic deformation at a geologically reasonable rate of such would imply that soda lake and silver lake during blackwelder stand were connected with lake manly this theory is known as mega lake manly such an expansion would have occurred whenever lake levels rose above above sea level and thus could flow south across salt spring hills enlargement of lake surface that resulted would have increased evaporation and stabilized lake levels there is no clear cut evidence that these shorelines are of same age as blackwelder shoreline although they are of similar appearance spread of pupfish between mojave river and death valley drainages would also be more likely with such a lake configuration there is no indication that soda lake playa had a lake during oxygen isotope stage 6 although water currents in a previous lake may have transported sands that are usually only found in ephemeral lakes through a deeper lake further based on dating shorelines at salt spring appear to belong to later lake stage and tectonic deformation required to link two southern shorelines to blackwelder has been deemed implausible and has not been supported by analysis of shorelines themselves a final explanation assumes that during that stage lake manly did not extend into southern death valley blackwelder highstand was probably not stabilized by overflow seeing as only spillway close to ludlow is about high above sea level considerably higher than blackwelder highstand could plausibly be and highest shorelines at shoreline butte and lake mojave are considerably lower additionally development of stable shorelines does not by default require an overflow as demonstrated by dead sea and its precursor lake lisan later lake stages by 130 000 120 000 years ago lake manly had retreated from blackwelder highstand a further lake stage may have occurred during oxygen isotope stage 4 but evidence is equivocal ostracod fossils dated between 129 000 and 123 000 years ago indicate that death valley was wetter than today and supported several hydrological environments between 54 000 and 50 000 years ago various shallow phases of lake manly occurred later lake stage which occurred during wisconsin glaciation glaciation was not as large as blackwelder lake stage at first it was suggested that only small lakes occupied death valley during that time later lake was shallower with dated at 25 000 and 18 000 years before present having formed at elevations of that lake was probably shallow with estimated depths of later research indicated that late lake manly was even shallower probably because regional climate conditions favorable to its growth were rarer during later lake stage than at blackwelder times and might have even been split into two separate waterbodies further it may have been dominated more by groundwater discharge in general chronology of this recent lake stage is not very clear last glacial maximum lake had a surface area of about this lake stage had highstands approximately 26 000 18 000 and 12 000 years before present which have been named dvlp 1 death valley late pleistocene lake high stand dvlp 2 and dvlp 3 respectively some radiocarbon dates have been obtained on this lake including 12 980 700 and 11 900 200 recession commenced before 12 970 185 years ago present day thumb a reformed lake in 2005 by 12 000 years before present lake manly had shrunk to badwater basin and was probably only deep this drying event separated various cyprinodon populations from each other triggering evolution of individual species with restricted distribution based on state of preservation of shoreline deposits e g at hanaupah fan retreat of lake was probably much faster than its growth lake had vanished by 10 000 years ago although some evidence for a holocene lake has been found a minor lacustrine period occurred between 5 000 and 2 000 years ago this lake was larger than lake mead and probably existed for less than 100 years its shorelines have been found at elevations of since then only a pond in badwater basin remains and valley is hot and dry rest of valley floor is filled with mudflats and salt pans salt creek and some springs are only freshwater present floods of mojave river are lost before reaching death valley current evaporation rates and climate conditions do not allow existence of perennial lakes in death valley bulk of present day water in death valley is supplied by groundwater discharge amargosa river is mostly underground but occasionally it can flood and reach death valley parts of death valley are sometimes flooded during wet weather causing parts of lake manly to reform legend has it that such happens only every hundred years severe flooding in march 2005 resulted in parts of death valley becoming submerged this precipitation event broke records dating back to 1911 and was followed by a major desert bloom such lake are usually associated with el nino events references sources external links a transient numerical lumped parameter isotopic
