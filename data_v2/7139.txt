reflections on having left a place of retirement is a poem written by english poet samuel taylor coleridge in 1796 like his earlier poem eolian harp poem discusses coleridge s understanding of nature and his married life which was suffering from problems that developed after previous poem overall poem focuses on humanity s relationship with nature in its various aspects ranging from experiencing an edenic state to having to abandon a unity with nature in order to fulfill a moral obligation to humanity discussion of man s obligation to each other leads into a discussion on difference between life of a philosopher and life of a poet by end of poem narrator follows philosophical path in a manner similar to what coleridge sought to do response to poem from critics was mostly positive with many of them emphasizing religious aspects of poem in their analysis background after marrying sara fricker in autumn 1795 coleridge left their home at clevedon and began to travel throughout england in order to meet with various philosophers and political theorists in part he was trying to meet with people so he could raise subscriptions for his various works during this time he would write home constantly to his pregnant wife and was concerned about her state of health his feelings of guilt along with a fever that he treated with laudanum affected him greatly and caused him to express these feelings in a letter to josiah wade on 10 february 1796 ashton 1997 p 80 my past life seems to me like a dream a feverish dream all one gloomy huddle of strange actions and dim discovered motives friendships lost by indolence and happiness murdered by mismanaged sensibilities ashton 1997 qtd p 80 after letter coleridge returned to his wife who was now living with her family at redcliffe hill bristol as he wrote eolian harp to commemorate coming to his home at clevedon coleridge composed reflections on having left a place of retirement on leaving it ashton 1997 pp 80 81 poem was not included in coleridge s 1796 collection of poems as it was probably still incomplete but it was published in october 1796 monthly 2001 p 260 under title reflections on entering into active life a poem which affects not to be poetry ashton 1997 p 139 reflections was included in coleridge s 28 october 1797 collection of poems and collections that followed of his early poems coleridge believed that reflections was his best yarlott 1967 p 109 poem poem begins with an idealisation of a valley of seclusion sisman 2006 p 129 in open air our blossom d and across porch thick twined little landscape round was green and woody and refresh d eye it was a spot which you might aptly call valley of seclusion lines 4 9 poem continues with a goodbye to 1997 p 81 and asks if his life of pleasure was appropriate i was constrain d to quit you was it right while my d brethren toil d and bled that i should dream away entrusted hours on rose leaf beds pampering coward heart with feelings all too delicate for use lines 44 48 narrator describes reasons why he is leaving clevedon along with allowance of remembering his former life there after his work is done radley 1966 p 48 i therefore go and join head heart and hand active and firm to fight bloodless fight of science freedom and truth in christ yet oft when after honourable toil rests tir d mind and waking loves to dream my spirit shall revisit thee dear cot lines 60 65 themes themes of reflections are connected to coleridge s eolian harp as scene for both is same land of clevedon is praised and seen full of life and it serves as contrast to escaping from real world into fantasy and pondering about abstract both poems also describe coleridge s relationship with his wife and feelings of sexual desire holmes 1989 p 103 imagination aspects of poem represent an unwillingness to accept nature on its own and rejects conclusion of eolian harp although land of clevedon can bring one closer to god one cannot just simply exist in such an area but must seek out truth radley 1966 pp 47 48 feeling need to seek out truth creates a separation between mind of a poet and mind of a philosopher poem reconciles two by allowing pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and god s presence however philosopher aspect is dominant and individual must go out and try to help humanity nature can be soothing but narrator must reject edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate radley 1966 pp 48 49 edenic imagery figures into many of coleridge s poems and is reinforced with image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry in reflections to dwell in an edenic state is a paradise in which narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore problems of world like a coward instead individual is compelled to join with humanity and even lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all harding 1974 pp 46 47 image of nature and other themes reappears in fears in solitude 1798 later poem recreates valley of seclusion image in form of a dell even image of a passerby looking in on cottage found in reflection is repeated similarly compulsion to enter into world and help humanity is included but it is altered from being motivated by guilt to a warning message against a possible invasion from outside forces as such fears in solitude does not seek to leave location to help humanity but to stay as a protector over his family yarlott 1967 pp 118 119 in coleridge s own life he tried to follow path of philosopher but 10 july 1834 entry in table talk admits that he was unable to do so jasper 1985 p 134 so i own i wish life and strength had been spared to me to complete my philosophy for as god hears me originating continuing and sustaining wish and design in my heart were to exalt glory of his name and which is same thing in other words to promote improvement of humanity but deo and his will be done jasper 1985 qtd p 135 in terms of coleridge s marriage reflections differs from eolian harp by saying that there were problems within marriage especially with it distracting coleridge from nature and world outside of home that he shared with his wife poem expresses feelings of solitude and confinement and there is a difference between worlds inside and outside of cottage in a similar manner to focus found within coleridge s kubla khan this is especially true with a focus from private to public spheres within outside world poem s narrator is separate from humanity but his focus is ever on humanity and contains both a religious and political component image of one life within poem compels him to abandon sensual pleasures of cottage and to pursue a path of helping humanity yarlott 1967 pp 97 98 sources besides natural relationship of poem with land of clevedon there are literary connections within poem poem begins with a line from horace although in many versions it is misquoted line is from horace s satires 1 4 42 and is intended to describe work as a whole as connecting to prose second stanza where narrator describes dial hill as stony mount is connected to william crowe s lewesdon hill 1788 it is possible that reflections could have been an imitation of crowe s poetry mays 2001 pp 260 262 in terms of edenic imagery including types of plant life coleridge s are connected to john milton s paradise lost book four harding 1974 p 46 critical response critical review saw favor with to river otter and reflections in their review of 1797 collection of coleridge s poem holmes 1989 p 148 july review claims that poem evince a feeling heart comparison between weeping eyes of a humane friend and unmoved face of another equally benevolent and contrast between latter and those who merely affect sympathy are well drawn jackson 1996 qtd p 42 during 20th century virginia radley declares that reflections although not so striking in imagery as is eolian harp still has much to recommend it in this respect impression left with reader that cottage and its surroundings are lovely quiet and peaceful is a paramount one while dead lines do not move reader at all except to make him wonder if move from clevedon for cause of humanity was a necessary one richard haven argues that poem s image of moral path is weak because returned traveller can only dismiss his ascent to another mode of being as a pleasant but useless memory haven 1969 pp 50 53 anthony harding believes it is important to recognize that it steps outside idyllic but circumscribed scene of eolian harp and admits impossibility in a fallen world of human self sufficiency harding 1974 p 48 oswald doughty states that most important additions to coleridge s 1797 edition of poems included reflections doughty 1981 p 127 richard holmes points out that both reflections and eolian harp mark a new stage in coleridge s exploration of sacred relations between man and nature which gradually become more serious and impassioned as they carry increasingly theological implications behind his romanticism holmes 1989 p 104 notes references ashton rosemary life of samuel taylor coleridge oxford blackwell 1997 doughty oswald perturbed
