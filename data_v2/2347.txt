dismissed in kokoda track campaign as a young officer rowell served at gallipoli but was invalided back to australia with typhoid fever in january 1916 end of war found rowell junior in rank to his

corps in kokoda track campaign but was sacked his subsequent rise to become chief of general staff demonstrated that circumstances of his dismissal in 1942 were indeed extraordinary early life sydney

second wife zella jane nee williams he acted as an unofficial batman to his father who was colonel commanding south australian brigade from 1907 to 1911 rowell was educated at adelaide high school and was one of first cadets to enter royal military college duntroon when it opened in 1911 first world war on 15 september 1914 rowell and his classmates were commissioned as first lieutenants in australian imperial force aif at time rowell s class had not yet completed its military training aif s commander major general william throsby bridges decided that regimental duty would rectify that deficiency so he allotted duntroon cadets as regimental officers of aif rather than as staff officers cost of this decision was high of 134 commissioned in time to serve at front 42 were killed and 38 wounded cadets were posted to units being formed in their home states so rowell was posted to 10th infantry battalion when he discovered that 3rd light horse regiment was to be commanded by his cousin lieutenant colonel f m rowell sydney obtained permission to swap places with another member of his duntroon class lieutenant eric wilkes talbot smith it was a fateful decision smith was fatally wounded on anzac day rowell contracted pneumonia and did not embark with main body of 3rd light horse regiment instead he left with its first reinforcements on hmat thirty six on 21 december 1914 rowell joined regiment in heliopolis in january next month he broke his left leg in a riding accident for a time it looked like rowell would again miss embarkation of his regiment but intervention of his father ensured that he reached anzac cove with 3rd light horse on 12 may 1915 rowell sydney fairbairn naa act rowell sydney fairbairn he was evacuated sick to egypt and then malta in july and returned to his regiment at quinn s post in august rowell was promoted to temporary rank of captain on 9 september briefly assuming command of a squadron before becoming regimental adjutant three days later in november rowell was again evacuated to egypt this time with typhoid fever disease that had killed his cousin on 20 january 1916 rowell was returned to australia because of a policy that a regular officer once invalided to australia could not again be posted overseas rowell s period of active service was over he was posted along with several other duntroon graduates who had been invalided home to duntroon as an instructor at officers training school this was closed in june 1917 and rowell was posted to staff of 4th military district in adelaide between wars on 20 august 1919 at chalmers church north terrace adelaide rowell married blanche may murison daughter of a scottish engineer blanche had served in royal australian army nursing corps in australia during war due to his brief overseas service end of war found rowell still a lieutenant and thus junior in rank to his contemporaries but snail like pace of promotions between wars allowed him to gradually catch up he was promoted to captain on 1 january 1920 major on 1 january 1926 and brevet rank lieutenant colonel on 1 july 1935 with substantive rank on 1 january 1936 his inter war career consisted of a long series of staff postings interspersed with training courses in 1924 rowell passed staff college examination for one of two australian spots qualifying in first place gave him a choice between staff college camberley and its counterpart at quetta and rowell chose former attending from 1925 to 1926 at this time commandant was major general edmund ironside staff included colonel j f c fuller and lieutenant colonels alan brooke and bernard montgomery fellow students included captains frank messervy and francis from 1935 to 1937 rowell was on exchange to british army as a staff officer with

lieutenant colonel george pearkes from canada other students included lieutenant colonel william slim and wing commander keith park for his staff work rowell was made an officer of order of british empire in king s birthday honours in 1938 rowell returned to australia to become director of military operations and intelligence at army headquarters in melbourne but in august 1938 he became staff officer to inspector general lieutenant general ernest squires partly because rowell was recognised as one of ablest of early duntroon graduates but also because he had spent five of previous thirteen years with british army or at british staff colleges government s decision to appoint a british officer to produce an authoritative report into army was widely seen as demonstrating government s lack of confidence in its own officer corps squires first recommendation was to restructure military districts into four commands this required legislation amending defence act and was not implemented until october 1939 second recommendation was formation of a regular brigade death of prime minister joseph lyons in april 1939 and his subsequent replacement by robert menzies caused this to be

staff rowell joined second australian imperial force aif and was given aif service number gavin long described rowell as clear and incisive in thought sensitive in feeling frank and outspoken in approach to men and to problems five recent years of service either at english staff colleges or on exchange duty made it probable that wherever he went his opposite numbers in british formations would be men with whom he had previously worked and played comparing him to aa qmg colonel george alan vasey long noted that both were not only efficient soldiers but men of commanding temperament and talent rowell was promoted to colonel on 13 october 1939 and when government decided to form i corps in april 1940 blamey was given command and rowell became brigadier general staff bgs with rank of brigadier blamey and rowell prepared i corps for operations as best they could completing force s structure and integrating new units as they arrived in middle east rowell strove to establish good relations with british army while occasionally having to remind them that aif was answerable to its own commander in chief and its own government rowell s efforts to create an administrative headquarters to free i corps staff for operational duties foundered on blamey s reluctance to delegate authority best that he could achieve was creation of a base and line of communications units command under brigadier allan boase but i corps remained responsible for organisation and training i corps part in western desert campaign was brief its headquarters opened near benghazi on 15 february 1941 replacing british xiii corps rowell studied prospects of an advance on tripoli but headquarters was recalled to egypt on 24 february to participate in battle of greece nonetheless for his part rowell was mentioned in despatches and appointed a commander of order of british empire greece in greece i corps was employed as such for first time campaign was another short one but very trying on participants just three days after headquarters opened on 5 april 1941 germans broke through and corps was thrown into a retreat that eventually led to its re embarkation blamey and his staff worked under tremendous pressure operational situation was precarious and german air attacks were frequent rowell later wrote tempers flared when i corps headquarters was ordered to evacuate to egypt blamey s aide recalled if rowell felt that blamey had shown a lack of moral courage in failing to stand up to political and military superiors who had directed ill fated campaign blamey felt that campaign had revealed flaws in rowell s character he wrote to chief of general staff lieutenant general vernon sturdee for his part in campaign in greece rowell was mentioned in despatches a second time syria i corps was alerted to take part in syria lebanon campaign although blamey having been promoted to deputy commander in chief middle east command it lacked a commanding officer apparently general sir henry maitland wilson believed that i corps loss of transport and signal equipment precluded it from participating in campaign from outset instead wilson attempted to exercise command from king david hotel this proved to be a serious error as his staff were preoccupied with political and administrative issues and were too remote from battlefields to exercise close command required something that rowell foresaw following a series of reverses rowell predicted on 16 june that it won t be long now i corps headquarters was sent for on 18 june and lieutenant general john lavarack assumed command that day defence of australia in august 1941 rowell returned to australia to take up post of deputy chief of general staff dcgs with rank of major general he expected that his main task would be to support aif but it turned out primary concern was looming war with japan which broke out soon after it was at this juncture that rowell was approached by major general george vasey who had a scheme to retire all officers over age of fifty and making major general horace robertson commander in chief presumably vasey expected rowell as a fellow duntroon graduate to be sympathetic a heated argument ensued ending with rowell telling vasey that if he weren t so bloody big i d toss him out of room rowell immediately went to sturdee who had lavarack with him and told him what had transpired in blamey s subsequent shake up of higher command arrangements rowell was appointed to command i corps this was his first command since his three day stint in command of a light horse squadron at gallipoli he became first duntroon graduate to command a corps and first to be promoted to rank of lieutenant general old i corps headquarters was largely absorbed into lavarack s new first army headquarters so a new one was formed from headquarters southern command initially located in melbourne it soon moved to esk queensland kokoda track thumb rowell at port moresby in september 1942 on 31 july 1942 blamey informed rowell that i corps headquarters would be sent to port moresby to control operations in new guinea rowell arrived in port moresby on 13 august 1942 and assumed command of new guinea force from major general basil morris rowell s i corps headquarters took over operational control from morris s which became that of angau only warning that morris had of rowell s arrival was a message from dcgs vasey which simply said syd is coming situation was dire japanese were steadily advancing on port moresby along kokoda trail and were also threatening milne bay and wau rowell and his staff were all seasoned officers with combat experience in middle east and battle of malaya and brought to new guinea skill and organisation that morris and his staff had been unable to provide however main body of rowell s staff did not arrive until 17 august rowell turned down a suggestion from blamey that he needed additional base staff to cope with his administrative problems given that a corps headquarters was a tactical headquarters intended to operate as part of an army with latter handling most of administrative work to goc ngf 21 september 1942 naa vic 6 2 401 92 rowell s staff gradually discovered how enormous task before them was they had few maps only transport aircraft were destroyed in a japanese raid and supplies that had been forwarded by air to kokoda could not be located rowell refused to give general douglas macarthur s general headquarters ghq in brisbane a ball to ball description of action sending only factual information at stated times failure to keep ghq up to date could only lead to fears of worst which were confirmed when major general george kenney reported that in his opinion port moresby would soon fall unless something drastic was done and rowell was defeatist on 17 september general macarthur discussed situation in new guinea with prime minister john curtin on he pointed out that while japanese faced all same difficulties as australian troops fighting on kokoda track japanese were advancing and australians were retreating and whole situation seemed to macarthur to be a lot like malaya he recommended that general blamey be sent up to new guinea to take personal command of situation blamey took over command of new guinea force but not i corps difference was academic insofar as there was only one staff blamey wrote a letter to rowell to explain situation in advance of his arrival in port moresby on 23 september rowell took it very badly he wrote to major general cyril clowes at milne bay on 25 september at macarthur s suggestion blamey flew to milne bay with brigadier general kenneth walker and ordered clowes to send a force by air to this would be an important step forward rowell kenney noted was not even consulted anymore rowell was furious at blamey bypassing him blamey reported back to prime minister curtin that exile on further consideration blamey decided that he might need stevens a first rate fighter and that it would be better to send rowell to middle east although such a move would involve rowell being reduced in rank to major general so as to be junior to morshead blamey to curtin 3 october 1942 naa act a5954 266 1 rowell paid a visit to macarthur in brisbane on his way south macarthur was unimpressed he told prime minister that rowell s attitude to a superior officer in a theatre of active operations was quite unpardonable and hoped for rowell s sake that there would be no enquiry into matter macarthur was

director of tactical investigation at war office in london vice lieutenant general alfred reade godwin austen at instigation of richard casey despite important sounding title and a high powered staff
