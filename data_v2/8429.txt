on august 25 wave decreased its forward speed while approaching a large low level circulation over southern mexico a broad area of disturbed weather formed in association with wave and low level circulation and after persisting for several days developed a smaller low level circulation on august 29 about 575 miles 925 km south southeast of cabo san lucas on august 31 two primary areas of convection were well removed from center by early on september 1 despite a lack of convective organization low cloud circulation was sufficiently well defined that national hurricane center designated

depression initially tracked slowly north northwestward and gradually strengthened late on september 1 it intensified into tropical storm isis while located about 200 miles 320 km south of cabo san lucas upon becoming a tropical storm deep convection was not organized causing one forecaster to describe isis as a large monsoon like system a mid level trough extending southward from arizona california border caused storm to accelerate northward storm quickly strengthened six hours after isis became a tropical storm it reached winds of 70 mph 115 km h very deep symmetrical convection developed over poorly defined center of circulation while banding features began to form although ill defined outflow and land interaction with baja california peninsula initially prevented further strengthening at 1200 utc on september 2 isis made landfall on extreme southeastern baja california sur as a strong tropical storm and subsequently turned to north northeast after entering gulf of
