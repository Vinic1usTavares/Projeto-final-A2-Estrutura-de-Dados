thumb romanticised victorian painting of jeremiah horrocks observing 1639 transit of venus founder of english astronomy by eyre crowe 1891 first known observations and recording of a transit of venus were made in 1639 by english astronomers jeremiah horrocks and his friend and correspondent william crabtree pair made their observations independently on 4 december that year 24 november under julian calendar then used in england horrocks from carr house then in village of much hoole lancashire and crabtree from his home in broughton near manchester friends followers of new astronomy of johannes kepler were self taught mathematical astronomers who had worked methodically to correct and improve kepler s rudolphine tables by observation and measurement in 1639 horrocks was only astronomer to realise that a transit of venus was imminent others became aware of it only after event when horrocks s report of it was circulated although friends both died within five years of making their observations their ground breaking work was influential in establishing size of solar system for this and their other achievements horrocks and crabtree along with their correspondent william gascoigne are considered to be founding fathers of british research astronomy background thumb right kepler s de raris mirisque anni 1631 notice to astronomers of impending transits of mercury and venus 1631 by 17th century two developments allowed for transits of planets across face of sun to be predicted and observed telescope and new astronomy of johannes kepler which assumed elliptical rather than circular planetary orbits in 1627 kepler published his rudolphine tables two years later he published extracts from tables in his pamphlet de raris mirisque anni 1631 which included an ad warning to astronomers concerning a transit of mercury in 1631 and transits of venus in 1631 and 1761 mercury transit occurred as predicted and was observed by johann baptist in innsbruck johannes remus in and pierre gassendi in paris vindicating keplerian approach but their observations threw into question previous theories about solar system as mercury was shown to be much smaller than expected although kepler s calculations indicated that 1631 transit of venus would best be visible from american continent he was not fully confident of his prediction and advised that european astronomers should be prepared to observe event gassendi and others in europe watched for it but as predicted sun was below horizon during transit according to modern calculations observers in much of italy and along eastern mediterranean should have been able to view last stage of transit but no such observations were recorded kepler had predicted a near miss for a venus transit in 1639 and as next full transit was not expected for another 121 years gassendi and other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas jeremiah horrocks jeremiah horrocks 1618 3 january 1641 was born in lower lodge toxteth park now part of liverpool but at that time a separate town his father james was a watchmaker and his mother mary aspinwall was from a notable toxteth park family several members of aspinwall family were also in watchmaking trade and it is said that a watchmaker uncle first interested jeremiah in astronomy jeremiah joined emmanuel college on 11 may 1632 and matriculated as a member of university of cambridge on 5 july 1632 as a sizar which meant he did not have means to fully support himself and was given specific duties to compensate for a reduction in fees at cambridge he would have studied arts classical languages a little geometry and some traditional astronomy but not latest work by galileo tycho brahe and kepler he used his spare time to teach himself more demanding mathematical astronomy and familiarise himself with latest thinking horrocks read most of astronomical treatises of his day identified their weaknesses and was suggesting new lines of research by age of 17 in 1635 he left cambridge without formally graduating presumably owing to cost of graduation ceremony after leaving cambridge horrocks returned to his home in lancashire and began collecting books and instruments in order to pursue his main interest study of astronomy in summer of 1639 he left home and moved about 18 miles along coast to village of much hoole this was probably to become tutor to children of stones family prosperous haberdashers who lived at carr house within bank hall estate horrocks was first to demonstrate that moon moved in an elliptical path around earth he also wrote a treatise on keplerian astronomy and began to explore mathematically properties of force that became known as gravity decades later isaac newton acknowledged horrocks s

a lancashire farmer of comfortable means and isabel crabtree nee pendleton he was educated at a grammar school in manchester probably forerunner of manchester grammar school which was then situated between collegiate church and what is now chetham s school of music he worked in manchester married into a wealthy family and in his spare time studied mathematics and astronomy he carefully measured movements of planets undertook precise astronomical calculations and rewrote existing rudolphine tables with improved accuracy he maintained an active correspondence much of it now lost with horrocks

dictionary of scientific biography 2008 retrieved may 10 2012 from encyclopedia com http www encyclopedia com doc html it is not known whether horrocks and crabtree ever met in person but from 1636 they corresponded regularly and because of their shared interest in work of johannes kepler referred to themselves along with william gascoigne as nos we crabtree s observations had convinced him that despite their errors kepler s rudolphine tables were superior to commonly used s tables and he became one of first converts to kepler s new astronomy by 1637 he had convinced horrocks of superiority of keplerian system and using their own planetary observations both men made many corrections to kepler s tables which crabtree converted to decimal form transit of mercury on 29 september 1638 horrocks wrote to crabtree about a likely forthcoming transit of mercury on 21 october 1638 old style which kepler had not predicted he explained that he intended to construct what would later be called a by attaching his telescope to an oblong stick carrying a plane surface at right angles to itself on which to receive sun s image and that he would draw a circle with numerical markings on a sheet of paper on which to project image of sun in event no such transit took place as mercury passed over sun well outside limit for a transit but exercise proved to be an important dry run for later observation of transit of venus in october 1639 horrocks had calculated that transits of venus occur not singly but in pairs eight years apart and realised that second transit would occur in less than four weeks he was convinced that a measurement could be made of apparent diameter of planet to within a fraction of a second of arc when it was seen as a dull black disk on face of sun compared to an accuracy of around one minute of arc when seen in its normal position as bright morning star close to sun he wrote to his younger brother and to crabtree in broughton advising them to observe event on sunday 24 november 4 december new style to quote horrocks more accurate calculations of very much confirmed my expectations and i rejoiced exceedingly in prospect of seeing venus observation of

observation thumb an image of solar disk hevelius added to his report based on horrocks s description of his observation image does not however give a true representation of what horrocks would have seen horrocks was concerned that weather would be unfavourable for transit as he believed rare planetary conjunction would produce severe weather at around midday on 23 november horrocks darkened his room and focused rays of sunlight coming through window onto paper where image could be observed safely at his location in much hoole latitude of which he determined to be 53deg 35 he calculated that transit should begin at about 3 00 pm on sunday 24th but he began his observations previous day fearing that he might miss event if his calculations proved to be inaccurate on sunday he began observing at sunrise weather was cloudy but he first saw tiny black shadow of venus crossing sun at about 3 15 pm and observed for half an hour until sunset at 3 53 pm quote text when time of observation approached i retired to my apartment and having closed windows against light i directed my telescope previously adjusted to a focus through aperture towards sun and received his rays at right angles upon paper i watched carefully on 24th from sunrise to nine o clock and from a little before ten until noon and at one in afternoon being called away in intervals by business of highest importance which for these ornamental pursuits i could not with propriety neglect about fifteen minutes past three in afternoon when i was again at liberty to continue my labours clouds as if by divine interposition were entirely dispersed i then beheld a most agreeable spectacle object of my sanguine wishes a spot of unusual magnitude and of a perfectly circular shape which had already fully entered upon sun s disk on left not doubting that this was really shadow of planet i immediately applied myself sedulously to observe it although venus continued on disk for several hours she was not visible to me longer than half an hour on account of sun so quickly setting inclination was only point upon which i failed to attain utmost precision for owing to rapid motion of sun it was difficult to observe with certainty to a single degree but all rest is sufficiently accurate and as exact as i could desire sign jeremiah horrocks source venus in sole visa crabtree made his observations using a similar set up but had insufficient time to make any measurements as it was cloudy in broughton and thus he only saw transit briefly according to horrocks rapt in contemplation he stood for some time scarcely trusting his own senses through excess of joy in a little while clouds again obscured face of sun so that he could observe nothing more than that venus was certainly on disc at time afterwards he made so rapid a sketch of venus as it had passed across sun s disc allowing crabtree to estimate angular size of venus to be 1 3 accurate to within 1 second of arc of its actual size horrocks s estimate of 1 12 was less accurate results kepler had found that distance between planets increased in proportion to their distance from sun and this led him to assume that universe was created with a divine harmony and that size of planets would increase in same way he had written in 1618 nothing is more in concord with nature than that order of magnitude should be same as order of spheres when horrocks s measurements of venus coupled with some erroneous measurements by kepler and gassendi seemed to confirm this horrocks tentatively proposed a law which stated that all planets with exception of mars would be same angular size when viewed from sun this being 28 arc seconds this meant that assumption kepler had made about sizes of planets held true and led horrocks to false conclusion that distance between each planet and sun was about 15 000 times its radius thus he estimated average distance from earth to sun to be approximately 60 million miles 97 million km suggesting that solar system was ten times larger than traditionally believed his figure was much lower than 93 million miles 150 million km that astronomical unit is known to be today but despite being based on a false premise was more accurate than any suggested up to that time by 1640 william gascoigne had developed a reticle and a micrometer for his telescope both of which would have been invaluable to horrocks he showed them to crabtree who told horrocks about them and reported back to gascoigne saying my friend mr horrox that little touch i gave him hath ravished his mind quite from itself and left him in an between admiration and amazement i beseech you sir slack not your intentions for perfection of your begun wonders horrocks produced several drafts of a latin treatise venus

by some of drafts of venus in sole visa were kept by crabtree who died in 1644 three years after horrocks their other correspondent william gascoigne died same year in battle of marston moor horrocks s papers remained with his family for a short time some were destroyed during civil war some were taken to ireland by a brother jonas and never seen again and others passed into collection of antiquarian and astronomer christopher towneley where they were consulted by jeremy shakerley who wrote three books on astronomy in mid 17th century others were destroyed in great fire of london in 1666 manuscripts were widely circulated from late 1650s although they remained unpublished for many years coronation of king charles ii took place on 23 april 1661 3 may new style day of a mercury transit across sun dutch astronomer christiaan huygens attended coronation during which he heard about horrocks s manuscript found in 1659 by john worthington master of jesus college cambridge and alumnus of emmanuel college where he was a contemporary of horrocks together with some fragments of correspondence with crabtree huygens knew eminent polish astronomer johannes hevelius and gave him manuscript copy hevelius appended manuscript to his report on mercury transit mercurius in sole published in 1662 publication of venus in sole visa by hevelius caused great consternation at newly founded royal society when it was realised that such an elegant and important paper by an englishman had been neglected in his own country for so long mathematician john wallis who was a friend of horrocks at emmanuel college and a founder member and leading light of society summed up view of its members when he wrote i cannot help being displeased that this valuable observation purchasable with no money elegantly described and prepared for press should have laid for two and twenty years and that no one should have been found to take charge of so fair an offspring at its father s death to bring to light a treatise of such importance to astronomy and to preserve a work for our country s credit and for advantage of mankind royal society assumed responsibility for publication of most of remainder of horrocks s work as opera in 1672 73 recording of transit is seen by many as birth of modern astronomy in britain john flamsteed later said he regarded horrocks crabtree and gascoigne as founding fathers of british research astronomy and intellectual heirs to galileo and kepler and began his three folio volume historia coelestis britannica 1745 by printing five pages of their letters and observations made between 1638 and 1643 commemorations thumb thumb plaque commemorating crabtree s observation near his home in broughton during 19th century there was a revival of interest in horrocks s and crabtree s achievement rev a b whatton who translated venus in sole visa from latin assumed that horrocks s comment about business of highest importance which for these ornamental pursuits i could not with propriety neglect must have referred to duties of a curate although it seems more probable they were his duties as tutor at house or perhaps his business was merely to attend church notion of impoverished curate gained popular traction and in 1874 after much lobbying a memorial was mounted in westminster abbey opposite to that of newton which reads in memory of jeremiah horrocks curate of hoole in lancashire who died on 3rd of jan 1641 in or near his 22nd year having in so short a life detected long inequality in mean motion of jupiter and saturn discovered orbit of moon to be an ellipse determined motion of lunar apse suggested physical cause of its revolution and of venus which was seen by himself and his friend william crabtree on sunday
