solar energy makes solar power plants a cleaner alternative to traditional power plants which burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal national renewable energy laboratory 2001 concentrating solar power energy from mirrors retrieved december 18 2008 solar power stations provide an environmentally benign source of energy produce virtually no emissions and consume no fuel other than sunlight some groups are also encouraging more distributed generation or rooftop solar in 2008 solar electricity was not cost competitive with bulk baseload power however it does provide electricity when and where power is most limited and most expensive which is a strategic contribution solar electricity mitigates risk of fuel price volatility and improves grid reliability since then costs have decreased to make solar electricity increasingly competitive while many of costs of fossil fuels are well known others pollution related health problems environmental degradation impact on national security from relying on foreign energy sources are indirect and difficult to calculate these are traditionally external to pricing system and are thus often referred to as externalities a corrective pricing mechanism such as a carbon tax could lead to renewable energy such as solar thermal power becoming cheaper to consumer than fossil fuel based energy solar thermal power plants can generally be built
