in your wardrobe was released in february 1974 and became band s first top 30 hit in uk album was recorded in august 1973 following tour supporting previous album foxtrot 1972 group set aside a short period of time to write new material which covered a number of themes including loss of english folk culture and an increased american influence which was reflected in title following album s release group set out on tour where they drew an enthusiastic reception from fans critics and band have given mixed opinions of album though guitarist steve hackett has said it is his favourite genesis record album has continued to sell and has reached gold certification by british phonographic industry and recording industry association of america it was remastered for cd in 1994 and 2007 several of album tracks became fan favourites and featured as a regular part of band s live setlist into 1980s background in may 1973 genesis line up of frontman and singer peter gabriel keyboardist tony banks bassist and guitarist mike rutherford guitarist steve hackett and drummer phil collins completed their 1972 1973 tour supporting their previous album foxtrot 1972 tour marked band s first full scale north american tour which drew positive responses but journalists were still criticising band and comparing them to other progressive rock bands of time such as emerson lake palmer jethro tull and pink floyd charisma pushed to release new genesis material to capitalise on band s newfound commercial success despite band s wishes against it and released a compilation of live recordings from early 1973 originally intended for broadcast on king biscuit flower hour radio show in us as their first live album genesis live 1973 this budget priced release also compensated for cancellation of a proposed gig at wembley arena in may 1973 which was cancelled due to inability to print tickets in time and to act as a bridging album in between foxtrot and next studio album it became their highest charting album in uk peaking at no 9 group were too busy touring to write new material so after coming off road they set aside time to create new songs due to success of foxtrot group s record label charisma records allowed them two to three months to come up with a new studio album which rutherford considered to be kiss of death early into sessions collins formed a pick up band with former yes guitarist peter banks for a few gigs and rutherford revealed in an interview to sounds in 1976 that there had been worries that phil might want to leave group despite this gabriel recalled this time as a relatively happy and calm period gabriel peter reissues interview 2007 at 00 54 01 01 production writing and recording album was not written in a single session or location and banks recalled group had some difficulty in coming up with musical ideas banks tony reissues interview 2007 at 01 01 02 15 extra time that charisma allowed caused band to adopt a more relaxed pace of working at first which included periods of unproductive work such as constant reworking of ideas to point where they no longer worked or those that led them back to where they started first sessions took place in what reporter jerry gilbert described as a rambling old stately home in chessington kingston upon thames group practising in living room causing neighbours to complain about noise and implicating a curfew hackett steve reissues interview 2007 at 03 20 03 43 collins did not remember album being particularly difficult to put together but said chessington sessions was where basis of cinema show was put together he had been listening to jazz fusion group mahavishnu orchestra which influenced him to play more complicated time signatures on drums for dancing with moonlit knight and other parts on album collins phil reissues interview 2007 at 04 02 04 25 rehearsals then moved to london in a space beneath una billings school of dance in shepherd s bush during which i know what i like in your wardrobe was developed further collins phil reissues interview 2007 at 04 36 04 41 hackett had not contributed a great deal of material to group at this point which was made difficult by breakdown of his first marriage going on around same time rather than pitch whole songs he instead devised guitar licks all of which were used and believed it gave album a jazz fusion feel yet still remain very english hackett steve reissues interview 2007 at 02 15 03 02 two sections that were brought into sessions from start were a simple guitar riff that hackett had been playing that band liked and wanted to develop further and became i know what i like in your wardrobe and three bits from banks that he initially thought were for different songs but were instead used in final arrangement of firth of fifth third section developed early on became opening of battle of epping forest and band repeatedly performed these three pieces daily for a short while which banks thought resulted in latter song being too overworked despite setbacks biographer robin platts wrote there were enough magic moments and inspired jam sessions to produce such enduring compositions one of ideas that gabriel wanted to convey with album was idea of looking at englishness in a different way this included his suggestion of album s title gabriel peter reissues interview 2007 at 00 10 00 31 itself a slogan adopted by labour party manifesto to ensure that british press would not accuse band of selling out to america rutherford later deemed title to be among band s best album titles rutherford mike reissues interview 2007 at 00 31 00 36 overall it represented a decay of english folk culture and an increase in americanisation banks said english theme across album was not an intentional idea at first but it is how songs merely ended up gabriel later said he wrote all his lyrical contributions to album in two days having rehearsed and written enough material for an album group entered island studios london in august 1973 as with foxtrot john burns helped with production burns technical skills resulted in a good recorded sound and environment and this motivated group to play better and tackle more complex arrangements gabriel was conscious of greater use of lengthy instrumental sections on album which he thought presented risk of material becoming boring songs side one dancing with moonlit knight evolved from a number of short piano pieces composed by gabriel which was combined with some of hackett s guitar figures to make up track gabriel added english themed lyrics to counter impression from music press that genesis were trying too hard to appeal to american audience including references to green shield stamps banks had upgraded to a new model of mellotron and used choir sound on track track ends with a series of 12 string guitar figures that were originally supposed to segue into cinema show to make a piece around 20 minutes in length but this idea was dropped as result was too comparable to 23 minute supper s ready on foxtrot its original working title was disney rutherford thought song s opening provided a good start to album but felt less enthusiastic towards it overall calling it a bit busy rutherford mike reissues interview 2007 at 00 44 00 53 i know what i like in your wardrobe came out of a jam session by group around one of hackett s guitar riffs he had presented riff to group previously but it had been rejected because it sounded too much like beatles gilbert described an early listening of song as hints of quaint english romanticism that according to gabriel was initially intended to have more of a folk oriented melody percussion sounds heard at beginning are gabriel playing with a talking drum that burns had purchased from nigeria it was released as a single from album which became first of group s to chart in uk banks wrote most of firth of fifth on his own and had presented it to group for foxtrot but it was rejected he reworked some sections of song for selling england by pound where it drew a more positive reception track opens with a solo piece for piano that is repeated by band later in song banks recalled difficulty to remove noise created by piano pedal in studio so he played passage without it which he found difficult hackett took one of banks piano figures and rearranged it as a guitar solo which dominates latter part of track banks later deemed lyrics to which he contributed with assistance from rutherford as one of worst sets of lyrics he had worked on he had aimed to follow idea of a river and then i got a bit caught up in cosmos and i don t quite know where i ended up more fool me is second of two songs other being for absent friends from nursery cryme to feature collins on lead vocals before he became band s lead singer in 1975 uncharacteristically for group s output at time song was a tender romantic ballad it was written quickly by collins and rutherford while sitting on steps outside recording studio gabriel considered pair s contributions quite a breakthrough side two battle of epping forest was inspired by a news story that gabriel had read several years previously about territorial battles by two rival gangs in east end of london that would fight in epping forest he placed an advertisement in times and looked through library archives in attempt to find more about story but was unable to find any further information so he created his own fictional characters including liquid len harold demure and bethnal green butcher upon hearing a rehearsal take of song in july 1973 reporter chris welch wrote battle has a catchy march theme with typical genesis drum and bass lines clean and precise lyrics have since been praised for their humour and wit but band later said they did not gel well with music and made piece complicated for sake of being so gabriel thought its ending which had each gang settling issue over toss of a coin tied up story well but is too much of an anti climax after ordeal is an instrumental written by hackett song originated as more of an electric piece but neither he nor other band members could adapt it into something that they felt worked so it was transformed with an acoustic introduction with an electric guitar solo to finish hackett steve reissues interview 2007 at 03 02 03 20 banks and gabriel did not want to include song on album but hackett insisted it should be kept banks expressed little interest in its pseudo classical style it was ultimately left on after gabriel and banks argued about length of cinema show which meant everything was included as a compromise banks later said compromise led to album overrunning its desirable length on vinyl resulting in a sound quality he thought came out as pretty rough thumb right tony banks performed keyboard solo on cinema show on an arp pro soloist cinema show is divided into two sections first section is a 12 string guitar based piece featuring vocal harmonies between gabriel and collins as well as a short flute and oboe solo song concludes with a four and a half minute keyboard solo on arp pro soloist with rutherford and collins playing a rhythm in a time signature lyrics written by banks and rutherford draw much of their inspiration from t s eliot poem waste land album closes with a segue from end of cinema show into aisle of plenty a reprise of dancing with moonlit knight which gives album a book end effect track uses word play such as easy love there s safe way home and thankful for her fine fair discount tess co operates referring to british supermarkets additional material a further set of lyrics and sketches were presented by peter gabriel for a song titled deja vu song was not further developed and not included on album however some forty years later steve hackett with blessing of peter gabriel completed music for song and it was featured in his 2019 genesis revisited tour at end of selling england by pound sleeve design album cover is a painting by betty swanwick titled dream swanwick had designed posters for london transport between 1930s and 1950s original painting did not include a lawn mower band had swanwick add it later as an allusion to track i know what i like because swanwick told them she did not have enough time to paint a new picture for cover release selling england by pound was released in october 1973 reaching no 3 in uk charts and no 70 on u s billboard pop albums chart album s success in u s benefitted from a switch from buddah records to atlantic i know what i like in your wardrobe was released as a single with twilight on b side in february 1974 it was band s first single to enter uk chart and peaked at no 21 it was successful enough for genesis to be invited to perform song on british television show top of pops which band declined in 2013 album was certified gold by british phonographic industry for selling 100 000 copies album was digitally remastered for compact disc in 1994 and again in 2007 by rhino records critical reception and legacy contemporary reviews for album were mixed rolling stones paul gambaccini praised band for attempting something utterly different amidst a stagnant pop scene but criticised album s lyrics feeling they overused british pop culture references and complained about some musical passages despite this gambaccini thought album merits some recognition nmes barbara charone said album was band s best most adventurous album to date guardians robin denselow wrote that much of material is and tedious writing for village voice in june 1974 robert christgau assessed record as down to earth progressive which means that it indulges in snooty satire about vulgar futility of working class youth would t s eliot be proud i doubt it but i have feeling that they re saying right out what all their co workers in genre are thinking and there s some pretty dense music here retrospective reviews have been more favourable allmusic and bbc music remarked that album returned to whimsical eccentricity of nursery cryme while retaining hard rock intensity and pessimism of foxtrot combining best of both elements to make genesis s best album up to that point christgau later writing in christgau s record guide rock albums of seventies 1981 admitted that songs firth of fifth and battle of epping forest have a complexity of tone that s pretty rare in any kind of art though he summarised rest of album by saying it sounds as snooty as usual in 2012 album ranked seventh in rolling stones readers poll your favorite prog rock albums of

towards album praising firth of fifth and cinema show but questioning some of other material motoring journalist and broadcaster jeremy clarkson is a fan of album and wrote sleeve notes for it when it was included in box set genesis 1970 1975 hackett has considered album to be his favourite genesis record and was happy with his extensive contributions to it in 2017 he explained it was an important watershed album for band and it was at beginning of us struggling to find gigs in states if we could get into a club somewhere wherever it was that was good news for us at that time a young struggling band but with an album that was due to become a classic in time banks and rutherford have had mixed feelings saying there are a lot of high points but also some lows charisma owner tony stratton smith was disappointed with album which he thought contained too many instrumental sections band friend and former roadie richard macphail thought power of genesis live had not been captured on record properly until burns started to work with them and that by time of selling england group had acquired better equipment selling england by pound has been praised by other songwriters and musicians rush drummer neil peart has said i think selling england by pound is an enduring masterpiece of drumming beautiful drumming lovely sound and arrangements i think they really nailed best of what that band as an entity could have done with that album fish solo artist and former lead singer of marillion has called it definitive genesis album praised its emotive quality said wordplay was one of things that became quite an influence on me games within lyrics and concluded it took a whole jump forward and was album that really got me into genesis john lennon said he really liked album during a radio interview which band took great encouragement from swedish guitarist yngwie malmsteen also cites album as a major influence tour thumb right upright peter gabriel during selling england by pound tour in 1974 dressed in costume genesis supported album with a tour of europe and north america from september 1973 to may 1974 initially they were to perform with a new and more elaborate stage set than before that included inflatable objects that had images projected onto them but a change in fire regulations following summerland disaster in august 1973 led to idea being scrapped gabriel devised new stories before songs and wore a full costume with a helmet and shield representing britannia character for dancing with moonlit knight and sung battle of epping forest with a stocking over his head tour began with a sold out tour of uk but had to cancel first date at green s playhouse glasgow due to electrical safety issues minutes before its start group realised they were substantially in debt and needed better management so recruited tony smith no relation to charisma boss tony stratton smith in october 1973 a pair of dates in tour were filmed by charisma for a possible cinema release but plan was rejected by band who felt film was not up to standard instead band performed a five song set in front of an invited audience at shepperton studios that was filmed and broadcast as tony
