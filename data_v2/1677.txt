was shifted from madras to trichinopoly a month later rajagopalachari intended to initiate a lines of dandi eastern coast to make salt at vedaranyam tanjore district madras presidency rajaji initially thought of choosing kanyakumari point where arabian sea bay of bengal and indian ocean confluence with each other since tncc had decided not to conduct satyagraha in non native states kanyakumari which was then a part of princely state of travancore was ruled out vedaratnam pillai an active congressman and a resident of vedaranyam convinced rajaji that his hometown be preferred destination rajaji agreed with his idea as there were convenient salt marshes at salt factory which was located near vedaranyam further pillai was also a licensee of salt factory and had knowledge about manufacturing of salt further rajaji was influenced by location of town it was a part of tanjore district which was a congress stronghold march as soon as venue was finalised rajaji made further preparations for march a government record pointed out that he was very much concerned about modeling march on lines of gandhi s dandi march he estimated that a minimum sum of was needed to organise rally he successfully managed to collect funds with help of of madurai and south indians in bombay and ahmedabad rajaji had formulated an advance guard that consisted of t s s rajan g ramachandran and thiruvannamalai n annamalai pillai even before march took off guard traveled along proposed route and met villagers to ensure support from them rajan was in charge of fixing halt points for march and took care of food and accommodation at each stage promulgation of section 157 of indian penal code made it a difficult task for rajan j a thorne district collector of tanjore issued a warning that those who provide food and accommodation to marchers shall be punished he tried his best by widely publicising his order throughout his jurisdiction committee had received nearly 1000 applications for participating in march after scrutinising applications rajaji selected a team of ninety eight volunteers most of them being young clerks students and graduates out of first batch twenty four were from madurai fifteen from tirunelveli twelve from ramanathapuram eleven from madras nine from nine from bombay seven from tanjore five from trichinopoly four from coimbatore and one each from north arcot

march commenced on 13 april 1930 coinciding with tamil new year from rajan s house in trichinopoly cantonment as soon as marchers reached tanjore rajaji avoided usual route to vedaranyam and instead chose a circuitous route via kumbakonam valangaiman semmangudi and thiruthuraipoondi as he hoped that marchers would receive hospitality in these places he had organised fifteen sub committees to ensure a smooth functioning of march idea was to gather enough support among people by drawing their attention they planned to cover a stretch of 10 miles each day for a period of about 15 days thus reaching destination before stipulated time madras government took a series of measures to bring an end to march it ordered district officers to organize public meetings to persuade people upon impracticability of march and issued orders to arrest participants of march other preventive measures included censoring news items related to march and taking actions against editors of nationalist

its astute and energetic collector j a thorne ics found ways to prevent them from proceeding further using newspapers leaflets printed in tamil town criers and press thorne informed would be hosts that anyone offering food or shelter to marchers was liable to six months of imprisonment and fine when rajagopalachari came to know about collector s order he said that he could understand mindset of his own people better than a british ics officer could and remarked thorne and thistles cannot stem this tide of freedom panthulu iyer an ex member of legislative council and a resident of kumbakonam ignored thorne s order and provided accommodation for marchers for two days and arranged a grand dinner for them at his house he was arrested and sentenced to six months of imprisonment a few government servants who welcomed marchers at semmangudi lost their jobs on 25 april marchers reached and had planned to stay at a choultry which was managed by ramachandra naidu a close associate of pillai despite collector s warning naidu provided accommodation to marchers at his choultry his actions led to him being arrested by police following day arrest of iyer and naidu created fear among people pillai however convinced people that they could provide food without getting caught by police as a result food packets were found tied to branches of roadside trees and when group rested on banks of kaveri there were indicators where huge food containers were buried british policemen who were deployed to suppress marchers suffered from starvation when local residents refused them food and water indian staff who were employed by british stopped performing their daily activities while barbers and refused to serve government employees during march rajagopalachari and marchers
