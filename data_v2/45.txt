by a woman revelations of divine love she lived throughout her life in english city of norwich an important centre for commerce that also had a vibrant religious life but which during her lifetime was a witness to devastating effects of black death of 1348 50 peasants revolt which affected large parts of england in 1381 and suppression of lollards in 1373 aged thirty and so seriously ill she thought she was on her deathbed julian received a series of visions or shewings of passion of christ she recovered from her illness and wrote two versions of her experiences earlier one being completed soon after her recovery and a much longer version today known as long text being written many years later for much of her life julian lived in permanent seclusion as an anchoress in her cell which was attached to st julian s church norwich four wills in which sums were bequeathed to her have survived and an account by celebrated mystic margery kempe exists which provides details of counsel she was given by anchoress nothing is known for certain about julian s actual name family or education or of her life prior to her becoming an anchoress preferring to write anonymously and seeking isolation from world she was nevertheless influential in her own lifetime her manuscripts were carefully preserved by and benedictine nuns all scribes but one being women protestant reformation prevented their publication in print for a very long time long text was first published in 1670 by benedictine serenus de cressy under title xvi revelations of divine love shewed to a devout servant of our lord called mother juliana an anchorete of norwich who lived in dayes of king edward third cressey s book was reissued by george hargreaves parker in 1843 and a modernised version of text was published by j t hecker in 1864 work emerged from obscurity in 1901 when a manuscript in british museum was transcribed and published with notes by grace warrack since then many more translations of revelations of divine love also known under other titles have been produced julian is today considered to be an important christian mystic and theologian background thumb map of norwich by samuel woodward 1847 st julian s church west of staithe sic is labelled with a 7 on map english city of norwich where julian probably lived all her life was second in importance to london during thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and at centre of country s primary region for agriculture and trade during her life norwich suffered terribly when black death reached city disease may have killed over half population and returned in subsequent outbreaks up to 1387 julian was alive during peasants revolt of 1381 when city was overwhelmed by rebel forces led by geoffrey litster later executed by henry le despenser after his peasant army was overwhelmed at battle of north walsham as bishop of norwich despenser zealously opposed lollardy which advocated reform of catholic church and a number of lollards were burnt at stake at lollard s pit just outside city norwich may have been one of most religious cities in europe at that time with its cathedral friaries churches and recluses cells dominating both landscape and lives of its citizens on eastern side of city was norman cathedral founded in 1096 benedictine hospital of st paul carmelite friary st giles hospital greyfriars monastery and to south priory at carrow located just beyond city walls priory s income was mainly generated from livings it acquired for renting its assets which included norwich churches of st julian all saints st edward conisford and st catherine newgate all now lost apart from st julian s where these churches had an anchorite cell they enhanced reputation of priory still further as they attracted legacies and endowments from across society st julian s church julian is associated with st julian s church norwich located off king street in south of city centre and which still holds services on a regular basis st julian s is an early round tower church one of 31 surviving parish churches of a total of 58 that were built in norwich after norman conquest of england during middle ages there were twenty two religious houses in norwich and sixty three churches within city walls of which thirty six had an anchorage no hermits or anchorites existed in norwich from 1312 until emergence of julian in 1370s it is not recorded when anchorage at st julian s was built but it was used by a number of different anchorites up to dissolution of monasteries in 1530s some of whom were named julian after this time cell was demolished and church stripped of its rood screen and statues no rector was then appointed until 1581 by 1845 st julian s was in a very poor state of repair and that year east wall collapsed after an appeal for funds church underwent a ruthless restoration it was further restored in 20th century but was destroyed during norwich blitz of 1942 when in june that year tower received a direct hit after war funds were raised to rebuild church it now appears largely as it was before its destruction although its tower is much reduced in height and a chapel has been built in place of long lost anchorite cell life information available thumb beginning of 15th century short text here es a vision be of god to a woman and hir name es that is recluse atte and ys on anno domini millesimo bl add ms 37790 uniquely for mystics of middle ages julian wrote about her visions she was an anchoress from at least 1390s and was greatest english mystic of her age by virtue of visions she experienced and her literary achievement but almost nothing about her life is known what little is known about her comes from a handful of sources she provides a few scant comments about circumstances of her revelations in her book revelations of divine love of which one fifteenth century manuscript and a number of longer post reformation manuscripts have survived earliest surviving copy of julian s short text made by a scribe in 1470s acknowledges her as author of work earliest known reference to an anchorite living in norwich with name julian comes from a will made in 1394 there are four known wills which mention her all of which were made by individuals living in norfolk roger reed rector of st michael coslany norwich whose will of 20 march 1393 4 provides earliest record of julian s existence made a bequest of 12 shillings to be paid to julian thomas edmund a chantry priest from norfolk town of aylsham stipulated in his will of 19 may 1404 that 12 pennies be given to julian anchoress of church of st julian conisford and 8 pennies to sarah living with her a norwich man john plumpton gave 40 pennies to anchoress in church of st julian s conisford and a shilling each to her maid and her former maid alice in his will dated 24 november 1415 fourth person to mention julian was isabelle countess of suffolk second wife of william de ufford 2nd earl of suffolk who made a bequest of 20 shillings to a julian reclus a norwich in her will dated 26 september 1416 a bequest to an unnamed anchorite at st julian s was made in 1429 there is a possibility she was alive at this time thumb part of manuscript c 1440 dictated by mystic margery kempe to a scribe in which she mentions visiting dame jelyan british library julian was known as a spiritual authority within her community where she also served as a counsellor and adviser in around 1414 when she was in her seventies she was visited by celebrated english mystic margery kempe in book of margery kempe which has been claimed to be first ever autobiography to be written in english she wrote about going to norwich to obtain spiritual advice from julian where dame jelyan showed her grace that god put into her soul of compunction contrition sweetness and devotion compassion with holy meditation and high contemplation for she good counsel could give margery kempe never referred to julian as an author although she was familiar with works of other spiritual writers and mentioned them visions according to julian s book revelations of divine love at age of thirty and when she was perhaps an anchoress already julian fell seriously ill on 8may 1373 a curate was administering last rites of catholic church to her in anticipation of her death as he held a crucifix above foot of her bed she began to lose her sight and feel physically numb but gazing on crucifix she saw figure of jesus begin to bleed over next several hours she had a series of fifteen visions of jesus and a sixteenth following night julian completely recovered from her illness on 13may she wrote about her shewings shortly after she experienced them her original manuscript no longer exists but a copy survived now referred to as her short text twenty to thirty years later perhaps in early 1390s she began a theological exploration of meaning of her visions now known as long text consisting of eighty six chapters and about 63 500 words this second work seems to have gone through many revisions before it was finished perhaps in or 1420s julian s revelations which appear to have been first of their kind to occur in england for two centuries mark her as unique amongst medieval mystics it is possible she was a lay person living at home when her visions occurred as she was visited by her mother and other people shortly before her visions and rules of enclosure for an anchoress would not normally have allowed outsiders such access personal life few autobiographical details julian included in short text including her gender were suppressed when she wrote her longer text later in life historians are not even sure of her actual name it is generally thought to be taken from st julian s church in norwich but it was also used in its own right as a girl s name in middle ages and so could have been her actual christian name julian s writings indicate that she was born in 1343 and died after 1416 she was six when black death arrived in norwich which may have killed a third of city s population it has been speculated that she was educated as a young girl by benedictine nuns of carrow abbey as it is known that a school for girls existed there during her childhood anchoresses did not usually have to come from a religious community and it is unlikely that julian ever became a nun there is no written evidence that she was ever a nun at carrow abbey during her lifetime and as she referred in her writings to being visited by her mother at her bedside commentators have suggested that she was living at home when her visions occurred according to several commentators including santha in her article in oxford dictionary of national biography julian s discussion of maternal nature of god suggests that she knew of motherhood from own direct experience of bringing up her own children as plague epidemics were rampant during 14th century it has been suggested that julian may have lost her own family as a result of plague by then becoming an anchoress she would have been kept in quarantine away from rest of population of norwich however nothing in her writings provides any indication of plagues religious conflict or civil insurrection that occurred in city during her lifetime kenneth leach and sister benedicta ward slg joint authors of julian reconsidered first published in 1988 are of opinion that that she was a young widowed mother and never a nun based on a dearth of references about her occupation in life and a lack of evidence to connect her with carrow priory which would have honoured her and buried her in priory grounds life as an anchoress thumb st julian s church james sillett 1828 julian s cell demolished centuries before this illustration was made and since rebuilt as a chapel is thought to have been located around other side of church as an anchoress julian would have played an important part within her community devoting herself to a life of prayer to complement clergy in their primary function as protectors of people s souls her solitary life would have begun upon completion of an elaborate selection process an important church ceremony would have taken place at st julian s church in presence of bishop of norwich during ceremony psalms from office of dead would have been sung for her as if it were her own funeral and at some point julian would have been led to her cell door and into room beyond door would afterwards have been sealed up and she would have remained in her cell for rest of her life once her life of seclusion had begun julian would have had to follow strict rules for anchoresses two important sources of information about life led by an anchoress have survived de was written in latin by aelred of in c 1162 and ancrene riwle was written in middle english in c 1200 although originally made for three religious sisters to follow ancrene riwle became in time a manual for all female recluses work regained its former popularity during mystical movement of fourteenth century and may have been available to julian in a version she could read and become familiar with it stipulated that anchoresses lived a life of confined isolation poverty and chastity however some anchoresses are known to have lived comfortably and there are instances in which they shared their accommodations with fellow recluses popular image of julian living with her cat for company stems from regulations set out in ancrene riwle as an anchoress living in heart of an urban environment julian would not have led an entirely secluded life she would have been permitted to make clothes for poor and she enjoyed financial support of more prosperous members of local community as well as general affection of population she would have in turn provided prayers advice and counsel to people serving as an example of devout holiness according to one edition of cambridge medieval history it is possible that she met english mystic walter hilton who died when she was in her fifties and who may have influenced her writings in a small way cambridge medieval history vol 7 p 807 revelations of divine love thumb 125px xvi revelations of divine love title page 1670 edition julian of norwich was according to historian henrietta beloved in twentieth century by theologians and poets alike her writings are unique as no other works by an english anchoress have survived although it is possible that some anonymous works may have been written by women in 14th century england when women were generally barred from high status positions their knowledge of latin would have been limited and it is more likely that they read and wrote in english historian janina ramirez has suggested that by choosing to write in her vernacular language a precedent set by other medieval writers julian was attempting to express inexpressible in best way possible nothing written by julian was ever mentioned in any bequests nor written for a specific readership or influenced other medieval authors and almost no references were made of her writings from time they were written until beginning of 20th century julian was largely unknown until 1670 when her writings were published under title xvi revelations of divine love shewed to a devout servant of our lord called mother juliana an anchorete of norwich who lived in dayes of king edward third by serenus de cressy a confessor for english nuns at cambrai cressy who knew nothing of julian s earlier short text based his book on long text developed by her over a number of years of which three manuscript copies survive one copy of complete long text known as paris manuscript resides in bibliotheque nationale de france in paris two other manuscripts are now in british library one of manuscripts was perhaps copied out by dame clementina cary who founded english benedictine monastery in paris cressy s edition was reprinted in 1843 1864 and again in 1902 modern interest in julian s book increased when henry collins published a new version of book in 1877 it became known still further after publication of grace warrack s 1901 edition which included modernised language as well as according to author georgia ronan crampton a sympathetic informed introduction book introduced most early 20th century readers to julian s writings julian s shorter work which may have been written not long after julian s visions in may 1373 is now known as her short text as with long text original manuscript was lost but not before at least one copy was made by a scribe who named julian as author it was in possession of an english catholic family at one point copy was seen by antiquarian francis blomefield in 1745 after disappearing from view for 150 years it was found in 1910 in a collection of contemplative medieval texts bought by british museum it was published by reverend dundas harford in 1911 now part of ms additional 37790 manuscripts are held in british library manuscripts long text westminster cathedral treasury ms 4 written c 1450 now on loan to westminster abbey s muniments room and library manuscript includes extracts from julian s long text as well as selections from writings of english mystic walter hilton short text theology julian of norwich is now recognised as one of england s most important mystics for theologian denys turner core issue julian addresses in revelations of divine love is problem of sin julian says that sin is which is often translated as necessary appropriate or fitting julian came to such a sense of awfulness of sin that she believed pains of hell are to be chosen in preference to it and to me was shown no harder hell than sin for a kind soul has no hell but sin graves dan all will be well christian history institute julian believed that sin was necessary because it brings people to self knowledge which leads to acceptance of role of god in their life julian lived in a time of turmoil but her theology was optimistic and spoke of god s omnibenevolence and love in terms of joy and compassion revelations of divine love contains a message of optimism based on certainty of being loved by god and of being protected by his providence pope benedict xvi general audience december 1 2010 most characteristic element of her mystical theology was a daring likening of divine love to motherly love a theme found in biblical prophets as in isaiah 49 15 isaiah 49 15 nab according to julian god is both our mother and our father as caroline walker bynum showed this idea was also developed by bernard of clairvaux and others from onward some scholars think this is a metaphor rather than a literal belief in her fourteenth revelation julian writes of trinity in domestic terms comparing jesus to a mother who is wise loving and merciful f beer asserted that julian believed that maternal aspect of christ was literal and not metaphoric christ is not like a mother he is literally mother julian emphasized this by explaining how bond between mother and child is only earthly relationship that comes close to relationship a person can have with jesus she used metaphors when writing about jesus in relation to ideas about conceiving giving birth weaning and upbringing thumb church of st julian in norwich she wrote for i saw no wrath except on man s side and he forgives that in us for wrath is nothing else but a perversity and an opposition to peace and to love she wrote that god sees us as perfect and waits for day when human souls mature so that evil and sin will no longer hinder us god is nearer to us than our own soul she wrote this theme is repeated throughout her work jesus answered with these words saying all shall be well and all shall be well and all manner of thing shall be well this was said so tenderly without blame of any kind toward me or anybody else monastic and university authorities might not have challenged her theology because of her status as an anchoress a lack of references to her work during her own time may indicate that she kept her writings with her in her cell so that religious authorities were unaware of them revival of interest in her has been associated with a renewed interest in english speaking world in christian contemplation julian meetings an association of contemplative prayer groups takes its name from her but is otherwise unconnected with julian s theology adam easton s defense of st birgitta alfonso of jaen s epistola and william s remedies against temptations are all used in julian s text commemoration julian has never been canonised as a saint by anglican church but since 1980 has been commemorated with a feast day on 8 may episcopal church and evangelical lutheran church also commemorate her on 8 may she has not been formally beatified or canonised in roman catholic church so she is not currently listed in roman martyrology or on liturgical calendar of catholic church in england and wales however she is popularly venerated by catholics as a holy woman of god and is therefore at times referred to as saint blessed or mother julian julian s feast day in roman catholic tradition by popular celebration is on 13 may in 1997 father mucci reported that julian of norwich is on waiting list to be declared a doctor of church in light of her established veneration it is possible she will first be given an equivalent canonization in which she is decreed a saint by pope without full canonization process being followed at a general audience on december 1 2010 pope benedict xvi discussed life and teaching of julian julian of norwich understood central message for spiritual life god is love and it is only if one opens oneself to this love totally and with total trust and lets it become one s sole guide in life that all things are transfigured true peace and true joy found and one is able to radiate it he said he concluded and all will be well all manner of things shall be well this is final message that julian of norwich transmits to us and that i am also proposing to you today benedict xvi general audience paul vi hall wednesday 1st december 2010 with video legacy literature catechism of
