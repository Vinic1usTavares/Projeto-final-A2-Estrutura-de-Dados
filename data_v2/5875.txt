randy marsh latter who is also town geologist is established as stan s father in later episodes it also marked first of two appearances for scuzzlebutt who became a popular minor character and

attack plot stan s uncle jimbo and his vietnam war buddy ned take stan kenny kyle and cartman on a hunting trip in mountains as they arrive jimbo explains to boys how to hunt whenever they see a creature they shoot it after yelling it s coming right for us so they can claim shooting was in self defense stan does not have proper temperament to enjoy hunting and finds himself unable to shoot a living target unlike stan kenny is able to shoot animals impressing jimbo meanwhile south park geologist randy discovers that mountain on which boys are hunting is a volcano that is about to erupt he reports his findings to mayor who directs one of her aides to make appropriate decisions about crisis during hunting trip jimbo proclaims kenny his honorary nephew upsetting stan when night falls cartman tells story of scuzzlebutt a creature that has a piece of celery in place of one of its hands and patrick duffy for a leg boys are skeptical so cartman decides to dress up as creature next morning in order to convince and scare them when he disappears next morning others set out to find him they then see cartman disguised as scuzzlebutt and start shooting at him when they catch up with cartman at base of mountain stan tries to shoot him in order to redeem himself in his uncle s eyes however he is unable to do so and delay gives cartman time to remove costume at a lower elevation randy orders south park residents to dig a trench to divert lava away from town suddenly volcano erupts hunters try to flee but find themselves trapped on other side of trench real scuzzlebutt then appears and jimbo apologizes to boys for their seemingly imminent deaths just before realizing that scuzzlebutt is weaving a wicker basket to carry hunting party to safety lava then flows through trench just as randy planned but due to a miscalculation he made trench leads lava to denver destroying it however in a misguided attempt to prove he can kill something and impress his uncle stan kills scuzzlebutt jimbo is less than impressed telling stan that some things you do kill and some you don t ned states that he now understands folly of guns and drops his rifle which accidentally fires killing kenny stan does not understand since jimbo tried to kill scuzzlebutt earlier and other animals and wanted to impress jimbo like kenny did jimbo points out that kenny is dead and that stan will always be jimbo s nephew finally boys decide that hunting is stupid and confusing thus decided to go home to watch cartoons production thumb 250px right alt two men sit in chairs man on right holds a microphone and gestures with his left hand south park co creators trey parker and matt stone wrote and directed volcano volcano was written and directed by series co creators trey parker and matt stone episode was inspired by volcano related hollywood disaster films such as dante s peak 1997 and volcano 1997 which came out around time they were writing script parker and stone considered films two of worst ever made stone said if you watch this episode and then go watch volcano this makes more sense than volcano does debbie liebling who served as a south park producer at time of episode s broadcast said volcano erupting in south park helped establish setting as a place where anything can happen although stone and parker acknowledged that a volcano could not actually erupt in this colorado town they felt they were entitled to create episode anyway because volcano film was set in los angeles stone said if they could do it we could similarly duo acknowledge tunnel built in episode would not really divert lava but they included it because parker said any movie today that s basically how dumb they are another influence on plot was large amount of hunting parker and stone saw around them while growing up in colorado neither of them were hunters and parker said stan s hesitation about hunting was based largely on himself and his father who hated idea of killing an animal even though parker s grandfather like jimbo was enthusiastic about sport parker said he feels many of first season episodes considered taboo in 1997 would have been considered less controversial five years later but that volcano is an exception since episode involved children drinking beer and threatening each other at gunpoint during hunting trips parker said he did not believe comedy central would have aired it following columbine high school massacre in 1999 parker said back then it was just sort of funny kids pointing guns at each other and it s just not so funny now south park animators spent first four episodes of show trying to perfect animation of characters by volcano which was produced after weight gain 4000 parker and stone felt textures were improved as well as smaller details like lines around eyes of characters while series pilot cartman gets an anal probe was animated with construction paper subsequent episodes were made using computers nevertheless parker and stone wanted show to maintain its crude paper look for example they specifically asked for night sky in this episode to look like a black piece of paper with holes cut into it for stars just as it was in pilot episode stone and parker were especially proud of animation of lava which they said took hours to perfect although they acknowledged it ended up simply resembling orange construction paper lava ball shooting out of volcano and almost killing kenny was directly inspired by volcano film parker and stone came up with character of scuzzlebutt during a random conversation with comedy central executive debbie liebling while meeting with her they simply started drawing character and decided to add a celery hand and patrick duffy leg for no particular reason scuzzlebutt also appeared in a second episode city on edge of forever from second season scuzzlebutt turning out to be a real character rather than a ridiculous story was first instance of a common characteristic of cartman character in which cartman says outrageous and completely unrealistic things that turn out to be true stone commented he s right more often than he s wrong volcano episode was in production when south park debuted on august 13 1997 comedy central executives did not object to most of content of episode but said scene in which kyle farted while talking to stan should have been removed because nothing happened after fart and they said it was not funny parker and stone however insisted it stay in episode and they said lack of any reaction whatsoever to fart was what made it funny during close ups of cartman s face while telling story of scuzzlebutt around campfire flames from fire stop moving parker and stone noticed consistency error after episode was filmed but they did not have enough time to go back and fix it before broadcast date so it was left in a cat featured in background of one of outdoor scenes was designed to look exactly like parker s cat jake scene in which ned catches fire was based on an experience parker had during a colorado camping trip where he tried to do an indian fire trick in which one pours gasoline onto a fire to create large flames although nobody caught fire parker said trick misfired and he nearly burned down forest after finishing episode parker and stone realized volcano was about two minutes shorter than time length required for episode in order to add time to episode parker and stone added scene with ned singing song around fire as well as long freeze frame on a shocked chef and mayor mcdaniels reacting to news of volcano s imminent eruption in addition to scuzzlebutt volcano included first appearances of recurring characters randy marsh and ned in this first appearance randy is identified only as south park geologist and it is only in episode an elephant makes love to a pig that he is first introduced as stan s father parker who provides voice of randy marsh said design voice and personality of character are based on his real life father who works as a geologist for united states geological survey parker said his father is very calm in real life and randy s relaxed reaction to learning of volcano calmly sipping his coffee is about how my dad would react to anything look of ned character was based on a drawing parker made in high school although character did not originally have a voice box voice was inspired by a waitress who worked at a kentucky fried chicken restaurant in boulder colorado where parker and stone would visit while attending university of colorado duo said they would go to restaurant just to hear her voice but that it was so low they would lose their appetite when she took their orders stone and parker had trouble creating right voice for character they tried putting microphone directly on their throat and also bought an actual voice box but ultimately decided that best way to provide character s voice was with natural voice simulation volcano was released alongside five other episodes in a three vhs set on may 5 1998 marking first time south park was made available on video episode was released on volume i video along with cartman gets an anal probe other featured episodes included an elephant makes love to a pig death weight gain 4000 and big gay al s big gay boat ride south park complete first season a dvd box set featuring all thirteen episodes including volcano was released on november 12 2002 parker and stone recorded commentary tracks for each episode but tracks were not included on dvds due to standards issues with some of statements parker and stone refused to allow tracks to be edited and censored so they were released on a separate cd cultural references and impact episode features a fictional education film called lava and you which says lava will pass harmlessly over potential victims who duck and cover their heads film was inspired by actual duck and cover films from 1950s and 1960s in which children were instructed to hide under tables or lean against walls in case of a nuclear weapon attack parker and stone like many critics of films found methods painfully simplistic and did not believe they would actually help in case of such an attack jimbo and ned are described as veterans of vietnam war military conflict between north vietnam and south vietnam that lasted from 1959 to 1975 cartman who is far too young to have participated in war claims to have flashbacks to his experiences in it patrick duffy american television actor best known for his roles in shows dallas and step by step appears in episode as living leg of scuzzlebutt matt stone claimed there was no particular reason duffy was chosen as leg except that he is such a nondescript actor he s just super bland like how could you possibly be a fan of patrick duffy scene where scuzzlebutt puts a star on top of a tree is a reference to a similar scene in 1964 television special rudolph red nosed reindeer in which abominable snow monster places a christmas star atop a large tree mount evanston fictional mountain in volcano was named after real mount evans in front range region of rocky mountains in clear creek county colorado
