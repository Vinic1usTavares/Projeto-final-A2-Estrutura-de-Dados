hurricane bonnie was a long lived storm in 1992 atlantic hurricane season it was third tropical storm including april subtropical storm and second hurricane of 1992 season bonnie formed at high latitudes in central atlantic on september 17 devoid of any real steering currents for much of its lifespan it was nearly stationary for over a week in central atlantic ocean on september 27 it began to slowly track east and northeast towards azores just before becoming extratropical it affected azores on september 30 although no damage was reported meteorological history origins of system was a cold front that moved off u s east coast on september 11 front moved gradually off coast and into subtropical atlantic ocean before becoming stationary just east of bermuda on september 15 over next two days cloud cover slowly detached itself from front and form into a tropical low in its own right on afternoon of september 17 system was organized enough to be declared tropical depression four depression organized steadily that evening and into morning of september 18 later that day it was upgraded to tropical storm bonnie and it began to move slowly to northeast like most storms that develop in higher latitudes bonnie was embedded in a larger scale cyclonic circulation at first which minimized shear allowing it to develop and provided weak steering currents low shear allowed bonnie to rapidly develop and a small but well defined eye formed late that morning storm was upgraded to a hurricane later that day while meandering in open ocean intensification rate slowed down after becoming a hurricane in addition bonnie began to slowly move more to northeast on september 19 as steering currents slowly developed bonnie strengthened into a category 2 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale that morning as well peaking at 105 mph 165 km h with a 970 mbar central pressure general track and intensity maintained itself throughout day and into september 20 when eye became less distinct and bonnie weakened slightly although remaining a category 2 hurricane early on september 21 eye became better defined once again and bonnie restrengthened slightly while continuing its slow northeast motion that afternoon storm gradually strengthened some more and reached its peak intensity of 110 mph 175 km h and a central pressure of 965 mbar just under category 3 intensity bonnie maintained its strength through evening and into early morning of september 22 when it began to weaken very gradually and level off bonnie also began to turn more eastward at that point before it became held up by a blocking mid latitude ridge of high pressure which stalled motion bonnie remained virtually stationary until morning of september 23 when it drifted very slowly to west southwest in response to ridge it also began to gradually weaken as low level center became exposed and storm became poorly organized convection also diminished and on afternoon of september 24 bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm as it drifted over cooler waters bonnie continued to lose most of its deep convection during day on september 25 as it began to make a turn back around to south that evening bonnie was downgraded to a tropical depression right thumb close up of bonnie s eye on september 19 as seen from space shuttle endeavour weakening trend ended early on september 26 and bonnie regained tropical storm status that afternoon as deep convection re established itself bonnie continued its change in direction turning to southeast at this point as it slowly redeveloped despite being in a high shear environment it had also briefly showed signs of becoming extratropical on september 27 as it made turn to northeast as a weak tropical storm and was operationally declared extratropical at that point until afternoon of september 28 during that period bonnie actually strengthened back into a high end tropical storm bonnie roughly followed hurricane charley s path towards azores thereafter storm became entrenched in an environment with greater wind shear although it only weakened slightly on september 29 as it accelerated towards northeast storm crossed over azores on september 30 as a strong tropical storm with 65 mph 100 km h winds after that bonnie quickly lost its tropical characteristics and was declared extratropical late that afternoon just east of azores extratropical low drifted back to southwest in a clockwise loop actually approaching azores once again while dissipating it dissipated on october 2 impact when bonnie passed over azores only four days after charley it resulted in tropical storm force winds across much of island chain lajes air base reported sustained winds of 40 mph 64 km h with gusts to 59 mph 94 km h in addition one man was killed by a rock fall on island of sao miguel no damage was reported in azores see also other storms of same name list of azores hurricanes references external links nhc s preliminary report on hurricane bonnie bonnie 1992 bonnie 1992 bonnie
