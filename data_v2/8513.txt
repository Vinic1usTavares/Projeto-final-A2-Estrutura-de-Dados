against barbary coast such as battle of tripoli in 1825 and second italian war of independence in 1859 last war was a major step toward italian unification which led to creation of a united italian state in 1861 during fighting in 1860 royal neapolitan navy defected to sardinia and placed itself under sardinian control in 1861 navy also absorbed royal sicilian navy resulting in creation of regia marina royal navy which itself became marina militare modern italian navy in 1946 history creation and expansion thumb left frigate during a south america cruise done in 1838 fleet traced its origins to rule of victor amadeus ii in early 18th century who as duke of savoy became king of sardinia in 1720 prior to 1713 victor amadeus had no navy as duke he relied on one or two galleys and smaller vessels belonging order of saints maurice and lazarus and on ducal letters of marque authorizing privateers to operate out of his main ports nice and oneglia when in 1703 during war of spanish succession emperor charles vi first proposed that duke of savoy should receive kingdom of sardinia victor amadeus rejected proposal on grounds that he had no navy with which to defend island in 1713 however victor amadeus acquired kingdom of sicily and with it a squadron of galleys he issued orders that squadron should be maintained at five galleys and three other vessels he created a marine corps and in 1717 promulgated fleet regulations in 1718 spain conquered sicily during war of quadruple alliance and captured savoyard fleet victor amadeus was forced to rely on privateers for duration of conflict but when he gave up sicily in exchange for sardinia in 1720 he also received back his fleet throughout its existence sardinian fleet was small compared to fleets of great powers kingdom was a small country with a limited budget it was also surrounded by potentially hostile states most significantly france and austrian empire which placed greater demand for spending on royal sardinian army than for navy during 18th century fleet took part in a series of wars against ottoman empire states of barbary coast and spain latter in war of jenkins ear during that conflict sardinia allied itself to british empire after spanish troops tried to force their way through sardinian piedmont in 1742 small sardinian fleet of galleys was placed under command of british mediterranean fleet shallow draft vessels could be used close to shore where larger british warships could not easily maneuver though their small size rendered them vulnerable to bad weather which kept them from operating through winter in 1790s sardinia was a member of coalitions arrayed against republican france in french revolutionary wars having been defeated by napoleon in his mainland possessions king charles emmanuel iv abdicated and his son victor emmanuel i retreated to island of sardinia bankrupted and protected by british fleet he allowed his navy to decline so that by 1809 it consisted of two xebecs a galley and two half galleys in treaty of vienna that ended napoleonic wars in 1815 old savoyard state was restored with addition of former republic of genoa this acquisition gave sardinia access to genoa s superior shipbuilding facilities by this time largest ship of fleet was a 20 gun corvette victor emmanuel embarked on a naval expansion program under direction of admiral giorgio des geneys who ordered a series of warships from italian and british shipyards thumb upright giorgio des geneys victor emmanuel did not remain on throne to see fruits of his program revolution in 1821 forced him to abdicate in favor of his brother charles felix during revolt austrian navy mobilized ships to intervene in conflict which also involved neapolitan kingdom of two sicilies and attack sardinian fleet but by time austrians arrived revolt had ended sardinian fleet saw action against barbary states twice in 1820s geneys led a squadron to attack morocco in 1822 that achieved little geneys ordered fleet to attack vilayet of tripoli in 1825 resulting in battle of tripoli sardinian success at tripoli convinced charles felix to continue his predecessor s construction program ordering a number of frigates corvettes and sloops in late 1820s these included 50 gun frigates and 60 gun frigates and 44 gun frigate and 20 gun corvette by 1829 fleet included a total of eight frigates during this period fleet kept warships in levant to protect sardinian interests in region during greek war of independence but they saw little activity naval expenditure fell significantly after charles death in 1831 as his successor charles albert was not interested in naval matters in 1830s fleet sent its warships abroad frequently to south american waters to protect sardinian economic interests in region in 1833 sardinia signed an alliance with neapolitans and that year two countries sent a combined squadron of three sardinian and one neapolitan frigates to attack tunis squadron forced city to pay compensation for attacks on italian merchant vessels naval construction continued apace and in 1834 fleet acquired its first steam warship sloop powered by a british built steam engine 24 gun corvette was launched in 1838 followed by paddle corvette in 1840 and next year saw launch of 18 gun brig and powerful 64 gun frigate latter vessel carried first shell firing guns

consisting of three frigates one brig and one schooner and neapolitan squadron to blockade trieste where austrian fleet had retreated there austrian ships were trapped as italian forces outnumbered them two to one but italian fleet was prevented from pressing attack on austrian fleet as trieste was located in part of austria that was included in german confederation and frankfurt parliament informed sardinians and neapolitans that an attack on trieste would be treated as an attack on confederation neapolitans were withdrawn after a revolt toppled their government prompting sardinians to send every available vessel of their fleet to reinforce italian squadron by now sardinian contingent consisted of four frigates two corvettes two brigs and eight steamships commanded by vice admiral giuseppe albini though strengthened by reinforcements italian fleet nevertheless was weakened by neapolitan withdrawal further threats from frankfurt convinced sardinians to order albini to drop blockade and merely observe port defeats on land including battle of custoza in july secured austrian victory ensuing armistice signed by austria and sardinia that month forced latter to withdraw its fleet and albini took his ships to corfu following a rebellion in austria albini returned to venice in october to operate with a french squadron that was at that time passively obstructing austrian blockade of city he was forced to withdraw most of his ships to ancona over winter of 1848 1849 due to bad weather sardinia declared war again in march 1849 but fleet could not deploy from ancona to support venice before sardinian army was defeated again at battle of novara in march forcing country out of war a second time second armistice required sardinian fleet to leave adriatic within fifteen

improved technical quality of fleet he ordered steam frigate from britain which was commissioned in 1854 she was first screw driven warship of sardinian fleet three more frigates followed later in 1850s including and in 1860 cavour added a pair of small ironclad warships beginning a series of ironclads built for sardinian and later italian these ships started a naval arms race with austria traditional opponent of italian states to ensure better discipline and aggressiveness in its officer corps cavour worked to instill strong nationalist sentiment in sardinian naval academy in genoa cavour s tenure as naval minister was marked by a more aggressive foreign policy cavour also served as prime minister of sardinia under his direction country joined british and french during crimean war of 1853 1855 though sardinian contribution to war was almost entirely on land a small squadron consisting of carlo alberto and several paddle steamers were sent to support expeditionary army war
