for three consecutive years during magazine s golden age long term fans of thrud were excited and nostalgic to see him return in his own full length comic but were concerned that idea would not stretch to 24 pages in reviewing issue 1 jez higgins writing on and robert clark of strike to stun considered comic a success that was more than one joke spread thin and which was not limited by single page brevity of original strip steven maxwell of bulletproof comics however found that what worked well within constraints of a single page seemed stretched when spun out over 24 issue 2 received similarly mixed reviews with clark criticising comic for being much same with same themes and joke as issue 1 while glenn carter of comics bulletin found it to be well written light reading with quite a few elements of humour overall comic was deemed a success with even more negative reviewers awarding it 6 out of 10 and looking forward to more issues although writing received mixed reviews reception of artwork was almost entirely positive higgins recalling heavy blacks and bold outlines of original strip found critchlow s new style to be much more open and expressive maxwell also praised critchlow s development as an artist judging comic to be beautifully drawn and coloured with a clear line style carter thought that art was a little flat in places but nevertheless praised it for being unique with a lot of character critchlow was also commended for risky decision to write draw and publish comic himself comic was compared favourably with professional quality comics with its lack of adverts viewed as an advantage over those offerings high production values were also praised with glossy cover and high quality paper used for inner pages in 2004 thrud

months after thrud issue 1 was published critchlow returned to 2000ad using his new computer drawn style his first story was judge dredd out of undercity story written by john wagner new style was initially well received by 2000ad review and seen as a marked improvement over his previous fully painted style with clearer figures and atmospheric colouring as undercity story developed however critchlow was criticised for using too narrow a palette with too many greys and blues although this might have been as a result of story being set underground 2000ad review s criticism of critchlow s subdued colouring continued with 2003 lobster random story no gain no pain by conclusion however critchlow s style was recognised as being truly unique and even previously criticised blues and greys were seen to work well when used with other coloured elements artwork in two further lobster random stories tooth claw in october 2004 and agony ecstasy in april 2006 was again very well received tooth claw was praised for its character designs while critchlow s style in agony ecstasy was said to be easily recognisable having volume colour and verve references bibliography external links
