fear direct confrontation with incumbent government and attacked it with vigour up to this point most of his labor colleagues had become dispirited by playmander and were resigned to ongoing dominance

undue weight on rural voters during debate dunstan decried this immoral bill i cannot separate it from motives of those who put it forward since it is immoral so are they such language unusually

december 1958 there occurred an event that initially had nothing to do with playford but eventually intensified into a debacle that was regarded as a turning point in his premiership and marked end of his rule dunstan was prominent in pressuring playford during this time cockburn p 292 a young girl was found raped and murdered and max stuart an aborigine was convicted and sentenced to be executed inglis pp 29 30 stuart s lawyer claimed that confession was forced and appeals to supreme and high courts were dismissed amid objections against fairness of trial among an increasing number of legal

299 amid hue and cry playford started a royal commission to review case however two of commissioners had already been involved in trial and one of appeals cockburn pp 299 300 this provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias from dunstan and labor who also attacked playford for what they regarded as a too restrictive scope of inquiry cockburn p 303 royal commission began its work and proceedings were followed closely and eagerly debated by public as playford did not commute stuart s sentence dunstan introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment vote was split along party lines and was thus defeated but dunstan used opportunity to attack playmander with much effect in media portraying failed legislation as an unjust triumph of a malapportioned minority who had a vengeance mentality over an electorally repressed majority who wanted a humane outcome cockburn pp 302 303 amid continuing uproar playford decided to grant clemency cockburn p 305 royal commission concluded

in 1962 aboriginal affairs bill was introduced to liberalise constraints that had been placed on indigenous australians in past and had effectively resulted in segregation initial proposal still retained some restrictions placing more controls over full blooded aborigines dunstan was prominent in labor s opposition to double standards summers p 495 and called for abolition of race based restrictions saying that social objectives could be achieved without explicit colour based schemes he was successful in forcing amendments to liberalise controls on property and confinement of indigenous australians to reserves however his attempt to remove different standards required of part and full blooded aborigines failed as did his proposal to ensure that at least half of members of aboriginal affairs board be indigenous australians summers p 496 despite passage of bill restrictions remained in place and dunstan questioned policy of assimilation of aborigines which he saw as diluting of their distinctive cultures summers p 497 labor won seats of glenelg and at 1965 election after winning seats of chaffey and unley at 1962 election labor thus finally overcame playmander and formed government for first time in 32 years with frank walsh as premier of south australia despite winning 55 percent of primary vote playmander was still strong enough that labor won only 21 of

parkin p 3 and one of only three under 60 parkin p 293 dunstan had a major impact on government policy as attorney general having only narrowly lost out on leadership in 1960 dunstan became obvious

workers were given more rights and bureaucracy of education department was liberalised much of reform was not necessarily radical and was primarily to fill gaps that previous lcl government had left despite a consistently higher statewide vote labor were consistently outnumbered 16 4 in legislative council so some desired legislation did not make it through in 1965 legislature convened for 65 days most for 34 years but many bills were still yet to be debated many bills were watered down parkin p 295 but due to lack of public interest outcry was minimal in particular council blocked electoral reform legislation paving way for a probable lcl win at next election blewett and jaensch pp 36 39 such was dunstan s pre eminence during his term as attorney general that cabinet was often called dunstan ministry parkin p 294 blewett and jaensch p 36 an economic depression had begun in south australia after labor government gained office in 1965 unemployment went from lowest in country to second highest while immigration levels dropped labor was not responsible for depression although it initially did little to alleviate it liberals seized on this opportunity blaming it on twelve months of socialist administration in south australia and branding it dunstan depression blewett and jaensch p 46 in 1966 federal election labor suffered a swing against it of 11 8 in south australia double national average if this was replicated at a state election it was projected that labor would only hold 10 of 39 seats liberals dropped playford as state leader and younger and more progressive

degree of responsibility for its ills blewett and jaensch pp 57 65 elections 1968 1970 in preparation for 1968 election labor campaigned heavily around its leader and this resonated with voters in

jaensch pp 171 172 right 300px thumb south australian house of assembly assembly s composition was radically altered after changes were made to electoral legislation abolishing electoral malapportionment of playmander there was a degree of speculation in press that dunstan would call for a new election because of adverse outcome however dunstan realised futility of such a move and instead sought to humiliate lcl into bringing an end to malapportionment although stott s decision to support lcl ended any realistic chance of dunstan remaining premier dunstan did not immediately resign his commission intending to force hall and lcl to demonstrate that they had support on floor of assembly when it reconvened he used six weeks before start of new legislature to draw attention to malapportionment protests were held on 15 march in light square there dunstan spoke to a crowd of more than 10 000 we need to show that people of sa feel that at last watershed has been reached in

confidence vote with it now clear that lcl had control of house dunstan tendered his resignation to governor parkin p 5 blewett and jaensch pp 173 177 hall was then sworn in as premier however six weeks of protesting had brought nationwide criticism of unfairness of electoral system and put more pressure on lcl to relent to reforms it has been seen as one of most important political events of its time with end of playford s tenure lcl had brought younger more progressive members into its ranks hall government continued many of social reforms that walsh dunstan governments had initiated most of these at instigation of hall or his attorney general robin millhouse abortion was partially legalised parkin pp 299 300 and planning for festival centre began horne pp 205 209 conservative and

to pick up under hall returning to full employment blewett and jaensch p 189 during term in opposition des corcoran became dunstan s deputy and pair worked together well despite any rift that may have been caused by struggle to succeed walsh hall also enacted a complete reform of electoral system he was embarrassed that lcl was in a position to win government despite having clearly lost first preference vote and was committed to a fairer electoral system reforms were significant but did not go as far as change to one vote one value that labor and dunstan had demanded lower house formerly had 39 seats 13 in adelaide and 26 in country now 47 seats were to be contested 28 in adelaide and 19 in country while there was still a slight rural weighting since adelaide accounted for two thirds of state s population with adelaide now electing a majority of legislature historical results made a labor win at next election likely yeeles pp 42 43 under playmander labor usually dominated adelaide even at height of playford s power in 1950s lcl won almost no seats in capital outside of wealthy eastern crescent and around holdfast bay under circumstances conventional wisdom was that hall undertook electoral reform knowing he was effectively handing premiership to dunstan at next election stott withdrew support in 1970 over dam a dispute over location of a dam on murray river parkin p 6 and south australia went to polls dam controversy was not much of an election issue and attempts by democratic labor party to portray dunstan as a communist over his opposition to ongoing australian support for south vietnam had little effect lcl campaigned heavily on hall while dunstan promised sweeping social reform artistic transformation and more community services he said we ll set a new standard of social advancement that whole of australia will envy we believe south australia can set pace it can happen here we can do it parkin pp 6 7 dunstan won 1970 election easily taking 27 seats compared with lcl s 20 blewett and jaensch pp 251 253 although share of votes had been similar to 1968 dilution of playmander had changed share of seats as labor had attained a majority of popular

travelled to canberra for annual premiers conference as sole labor premier his government on a mandate to dramatically increase funding in key areas sought to appropriate further finances from federal government this brought dunstan into conflict with prime minister john gorton and federal funding to sa was not increased an appeal was made to federal grants commission and dunstan was awarded more

this these were summarily rejected by dunstan government which planned to build a new city 83 kilometres from adelaide near murray bridge city to be known as monarto was to be built on farmland to west of existing town dunstan was very much against allowing adelaide s suburbs to further sprawl and thus monarto was a major focus of his government he argued that new south eastern freeway would allow a drive of only 45 minutes from adelaide that city was not far from current industry and that water could be readily supplied from river murray dunstan p 191 government hoped that adelaide would not sprawl into mount lofty ranges to east and that bureaucracy would be dispersed from capital in contrast public servants feared being forced into rural settlement critics of which there were many

independent tribunal it also proposed to allow body to decide mining proposals on land and receive royalties this aroused discontent among mining interests but a bipartisan parliamentary committee

australian community in world war ii cockburn p ix it had amassed information on tens of thousands of individuals and organisations while such an operation was of concern to dunstan and his government

conducted into branch by justice white of supreme court of south australia and report was placed in dunstan s hands on 21 december 1977 cockburn p 17 it said that dossiers did exist and that they were scandalously inaccurate irrelevant to security purposes and outrageously unfair to hundreds perhaps thousands of loyal and worthy citizens it also noted that reports overwhelmingly focused on left wing politicians and activists and that dunstan had been misled by police commissioner after reviewing report dunstan sacked police commissioner harold salisbury in january and threatened to release report to public parkin p 15 however salisbury had a reputation as a man of integrity and controversy erupted regarding inquiry and dunstan s actions and whether he had already known about true

agreement with dow was still to be finalised financial difficulties forced a freeze on public sector expansion and hospital developments and there were claims of theft and mismanagement in health system but liberals were in a disorganised state and unpopular so they were not able to pressure dunstan effectively parkin p 16 towards end of year political and media scrutiny began to grow on dunstan who began to grow uneasy in his dealings with press soon after salisbury dismissal he walked out of a stormy media conference after refusing to be drawn on rumoured sacking of seaman from gubernatorial role whitelock p 155 increasing innuendo about dunstan s private life and allegations of corruption and economic mismanagement were worsened by dunstan s self righteous tendencies

south australia s lead as evidence of this parkin p 20 life after politics after dunstan s resignation from parliament deputy des corcoran took his place as party leader and premier at subsequent norwood by election dunstan s seat was retained by labor corcoran soon called 1979 election corcoran s lack of media savvy advertiser s bias towards liberals at this election and public s widespread
