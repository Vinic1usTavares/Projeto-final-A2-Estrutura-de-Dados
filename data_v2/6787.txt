royal order of saint hubert is a roman catholic dynastic order of knighthood founded in 1444 or 1445 by gerhard vii duke of julich berg he sought to commemorate his victory over house of egmond at battle of linnich on 3 november which is saint hubert s day establishment of order occurred during a long term intermittent territorial dispute initially between dukes of julich and dukes of guelders who were descended from a female line of house of julich dispute began in 1430s when arnold duke of gelderland claimed duchy of julich and county of ravensberg and was resolved in 1614 treaty of xanten which established united duchies of julich cleves berg of counties of ravensberg and mark with duchies of cleves julich and berg in 1778 charles theodore duke of julich and berg and count elector palatine succeeded his childless cousin maximilian iii joseph elector of bavaria and brought order to bavaria initially order was open to men and women although limiting number of male companions to sixty it commemorated conversion of saint hubert and his standing as patron saint of hunters and knights over time award had other uses as a reward for loyalty to monarch and service to princely state history foundation sources agree that order of saint hubert honors a military victory of duke of julich on saint hubert s day 3 november 1444 for example see f m rudge military orders

1881 p 230 sources differ on specific date of establishment of order whether it celebrated victory at battle of linnich between gebhard v of julich and arnold of egmont or egmond or commemorated battle at a future date consequently date of founding depends on source still other sources date founding of order as late as 1473 or 1475 d arcy jonathan dacre boulton knights of crown monarchical

foundation use good friday in this case 26 march 1445 furthermore there is clear written evidence that order existed prior to march 1445 original german statutes were dated immediately after battle it is also possible that gerhard proclaimed establishment of order immediately after victory of his knights at linnich but documents were not drawn up until later leading to discrepancy in dates of 1444 or 1445 to further obfuscate date of founding gerhard s son william iii renewed order upon his own succession to ducal dignities in 1475 in so called new statutes which were prepared in latin and german these remained governing documents of order until 1708 in this confirmation probably lies root of confusion over date of order s foundation initially order was a knightly brotherhood reflecting overlapping religious and military aspects of medieval court life saint hubert was patron saint of hunters and knights founding of order of golden fleece in early 15th century started a trend in confraternal princely orders purpose of these whether established by monarchs or princes was to foster loyalty to a sovereign replacing to old chivalric orders developed in crusades although some historians classify order of saint hubert as a confraternal order during its 600 year life its purpose changed as fortunes and needs of dukes of julich and berg and their successors changed francois
