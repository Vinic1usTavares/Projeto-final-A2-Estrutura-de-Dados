uncontrolled but stable weave thumb bicycles leaning in a turn bicycle and motorcycle dynamics is science of motion of bicycles and motorcycles and their components due to forces acting on them dynamics falls under a branch of physics known as classical mechanics bike motions of interest include balancing steering braking accelerating suspension activation and vibration study of these motions began in late 19th century and continues today bicycles and motorcycles are both single track vehicles and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and are fundamentally different from and more difficult to study than other wheeled vehicles such as tricycles and as with unicycles bikes lack lateral stability when stationary and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its center of mass over its wheels this steering is usually supplied by a rider or in certain circumstances by bike itself several factors including geometry mass distribution and gyroscopic effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self stability but long standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect such as gyroscopic or trail is solely responsible for stabilizing force have been discredited while remaining upright may be primary goal of beginning riders a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn higher speed or smaller turn radius more lean is required this balances roll torque about wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to turn with that of gravitational force this lean is usually produced by a momentary steering in opposite direction called countersteering countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought unlike other wheeled vehicles primary control input on bikes is steering torque not position although longitudinally stable when stationary bikes often have a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration when braking depending on location of combined center of mass of bike and rider with respect to point where front wheel contacts ground bikes can either skid front wheel or flip bike and rider over front wheel a similar situation is possible while accelerating but with respect to rear wheel history right thumb draisine history of study of bike dynamics is nearly as old as bicycle itself it includes contributions from famous scientists such as rankine and whipple in early 19th century karl von drais credited with inventing two wheeled vehicle variously called velocipede draisine and dandy horse showed that a rider could balance his device by steering front wheel in 1869 rankine published an article in engineer repeating von drais s assertion that balance is maintained by steering in direction of a lean in 1897 french academy of sciences made understanding bicycle dynamics goal of its prix fourneyron competition thus by end of 19th century carlo bourlet emmanuel carvallo and francis whipple had showed with rigid body dynamics that some safety bicycles could actually balance themselves if moving at right speed bourlet won prix fourneyron and whipple won cambridge university smith prize it is not clear to whom should go credit for tilting steering axis from vertical which helps make this possible in 1970 david e h jones published an article in physics today showing that gyroscopic effects are not necessary to balance a bicycle since 1971 when he identified and named wobble weave and capsize modes robin sharp has written regularly about behavior of motorcycles and bicycles while at imperial college london he worked with david and in early 1970s cornell aeronautical laboratory cal later calspan corporation in buffalo ny usa was sponsored by schwinn bicycle company and others to study and simulate bicycle and motorcycle dynamics portions of this work have now been released to public and scans of over 30 detailed reports have been posted at this tu delft bicycle dynamics site since 1990s cossalter et al have been researching motorcycle dynamics at university of padova their research both experimental and numerical has covered weave wobble chatter simulators vehicle modelling tire modelling handling and minimum lap time maneuvering in 2007 et al published canonical linearized equations of motion in proceedings of royal society a along with verification by two different methods these equations assumed tires to roll without slip that is to say to go where they point and rider to be rigidly attached to rear frame of bicycle in 2011 kooijman et al published an article in science showing that neither gyroscopic effects nor so called caster effects due to trail are necessary for a bike to balance itself they designed a two mass skate bicycle that equations of motion predict is self stable even with negative trail front wheel contacts ground in front of steering axis and with counter rotating wheels to cancel any gyroscopic effects then they constructed a physical model to validate that prediction this may require some of details provided below about steering geometry or stability to be re evaluated bicycle dynamics was named 26 of discovers 100 top stories of 2011 in 2013 eddy merckx cycles was awarded over eur150 000 with ghent university to examine bicycle stability thumb external forces on a bike and rider leaning in a turn weight in green drag in blue vertical ground reaction in red net propulsive and rolling resistance in yellow friction in response to turn in orange and net torques on front wheel in magenta thumb spring between front fork and rear frame forces if bike and rider are considered to be a single system forces that act on that system and its components can be roughly divided into two groups internal and external external forces are due to gravity inertia contact with ground and contact with atmosphere internal forces are caused by rider and by interaction between components external forces as with all masses gravity pulls rider and all bike components toward earth at each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components vertical components mostly counteract force of gravity but also vary with braking and accelerating for details see section on longitudinal stability below horizontal components due to friction between wheels and ground including rolling resistance are in response to propulsive forces braking forces and turning forces aerodynamic forces due to atmosphere are mostly in form of drag but can also be from crosswinds at normal bicycling speeds on level ground aerodynamic drag is largest force resisting forward motion at faster speed aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly largest force resisting forward motion turning forces are generated during maneuvers for balancing in addition to just changing direction of travel these may be interpreted as centrifugal forces in accelerating reference frame of bike and rider or simply as inertia in a stationary inertial reference frame and not forces at all gyroscopic forces acting on rotating parts such as wheels engine transmission etc are also due to inertia of those rotating parts they are discussed further in section on gyroscopic effects below internal forces internal forces those between components of bike and rider system are mostly caused by rider or by friction in addition to pedaling rider can apply torques between steering mechanism front fork handlebars front wheel etc and rear frame and between rider and rear frame friction exists between any parts that move against each other in drive train between steering mechanism and rear frame etc in addition to brakes which create friction between rotating wheels and non rotating frame parts many bikes have front and rear suspensions some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy and some bicycles have a spring connecting front fork to frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer bicycle straight ahead on bikes with rear suspensions feedback between drive train and suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers motions motions of a bike can be roughly grouped into those out of central plane of symmetry lateral and those in central plane of symmetry longitudinal or vertical lateral motions include balancing leaning steering and turning motions in central plane of symmetry include rolling forward of course but also brake diving and most suspension activation motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled that is they do not interact with each other to first order an uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self stable when moving under right conditions or when controlled by a rider conversely a bike is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration lateral dynamics of two lateral dynamics has proven to be more complicated requiring three dimensional dynamic analysis with at least two generalized coordinates to analyze at a minimum two coupled second order differential equations are required to capture principal motions exact solutions are not possible and numerical methods must be used instead competing theories of how bikes balance can still be found in print and online on other hand as shown in later sections much longitudinal dynamic analysis can be accomplished simply with planar kinetics and just one coordinate balance thumb upright balancing a bicycle by keeping wheels under center of mass when discussing bike balance it is necessary to distinguish carefully between stability self stability and controllability recent research suggests that rider controlled stability of bicycles is indeed related to their self stability a bike remains upright when it is steered so that ground reaction forces exactly balance all other internal and external forces it experiences such as gravitational if leaning inertial or centrifugal if in a turn gyroscopic if being steered and aerodynamic if in a crosswind steering may be supplied by a rider or under certain circumstances by bike itself this self stability is generated by a combination of several effects that depend on geometry mass distribution and forward speed of bike tires suspension steering damping and frame flex can also influence it especially in motorcycles even when staying relatively motionless a rider can balance a bike by same principle while performing a track stand rider can keep line between two contact patches under combined center of mass by steering front wheel to one side or other and then moving forward and backward slightly to move front contact patch from side to side as necessary forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling backwards motion can be generated same way on a fixed gear bicycle otherwise rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of pavement or lurch upper body backwards while brakes are momentarily engaged if steering of a bike is locked it becomes virtually impossible to balance while riding on other hand if gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter rotating wheels it is still easy to balance while riding one other way that a bike can be balanced with or without locked steering is by applying appropriate torques between bike and rider similar to way a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at elbow forward speed rider applies torque to handlebars in order to turn front wheel and so to control lean and maintain balance at high speeds small steering angles quickly move ground contact points laterally at low speeds larger steering angles are required to achieve same results in same amount of time because of this it is usually easier to maintain balance at high speeds as self stability typically occurs at speeds above a certain threshold going faster increases chances that a bike is contributing to its own stability center of mass location farther forward closer to front wheel center of mass of combined bike and rider less front wheel has to move laterally in order to maintain balance conversely farther back closer to rear wheel center of mass is located more front wheel lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance this can be noticeable on long wheelbase recumbents choppers and wheelie bikes it can also be a challenge for touring bikes that carry a heavy load of gear over or even behind rear wheel mass over rear wheel can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over front wheel a bike is also an example of an inverted pendulum just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in hand than a pencil a tall bike with a high center of mass can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because tall bike s lean rate rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over will be slower however a rider can have opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary a top heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright when stopped in traffic for example than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass this is an example of a vertical second class lever a small force at end of lever seat or handlebars at top of bike more easily moves a large mass if mass is closer to fulcrum where tires touch ground this is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks trail thumb 350px bike steering axis angle fork offset and trail a factor that influences how easy or difficult a bike will be to ride is trail distance that front wheel ground contact point trails behind steering axis ground contact point steering axis is axis about which entire steering mechanism fork handlebars front wheel etc pivots in traditional bike designs with a steering axis tilted back from vertical positive trail tends to steer front wheel into direction of a lean independent of forward speed this can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side front wheel will usually also steer to that side in a lean gravity provides this force dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated however and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect trail is a function of head angle fork offset or rake and wheel size their relationship can be described by this formula where is wheel radius is head angle measured clock wise from horizontal and is fork offset or rake trail can be increased by increasing wheel size decreasing head angle or decreasing fork rake more trail a traditional bike has more stable it feels although too much trail can make a bike feel difficult to steer bikes with negative trail where contact patch is in front of where steering axis intersects ground while still rideable are reported to feel very unstable normally road racing bicycles have more trail than touring bikes but less than mountain bikes mountain bikes are designed with reduced head angles than road bikes to improve stability for descents and therefore have greater trail touring bikes are built with small trail to allow rider to control a bike weighed down with baggage as a consequence an unloaded touring bike can feel unstable in bicycles fork rake often a curve in fork blades forward of steering axis is used to diminish trail bikes with negative trail exist such as python lowracer and are rideable and an experimental bike with negative trail has been shown to be self stable in motorcycles rake refers to head angle instead and offset created by triple tree is used to diminish trail a small survey by whitt and wilson found touring bicycles with head angles between 72deg and 73deg and trail between 43 mm and 60 mm racing bicycles with head angles between 73deg and 74deg and trail between 28 mm and 45 mm track bicycles with head angles of 75deg and trail between 23 5 mm and 37 mm however these ranges are not hard and fast for example lemond racing cycles offers both with forks that have 45 mm of offset or rake and same size wheels a 2006 tete de course designed for road racing with a head angle that varies from 71 1 4deg to 74deg depending on frame size and thus trail that varies from 51 5 mm to 69 mm a 2007 filmore designed for track with a head angle that varies from 72 1 2deg to 74deg depending on frame size and thus trail that varies from 51 5 mm to 61 mm amount of trail a particular bike has may vary with time for several reasons on bikes with front suspension especially telescopic forks compressing front suspension due to heavy braking for example can steepen steering axis angle and reduce trail trail also varies with lean angle and steering angle usually decreasing from a maximum when bike is straight upright and steered straight ahead trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean and steer angles which can alter how stable a bike feels finally even profile of front tire can influence how trail varies as bike is leaned and steered a measurement similar to trail called either mechanical trail normal trail or true trail is perpendicular distance from steering axis to centroid of front wheel contact patch wheelbase a factor that influences directional stability of a bike is wheelbase horizontal distance between ground contact points of front and rear wheels for a given displacement of front wheel due to some disturbance angle of resulting path from original is inversely proportional to wheelbase also radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to wheelbase finally wheelbase increases when bike is leaned and steered in extreme when lean angle is 90deg and bike is steered in direction of that lean wheelbase is increased by radius of front and rear wheels steering mechanism mass distribution another factor that can also contribute to self stability of traditional bike designs is distribution of mass in steering mechanism which includes front wheel fork and handlebar if center of mass for steering mechanism is in front of steering axis then pull of gravity will also cause front wheel to steer in direction of a lean this can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with ground additional parameters such as fore to aft position of center of mass and elevation of center of mass also contribute to dynamic behavior of a bike gyroscopic effects thumb 200px right gyroscopic effect on front wheel of a bike applying a torque in green about lean axis results in a reaction torque in blue about steer axis role of gyroscopic effect in most bike designs is to help steer front wheel into direction of a lean this phenomenon is called precession and rate at which an object precesses is inversely proportional to its rate of spin slower a front wheel spins faster it will when bike leans and vice versa rear wheel is prevented from precessing as front wheel does by friction of tires on ground and so continues to lean as though it were not spinning at all hence gyroscopic forces do not provide any resistance to tipping at low forward speeds precession of front wheel is too quick contributing to an uncontrolled bike s tendency to oversteer start to lean other way and eventually oscillate and fall over at high forward speeds precession is usually too slow contributing to an uncontrolled bike s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached upright position this instability is very slow on order of seconds and is easy for most riders to counteract thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled another contribution of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment generated by front wheel during countersteering for example steering left causes a moment to right moment is small compared to moment generated by out tracking front wheel but begins as soon as rider applies torque to handlebars and so can be helpful in motorcycle racing for more detail see section countersteering below and countersteering article self stability between two unstable regimes mentioned in previous section and influenced by all factors described above that contribute to balance trail mass distribution gyroscopic effects etc there may be a range of forward speeds for a given bike design at which these effects steer an uncontrolled bike upright it has been proven that neither gyroscopic effects nor positive trail are sufficient by themselves or necessary for self stability although they certainly can enhance hands free control however even without self stability a bike may be ridden by steering it to keep it over its wheels note that effects mentioned above that would combine to produce self stability may be overwhelmed by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables this video shows a riderless bicycle exhibiting self stability longitudinal acceleration longitudinal acceleration has been shown to have a large and complex effect on lateral dynamics in one study positive acceleration eliminates self stability and negative acceleration deceleration changes speeds of self stability turning thumb a grand prix motorcyclist leaning in a turn thumb forces both physical and inertial acting on a leaning bike in rotating reference frame of a turn where n is normal force ff is friction m is mass r is turn radius v is forward speed and g is acceleration of gravity thumb graph of bike lean angle vs forward speed assuming unlimited friction between tires and ground thumb upright cyclist riding with no hands on handlebars in order for a bike to turn that is change its direction of forward travel front wheel must aim approximately in desired direction as with any front wheel steered vehicle friction between wheels and ground then generates centripetal acceleration necessary to alter course from straight ahead as a combination of cornering force and camber thrust radius of turn of an upright not leaning bike can be roughly approximated for small steering angles by where is approximate radius is wheelbase is steer angle and is caster angle of steering axis leaning however unlike other wheeled vehicles bikes must also lean during a turn to balance relevant forces gravitational inertial frictional and ground support angle of lean th can easily be calculated using laws of circular motion where v is forward speed r is radius of turn and g is acceleration of gravity this is in idealized case a slight increase in lean angle may be required on motorcycles to compensate for width of modern tires at same forward speed and turn radius it can also be seen however that this simple 2 dimensional model essentially an inverted pendulum on a turntable predicts that steady state turn is unstable if bike is displaced slightly downwards from its equilibrium lean angle torque of gravity increases that of centrifugal force decreases and displacement gets amplified a more sophisticated model that allows a wheel to steer adjust path and counter torque of gravity is necessary to capture self stability observed in real bikes for example a bike in a 10 m 33 ft radius steady state turn at 10 m s 36 km h 22 mph must be at an angle of 45 6deg a rider can lean with respect to bike in order to keep either torso or bike more or less upright if desired angle that matters is one between horizontal plane and plane defined by tire contacts and location of center of mass of bike and rider this lean of bike decreases actual radius of turn proportionally to cosine of lean angle resulting radius can be roughly approximated within 2 of exact value by where r is approximate radius w is wheelbase th is lean angle d is steer angle and ph is caster angle of steering axis as a bike leans tires contact patches move farther to side causing wear portions at either edge of a motorcycle tire that remain by leaning into turns is sometimes referred to as finite width of tires alters actual lean angle of rear frame from ideal lean angle described above actual lean angle between frame and vertical must increase with tire width and decrease with center of mass height bikes with fat tires and low center of mass must lean more than bikes with tires or higher centers of mass to negotiate same turn at same speed increase in lean angle due to a tire thickness of 2t can be calculated as where ph is ideal lean angle and h is height of center of mass for example a motorcycle with a 12 inch wide rear tire will have t 6 inches if combined bike and rider center of mass is at a height of 26 inches then a 25deg lean must be increased by 7 28deg a nearly 30 increase if tires are only 6 inches wide then lean angle increase is only 3 16deg just under half it has been shown that couple created by gravity and ground reaction forces is necessary for a bicycle to turn at all on a custom built bicycle with spring loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple so that bicycle and rider may assume any lean angle when traveling in a straight line riders find it impossible to make a turn as soon as wheels deviate from a straight path bicycle and rider begin to lean in opposite direction and only way to right them is to steer back onto straight path countersteering in order to initiate a turn and necessary lean in direction of that turn a bike must momentarily steer in opposite direction this is often referred to as countersteering with front wheel now at a finite angle to direction of motion a lateral force is developed at contact patch of tire this force creates a torque around longitudinal roll axis of bike and this torque causes bike to lean away from initially steered direction and toward direction of desired turn where there is no external influence such as an opportune side wind to create force necessary to lean bike countersteering is necessary to initiate a rapid turn while initial steer torque and steer angle are both opposite desired turn direction this may not be case to maintain a steady state turn sustained steer angle is usually in same direction as turn but may remain opposite to direction of turn especially at high speeds sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite turn direction actual magnitude and orientation of both sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed bike geometry tire properties and combined bike and rider mass distribution once in a turn radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of turn to increase lean and decrease radius then into turn to decrease lean and increase radius to exit turn bike must again momentarily steering more into turn in order to decrease radius thus increasing inertial forces and thereby decreasing angle of lean steady state turning once a turn is established torque that must be applied to steering mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on forward speed and geometry and mass distribution of bike at speeds below capsize speed described below in section on eigenvalues and also called inversion speed self stability of bike will cause it to tend to steer into turn righting itself and exiting turn unless a torque is applied in opposite direction of turn at speeds above capsize speed capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out of turn increasing lean unless a torque is applied in direction of turn at capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain steady state turn steering angle several effects influence steering angle angle at which front assembly is rotated about steering axis necessary to maintain a steady state turn some of these are unique to single track vehicles while others are also experienced by automobiles some of these may be mentioned elsewhere in this article and they are repeated here though not necessarily in order of importance so that they may be found in one place first actual kinematic steering angle angle projected onto road plane to which front assembly is rotated is a function of steering angle and steering axis angle where is kinematic steering angle is steering angle and is caster angle of steering axis second lean of bike decreases actual radius of turn proportionally to cosine of lean angle resulting radius can be roughly approximated within 2 of exact value by where is approximate radius is wheelbase is lean angle is steering angle and is caster angle of steering axis third because front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution tire properties etc bikes can experience understeer or oversteer when steering angle must be greater and when oversteering steering angle must be less than it would be if slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius some authors even use term counter steering to refer to need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in opposite direction of turn negative steering angle to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage fourth camber thrust contributes to centripetal force necessary to cause bike to deviate from a straight path along with cornering force due to slip angle and can be largest contributor camber thrust contributes to ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle when a bike is steered and leaned in same direction camber angle of front tire is greater than that of rear and so can generate more camber thrust all else being equal no hands while countersteering is usually initiated by applying torque directly to handlebars on lighter vehicles such as bicycles it can also be accomplished by shifting rider s weight if rider leans to right relative to bike bike leans to left to conserve angular momentum and combined center of mass remains nearly in same vertical plane this leftward lean of bike called counter lean by some authors will cause it to steer to left and initiate a right hand turn as if rider had to left by applying a torque directly to handlebars this technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables combined center of mass does move slightly to left when rider leans to right relative to bike and bike leans to left in response action in space would have tires move right but this is prevented by friction between tires and ground and thus pushes combined center of mass left this is a small effect however as evidenced by difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone gyroscopic effects as mentioned above in section on balance one effect of turning front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession magnitude of this moment is proportional to moment of inertia of front wheel its spin rate forward motion rate that rider turns front wheel by applying a torque to handlebars and cosine of angle between steering axis and vertical for a sample motorcycle moving at 22 m s 50 mph that has a front wheel with a moment of inertia of 0 6 kg m2 turning front wheel one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3 5 n m in comparison lateral force on front tire as it tracks out from under motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50 n this acting on 0 6 m 2 ft height of center of mass generates a roll moment of 30 n m while moment from gyroscopic forces is only 12 of this it can play a significant part because it begins to act as soon as rider applies torque instead of building up more slowly as wheel out tracks this can be especially helpful in motorcycle racing two wheel steering because of theoretical benefits such as a tighter turning radius at low speed attempts have been made to construct motorcycles with two wheel steering one working prototype by ian drysdale in australia is reported to work very well issues in design include whether to provide active control of rear wheel or let it swing freely in case of active control control algorithm needs to decide between steering with or in opposite direction of front wheel when and how much one implementation of two wheel steering sideways bike lets rider control steering of both wheels directly another swing bike had second steering axis in front of seat so that it could also be controlled by handlebars milton w raymond built a long low two wheel steering bicycle called x 2 with various steering mechanisms to control two wheels independently steering motions included balance in which both wheels move together to steer tire contacts under center of mass and true circle in which wheels steer equally in opposite directions and thus steering bicycle without substantially changing lateral position of tire contacts relative to center of mass x 2 was also able to go crabwise with wheels parallel but out of line with frame for instance with front wheel near roadway center line and rear wheel near curb balance steering allowed easy balancing despite long wheelbase and low center of mass but no self balancing no hands configuration was discovered true circle as expected was essentially impossible to balance as steering does not correct for misalignment of tire patch and center of mass crabwise cycling at angles tested up to about 45deg did not show a tendency to fall over even under braking x 2 is mentioned in passing in whitt and wilson s bicycling science 2nd edition rear wheel steering because of theoretical benefits especially a simplified front wheel drive mechanism attempts have been made to construct a rideable rear wheel steering bike bendix company built a rear wheel steering bicycle and u s department of transportation commissioned construction of a rear wheel steering motorcycle both proved to be unrideable rainbow trainers inc in alton illinois offered us 5 000 to first person who can successfully ride rear steered bicycle rear steered bicycle i one documented example of someone successfully riding a rear wheel steering bicycle is that of l h at massachusetts institute of technology on a specially designed recumbent bike difficulty is that turning left accomplished by turning rear wheel to right initially moves center of mass to right and vice versa this complicates task of compensating for leans induced by environment examination of eigenvalues for bicycles with common geometries and mass distributions shows that when moving in reverse so as to have rear wheel steering they are inherently unstable this does not mean they are but that effort to control them is higher other purpose built designs have been published however that do not suffer this problem center steering thumb with center extremes of bicycles with classical front wheel steering and those with strictly rear wheel steering is a class of bikes with a pivot point somewhere between two referred to as center steering and similar to articulated steering an early implementation of concept was phantom bicycle in early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to penny farthing this design allows for simple front wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable even rideable no hands as many photographs illustrate these designs such as python lowracer a recumbent usually have very lax head angles 40deg to 65deg and positive or even negative trail builder of a bike with negative trail states that steering bike from straight ahead forces seat and thus rider to rise slightly and this offsets destabilizing effect of negative trail reverse steering bicycles have been constructed for investigation and demonstration purposes with steering reversed so that turning handlebars to left causes front wheel to turn to right and versa it is possible to ride such a bicycle but it has been found that riders experienced with normal bicycles find it very difficult to learn if they can manage it at all tiller effect tiller effect is expression used to describe how handlebars that extend far behind steering axis head tube act like a tiller on a boat in that one moves bars to right in order to turn front wheel to left and vice versa this situation is commonly found on cruiser bicycles some recumbents and some motorcycles it can be troublesome when it limits ability to steer because of interference or limits of arm reach tires tires have a large influence over bike handling especially on motorcycles but also on bicycles tires influence bike dynamics in two distinct ways finite crown radius and force generation increase crown radius of front tire has been shown to decrease size or eliminate self stability increasing crown radius of rear tire has opposite effect but to a lesser degree tires generate lateral forces necessary for steering and balance through a combination of cornering force and camber thrust tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds because front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution tire properties etc bikes can experience understeer or oversteer of two understeer in which front wheel slides more than rear wheel is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance also because real tires have a finite contact patch with road surface that can generate a scrub torque and when in a turn can experience some side slipping as they roll they can generate torques about an axis normal to plane of contact patch thumb right bike tire contact patch during a right hand turn one torque generated by a tire called self aligning torque is caused by asymmetries in side slip along length of contact patch resultant force of this side slip occurs behind geometric center of contact patch a distance described as pneumatic trail and so creates a torque on tire since direction of side slip is towards outside of turn force on tire is towards center of turn therefore this torque tends to turn front wheel in direction of side slip away from direction of turn and therefore tends to increase radius of turn another torque is produced by finite width of contact patch and lean of tire in a turn portion of contact patch towards outside of turn is actually moving rearward with respect to wheel s hub faster than rest of contact patch because of its greater radius from hub by same reasoning inner portion is moving rearward more slowly so outer and inner portions of contact patch slip on pavement in opposite directions generating a torque that tends to turn front wheel in direction of turn and therefore tends to decrease turn radius combination of these two opposite torques creates a resulting yaw torque on front wheel and its direction is a function of side slip angle of tire angle between actual path of tire and direction it is pointing and camber angle of tire angle that tire leans from vertical result of this torque is often suppression of inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in section on steady state turning high side a highsider or high side is a type of bike motion which is caused by a rear wheel gaining traction when it is not facing in direction of travel usually after slipping sideways in a curve this can occur under heavy braking acceleration a varying road surface or suspension activation especially due to interaction with drive train it can take form of a single slip then flip or a series of violent oscillations maneuverability and handling bike maneuverability and handling is difficult to quantify for several reasons geometry of a bike especially steering axis angle makes kinematic analysis complicated under many conditions bikes are inherently unstable and must always be under rider control finally rider s skill has a large influence on bike s performance in any maneuver bike designs tend to consist of a trade off between maneuverability and stability rider control inputs thumb graphs showing lean and steer angle response of an otherwise uncontrolled bike traveling at a forward speed in its stable range 6 m s to a steer torque that begins as an impulse and then remains constant torque to right causes initial steer to right lean to left and eventually a steady state steer lean and turn to left primary control input that rider can make is to apply a torque directly to steering mechanism via handlebars because of bike s own dynamics due to steering geometry and gyroscopic effects direct position control over steering angle has been found to be problematic a secondary control input that rider can make is to lean upper torso relative to bike as mentioned above effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with mass of bike on heavy bikes such as motorcycles rider lean mostly alters ground clearance requirements in a turn improves view of road and improves bike system dynamics in a very low frequency passive manner in motorcycle racing leaning torso moving body and projecting a knee to inside of turn relative to bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding turn differences from automobiles need to keep a bike upright to avoid injury to rider and damage to vehicle even limits type of maneuverability testing that is commonly performed for example while automobile enthusiast publications often perform and quote results motorcycle publications do not need to set up for a turn lean bike to appropriate angle means that rider must see further ahead than is necessary for a typical car at same speed and this need increases more than in proportion to speed rating schemes several schemes have been devised to rate handling of bikes particularly motorcycles roll index is ratio between steering torque and roll or lean angle acceleration index is ratio between steering torque and lateral or centripetal acceleration steering ratio is ratio between theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire behavior and actual turning radius values less than one where front wheel side slip is greater than rear wheel side slip are described as under steering equal to one as neutral steering and greater than one as over steering values less than zero in which front wheel must be turned opposite direction of curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than front wheel have been described as counter steering riders tend to prefer neutral or slight over steering car drivers tend to prefer under steering koch index is ratio between peak steering torque and product of peak lean rate and forward speed large touring motorcycles tend to have a high koch index sport motorcycles tend to have a medium koch index and scooters tend to have a low koch index it is easier to maneuver light scooters than heavy motorcycles lateral motion theory although its equations of motion can be linearized a bike is a nonlinear system variable s to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components i e its behavior is not expressible as a sum of behaviors of its descriptors generally nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems in idealized case in which friction and any flexing is ignored a bike is a conservative system damping however can still be demonstrated under right circumstances side to side oscillations will decrease with time energy added with a sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright demonstrating self stability is converted into increased forward speed not lost as oscillations die out a bike is a system because its outcome is path dependent in order to know its exact configuration especially location it is necessary to know not only configuration of its parts but also their histories how they have moved over time this complicates mathematical analysis finally in language of control theory a bike exhibits non minimum phase behavior it turns in direction opposite of how it is initially steered as described above in section on countersteering degrees of freedom thumb graphs of bike steer angle and lean angle vs turn radius number of degrees of freedom of a bike depends on particular model being used simplest model that captures key dynamic features called whipple model after francis whipple who first developed equations for it has four rigid bodies with knife edge wheels rolling without slip on a flat smooth surface and has 7 degrees of freedom configuration variables required to completely describe location and orientation of all 4 bodies x coordinate of rear wheel contact point y coordinate of rear wheel contact point orientation angle of rear frame yaw rotation angle of rear wheel rotation angle of front wheel lean angle of rear frame roll steering angle between rear frame and front end adding complexity to model such as rider movement suspension movement tire compliance or frame flex adds degrees of freedom while rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering pitch angle is completely constrained by requirement for both wheels to remain on ground and so can be calculated geometrically from other seven variables if location of bike and rotation of wheels are ignored first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored and bike can be described by just two variables lean angle and steer angle equations of motion equations of motion of an idealized bike consisting of a rigid frame a rigid fork two knife edged rigid wheels all connected with frictionless bearings and rolling without friction or slip on a smooth horizontal surface and operating at or near upright and straight ahead unstable equilibrium can be represented by a single fourth order linearized ordinary differential equation or two coupled second order differential equations lean equation and steer equation where is lean angle of rear assembly is steer angle of front assembly relative to rear assembly and and are moments torques applied at rear assembly and steering axis respectively for analysis of an uncontrolled bike both are taken to be zero these can be represented in matrix form as where is symmetrical mass matrix which contains terms that include only mass and geometry of bike is so called damping matrix even though an idealized bike has no dissipation which contains terms that include forward speed and is asymmetric is so called stiffness matrix which contains terms that include gravitational constant and and is symmetric in and asymmetric in is a vector of lean angle and steer angle and is a vector of external forces moments mentioned above in this idealized and linearized model there are many geometric parameters wheelbase head angle mass of each body wheel radius etc but only four significant variables lean angle lean rate steer angle and steer rate these equations have been verified by comparison with multiple numeric models derived completely independently equations show that bicycle is like an inverted pendulum with lateral position of its support controlled by terms representing roll acceleration roll velocity and roll displacement to steering torque feedback roll acceleration term is normally of wrong sign for self stabilization and can be expected to be important mainly in respect of wobble oscillations roll velocity feedback is of correct sign is gyroscopic in nature being proportional to speed and is dominated by front wheel contribution roll displacement term is most important one and is mainly controlled by trail steering rake and offset of front frame mass center from steering axis all terms involve complex combinations of bicycle design parameters and sometimes speed limitations of benchmark bicycle are considered and extensions to treatments of tires frames and riders and their implications are included optimal rider controls for stabilization and path following control are also discussed eigenvalues right thumb 300px eigenvalues plotted against forward speed for a typical utility bicycle simplified to have knife edge wheels that roll without slip it is possible to calculate eigenvalues one for each of four state variables lean angle lean rate steer angle and steer rate from linearized equations in order to analyze normal modes and self stability of a particular bike design in plot to right eigenvalues of one particular bicycle are calculated for forward speeds of 0 10 m s 22 mph when real parts of all eigenvalues shown in dark blue are negative bike is self stable when imaginary parts of any eigenvalues shown in cyan are non zero bike exhibits oscillation eigenvalues are point symmetric about origin and so any bike design with a self stable region in forward speeds will not be self stable going backwards at same speed there are three forward speeds that can be identified in plot to right at which motion of bike changes qualitatively forward speed at which oscillations begin at about 1 m s 2 2 mph in this example sometimes called double root speed due to there being a repeated root to characteristic polynomial two of four eigenvalues have exactly same value below this speed bike simply falls over as an inverted pendulum does forward speed at which oscillations do not increase where weave mode eigenvalues switch from positive to negative in a hopf bifurcation at about 5 3 m s 12 mph in this example is called weave speed below this speed oscillations increase until uncontrolled bike falls over above this speed oscillations eventually die out forward speed at which non oscillatory leaning increases where capsize mode eigenvalues switch from negative to positive in a pitchfork bifurcation at about 8 m s 18 mph in this example is called capsize speed above this speed this non oscillating lean eventually causes uncontrolled bike to fall over between these last two speeds if they both exist is a range of forward speeds at which particular bike design is self stable in case of bike whose eigenvalues are shown here self stable range is 5 3 8 0 m s 12 18 mph fourth which is usually stable very negative represents behavior of front wheel as it tends to turn towards direction in which bike is traveling note that this idealized model does not exhibit wobble or shimmy and rear wobble instabilities described above they are seen in models that incorporate tire interaction with ground or other degrees of freedom experimentation with real bikes has so far confirmed weave mode predicted by eigenvalues it was found that tire slip and frame flex are not important for lateral dynamics of bicycle in speed range up to 6 m s idealized bike model used to calculate eigenvalues shown here does not incorporate any of torques that real tires can generate and so tire interaction with pavement cannot prevent capsize mode from becoming unstable at high speeds as wilson and cossalter suggest happens in real world modes thumb graphs that show from left to right top to bottom weave instability self stability marginal self stability and capsize instability in an idealized linearized model of an uncontrolled utility bicycle bikes as complex mechanisms have a variety of modes fundamental ways that they can move these modes can be stable or unstable depending on bike parameters and its forward speed in this context stable means that an uncontrolled bike will continue rolling forward without falling over as long as forward speed is maintained conversely unstable means that an uncontrolled bike will eventually fall over even if forward speed is maintained modes can be differentiated by speed at which they switch stability and relative phases of leaning and steering as bike experiences that mode any bike motion consists of a combination of various amounts of possible modes and there are three main modes that a bike can experience capsize weave and wobble a lesser known mode is rear wobble and it is usually stable capsize capsize is word used to describe a bike falling over without oscillation during capsize an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers in direction of lean but never enough to stop increasing lean until a very high lean angle is reached at which point steering may turn in opposite direction a capsize can happen very slowly if bike is moving forward rapidly because capsize instability is so slow on order of seconds it is easy for rider to control and is actually used by rider to initiate lean necessary for a turn for most bikes depending on geometry and mass distribution capsize is stable at low speeds and becomes less stable as speed increases until it is no longer stable however on many bikes tire interaction with pavement is sufficient to prevent capsize from becoming unstable at high speeds weave weave is word used to describe a slow 0 4 hz oscillation between leaning left and steering right and vice versa entire bike is affected with significant changes in steering angle lean angle roll and heading angle yaw steering is 180deg out of phase with heading and 90deg out of phase with leaning this avi movie shows weave for most bikes depending on geometry and mass distribution weave is unstable at low speeds and becomes less pronounced as speed increases until it is no longer unstable while amplitude may decrease frequency actually increases with speed wobble or shimmy right thumb 300px eigenvalues plotted against forward speed for a motorcycle modeled with frame flexibility and realistic tire properties additional modes can be seen such as wobble which becomes unstable at 43 7 m s right thumb 300px same eigenvalues as in figure above but plotted on a root locus plot several additional oscillating modes are visible wobble shimmy tank slapper speed wobble and death wobble are all words and phrases used to describe a rapid 4 10 hz oscillation of primarily just front end front wheel fork and handlebars also involved is yawing of rear frame which may contribute to wobble when too flexible roe g e and thorpe t e a solution of low speed wheel flutter instability in motorcycles journal mechanical engineering science v 18 no 2 1976 this instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels airplane landing gear and automobile front wheels while wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed position or grip on handlebar it can be fatal if left uncontrolled wobble or shimmy begins when some otherwise minor irregularity such as fork asymmetry accelerates wheel to one side restoring force is applied in phase with progress of irregularity and wheel turns to other side where process is repeated if there is insufficient damping in steering oscillation will increase until system failure occurs oscillation frequency can be changed by changing forward speed making bike stiffer or lighter or increasing stiffness of steering of which rider is a main component rear wobble term rear wobble is used to describe a mode of oscillation in which lean angle roll and heading angle yaw are almost in phase and both 180deg out of phase with steer angle rate of this oscillation is moderate with a maximum of about 6 5 hz rear wobble is heavily damped and falls off quickly as bike speed increases design criteria effect that design parameters of a bike have on these modes can be investigated by examining eigenvalues of linearized equations of motion for more details on equations of motion and eigenvalues see section on equations of motion above some general conclusions that have been drawn are described here lateral and torsional stiffness of rear frame and wheel spindle affects wobble mode damping substantially long wheelbase and trail and a flat steering head angle have been found to increase weave mode damping lateral distortion can be countered by locating front fork torsional axis as low as possible cornering weave tendencies are amplified by degraded damping of rear suspension cornering camber and relaxation length of rear tire make largest contribution to weave damping same parameters of front tire have a lesser effect rear loading also amplifies cornering weave tendencies rear load assemblies with appropriate stiffness and damping however were successful in damping out weave and wobble oscillations one study has shown theoretically that while a bike leaned in a turn road undulations can excite weave mode at high speed or wobble mode at low speed if either of their frequencies match vehicle speed and other parameters excitation of wobble mode can be mitigated by an effective steering damper and excitation of weave mode is worse for light riders than for heavy riders riding on treadmills and rollers riding on a treadmill is theoretically identical to riding on stationary pavement and physical testing has confirmed this treadmills have been developed specifically for indoor bicycle training riding on rollers is still under investigation other hypotheses although bicycles and motorcycles can appear to be simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts frame fork and two wheels these parts are arranged in a way that makes them complicated to analyze while it is an observable fact that bikes can be ridden even when gyroscopic effects of their wheels are canceled

work macaulay houghton mifflin new york ny 1989 longitudinal dynamics thumb a bicyclist performing a wheelie bikes may experience a variety of longitudinal forces and motions on most bikes when front wheel is turned to one side or other entire rear frame pitches forward slightly depending on steering axis angle and amount of trail on bikes with suspensions either front rear or both trim is used to describe geometric configuration of bike especially in response to forces of braking accelerating turning drive train and aerodynamic drag load borne by two wheels varies not only with center of mass location which in turn varies with amount and location of passengers and luggage but also with acceleration and deceleration this phenomenon is known as load transfer or weight transfer depending on author and provides challenges and opportunities to both riders and designers for example motorcycle racers can use it to increase friction available to front tire when cornering and attempts to reduce front suspension compression during heavy braking has spawned several motorcycle fork designs net aerodynamic drag forces may be considered to act at a single point called center of pressure at high speeds this will create a net moment about rear driving wheel and result in a net transfer of load from front wheel to rear wheel also depending on shape of bike and shape of any fairing that might be installed aerodynamic lift may be present that either increases or further reduces load on front wheel stability though longitudinally stable when stationary a bike may become longitudinally unstable under sufficient acceleration or deceleration and euler s second law can be used to analyze ground reaction forces generated for example normal vertical ground reaction forces at wheels for a bike with a wheelbase and a center of mass at height and at a distance in front of rear wheel hub and for simplicity with both wheels locked can be expressed as for rear wheel and for front wheel frictional horizontal forces are simply for rear wheel and for front wheel where is coefficient of friction is total mass of bike and rider and is acceleration of gravity therefore if which occurs if center of mass is anywhere above or in front of a line extending back from front wheel contact patch and inclined at angle above horizontal then normal force of rear wheel will be zero at which point equation no longer applies and bike will begin to flip or loop forward over front wheel on other hand if center of mass height is behind or below line such as on most tandem bicycles or long wheel base recumbent bicycles as well as cars it is less likely that front wheel can generate enough braking force to flip bike this means they can decelerate up to nearly limit of adhesion of tires to road which could reach 0 8 g if coefficient of friction is 0 8 which is 40 more than an upright bicycle under even best conditions bicycling science author david gordon wilson points out that this puts upright bicyclists at particular risk of causing a rear end collision if they tailgate cars similarly powerful motorcycles can generate enough torque at rear wheel to lift front wheel off ground in a maneuver called a wheelie a line similar to one described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from rear wheel contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given available friction center of mass location and sufficient power this can also happen on bicycles although there is much less power available if center of mass is back or up far enough or rider lurches back when applying power to pedals of course angle of terrain can influence all of calculations above all else remaining equal risk of pitching over front end is reduced when riding up hill and increased when riding down hill possibility of performing a wheelie increases when riding up hill and is a major factor in motorcycle hillclimbing competitions braking according to ground conditions thumb with no braking on a bicycle m is usually approximately over bottom bracket when braking rider in motion is seeking to change speed of combined mass m of rider plus bike this is a negative acceleration a in line of travel f ma acceleration a causes an inertial forward force f on mass m braking a is from an initial speed u to a final speed v over a length of time t equation u v at implies that greater acceleration shorter time needed to change speed stopping distance s is also shortest when acceleration a is at highest possible value compatible with road conditions equation s ut 1 2 makes s low when a is high and t is low how much braking force to apply to each wheel depends both on ground conditions and on balance of weight on wheels at each instant in time total braking force cannot exceed gravity force on rider and bike times coefficient of friction m of tire on ground mgm ff fr a skid occurs if ratio of either ff over nf or fr over nr is greater than m with a rear wheel skid having less of a negative impact on lateral stability when braking inertial force ma in line of travel not being co linear with f tends to rotate m about f this tendency to rotate an overturning moment is resisted by a moment from mg thumb in light braking nr is still significant so fr can contribute towards braking nr decreases as ma increases taking moments about front wheel contact point at an instance in time when there is no braking mass m is typically above bottom bracket about 2 3 of way back between front and rear wheels with nr thus greater than nf in constant light braking whether because an emergency stop is not required or because poor ground conditions prevent heavy braking much weight still rests on rear wheel meaning that nr is still large and fr can contribute towards a as braking a increases nr and fr decrease because moment mah increases with a at maximum constant a clockwise and anti clockwise moments are equal at which point nr 0 any greater ff initiates a stoppie thumb at maximum braking nr 0 other factors downhill it is much easier to topple over front wheel because incline moves line of mg closer to f to try to reduce this tendency rider can stand back on pedals to try to keep m as far back as possible when braking is increasing center of mass m may move forward relative to front wheel as rider moves forward relative to bike and if bike has suspension on front wheel front forks compress under load changing bike geometry this all puts extra load on front wheel at end of a brake maneuver as rider comes to a halt suspension and pushes rider back values for m vary greatly depending on a number of factors material that ground or road surface is made of whether ground is wet or dry smoothness or roughness of ground firmness or looseness of ground speed of vehicle with friction reducing above 30 mph 50 km h whether friction is rolling or sliding with sliding friction at least 10 below peak rolling friction braking thumb a motorcyclist performing a stoppie most of braking force of standard upright bikes comes from front wheel as analysis above shows if brakes themselves are strong enough rear wheel is easy to skid while front wheel often can generate enough stopping force to flip rider and bike over front wheel this is called a stoppie if rear wheel is lifted but bike does not flip or an endo abbreviated form of end over end if bike flips on long or low bikes however such as cruiser motorcycles and recumbent bicycles front tire will skid instead possibly causing a loss of balance assuming no loss of balance it is possible to calculate optimum braking performance depending on bike s geometry location of center of gravity of bike and rider and maximum coefficient of friction in case of a front suspension especially telescoping fork tubes increase in downward force on front wheel during braking may cause suspension to compress and front end to lower this is known as brake diving a riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases downward force on front wheel is known as trail braking front wheel braking limiting factors on maximum deceleration in front wheel braking are maximum limiting value of static friction between tire and ground often between 0 5 and 0 8 for rubber on dry asphalt kinetic friction between brake pads and rim or disk and pitching or looping of bike and rider over front wheel for an upright bicycle on dry asphalt with excellent brakes pitching will probably be limiting factor combined center of mass of a typical upright bicycle and rider will be about back from front wheel contact patch and above allowing a maximum deceleration of 0 5 g 5 m s2 or 16 ft s2 if rider modulates brakes properly however pitching can be avoided if rider moves his weight back and down even larger decelerations are possible front brakes on many inexpensive bikes are not strong enough so on road they are limiting factor cheap cantilever brakes especially with power modulators and raleigh style side pull brakes severely restrict stopping force in wet conditions they are even less effective front wheel slides are more common off road mud water and loose stones reduce friction between tire and trail although knobby tires can mitigate this effect by grabbing surface irregularities front wheel slides are also common on corners whether on road or off centripetal acceleration adds to forces on tire ground contact and when friction force is exceeded wheel slides rear wheel braking rear brake of an upright bicycle can only produce about 0 25 g 2 5 m s2 deceleration at best because of decrease in normal force at rear wheel as described above all such bikes with only rear braking are subject to this limitation for example bikes with only a coaster brake and fixed gear bikes with no other braking mechanism there are however situations that may warrant rear wheel braking slippery surfaces or bumpy surfaces under front wheel braking lower coefficient of friction may cause front wheel to skid which often results in a loss of balance front flat tire braking a wheel with a flat tire can cause tire to come off rim which greatly reduces friction and in case of a front wheel result in a loss of balance to deliberately induce a rear wheel skid to induce oversteer and achieve a smaller turn radius on tight turns front brake failure recumbent bicycles long wheelbase recumbents require a good rear brake as cg is near rear wheel braking technique expert opinion varies from use both levers equally at first to fastest that you can stop any bike of normal wheelbase is to apply front brake so hard that rear wheel is just about to lift off ground depending on road conditions rider skill level and desired fraction of maximum possible deceleration suspension thumb mountain bike rear suspension bikes may have only front only rear full suspension or no suspension that operate primarily in central plane of symmetry though with some consideration given to lateral compliance goals of a bike suspension are to reduce vibration experienced by rider maintain wheel contact with ground reduce loss of momentum when riding over an object reduce impact forces caused by jumps or drops and maintain vehicle trim primary suspension parameters are stiffness damping sprung and unsprung mass and tire characteristics besides irregularities in terrain brake acceleration and drive train forces can also activate suspension as described above examples include bob and pedal feedback on bicycles shaft effect on motorcycles and squat and brake dive on both vibration study of vibrations in bikes includes its causes such as engine balance wheel balance ground surface and aerodynamics its transmission and absorption and its effects on bike rider and safety an important factor in any vibration analysis is a comparison of natural frequencies of system with possible driving frequencies of vibration sources a close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes a challenge in vibration damping is to create compliance in certain directions vertically without sacrificing frame rigidity needed for power transmission and handling another issue with vibration for bike is possibility of failure due to material fatigue effects of vibration on riders include discomfort loss of efficiency hand arm vibration syndrome a secondary form s disease and whole body vibration vibrating instruments may be inaccurate or difficult to read in bicycles primary cause of vibrations in a properly functioning bicycle is surface over which it rolls in addition to pneumatic tires and traditional bicycle suspensions a variety of techniques have been developed to damp vibrations before they reach rider these include materials such as carbon fiber either in whole frame or just key components such as front fork or handlebars tube shapes such as curved seat stays gel handlebar grips and saddles and special inserts such as by specialized and by in motorcycles in addition to road surface vibrations in a motorcycle can be caused by engine and wheels if unbalanced manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations such as engine balance shafts rubber engine mounts and tire weights problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after market parts and systems designed to reduce it add ons include handlebar weights isolated foot pegs and engine counterweights at high speeds motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting this can be abated by changing air flow over key parts such as windshield experimentation a variety of experiments have been performed in order to verify or disprove various hypotheses about bike dynamics david jones built several bikes in a search for an unrideable configuration richard klein built several bikes to confirm jones s findings richard klein also built a torque wrench bike and a rocket bike to investigate steering torques and their effects keith code built a motorcycle with fixed handlebars to investigate effects of rider motion and position on steering schwab and
