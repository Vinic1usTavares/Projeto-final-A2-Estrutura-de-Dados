thumb upright lewis chessmen an iconic image of scandinavian scotland in harald maddadsson s time harald maddadsson old norse haraldr maddadarson gaelic aralt mac c 1134 1206 was earl of orkney and mormaer of caithness from 1139 until 1206 he was son of matad mormaer of atholl and margaret daughter of earl haakon paulsson of orkney of mixed norse and gaelic blood and a descendant of scots kings harald was probably a descendant of mael coluim mac cinaeda died 1034 and perhaps of donnchad mac crinain he was a significant figure in northern scotland and played a prominent part in scottish politics of twelfth century orkneyinga saga names him one of three most powerful earls of orkney along with sigurd eysteinsson and thorfinn sigurdsson orkneyinga saga c 112 background in early twelfth century earldom of orkney although weakened since time of earl thorfinn remained in control of caithness and was dominant in sutherland and parts of outer hebrides thus succession of earldom was of great interest to scots king david i marriage of matad and margaret is believed to have taken place not long before 1134 shortly following david s suppression of a major revolt involving mormaer oengus of moray grandson of king lulach and mael coluim mac alaxandair illegitimate son of david s brother alexander and subsequent extension of royal power into provinces of moray and ross oram david i pp 96 97 david s nephew william fitz duncan was appointed to rule moray and it has been proposed that matad whose power lay in scottish kingdom s heartland of atholl may also have been granted authority in new lands north of mounth and that his marriage to margaret haakons daughter was arranged with this in mind oram david i pp 97 98 harald maddadsson was born shortly before rognvald kali kolsson took control of earldom of orkney on disappearance of earl paul haakonsson orkneyinga saga reports official tale that paul had abdicated and rumour that he was killed on orders of harald s mother earl paul had not been well loved by his female kin his mother and her sister frakkok had previously tried to murder him with a poisoned shirt which instead caused death of his brother harald haakonsson rognvald represented pro norwegian faction in earldom it is said that frakkok and her supporters had originally intended to advance claims of harald haakon s son erlend on paul s death however matad and margaret with king david backing them imposed infant harald maddadson as joint ruler with rognvald oram david i pp 97 99 orkneyinga saga cc 55 74 75 early years main threat to harald maddadsson and rognvald kali came from erlend haraldsson especially from erlend s supporter frakkok old conspirator however was soon disposed of burned to death in her hall near orkneyinga saga names svein asleifsson as killer and says that he came to caithness from south from atholl with rognvald s blessing and matad s help this svein asleifsson had also been man in whose custody earl paul had disappeared oram david i pp 99 100 orkneyinga saga c 78 in harald s early years when power was exercised jointly with rognvald on his behalf by councillors chosen by king david orkney enjoyed relative stability although saga contains usual killings and burnings of time including death of an earl who is otherwise unknown orkneyinga saga cc 79 84 in 1150 or 1151 harald visited norway with earl rognvald and probably met with king ingi haraldsson orkneyinga saga c 85 during this visit rognvald made his decision to go on crusade as recounted at length in saga orkneyinga saga cc 85 90 earls rognvald harald and erlend after harald returned to orkney and rognvald departed on his expedition king eystein haraldsson eldest brother of ingi undertook a raiding expedition from norway against earldom of orkney during this operation he encountered harald near thurso and captured him harald was freed in return for a ransom in gold and by giving his oath to eystein eystein then went on to raid coasts of scotland and england heimskringla saga of sons of harald c 20 orkneyinga saga c 91 possibly as a result of eystein s activities king david granted half of caithness to harald s cousin erlend haraldsson oram david i pp 100 101 result as recounted in orkneyinga saga was a political struggle which ended with erlend s murder in 1154 rognvald too was killed in 1158 svein asleifsson was again heavily involved in this dynastic conflict orkneyinga saga cc 92 104 in 1153 king david died to be succeeded by his young grandson malcolm iv king eystein too died in a war with his brothers ingi and sigurd which left ingi sole surviving son of harald gilli heimskringla saga of sons of harald cc 28 32 as a result by 1158 harald maddadsson was undisputed earl of orkney with neither king of scots nor king of norway in any position to contest his power earl harald and kings enemies from death of rognvald harald maddadsson pursued a policy of supporting enemies of kings of scotland first malcolm iv who died young in 1165 perhaps related to osteitis deformans see duncan pp 74 75 then malcolm s brother william of these enemies those who were active in north and west where harald s power was significant were somerled king of argyll and hebrides who married earl harold s first cousin ragnhild of isle of man sons of mael coluim mac alasdair illegitimate son of king alexander i himself held prisoner at roxburgh meic uilleim descendants of william fitz duncan and and dispossessed would be mormaers of ross who possibly were a branch of ancient loairn dynasty of moray and claimants of its rights an expedition to ross by king william and his brother earl david in 1179 may have been related to harald s activities grant p 106 macdonald outlaws p 99 two years later rebellion of domnall son of mael coluim mac uilleim broke out in ross and moray and it is presumed that earl harald played a part in this rebellion was not finally suppressed until 1187 grant pp 106 107 macdonald outlaws pp 99 100 defeat of domnall s rebellion led to more conflict between earl harald and king william after 1187 it appears that scots and scotto norman nobles were being planted in ross and in cromarty as had previously happened in moray de moravia family anglicised as moray or murray which later produced andrew moray were granted lands in ross and cromarty and they are unlikely to have been unique in this award when king william fell ill in 1195 this may have been catalyst for final conflict with harald which lasted from 1197 until 1201 as part of this struggle william granted lands in caithness to harald young grandson of rognvald kali in 1197 harald young was killed by harald maddadsson following year grant pp 106 107 mcdonald outlaws pp 99 100 orkneyinga saga c 109 orkneyinga saga states that king william called upon king of mann ragnald to fight against harald orkneyinga saga c 110 for more on rognvald mcdonald kingdom of isles pp 85 88 144 150 151 212 mcdonald concludes that ragnald was a dominant figure in west in later twelfth century rognvald had possibly spuriously claims to harald s lands because people remembered that harald s mother was younger daughter of earl haakon paulsson whereas elder daughter had married king of isle of man although ragnald s father godfrey of man had been that lady s stepson and not her own son harald however retook caithness at this time in this campaign dated to 1201 saga tells that harald came to stronghold of bishop john of caithness at scrabster bishop john went to meet harald apparently to greet him but earl had him seized tortured and mutilated orkneyinga saga c 111 gesta annalia reports that harald tormented bishop john in this way because he believed that john was an informant set on making trouble between harald and king william macdonald outlaws pp 107 109 creation of john s see of caithness in 1189 1190 was undoubtedly intended to extend scots authority in region new bishopric was not uncontroversial and john soon came into conflict with harald maddadson and bishop of orkney bjarni kolbeinsson conflict presented as a dispute over collection of monies for papacy a form of peter s pence was appealed to pope innocent iii who wrote to bishop bjarni and bishop of rosemarkie or ross to prevent john from interfering with collection king william using treatment of bishop john as a cause for war with harald brought a large army north in 1201 1202 army it is said was so large that harald capitulated without a fight and agreed to give a quarter of revenues of caithness to william during this time earl harald s son thorfinn was captured by scots whether in revenge for treatment of bishop john or to cow harald or because thorfinn may have had some claim to throne through his mother lady of moray he was blinded and castrated dying soon later in prison orkneyinga saga c 112 oram david i pp 101 102 harald maddadson also faced troubles with norwegian king orkney and shetland warriors oyskjeggs led by harald s brother in law olaf fought on behalf of sigurd magnusson against king sverre sigurdsson sigurd magnusson was son of former king magnus v of norway and pretender to throne of king sverre olaf was joined by hallkjell jonsson who had been a son in law of norwegian earl erling as well as brother in law of king magnus v king sverre and his force confronted oyskjeggs in spring of 1194 when two fleets met at florvag on askoy an island just north of bergen norway in battle of florvag on 3 april 1194 experience of norwegian veterans proved to be decisive king sverre won and both sigurd magnusson and hallkjell jonsson fell with most of their men king sverre appears to have believed that harald maddadson was involved in affair after battle of florvag king sverre punished harald by seizing shetland which was never returned in his lifetime orkneyinga saga c 112 saga c 125 in 1202 pope innocent persuaded that harald was not personally responsible for abuse of bishop john wrote to bishop bjarni to order him to ensure that harald s man who was blamed for deeds was suitably punished macdonald outlaws p 109 letter text at documentation project with this story of harald s turbulent life reaches its close he died of natural causes in 1206 after a long and eventful reign of 65 years aged about 72 haraldssons harald s first wife was named affrica a gaelic name shared with a daughter of fergus of galloway they had four children together whom orkneyinga saga names as heinrek haakon helena and margaret second wife of earl harald orkneyinga saga says was hvarflod erroneously called gormflaith in some literature daughter of earl mael coluim of moray whom he married around 1168 and with her he had six children thorfinn david jon gunnhild and hvarflod s father is presumed to have been mael coluim mac possibly an heir of moray loairn dynasty s rights so that her sons and it may be that she was mother of thorfinn alone of harald s sons would carry on old rival claims to scots throne orkneyinga saga c 109 oram david i pp 101 102 identifies hvarflod as daughter of mael coluim mac alaxandair however macdonald outlaws p 99 from whom date is taken makes hvarflod daughter of mael coluim macheth it appears that king william demanded that harald repudiate hvarflod as a condition of peace between them macdonald outlaws p 158 of surviving haraldssons david and jon were joint earls of orkney on their father s death while heinrek eanric mac arailt mac ruled ross nothing more is known of and earl david haraldsson died of sickness in 1214 leaving jon to rule alone until 1231 in 1222 earl jon was implicated indirectly in burning of bishop adam of caithness in his hall at halkirk by local farmers jon was accused of looking on or of fomenting discontent macdonald outlaws pp 116 117 king alexander ii undertook harsh reprisals for killing to satisfaction of pope honorius iii writer of orkneyinga saga reported that punishments by alexander for burning of bishop by mutilation and death confiscation and outlawry from land are still in fresh memory macdonald outlaws pp 109 110 jon haraldsson was killed in 1231 at thurso in caithness he was contested by snaekoll a great grandson of rognvald kali who had demanded that jon should share earldom with him as had been done before jon s supporters and snaekoll s fought a war until it was agreed that king haakon should settle matter all concerned set off to norway but a ship carrying earl jon his supporters and his kin was lost at sea on return voyage as a result line of norse earls came to a temporary end and from 1231 until 1236 orkney was without an earl in 1236 earldom was granted by haakon iv of norway to magnus son of gille brigte mormaer of angus although ruled by angus strathearn and sinclair
