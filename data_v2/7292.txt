barmouth bridge welsh pont or barmouth viaduct is a grade ii listed single track wooden railway viaduct across estuary of river mawddach near barmouth wales it is long and carries cambrian line it is longest timber viaduct in wales and one of oldest in regular use in britain barmouth bridge was designed by and constructed for aberystwyth and welsh coast railway on its line between aberystwyth and pwllheli work was authorised in 1861 and commenced in 1864 on 10 october 1867 completed bridge was officially opened following discovery of severe corrosion on underwater sections of ironwork an intensive restoration programme was performed between december 1899 and late 1902 by 1980 viaduct was under attack by marine woodworm which led to concerns that it would have to be closed and demolished because of its value to tourism it was repaired between 1985 and 1986 when it was closed for six months since 2005 weight restriction on bridge have been relaxed allowing locomotive hauled trains to cross for first time in two decades bridge between and in gwynedd is used by rail cyclists and pedestrians and is part of national cycle network to allow passage of tall ships bridge incorporated a drawbridge which was replaced between 1899 and 1902 by a swing bridge which is no longer operational due to a lack of demand there is no provision for road traffic tolls were collected for foot and cycle traffic up to 2013 but this has been voluntary since 2017 location thumb left north end of crossing has a swing bridge section to allow tall ships to pass though it has not seen regular use since testing in 1980s barmouth bridge crosses estuary of river mawddach between morfa mawddach near on south and barmouth line was operated by arriva trains wales until 2018 and is now operated by transport for wales which provides connecting services south to aberystwyth and east to welshpool and shrewsbury bridge is on cambrian coast railway between machynlleth and pwllheli it is long and is made up of 113 wooden trestles supported by cast iron piers it is one of longest timber viaducts standing in britain and is a grade ii listed structure most of bridge is built on top of a gravel bed covered by shifting sand northern end of viaduct where swing bridge is located is next to fawr a rock at base of mountain water passing through channel flows at up to 9 knots 16 7 km h first two spans at this end are built on rock on cast iron cylindrical piers steel swing bridge section which replaced original drawbridge was last opened for testing in april 1987 installation of continuous rail across movable section now prevents its movement and passage of tall ships in and out of estuary nearest road across afon mawddach is toll bridge at penmaenpool about upstream which can carry vehicles up to 2 5 tonnes heavier vehicles must use first public road bridge at dolgellau about from barmouth pedestrians cyclists and motorcycles can cross estuary via footbridge on bridge s eastern side since 1996 footbridge has been part of national cycle route linking north and south wales footbridge is owned by network rail and gwynedd county council contributes 10 per cent of its annual maintenance in exchange for a licence to use it history background and construction thumb illustration of estuary and bridge circa 1869 a bridge across mawddach estuary at barmouth was proposed by aberystwith and welsh coast railway who constructed a line between aberystwyth and pwllheli authorisation for railway was received in 1861 2 and detailed design of bridge was started barmouth bridge was designed by civil engineers benjamin piercy and henry conybeare conybeare wanted a timber viaduct because it was about four times cheaper to import wood from baltic by sea than to construct an iron bridge decision was influenced by incorrect belief that estuary was free from marine borers which attack and weaken timber over time during this era timber pile viaducts were commonplace on coastal railways particularly in wales although bridge at barmouth would be longer than most construction began in 1864 contractor was thomas savin and ironwork was produced by john cochrane sons early on progress was hindered by strong tidal currents which caused multiple failed attempts to sink bridge s piers from barges between march and june 1866 staging was built from northern abutment for bridge and piers were dropped into water and filled with concrete thumb left a steam hauled train traversing barmouth bridge circa 1921 wooden trestles were built on screw piles wide with screw discs in diameter in groups of three piles per pier timber trellis girders long and deep supported deck with driven piles as fenders water around trestles had a maximum depth of at spring tides but river bed was raised by tipping stones to protect piles viaduct had a wooden drawbridge near its northern end allowing tall ships to pass upstream drawbridge span which was carried on top of wrought iron piles opened by tilting and rolling back over track on four wheels spaced apart and nine steel rollers when opened there was a gap between fenders drawbridge never regularly used as opening of railway effectively eliminated need for traditional boat traffic on 3 june 1867 horse drawn carriages crossed viaduct on 10 october bridge was officially opened and steam hauled services started operational life thumb underside view of bridge and its piers note concrete reinforcement towards base of wooden piers in august 1899 alfred jones collin chief engineer of cambrian railways ordered underwater inspections to check integrity of drawbridge span s ironwork they discovered that supports were severely corroded undermining its structural integrity and requiring replacement of all ironwork except for two piers a temporary speed limit of later reduced to was put in place while repairs were made repairs started that december and were completed by end of 1902 drawbridge was replaced with a swing bridge with a single steel swing span 41 5 meters long which rotated around a central pivot adjacent to a 36 meter long fixed span spans are hogback lattice trusses supported by pairs of cylindrical iron piers and turntable rests on a cluster of four piers in 1946 bridge was nearly destroyed after a live naval mine was washed ashore close to it during stormy weather according to reports mine had swept past one of pillars but did not detonate and bridge escaped unscathed thumb left view of bridge from northwest in 2014 following beeching cuts of 1960s passenger train services declined after closure of ruabon to barmouth line via llangollen and dolgellau in 1965 causing all traffic to take longer and slower route from shrewsbury via machynlleth and dovey junction old trackbed from morfa mawddach railway station to dolgellau now forms mawddach trail a walking and cycle trail by 1980 bridge was under attack from marine woodworm and resulting damage was serious enough to threaten its closure british rail discovered that woodworm had eaten into 69 of supporting pillars and estimated that it would cost around ps2 5 million to repair locomotive hauled trains were banned which resulted in loss of traffic from tywyn including explosives traffic to and from factory at which was re routed via road railway station and conwy valley line gwynedd county council opposed closing bridge as 40 of all railway traffic in area was tourist related government applied for a ps2 5 million grant from european economic community eec to finance repairs and ps4 6 million was spent on signalling improvements upon line bridge was closed to traffic for six months during repair works and 30 of piles were replaced thumb barmouth bridge toll prices in 2007 before toll was removed on 13 april 1986 a british rail class 37 diesel locomotive number was named bont y to celebrate re introduction of locomotive hauled trains following repairs in 1985 1986 locomotive hauled trains were forbidden shortly afterwards after weight restrictions were imposed upon all bridge traffic after major repairs in 2005 weight restriction was relaxed and locomotive hauled trains are allowed to cross in march 2013 barmouth viaduct access group b was established to investigate an alternative route from town centre to bridge as walkway is steep narrow and unsuitable for buggies or wheelchairs in june bridge toll was removed after collectors left and were not replaced council is undecided as to how to pay for maintenance costs which were ps39 405 for year this is problematic as revenue from tolls is insufficient to cover council s share of costs and there is no budget to employ staff to collect payments gwynedd council proposed closing bridge to pedestrians and cyclists for cost reasons as it needed to find ps9 million of savings by april 2016 closing bridge is one of over 100 cost saving options totalling ps13 million that were put to a public consultation in autumn 2015 council pays network rail ps30 800 per year towards maintenance costs a petition calling on council to cease considerations of closing this much loved walking and cycling route attracted 20 000 signatures in a week in february 2016 it was reported that bridge would not close on 4 october 2016 barmouth bridge was closed to traffic for a week following a fire on structure fire on barmouth
