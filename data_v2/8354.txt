king s highway 3 commonly referred to as highway 3 is a provincially maintained highway in canadian province of ontario which travels parallel to northern shoreline of lake erie it has three segments first of which travels from ambassador bridge in windsor to highway 77 in leamington second portion begins at talbotville royal outside of st thomas at highway 4 and travels to western city limits of port colborne road is regionally maintained within port colborne as niagara regional road 3 but regains its provincial designation at highway 140 its third and final terminus is at edgewood park within fort erie town limits from there road continues as niagara regional road 3 to peace bridge where drivers can cross to united states total length of highway 3 is consisting of from windsor to leamington from talbotville royal to port colborne and from port colborne to edgewood park until late 1990s highway 3 formed a single continuous route from ambassador bridge to near peace bridge but since then has had significant portion transferred to regional and county governments a large segment of route follows historic talbot trail a settlement road following northern shore of lake erie constructed by colonel talbot in early 1800s as part of a grand settlement plan along lake front east of canborough road generally follows older settlement trails forks road connecting dunnville with wainfleet portions of sherk s road through port colborne to gasline and garrison road a military road built west from fort erie highway was initially designated in 1920 but not numbered until five years later it originally connected to niagara falls but was rerouted to fort erie following completion of peace bridge in late 1920s although a few portions of highway 3 were upgraded in years since highway generally follows same route as it did in 1930 however in 1997 segments through port colborne and fort erie were decommissioned as a provincial highway followed by a segment of route from leamington to talbotville royal in 1998 all three now exist as county regional roads portion of highway 3 along huron church road in windsor was reconstructed when rt hon herb gray parkway was constructed between 2011 and 2015 route description highway 3 follows route of historic talbot trail for most of its length abutting northern shore of lake erie between windsor and fort erie route deviates in places to bypass towns and to avoid less than direct trail laid nearly two centuries ago prior to 1998 highway spanned this entire distance but has since then been divided into three discontinuous sections western section travels from windsor to leamington from there a gap separates western and central sections highway 3 resumes near st thomas at southern end of highway 4 and travels east to port colborne central and eastern sections are divided by a connecting link through port colborne eastern section begins at highway 140 and travels to fort erie it ends at rosehill road a short distance west of peace bridge crossing into new york western segment western segment of highway 3 begins at ambassador bridge which connects canada with u s state of michigan over detroit river five lane highway travels southeast through windsor along huron church road surrounded by residential subdivisions then curves east along talbot road section through windsor to cabana road is maintained under a connecting link agreement between e c row expressway and howard ave highway 3 runs adjacent to rt hon herb gray parkway portion of highway 401 at essex county road 11 highway 3 enters rural southwestern ontario and is dominated by farmland for much of its length through essex county now four laned route becomes divided as it follows essex bypass around southern edge of essex with commercial services lining highway primarily on north side returning to farmland and narrowing to a two lane undivided road highway continues southeast passing nearby but avoiding several small communities that original highway travelled through after passing essex county road 18 route curves eastward passing north of ruthven before entering leamington along its northern fringe western section ends at southern terminus of highway 77 where provincially built but county maintained leamington bypass continues east to meet talbot road just east of town central segment thumb left five span bridge in cayuga in 2010 opened in 1924 demolished in 2014 and replaced by a concrete structure central segment is longest of three at it begins at southern terminus of highway 4 at talbotville royal in elgin county just northwest of st thomas and south of london route travels east into st thomas becoming a two laned expressway aptly named st thomas expressway this expressway begins at wellington road elgin county road 25 26 and travels through st thomas to centennial road featuring a single interchange however right of way is wide enough to accommodate any future upgrade to a divided expressway at eastern end highway 3 turns south onto centennial road and then east onto talbot line following historic talbot trail to east of aylmer this mostly straight and rural portion passes through several small villages before talbot trail splits from it to follow elgin norfolk county road 38 through highway 3 meanwhile curves northeast and passes through tillsonburg encountering highway 19 it then curves east and travels parallel to st thomas and eastern railway to courtland with talbot trail and snaking towards delhi now within norfolk county at delhi highway 3 turns south for before returning to its eastward orientation it continues through farmland to town of simcoe where it meets highway 24 from simcoe to canborough highway is nearly straight as an arrow with an occasional jog to northeast it enters haldimand county and intersects highway 6 in jarvis at cayuga it crosses grand river until 2014 a five span steel girder bridge crossed river but it has since been replaced by a concrete structure at canborough historic talbot trail ends and highway 3 veers south to dunnville briefly travelling along northern bank of grand river and gradually curving back eastward east of dunnville route follows forks road into wainfleet and niagara region at chambers corners it turns south and passes through wainfleet village crossing old feeder canal which once supplied welland canal with water from grand river just north of lake erie highway 3 turns east and travels straight towards port colborne passing just south of wainfleet bog at townline road boundary between wainfleet and port colborne central section ends and roadway continues as niagara regional road 3 through city meeting southern end of highway 58 thumb right highway 3 at highway 140 in port colborne portions of central segment of highway 3 through several towns are maintained under connecting link agreements including within aylmer delhi simcoe cayuga and dunnville combined length of these segments is eastern segment final and shortest section of highway 3 begins at highway 140 on eastern fringe of port colborne and lies entirely within niagara region segment travels several kilometres inland to lake erie as well as parallel to it from there it mostly travels along a straight line eastward through generally rural areas notable exception is village of gasline where niagara speedway stands on northern side of highway at fort erie boundary route widens to four lanes and jogs northeast to align with old garrison road as highway progresses eastward into town surroundings gradually become more urbanized before it ends at rosehill road roadway continues east through fort erie to foot of peace bridge as niagara regional road 3 connecting with queen elizabeth way to provide access to united states thumb left approaching ambassador bridge in windsor westbound traffic on highway 401 funnels onto highway 3 and faces over a dozen traffic lights work is ongoing to bypass this bottleneck with a six lane freeway connections with united states highway 3 was only ontario provincial highway to start and end at bridges ambassador bridge leading into detroit michigan and peace bridge leading into buffalo new york with both termini at international crossings a quick link from chicago toledo and detroit to buffalo and western new york highway 3 was shorter and more direct than any american route including interstate 90 because lake erie shoreline dips south along ohio pennsylvania and new york after 1954 new york state thruway opened from buffalo to new york city michigan officials had encouraged ontario to replace highway 3 with a toll road connecting detroit to buffalo highway 3 has been largely replaced as a detroit buffalo truck route by highway 401 highway 403 and queen elizabeth way last section of highway 403 opened in august 1997 leaving a local section of highway 3 on windsor surface streets as a bottleneck to be bypassed by windsor essex parkway and gordie howe international bridge to detroit in 2020 when michigan department of transportation discontinued us 25 in 1973 much of it through detroit was redesignated as m 3 whose southern terminus came at clark street in detroit at junction of i 75 by ambassador bridge this provided a connection between michigan s m 3 and ontario s highway 3 until 2001 when jurisdictional changes within downtown detroit created a discontinuous segment of m 3 and this international route 3 connection was lost when portion of m 3 along fort street was redesignated m 85 history talbot trail history of highway 3 dates back over 200 years to pioneering settlement era of upper canada following american revolution and resulting influx of united empire loyalists thomas talbot an influential scion who joined british army at age of 11 would challenge government terrain and forces of nature to see to it that his road be built due to his family legacy talbot worked through ranks quickly and found himself a personal aide to john graves simcoe first lieutenant governor of upper canada he returned to england after simcoe fell ill but vowed to return to hinterland he had come to love thumb right colonel thomas talbot after completing his military commission talbot returned to upper canada in 1801 at age of 30 although simcoe had promised talbot of land in yarmouth township on shoreline of lake erie he had not made it official talbot returned to england in 1802 and spoke to legislature promoting his concept of a vibrant farming settlement government granted talbot his land and promised an additional for each family that settled a lot in original grant talbot returned to upper canada in 1803 with four families and a letter from lord hobart authorizing his grant and established what is now town of port stanley wishing to expand his grant and create his ideal colony talbot sought out new settlers a road was required talbot received a grant of 250 in september 1804 for construction of a road between brantford and delhi john bostwick would survey route that year however funding shortages would halt construction in 1806 talbot approached new lieutenant governor francis gore in 1808 with intent of persuading him to fund building of road he insisted that a road would increase value of land in surrounding townships as well as providing a greater incentive for newcomers to settle in what was otherwise a desolate wilderness gore instructed deputy surveyor mahlon burwell to build a road one chain wide laid out on principle of yonge street with lots on each side burwell began this work in 1809 westward from delhi in 1811 he was tasked with surveying west talbot road from talbotville royale to amherstburg by then a road was already opened between port talbot and talbotville royale construction of new road proved far more difficult than first imagined workers followed an old native american trail wholly consumed by nature between delhi and port talbot to get across numerous swamps felled trees were laid across path to create a corduroy road much to chagrin of settlers outbreak of war of 1812 would temporarily halt further construction when it resumed in 1816 talbot himself began directing surveyor ordering that road remain on highest ground possible this led to an irregular and winding route between aylmer and delhi by 1830 corduroy logs had been removed and road improved and extended from amherstburg to canborough niagara trails east of canborough highway 3 follows several early settlement trails forks road between dunnville and chambers corners sherk s road through port colborne to gasline and military garrison road through fort erie these roads predate land survey grid of concession roads and sidelines which would be used by provincial government to make highway 3 a continuous route through niagara peninsula where none previously existed forks road a river road following forks creek served to connect grand river at dunnville with welland river west of welland like many early roads in upper canada it was built along a river bank it can therefore be assumed that this trail was built prior to completion of feeder canal in 1832 sherk s road was built at request of elias sherk d 1893 in 1858 to connect his house historic danner house with his and michael gondor s properties irregular road connected welland canal at now port colborne to community of ridgeway where it met west end of garrison road that road was built due to threat of american attack to provide quick access from fort erie and like other military roads in upper canada e g dundas street or yonge street it travelled in a straight line in this case parallel to lake erie shoreline provincial highway network until 1918 majority of primary roads through southern ontario formed part of county road system department of public works and highways paid up to 60 of construction and maintenance costs for these roads while counties were responsible for remaining 40 in 1919 federal government passed canada highways act which provided 20 000 000 to provinces under condition that they establish an official highway network up to 40 of construction costs would be subsidized first network plan was approved on february 26 1920 and included talbot road majority of what would soon become highway 3 was designated several months later in august however it would not receive a route number until summer of 1925 four significant changes to highway 3 have taken place since designation of route in 1920 first was an adjustment to eastern terminus second was essex bypass built through 1970s between windsor and leamington third was st thomas expressway a super two highway built in late 1970s final change was provincial highway transfers conducted in 1997 and 1998 that resulted in three segments of highway 3 being decommissioned between leamington and talbotville royale through port colborne and within fort erie highway 3 originally ended at honeymoon bridge in niagara falls it continued east of chambers corners along forks road regional road 23 rather than south through wainfleet as it does today it then travelled north through welland and east along lane highway 58 and highway 20 would later follow portions of this route as part of spirit of cooperation that inundated canada and us following world war i as well as to celebrate a century of peace a new bridge was planned between fort erie and buffalo alongside international railway crossing construction began in 1925 completed bridge opened to traffic on june 1 1927 two months later on august 7 bridge was formally dedicated as peace bridge by us vice president charles dawes and edward prince of wales traffic patterns quickly shifted to take advantage of new crossing and bypass of niagara falls that it provided in foresight of this department of public highways took control of a welland county road between chambers corners and fort erie on may 11 1927 this roadway which followed a significant portion of sherk s road and garrison road in addition to a concession road built west from port colborne and north through wainfleet village was designated as highway 3a following year it was surfaced with concrete and a new bridge built over welland canal in port colborne new route became so popular that in 1929 highway 3 and highway 3a designations were swapped in early 1970s as part of a review to determine future route of highway 406 south of welland proposals arose for a bypass of highway 3 from east of dunnville to port colborne near highway 58 essex bypass essex bypass was opened in stages in 1970s and early 1980s plans were completed in 1968 as part of a province wide program to bypass small towns on busy provincial highways first stage opened by 1972 began west of maidstone and passed south of essex where it then routed along malden road to its former alignment now essex county road 34 construction of an eastward extension to ruthven was underway by 1982 and completed in 1983 with road following union road to old alignment construction of a final extension from union road north of ruthven to past highway 77 on northern fringe of leamington was underway in late 1998 it opened in early december 1999 although leamington bypass was constructed by ministry of transportation mto segment east of highway 77 to county road 34 talbot road was never a part of highway 3 or provincial highway network it is signed as essex county road 33 as leamington is planning to link discontinuous segments of county road 33 with east side arterial road st thomas expressway thumb right lone interchange on st thomas expressway note unused right span of overpass designed to accommodate future expansion st thomas expressway was built along northern edge of that city beginning in 1974 it features six overpasses and a single interchange at first avenue a ribbon cutting ceremony was held on september 7 1981 to officially open new route which bypassed former highway 3 alignment along talbot street and short concurrency with highway 4 sunset drive bypass cost c 16 5 million to construct and features a two lane roadway with allotted space on north side for a second two lane roadway plans originally called for expressway to extend further east to new sarum and later even as far as aylmer but these have never materialized downloads and changes since thumb left highway 3 ended near peace bridge from 1929 until 1998 aside from essex bypass and st thomas expressway highway 3 remained generally unchanged between 1930s and late 1990s however budget constraints brought on by a recession in 1990s resulted in mike harris provincial government forming who does what committee to determine cost cutting measures in order to balance budget after a deficit incurred by former premier bob rae it was determined that many ontario highways no longer served long distance traffic movement and should therefore be maintained by local or regional levels of government mto consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998 removing a significant percentage of provincial highway network despite once serving as one of principal highways through southwestern ontario highway 3 had been largely supplanted by highway 401 qew and later highway 403 as a through route as a result portions of route through regional municipality of niagara were transferred to region on april 1 1997 including a segment through port colborne most of which had existed as a connecting link and a segment in fort erie to west a segment of route paralleling highway 401 between leamington and talbotville royal was decommissioned on january 1 1998 and transferred to essex county chatham kent and elgin county it has since been designated as essex county road 34 chatham kent road 3 and elgin county road 3 in 2001 mto considered renumbering western segment of highway 3 as highway 103 to avoid confusion however this never came to pass windsor essex parkway at western end of highway 3 two major traffic concerns have been focus of controversy since mid 1990s and early 2000s essex bypass and approach to ambassador bridge numerous attempts by local and provincial politicians since then have led mto to begin remedying situation by upgrading bypass to a divided four lane road and constructing windsor essex parkway to a new international crossing essex bypass completed around village of essex in 1972 was designed to accommodate future widening to a divided four lane road when traffic volumes warranted by mid 1990s a regular pattern of fatalities were occurring prompting local politicians and essex member of provincial parliament mpp bruce crozier to lobby mto widen route it was announced in june 2006 that entire bypass would be widened to four lanes with a grassy median separating opposing flows of traffic three phase project began in september 2007 with a stretch between maidstone and county road 8 west of essex four laned highway opened in june 2009 at a cost of c 20 7 million c 22 1 million second phase involved widening highway between walker road and maidstone to a five lane cross section and began in mid november 2009 it was completed in early 2012 despite concerns raised by crozier in 2006 that project would be halted after first phase which were dismissed at time no further work has actually been completed on essex bypass since 2012 and section between essex and ruthven remains a two lane highway it is still considered as a future project by mto with no time line set three months after crozier s unexpected death on june 3 2011 entire essex bypass was renamed bruce crozier way in honour of his commitment to widening of highway in 2004 a joint announcement by federal government of united states and government of canada confirmed that a new border crossing would be constructed between detroit and windsor detroit river international crossing dric was formed as a bi national committee to manage project mto took advantage of this opportunity to extend highway 401 to international border and began an environmental assessment on entire project in late 2005 new parkway is below grade and has six through lanes it follows but did not replace talbot road and huron church road from a new interchange at current end of highway 401 to e c row expressway where it runs concurrently westward for from there it will turn northwest and follow a new alignment to border initial construction of a noise barrier from north talbot road to howard avenue began in march 2010 full construction began on august 19 2011 with an expected completion date of mid 2015 for first phase and 2015 16 for remainder of parkway in early 2015 it was announced that parkway would open to traffic between highway 3 and labelle street near e c row expressway in spring work was done in cayuga to install a new crossing over grand river replacing five span steel structure that previously served traffic since 1924 new concrete structure was opened to traffic on june 20 2014 and former structure was demolished after that on november 4 and december 4 of that year construction on bridge was halted by haudenosaunee confederacy chiefs council on claim that structure impeded on land reserved for a towpath along grand river by six nations of grand river first nation remaining work included a scheduled three day closure during which new bridge was jacked north to align with former structure as well as decorative work work was completed in autumn of 2015 major intersections see
