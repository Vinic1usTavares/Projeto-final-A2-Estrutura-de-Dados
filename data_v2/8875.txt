to ever pick up a microphone he put enough emotion and flair into his words to make them float inside of your consciousness for days writing for uk based fact magazine jack law said trap back mostly succeeds because it s fun describing mixtape s overall sound as an inventive weirdly playful twist on trap template and gucci mane s lyrics as completely conventional he s got a lot of money he s fucked a lot of etc but so eccentrically and extravagantly depicted that they end up seeming exotic and cartoonish in a mostly negative review phillip mlynar at hiphopdx said project reinforces limits
