hurricane edna was a deadly and destructive major hurricane that impacted united states east coast in september of 1954 atlantic hurricane season it was one of two hurricanes to strike massachusetts in that year other being hurricane carol fifth tropical cyclone and storm of season as well as fourth hurricane and second major hurricane edna developed from a tropical wave on september 2 moving towards north northwest edna skirted northern leeward islands as a tropical depression before turning more towards west depression attained tropical storm status to east of puerto rico and strengthened further to reach hurricane status by september 7 storm rapidly intensified and reached its peak intensity of 125 mph 205 km h north of bahamas before weakening to category 2 status near landfall in massachusetts on september 11 edna transitioned into an extratropical cyclone in atlantic canada before its remnants dissipated in northern atlantic edna caused 20 fatalities throughout its lifetime as a tropical cyclone as well as a moderate amount of damage it first caused rainfall induced flooding in puerto rico and it later brushed bahamas high waves affected coastline of north carolina edna resulted in heaviest day of rainfall in new york city in 45 years while strong waves cut off montauk from remainder of long island there were six highway deaths in state and 1 5 million in crop damage there were widespread evacuations in southern new england after hurricane carol struck same area only 11 days prior strong winds caused extensive power outages for 260 000 people including nearly all of cape cod edna became costliest hurricane in history of maine where hurricane caused flooding that washed out roads and rail lines there were 21 deaths in new england eight of whom in maine due to drownings later high winds severely damaged crops in atlantic canada meteorological history hurricane edna originated in an easterly tropical wave which modern research has estimated to have spawned a tropical depression east of caribbean sea on september 2 1954 low pressure area was not observed in real time until several days later on september 5 while situated between puerto rico and bahamas near disturbance a ship reported heavy squalls and wind gusts to additionally island of puerto rico experienced torrential rainfall in association with storm operationally system was not recognized to have organized into a tropical cyclone until september 6 it is listed in atlantic hurricane database as achieving tropical storm intensity early on september 4 edna proceeded west northwestward bypassing hispaniola to north and by september 7 it had strengthened into a minimal hurricane on present day saffir simpson hurricane scale initially a rather small storm in terms of physical size hurricane steadily intensified throughout day reconnaissance aircraft flew into storm frequently to take observations on cyclone s structure center of circulation passed near san salvador island and on september 8 edna further strengthened into a category 3 major hurricane while broadly curving northward reconnaissance flights indicated a maturing and evolving eye approximately in diameter overall circulation increased in size as banding features became more well defined storm reached its peak winds of and maintained them for over two days however reconnaissance data was at times inconsistent and inaccurate leading to suspicious and unlikely jogs in storm s track cause of these errors is attributed to misinterpretation of radar information midday on september 9 while tracking nearly due north edna s minimum central barometric pressure fell to but is believed to have leveled off shortly thereafter radius of hurricane force winds increased and storm may have become asymmetrical with convection concentrated to right of center although this was not confirmed due to a lack of data an approaching weak frontal boundary spread overcast conditions over eastern seaboard north of north carolina by september 10 edna was located just south of cape hatteras passing east of outer banks early next day as hurricane accelerated to northeast it began to deteriorate and weaken closely following recent track of hurricane carol edna approached new england but diverged from carol s track upon skirting eastern coast instead of moving inland weather reporting stations in mid atlantic states reported rapid clearing as storm gained latitude while heavy rain and gusty winds enveloped new england on september 11 edna passed directly over cape cod after weakening to category 2 status although surface weather analysis depicted a central pressure of it subsequently tracked just east of eastport maine storm continued northeastward into atlantic canada and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone although exact time of this transition is unknown storm s extratropical remnants reemerged into northern atlantic after crossing eastern canada and were last noted on september 15 preparations in advance of storm hurricane warnings were issued for parts of bahamas and south florida as winds of up to hurricane force were expected farther to north storm warnings were posted from myrtle beach south carolina to eastport maine along coast of north carolina and virginia capes where gale force winds and high tides were expected residents were advised to take precautions in new york city it was to be considered a miracle if edna did not strike area directly and storm was predicted to be one of most severe hurricanes in history of new york weather bureau in 24 hours before storm struck new york telephone received 361 392 calls which was third highest volume company ever recorded in montauk area 500 residents evacuated their homes by early september 11 while all businesses closed in westerly rhode island businesses in providence which was flooded during hurricane carol prepared sandbags to mitigate flooding most beach homes had closed for summer season and hundreds of people who lived along southern new england coast evacuated other threatened areas were evacuated including milford connecticut where 3 000 families left their homes sirens alerted other residents to remain indoors and drivers to stay off highways along coast of connecticut bus and train service was halted a state of emergency was declared in new london and mail service was canceled in some areas on september 10 navy ordered evacuation of hundreds of warships and aircraft coast guard planes evacuated from rhode island and massachusetts about 40 red cross shelters which were opened during hurricane carol 11 days prior were reopened to provide food officers at fort devens sent 40 trucks with cots blankets and generators to areas expected to be struck by storm advance warning was credited with a lower death toll in edna than carol impact right thumb 300px comparison of pressure readings between hurricanes carol and edna at jamaica new york and hurricane hazel in washington d c west indies on september 7 a bulletin from san juan puerto rico reported extensive flood inducing rainfall along western and southern coasts of island over of precipitation fell within a two day period easternmost islands of bahamas including san salvador experienced gale force winds and high seas united states edna s path near north carolina was about east of carol winds blew at up to along shore accompanied by strong surf although no fatalities or major property damage resulted from storm tides at norfolk virginia were only slightly above normal during storm s passage to east and winds were moderate in strength peripheral rainfall in maryland and delaware eased drought conditions in coastal new jersey northwesterly winds reached and long branch received around of rainfall further north long island also suffered moderate to strong winds blowing from north at their peak a weather bureau station in new york city recorded winds midday on september 11 rainfall reached in city becoming wettest day in 45 years storm cut off montauk point on eastern long island at its height prompting coast guard to temporarily relocate 500 families rainfall in suffolk county amounted to crop damage in new york was estimated at 1 5 million and six people died in city due to highway deaths when edna struck new england it was moving quickly to northeast at it struck eastern massachusetts about east of where hurricane carol struck only a week prior hurricane force winds affected much of coastline with peak gusts of on martha s vineyard offshore massachusetts and on block island offshore rhode island along coast wind gusts peaked at at hyannis massachusetts high winds caused widespread power outages including for nearly all of cape cod storm surge reached along massachusetts coast causing flooding and heavy boating damage further west there was lesser coastal flooding although heavy rainfall after previously wet conditions caused urban and stream flooding rainfall peaked at around damage in connecticut and rhode island was mainly in areas already affected by hurricane carol several streets were washed out and rivers rose above flood stage damage was heaviest in maine estimated at 25 million which made edna costliest hurricane in state s history strong wind gusts reaching and heavy rainfall peaking at extended into state these were considered heaviest rains in state in 58 years and kennebec rivers both reached above normal levels causing flooding and washing out roads in augusta kennebec river reached which was above peak level after spring snow melt flooding entered basements affected fields and covered bridges in west peru floods washed out a bridge that was under construction in addition winds downed trees which blocked widespread roads and caused power outages in 18 of state washed out roads and rail lines cut off state from rest of new england in lewiston a trapped car in deep waters required rescue by boat another stranded family was rescued after seven hours in unity in which one child and a rescuer were killed there were eight deaths in state most of whom related to cars being swept away by floods there were 21 deaths in new england including eight drownings in maine throughout united states damage was estimated at 42 815 000 damage was less from edna than from carol primarily due to its strongest winds not occurring at time of highest tides and its track farther to east throughout new england 260 000 people lost power most of whom in massachusetts atlantic canada while rapidly losing characteristics of a tropical cyclone edna traversed central new brunswick in contrast with smaller more compact hurricane juan which struck atlantic canada in 2003 edna was a much larger storm with strong winds extending hundreds of miles from center tightest pressure gradient was focused on east side of storm over mainland nova scotia edna brought down approximately 700 million board feet of timber and although amount of trees storm destroyed was comparable to that of juan its effects were more widespread and not as locally severe sustained winds reached at yarmouth and at halifax intense winds downed power and telephone lines and destroyed many barns one such structural collapse killed a man and livestock were lost throughout region other damage to property included several fallen chimneys a toppled church steeple in pictou and roof failures in kentville an apartment building undergoing construction was destroyed approximately 3 million cad in apple crops were decimated while in yarmouth both live lobsters and lobster pots were lost debris blocked streets across province and at least of road was washed out damage in nova scotia totaled 6 million cad in aftermath yarmouth and kentville declared states of emergency in new brunswick storm dropped of rain and produced winds of wind damage was less significant than in nova scotia although still evident in structures and utility lines a theatre in mcadam was destroyed and several people were injured across area storm flooded streets in st stephen about 400 salmon valued at 10 000 cad were lost in dalhousie total damage in province is estimated at 1 78 million cad elsewhere power outages were reported in montreal aftermath throughout new england 20 counties were declared states of emergency after storm southern new england telephone sent a crew of 100 workers in 50 trucks to maine to assist in restoring power power was quickly restored and in some places outages were less severe than during carol for only third time in its history portland evening express was not delivered due to storm most primary roads were re opened by two days after storm although rural areas and rail lines took longer to repair there was a temporary travel ban for all but emergency vehicles in maine due to washed out roads affecting densely populated portions of state edna struck day before governor race between republican burton m cross and democratic edmund muskie before election politicians commented how a suppressed turnout as a result of storm would benefit muskie in a state where no democrat had won governorship since 1934 muskie ultimately won election in a close race which saw a lower turnout than 1950 likely due to edna suppressing rural republican turnout after a survey from federal civil defense administration described damage as tremendous president dwight eisenhower declared portions of maine as a disaster area which allocated federal funding for relief president also authorized additional aid to rhode island and massachusetts due to additional damage there from edna due to severity of storm name edna was retired after this usage for ten years before it was reintroduced for 1968 season at 1969 interdepartmental hurricane conference it was proposed that names edna carol and hazel be permanently retired because of their importance to research community despite proposal name edna was added to 1972 naming list but was ultimately unused see also list of new england hurricanes hurricane bob references mccarthy earls eamon twisted sisters how four
