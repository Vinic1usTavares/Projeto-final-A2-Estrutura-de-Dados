thumb 300px right scharnhorsts and gneisenaus path across pacific alt map of depicting various pacific islands and dates at which spee arrived at them bombardment of papeete occurred in french polynesia when german warships attacked on 22 september 1914 during world war i german armoured cruisers and entered port of papeete on island of tahiti and sank french gunboat and freighter walkure before bombarding town s fortifications french shore batteries and a gunboat resisted german intrusion but were greatly outgunned main german objective was to seize coal piles stored on island but these were destroyed by french at start of action german vessels were largely undamaged but french lost their gunboat several of papeete s buildings were destroyed and town s economy was severely disrupted main strategic consequence of engagement was disclosure of cruisers positions to british admiralty which led to battle of coronel where entire german east asia squadron defeated a royal navy squadron depletion of scharnhorsts and gneisenaus ammunition at papeete also contributed to their subsequent destruction at battle of falklands background word of war reached admiral maximilian von spee of german east asia squadron while at ponape 17 july 6 august he concentrated majority of his squadron at pagan island in nearby mariana islands and then steamed off into pacific with scharnhorst class armored cruisers and konigsberg class light cruiser auxiliary cruiser sms titania and several colliers at his disposal nurnberg and titania were sent to gather intelligence at hawaii and raid cable station at fanning island halpern p 88 von spee then learned that australian and new zealand forces had captured german samoa and he sailed off in his flagship scharnhorst along with her sister ship gneisenau to engage what allied forces they could find there failing to catch samoa expeditionary force at apia and having seen no action at all since leaving pagan island men of admiral von spee s armored cruisers were eager to meet enemy in battle strachan p 472 von spee decided to raid papeete in tahiti on his way to rendezvous with rest of his squadron at easter island french held over of high quality cardiff coal at port and von spee hoped to seize coal piles to replenish his squadron s supply additionally von spee aimed at destroying what allied shipping he could find in harbour and thought raid might help raise his men s morale von spee intended to coal at suwarrow atoll before sailing to papeete but was prevented by foul weather instead von spee decided to take scharnhorst and gneisenau and attempt to resupply at bora bora while nurnberg and titania were dispatched to nuku hiva to guard fleet s colliers german admiral intended to keep his vessels identities secret by disguising them as french ships flying french flags and only allowing french and english speaking members of his crew contact with frenchmen present there von spee managed to replenish his food stores using gold seized by titania and nurnberg during their raid of fanning and was able to discover strength of french military in region as well as exact size and positions of coal piles at papeete hough p p 558 french had no heavy defenses at papeete but had been warned that von spee s squadron might raid tahiti and that a german squadron had been sighted off samoa although papeete was capital of french settlements in oceania by 1914 it had become a colonial backwater lacking a wireless station and having a garrison of only 25 colonial infantry and 20 gendarmes in order to bolster town s defenses lieutenant maxime destremau commander of old wooden gunboat and ranking officer at papeete had his ship s stern gun and all of her and guns removed from his vessel and placed ashore to be used in place of papeete s antiquated land batteries several ford trucks were turned into impromptu armored cars by mounting them with 37 mm guns and 160 sailors and marines drilled in preparation to repel any german attempt at landing zelee retained only her 100 mm bow gun and 10 men under ship s second in command in addition to gunboat and harbor fortifications french also had at papeete unarmed german freighter walkure which had been captured by zelee at start of war american forestry p 559 despite french preparations two german cruisers were more than a match for forces destremau commanded at papeete both scharnhorst and gneisenau heavily outgunned zelee each being armed with eight guns six guns eighteen guns and four torpedo tubes von spee s forces also outnumbered french with over 1 500 sailors aboard their vessels more than enough to form a landing party and overwhelm forces destremau had to oppose them groner p 52 battle thumb right one of turrets of scharnhorst main battery alt picture of large caliber guns on a german armored cruiser thumb captain maxime destremau center and his staff in papeete in 1914 at 07 00 on 22 september 1914 french sighted two unidentified cruisers approaching harbor of papeete alarm was raised harbor s signal beacons destroyed and three warning shots were fired by french batteries to signal approaching cruisers that they must identify themselves cruisers replied with a shot of their own and raised german colors signaling town to surrender french refused german demands and von spee s vessels began to shell shore batteries and town from a distance of american forestry p 553 land batteries and gunboat in harbor returned fire but scored no hits on armored cruisers having difficulty in discovering exact position of french batteries german cruisers soon turned their attention to french shipping in harbor hough p p 559 french commander destremau had ordered coal piles burned at start of action and now smoke began billowing over town zelee and walkure were sighted and fired upon by germans french had begun to scuttle their vessels when action had begun but both were still afloat when scharnhorst and gneisenau began firing upon them and finished two ships off by now most of papeete s inhabitants had fled and town had caught fire from german shelling with two blocks of papeete set alight american forestry p 554 with coal piles destroyed and threat of mines in harbor von spee saw no meaningful purpose in making a landing gudmundsson p 3 accordingly german admiral withdrew his ships from papeete s harbor by 11 00 after leaving papeete ships steamed out towards nuku hiva to meet nurnberg titania and colliers waiting there aftermath thumb 240px right some of damage done to town of papeete after it was bombarded by germans thumb picture of a battle damaged freighter half sunk in shallow water by time von spee withdrew his ships large portions of town had been destroyed two entire blocks of papeete had burnt to ground before fires were finally put out a copra store a market and several other buildings and residences were among those destroyed by shellfire and resulting inferno while majority of papeete s civilians fled to interior of island as soon as fighting began a japanese civilian and a polynesian boy were both killed by german shellfire although two french vessels in harbor had been sunk there were no military casualties on either side and german vessels took no damage overall bombardment was estimated in 1915 to have caused over 2 million francs worth of property damage some of which was recouped through seizure of a german store on island in addition to seizure of their property several local germans were interned and forced to repair damage von spee s squadron had caused perhaps most lasting effect of bombardment on french was dramatic fall of copra prices in region as local suppliers had previously sold a majority of their produce to german merchants in area who were now interned davis p 1 further havoc and distress spread throughout island 18 days after von spee s squadron had left when rumors started to spread that a second german bombardment was about to begin after withdrawing scharnhorst and gneisenau rendezvoused with nurnberg and titania at nuku hiva where they resupplied and their crews took shore leave before moving on to meet rest of squadron at easter island although germans had destroyed shipping at papeete and wreaked havoc in town they had been denied their primary objective of seizing french coal piles and replenishing their own stocks von spee s raid allowed british admiralty to receive word on his position and heading allowing them to inform rear admiral christopher cradock of german intentions thus leading to battle of coronel hough p 71 another effect was reduction of ammunition available to two german cruisers hundreds of shells fired by von spee s ships at papeete were irreplaceable depletion of ammunition as a result of action at papeete contributed to german east asia squadron s failure to adequately defend itself at battle of falkland islands against british battlecruisers freeman p 274 lieutenant destremau was chastised by his misinformed superior officer for his actions during defense of papeete and for loss of gunboat zelee he was summoned back to toulon under arrest to be court martialled but died of illness in 1915 before trial in 1918 destremau was finally recognized for his actions at papeete and was posthumously awarded legion d honneur citations references further reading heinz die von
