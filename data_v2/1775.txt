thumb right upright 1 5 map of monte bello islands indicating sites of operation mosaic nuclear test detonations g1 and g2 operation mosaic was a series of two british nuclear tests conducted in monte bello islands in western australia on 16 may and 19 june 1956 these tests followed operation totem series and preceded operation buffalo series second test in series was largest ever conducted in australia purpose of tests was to explore increasing yield of british nuclear weapons through boosting with lithium 6 and deuterium and use of a natural uranium tamper although a boosted fission weapon is not a hydrogen bomb which british government had agreed would not be tested in australia tests were connected with british hydrogen bomb programme operation totem tests of 1953 had been carried out at emu field in south australia but it was considered unsuitable a new permanent test site was being prepared at maralinga in south australia but would not be ready until september 1956 it was therefore decided that best option was to return to monte bello islands where operation hurricane had been conducted in 1952 a 15 july deadline was set as terminal date for operation mosaic to allow task force flagship tank landing ship to return to uk and refit for operation grapple planned first test of a british hydrogen bomb british government was anxious that grapple should take place before a proposed moratorium on nuclear testing came into effect second test was therefore conducted under time pressure at time of royal commission into british nuclear tests in australia in 1984 1985 there emerged a claim that second test was of a significantly higher yield than suggested by available figures as compared to but this claim remains unsubstantiated background during early part of second world war britain had a nuclear weapons project code named tube alloys which 1943 quebec agreement merged with american manhattan project to create a combined american british and canadian project british government expected that united states would continue to share nuclear technology which it regarded as a joint discovery but united states atomic energy act of 1946 mcmahon act ended technical co operation fearing a resurgence of united states isolationism and britain losing its great power status british government restarted its own development effort which was given cover name high explosive research first british atomic bomb was tested in operation hurricane at monte bello islands in western australia on 3 october 1952 britain thereby became third nuclear power after united states and soviet union but just four weeks after operation hurricane united states successfully demonstrated a hydrogen bomb technology mastered in operation hurricane was six years old and with hydrogen bomb in hand us congress saw no benefit in renewing cooperation with uk all while britain strove for independence at same time it sought interdependence in form of a renewal of special relationship with united states british government therefore resolved on 27 july 1954 to initiate british hydrogen bomb programme at time momentum was gathering both domestically and internationally for a moratorium on nuclear testing british government was most anxious that this should not occur before britain had developed hydrogen bombs which it was hoped would be achieved in 1957 purpose and site selection in thinking about thermonuclear designs british scientists at atomic weapons research establishment at aldermaston considered boosted fission weapons these are a type of nuclear warhead in which isotopes of light elements such as lithium 6 and deuterium are added resulting nuclear fusion reactions produced neutrons and thus increase rate of fission and therefore yield british had no practical experience with boosting so a test of concept was required scientists had also heard a rumour from american sources that yield could be improved by up to 50 per cent through use of a natural uranium tamper two tests were therefore added to schedule one with a lead tamper to investigate effect of lithium deuteride and one with a natural uranium tamper to investigate its effect two tests would provide important information that would materially advance progress towards building a british hydrogen bomb need for speed dictated location operation totem tests of 1953 had been carried out at emu field in south australia but it was considered unsuitable there area was too isolated with nearest road over away and only tracked vehicles or those with special tyres could traverse intervening sand dunes emu field therefore relied on air transport but dust storms were a problem moreover a shortage of water severely limited number of personnel at site a new permanent test site was therefore being prepared at maralinga in south australia but it would not be ready until september 1956 and operation buffalo tests were already scheduled to be held there it was therefore decided that best option was to return to monte bello islands where operation could be supported by royal navy there were also doubts as to whether australian government would allow a test at maralinga this was a sensitive matter there was an agreement with australia that no thermonuclear testing would be carried out there australian minister for supply howard beale responding to rumours reported in newspapers asserted that federal government has no intention of allowing any hydrogen bomb tests to take place in australia nor has it any intention of allowing any experiments connected with hydrogen bomb tests to take place here while a boosted fusion weapon is not a hydrogen bomb tests were indeed connected with hydrogen bomb development prime minister of united kingdom sir anthony eden cabled prime minister of australia robert menzies on 16 may 1955 eden detailed nature and purpose of tests he explained that experiments would include addition of light elements as a boost but promised that yield of neither test would exceed two and a half times that of operation hurricane test neither anticipated nor actual yield of hurricane test had been officially disclosed to australian officials but yield was so promised upper limit was about eden informed menzies that two shots would be from towers which would produce a fifth of fallout of that of operation hurricane and there would be no danger to people or animals on mainland he explained that use of monte bello islands would save as much as six months of development time menzies cabled his approval of tests on 20 june 1955 preparations like operation hurricane before it test was a royal navy responsibility planning commenced in february 1955 under codename operation giraffe in june 1955 admiralty adopted codename operation mosaic atomic trials executive in london chaired by lieutenant general sir frederick morgan had already begun planning operation buffalo it assumed responsibility for operation mosaic as well sitting as mosex or as appropriate captain hugh martell would be in charge as commander task force 308 with temporary rank of commodore charles adams from aldermaston who had been deputy technical director to leonard for operation hurricane and to william penney on operation totem was appointed scientific director for operation mosaic with ieuan maddock as scientific superintendent group captain s w b paddy menaul would command air task group menaul was also a nuclear test veteran having been an observer on board vickers valiant when it had made first operational drop of a british atomic bomb during operation totem planning was conducted at aldermaston on 18 july 1955 a five man mission headed by martell that included adams menaul and lieutenant commanders a k dodds and r r fotheringham departed uk for australia they arrived on 22 july and began a series of discussions australian government created a monte bello working party as a subcommittee of maralinga committee as a counterpart to british mosex adams met with w a s butement of recently formed atomic weapons tests safety committee awtsc an organisation created by australian government to oversee safety of nuclear tests mosex agreed that at least two members of awtsc would be present on board task force 308 flagship landing ship tank when decision to fire was taken he also had discussions with leonard dwyer director of australian bureau of meteorology about weather conditions that could be expected for test it was agreed that a royal australian navy ran frigate would act as a weather ship for test series and that a second weather ship might be required to give warnings of willy willys and cyclones a small fleet of ships was assembled for operation mosaic hms narvik began a refit at hm dockyard chatham in july 1955 which was completed by november she departed uk on 29 december 1955 and travelled via suez canal reaching fremantle on 23 february 1956 frigate normally yacht of commander in chief far east fleet was loaned to act as an accommodation ship for scientists and vips along with tanker they formed task group 308 1 far east fleet also supplied cruiser and destroyers and these formed task group 308 3 which was mainly responsible for weather reporting destroyer was detailed to carry out scientific tests and formed task group 308 4 they were augmented by ran vessels designated task group 308 2 sloop and boom defence vessel carried out a hydrographic survey of monte bello islands laying marker buoys for moorings care had to be taken with this as operation hurricane had left some parts of islands dangerously radioactive corvettes and provided logistical support ferried personnel between islands and mainland and accommodated 14 australian and british media representatives during first test they were replaced by for second test a pair of ran motor lighters and provided water and refrigeration respectively two barges were visited by first sea lord admiral lord mountbatten and lady mountbatten who flew out to islands on a whirlwind helicopter on 15 april only a small party of royal engineers and two aldermaston scientists travelled on narvik main scientific party left london by air on 1 april air task group consisted of 107 officers and 407 other ranks most were based at pearce and onslow although four royal air force raf shackletons and about 70 raf personnel were based at darwin from whence shackletons daily flew weather reconnaissance flights commencing on 2 march there was a cyclone three days later three royal australian air force raaf neptunes flew safety patrols five raf varsity aircraft tracked clouds and flew on low level radiological survey missions five raf canberra bombers were tasked with collecting radioactive samples four raf hastings aircraft flew between uk and australia and two whirlwind helicopters provided a taxi service united states air force usaf provided a pair of c 118 to collect radioactive samples lieutenant colonel r n b holmes was in charge of royal engineers whose task including erecting aluminium towers for shots g1 thumb corvette and lst bound for monte bello adams arrived at monte bello on 22 april and was sufficiently impressed with progress of works to schedule a scientific rehearsal for 27 april a second scientific rehearsal was held on 2 may followed by a full dress rehearsal on 5 may fissile material was delivered by a raf hastings to onslow from whence it was collected by hms alert on 11 may and delivered to monte bello islands following day five members of awtsc leslie h martin ernest titterton cecil eddy butement and dwyer arrived at onslow and were flown to narvik by helicopter on 14 may following day martell set 16 may as day for test there had been protests in perth at test series and deputy premier of western australia john tonkin promised to discuss demands for an end to tests martin and titterton confronted martell and adams and martin told them that without sufficient information about nature of tests awtsc could not approve test that it had a veto came as a surprise it was not what their orders from london said penney sent a message to adams 10 may thumb left rather than stonewall adams and martell disclosed same information that had been given to menzies on condition that they kept it to themselves this mollified them and g1 test went ahead device was detonated on island at 03 50 utc 11 50 local time on 16 may soon afterwards narvik and alert entered parting pool in monte bello islands radiological group wearing full protective clothing entered lagoon in a cutter they retrieved measuring instruments and conducted a ground survey a tent with a decontamination area was established ashore and a water pump allowed radiological group to wash themselves before they returned to narvik main danger to ships crews was considered to be from radioactive seaweed so crews were prohibited from catching or eating fish and ships evaporators were not run spot checks were made to verify that there was no contamination on board most of sample collection was completed by 20 may an extra run was made to collect film badges from hermite island and maddock paid crater a visit on 25 may to collect further samples two raf canberra bombers flew through cloud to collect samples one of which was flown by menaul results of test were mixed yield was between as had been anticipated although mushroom cloud rose to instead of as predicted valuable data was obtained implosion system had performed flawlessly but boosting effect of lithium deuteride had been negligible boosting process had not been fully understood given result of g1 plans were changed for g2 it had been intended to use a lead tamper for g2 but given low yield of g1 a natural uranium tamper was substituted hms diana about from ground zero was quickly decontaminated and sailed for singapore on 18 may fallout cloud initially moved out to sea as predicted but then reversed direction and drifted across northern australia tests on aircraft at had detected signs of radioactive contamination from g1 indicating that some fallout had been blown over mainland g2 thumb right results of g1 meant that a natural uranium tamper could be used in g2 without exceeding limit laid down by awtsc scientific rehearsals for g2 were held on 28 and 31 may followed by a full rehearsal on 4 june fissile core for device was delivered to onslow by raf hastings on 6 june and once again couriered to monte bello islands by hms alert there then followed a period of waiting for suitable weather conditions idea was to avoid as far as possible fallout being blown over mainland at this time of year winds at low altitudes were mainly subject to coastal influences but above prevailing winds were from west what was required was an interval during which prevailing wind pattern was interrupted these were not common at this time of year at start of operation mosaic it had been estimated that conditions favourable for g2 would occur only three days per month in fact since narvik had arrived in march not a single day had been suitable and good weather conditions alone were insufficient meteorologists had to accurately forecast them a 15 july deadline was set as terminal date for mosaic so as to allow narvik to return to uk and refit for operation grapple first test of a british hydrogen bomb as deadline drew nearer william cook scientist in charge of hydrogen bomb project at aldermaston determined that in view of results of g1 g2 was now more important than ever he agreed that if necessary grapple could be delayed in order to conduct g2 with time running short test procedures were altered to allow for a break in weather to be exploited with an earlier firing time and a shorter countdown another complication was safety while test of a larger device would normally mandate a larger safety area beale announced that g2 was going to be smaller than g1 to avoid embarrassing minister safety area was not enlarged and no official announcement was made that g2 would in fact be larger than g1 weather improved on 8 june and martell ordered countdown to begin following day but beale objected to a test being carried out on a sunday during operation totem there was an agreement that no tests would be conducted on sundays mosex considered that matter in london and directed martell not to test on 10 june following 48 hours were unsuitable on 17 june meteorologists predicted a break in weather and martell ordered countdown to recommence weather balloons indicated that conditions were stable between with an anomaly between that was not considered significant thumb left g2 was detonated from a tower on alpha island at 02 14 utc 10 14 local time on 19 june it produced a yield of making it largest nuclear device ever detonated in australia at time of royal commission into british nuclear tests in australia in 1985 joan smith a british investigative journalist published a book clouds of deceit deadly legacy of britain s bomb tests in which she alleged that g2 test had a significantly higher yield than suggested by available figures as compared to official figure of she based this claim on secret documents released to public record office in 1985 but text was and documents have never been found british official historian lorna arnold reported that she had never seen any such documents cloud rose to considerably higher than predicted procedure for collecting samples was far more limited than that of g1 a land rover was landed from a landing craft assault lca and driven by a party wearing protective clothing to within of ground zero to collect samples and recover blast measurement equipment another sortie was made to collect film badges from hermite island and maddock collected a sample from g2 crater canberra sent to fly through cloud had trouble finding it and only after some searching located it about from where it was supposed to be following day canberra sent to track cloud and collect more samples could not locate it at all bulk of fallout drifted over arafura sea but owing to different winds at different altitudes part of it again drifted over mainland as fallout was detected over northern australia by monitoring stations in combination with beale s announcement that g2 would be smaller than g1 an impression was generated that something had gone horribly wrong acting prime minister sir arthur fadden ordered an inquiry seamen in fremantle demanded that ss a cattle transport on which 75 cattle had died on board be inspected as it was feared that they had died from radioactive poisoning seamen refused to unload remaining 479 cattle a physicist from commonwealth x ray and radium laboratory with a geiger counter found no evidence of radioactive contamination and deaths were determined to have resulted from red water disease caused by a malaria like parasite it was estimated that someone living in port hedland where contamination was highest would receive a dose of over a period of 50 years assuming that they wore no clothes an annual exposure of is normally considered acceptable for occupational purposes aftermath by 1980s radioactivity had decayed to point where it was no longer hazardous to casual visitor but there were still radioactive metal fragments island remained a prohibited area until 1992 a 2006 zoological survey found that wildlife had recovered as part of gorgon gas project rats and feral cats were eradicated from monte bello islands in 2009 and birds and marsupials were transplanted from nearby barrow island to hermite island today monte bello islands are a park visitors are advised not to spend more than an hour per day at test sites or to
