peniophora quercina is a species of wood decay fungus in family it produces fruit bodies that vary in appearance depending on whether they are wet or dry wet fruit bodies are waxy and lilac and attached strongly to wood on which they grow when dry edges curl up and reveal dark underside while surface becomes crusty and pink p quercina is type species of genus peniophora with species being reclassified as a member of genus upon latter s creation by mordecai cubitt cooke p quercina is found primarily in europe where it can be encountered all year though primarily growing upon dead wood especially oak it is also capable of growing upon still living wood taxonomy early descriptions of species came from carl ludwig willdenow who named it lichen in 1787 and jean baptiste francois pierre bulliard who in 1790 named it auricularia corticalis however sanctioned name is thelephora quercina given by christiaan hendrik persoon in 1801 and sanctioned by elias magnus fries in first volume of his systema mycologicum specific name quercina is in reference to quercus generic name for oak a number of authors including jean baptiste lamarck lucien quelet and giacomo reclassified bulliard s auricularia corticalis throughout 19th century while persoon s thelephora quercina was reclassified by samuel frederick gray in 1821 who placed it in corticium as corticium however in 1879 mordecai cubitt cooke transferred species to his newly described genus peniophora declaring it type species despite subsequent attempts at reclassification cooke s name is one currently used description peniophora quercina produces fruit bodies that vary in appearance depending on whether they are wet or dry they are up to thick and form irregular patches that sometimes measure several centimetres across initially species forms small disc shaped fruit bodies through holes in bark but these expand and merge to form irregular patches when fresh surface is reminiscent of jelly or wax and can be smooth or warty varying in colour from a dull blue to lilac initially they are firmly attached to wood on which they are growing but as they dry edges roll inwards and reveal dark brown or black underside dry specimens have a crusty and slightly fissured surface and in colour are a bright pink or grey tinted with lilac there is a relatively thick layer of gelatinous flesh apart from a brown layer close to wood flesh is hyaline species has no distinctive odour or taste and is inedible microscopic features peniophora quercina produces spores that take shape of a curved cylinder sausage shaped and have been variously reported as light red pink and white they measure from 8 to 12 by 3 to 4 micrometres mm spores are borne on basidia with four spores per basidium which measure 50 to 70 by 5 to 12 mm species has hyaline cystidia with thick cell walls which are heavily encrusted with crystalline material cystidia are often buried within fruit body as it grows but can be found in large numbers they have been variously described as spindle shaped or conical and measure 25 to 35 by 10 to 15 mm hyphae have clamp connections and base of fruit body is made up of brown hyphae with moderately thick cell walls measuring 3 to 4 mm in width similar species peniophora is similar in appearance to p quercina however edges of fruit body are highlighted in a dark black and species favours ash as opposed to oak ecology and distribution peniophora quercina typically grows upon dead wood which can be attached to tree or fallen where it causes white rot it favours oak but can also be found on other deciduous trees such as beech p quercina is known to be a pioneer species on dead wood which means it can be first species to grow it is found in europe where it is very common though it can be encountered all year it produces spores in late summer and autumn it has also been recorded in amur in eastern asia species has also been identified in living sapwood though it is latent at this time and it is probable that it waits until wood begins to die when it is drier but contains more oxygen before mycelia begin to grow when species was inoculated into living wood it did grow but only around inoculation wound species did not spread as it would have done on dead wood another study found that species actively colonised partially living branches causing white rot however species had little effect on cambium and was mostly limited to ends of branches references category fungal tree pathogens and diseases category russulales category inedible fungi category fungi described in 1879 category fungi of europe category fungi of asia category taxa named by christiaan hendrik persoon
