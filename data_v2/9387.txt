began in 2008 following completion of sonic unleashed while they kept most of unleasheds core gameplay elements developers sonic team and dimps decided to create an equal balance between speed and platforming similar to that of games released for sega genesis in comparison to straightforward gameplay of unleashed following requests by fans team also made decision to make sonic only playable character and to omit gimmick themes such as swordplay mechanic used in 2009 spin off sonic and black knight team chose to develop sonic colors on nintendo s wii and ds consoles hoping to expand upon audience attracted by successful mario sonic at olympic games crossover games one of first ideas was setting should be an amusement park sonic team then realized that any sort of terrestrial amusement park would be too small to contain sonic s adventures from this came idea of an interplanetary park which would allow for more creativity and variance in game developers used disneyland as visual inspiration for levels sonic team also desired something that would diversify gameplay but did not slow it down thus wisps were added to game to expand and strengthen gameplay without forcing player to switch to other playable characters another goal was to encourage players to revisit completed levels sonic team accomplished this by adding segments requiring certain types of wisps to levels preceding their first appearances wii version makes use of physx physics engine sonic colors cover art previously used with 2007 s sonic and secret rings while ds version uses same engine used in 2005 entry sonic rush and its sequel according to producer takashi iizuka sonic colors was designed to appeal to a casual audience particularly children and fans of super mario series iizuka s statement that it was impossible to please all sonic fans initially alienated those who had enjoyed prior entries such as unleashed and sonic hedgehog 4 episode i though sega brand manager judy gilbertson later
