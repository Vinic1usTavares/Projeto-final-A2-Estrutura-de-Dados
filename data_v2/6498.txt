created a backstory that was included in stage directions pierson explained that in order to advance in florida prison system officers had to take criminology and courses at state university showing how warden might know such words strother martin later clarified that he felt line was kind that his character would very likely have heard or read from some pointy headed intellectuals who had begun to infiltrate his character s world under general rubric of a new enlightened approach to incarceration some authors believe that quotation was a metaphor for ongoing vietnam war conflict which was taking place during filming and others have applied it towards corporations and even teenagers quotation was listed at number 11 on american film institute s list of 100 most memorable movie lines

presence of paul newman is reason this movie works smile innocent blue eyes lack of strutting which no other actor could have produced as effectively contrary to general consensus newman s biographer lawrence j quirk thought that it was one of newman s weaker performances stating for once even newman s famed charisma fails him for in cool hand luke he completely lacks charm that say al pacino in scarecrow effortlessly exhibits when he plays a screw up who also winds up briefly incarcerated however quirk added that newman s performance was stronger in second half and said that to be fair to newman he was trying his damnedest to play an impossible part since luke is a convict s rationalization fantasy and never a real character some authors have criticized film s depiction of prison life
