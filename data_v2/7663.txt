mixed reviews from critics myles mcnutt from a v club awarded episode a c rating noting that test store was just too dumb to build any further momentum i wish i had a better word for it but i just can t think of one however mcnutt appreciated jim s presentation noting that final presentation was a pretty decent setpiece what culture reviewer joseph kratzer awarded episode three out of five stars noting that episode fell victim to overall lack of focus and believability that has plagued office all season jeffrey hyatt from screen crave gave episode a review of seven out of ten noting that office continues to get comedy boost it needs from florida storyline hyatt called scene featuring dwight and jim imitating kelly and ryan s mom as one of my favorite moments of season so far despite this he did call episode uneven noting that scranton story line was ho hum dan forcella from tv fanatic awarded episode four out of five stars and praised jim s presentation writing between jim s outfit and makeup fact that he embraced presentation throughout and all of chuck references i was speechless by end of that thing many reviews were critical of scranton sub plot mcnutt wrote that andy getting hit by a girl plays into most weak infantile parts of his character and making pam his accomplice was a complete non starter kratzer wrote don t get me wrong idea of andy getting punched in face by a female fifth grader isn t necessarily unbelievable or unfunny it s just that it had so little relevance or realism that it was difficult to follow for more than five minutes and it constituted an entire plot line references external links test store at nbc com category office american season 8 episodes category 2012 american television episodes category television episodes
