pallid sturgeon scaphirhynchus albus is an endangered species of ray finned fish endemic to waters of missouri and lower mississippi river basins of united states named for its pale coloration it is closely related to relatively common shovelnose sturgeon scaphirhynchus platorynchus but is much larger averaging between in length and in weight at maturity this species takes 15 years to mature and spawns infrequently but can live up to a century a member of sturgeon family acipenseridae which originated during cretaceous period 70 million years ago pallid sturgeon has changed little since then in 1990 u s fish and wildlife service placed pallid sturgeon on its endangered species list because few young individuals had been observed in preceding decade and sightings had greatly diminished species is now rarely seen in wild it was first fish species in missouri river drainage area to be listed as endangered and a loss of its habitat is thought to be responsible for its decline vast majority of missouri river drainage system has been channeled and dammed reducing gravel deposits and slow moving side channels that are its favored spawning areas until middle of 20th century pallid sturgeon were common and anglers found catching such a large fish in fresh water a rewarding experience species is considered to be good tasting and its eggs have been used as caviar although less commonly than those of many other sturgeon efforts to prevent species from becoming extinct have had modest success pallid sturgeon are actively being raised in a dozen hatcheries and offspring are being released back to wild every year to better understand pallid sturgeon behavior researchers have implanted radio transmitters to track their movements and help identify possible spawning areas federal and state agencies are working together to improve habitat by restoring spawning areas since restoration of these areas is required if species is to survive in wild taxonomy and etymology taxonomists s a forbes and r e richardson classified pallid sturgeon in 1905 grouping it in genus and family acipenseridae which includes all sturgeon worldwide its closest relatives are shovelnose sturgeon scaphirhynchus platorynchus which is still relatively common and critically endangered alabama sturgeon scaphirhynchus which may soon become extinct these three species belong to subfamily scaphirhynchinae which has only one other genus pseudoscaphirhynchus represented by three species found in west central asia word pallid means deficient in color and compared to other species of sturgeon pallid is noticeably paler scientific name for fish is derived from scaphirhynchus a greek word meaning spade snout and albus which is latin for white biology dna studies to better protect pallid sturgeon from extinction research on its dna and that of other closely related species was conducted to assess differences within various populations of pallid sturgeon and differences between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon early dna research indicated that pallid sturgeon and shovelnose sturgeon were a single species however a 2000 study comparing dna sequences in three members of genus scaphirhynchus pallid shovelnose and alabama sturgeon showed that three are distinct species between 2001 and 2006 several studies examined two populations of pallid sturgeon located in upper great plains section of missouri river and compared them to a southern population located in atchafalaya river in louisiana these dna studies concluded that northern populations of pallid sturgeon are reproductively isolated and are genetically distinct from atchafalaya population however genetic variability among pallid sturgeon was found to be far less than that between them and shovelnose sturgeon another reason for dna testing was to determine rates of hybridization between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon southern populations have more hybrids than are found in middle sections of missouri river basin while northernmost populations have had few reports of hybrids hybrids are most common in atchafalaya river in louisiana and dna sequencing in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeon but based on genetic markers assessed they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeon because of this ability of two species to hybridize some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of endangered species act to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another it is not known if hybrids are able to reproduce or not although they appear to be result of pallid sturgeon eggs being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males physical characteristics thumb right detail and measurement of head of a hatchery raised pallid sturgeon pallid sturgeon is one of largest freshwater fish species in north america they are generally between in length and weigh as much as species is ancient and has remained virtually unchanged for 70 million years since cretaceous period pallid sturgeon has a distinctive appearance that has been referred to as primitive dinosaur like and even ugly although visually similar shovelnose sturgeon is much smaller and usually weighs no more than pallid sturgeon are much paler in coloration with grayish white backs and sides while shovelnose sturgeon are brown pallid sturgeon turn whiter as they age and younger specimens are easily confused with adult shovelnose sturgeon since they are similar in color like shovelnose sturgeon their tails are heterocercal with top tail fin being longer than bottom fin though this is more pronounced in pallid sturgeon as with other sturgeon pallid sturgeon lack scales or bones found in more modern species of fish instead they have cartilaginous skeletons with five rows of thick cartilage plates that extend along their sides undersides and backs as well as over most of head these thick cartilage plates are covered by skin and serve as a protective armor bony cartilage also extends along backside from dorsal fin to tail pallid sturgeon s snout and head are longer than that of shovelnose sturgeon in both species mouth is located well back from tip of snout lacking teeth they use their extendable mouths to suck up small fish mollusks and other food sources from river bottoms both species also have four barbels which descend from snout near front of mouth barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources on pallid sturgeon two inner barbels are about half as long as outer ones while on shovelnose sturgeon all four barbels are same length inner barbels of pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of outer ones but those on shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line length and positioning of barbels is one of best ways to distinguish two species reproduction and lifecycle thumb right immature larva of a pallid sturgeon being raised in a fish hatchery pallid sturgeon have a long lifespan living in excess of 50 and perhaps as long as 100 years they lack bones and scales which makes it more difficult to establish their age and determine exactly how long they live as is true for many long lived species pallid sturgeon reach reproductive maturity relatively late males reach sexual maturity between ages of 5 and 7 years while females are believed to become capable of reproduction when they are at least 15 years old one study of nine females indicated that they begin egg development between ages of 9 and 12 years but do not reach reproductive maturity until they are 15 years old reproduction does not take place every year average interval between spawnings is three years although other studies suggest an interval as long as 10 years spawning usually takes place may to july prior to construction of dams on missouri pallid sturgeon migrated hundreds of miles upstream to spawn and sought out rocky or hard surfaces to deposit hundreds of thousands of eggs one female pallid sturgeon caught in upper missouri river was estimated to be carrying 170 000 eggs representing over 11 percent of its total body weight after fertilization pallid sturgeon eggs hatch in 5 to 8 days after which larvae drift back downstream for several weeks as larvae develop tails they seek out slower moving waterways and slowly mature over a period of a dozen years rate of survival to maturity for pallid sturgeon larvae is extremely low and of hundreds of thousands of eggs spawned only a few live to adulthood for several decades no natural reproduction of pallid sturgeon was observed since all fish that had been captured were older specimens in late 1990s young pallid sturgeon were discovered living in a restored riparian area of lower missouri river this was first documented example of wild spawned pallid sturgeon in 50 years in 2007 two female pallid sturgeon were also reported to have spawned in missouri national recreational river area located downstream from gavins point dam on missouri river ecology distribution pallid sturgeon s historical range spanned entire missouri river and into mississippi river historically species was rare to nonexistent in upper mississippi probably due to a lack of proper habitat currently species is considered imperiled throughout its entire range as of 2008 pallid sturgeon can still be found throughout their original range but their population numbers have severely declined from mid 20th century missouri and mississippi rivers from montana to louisiana as well as atchafalaya river in louisiana continue to harbor an aging population of pallid sturgeon pallid sturgeon have never been very common as early as 1905 when species was first identified they represented only one in five of all sturgeon in lower missouri river and as few as one in 500 where illinois river meets mississippi between 1985 and 2000 ratio of pallid sturgeon to all sturgeon netted declined from one in about 400 to one in nearly 650 a 1996 study concluded that between 6 000 and 21 000 pallid sturgeon remained in their natural habitat at that time thumb right pallid sturgeon scaphirhynchus albus showing siphoning feeding behaviour six areas were studied for wild pallid sturgeon population estimates and recovery recommendations by united states fish and wildlife service usfws between 1990 when species was declared endangered and 2006 usfws has referred to these six areas of wild population studies as recovery priority management areas rpmas in northernmost region of study known as rpma 1 located between marias river in montana and western reaches of fort peck reservoir only 45 wild nonhatchery individuals remain of these no juveniles were observed and population was declining in rpma 2 located between fort peck dam headwaters of lake and lower yellowstone river up to confluence of tongue river montana only 136 wild specimens remain in rpma 3 stretching from upstream of niobrara river to lewis and clark lake along missouri river no native populations were recorded all collected specimens appeared to be hatchery raised however these specimens were apparently maturing and adjusting well to this section of river recovery priority management area 4 extends from gavins point dam to confluence of missouri and mississippi rivers this region also includes platte river here at least 100 unique nonhatchery specimens were collected during study period evidence also indicates some wild reproduction is going on in this region in rpma 5 between confluence of missouri and mississippi and gulf of mexico several hundred specimens were documented again some evidence suggests natural reproduction is occurring as demonstrated by recovery of a few examples of immature nonhatchery raised individuals atchafalaya river basin is designated as rpma 6 and findings there were similar to those in rpmas 4 and 5 but with greater numbers of unique individuals near 500 in total habitat pallid sturgeon prefer moderate to swift river currents and most captured specimens have been recovered in rivers and streams in which current averages between they also prefer turbid waterways and water depths between species is more commonly found where sandy substrates are plentiful but also lives in predominately rocky waterways pallid sturgeon prefer swift river currents more often than do shovelnose sturgeon in a study based in montana and north dakota conducted on both pallid and shovelnose sturgeon both species were fitted with radio transmitters so researchers could track their swimming habits pallid sturgeon were found to prefer wider river channels sandbars and numerous islands and were most commonly recorded in water depths between study also showed that pallid sturgeon moved as much as per day and up to pallid sturgeon are believed to have preferred muddy and generally warmer waters that existed prior to missouri river dam construction food preferences pallid sturgeon are generally bottom feeders skimming sandy reaches of various rivers and streams in their habitat though little is known about precise eating habits of species they are thought to be opportunistic feeders one study which examined contents from stomachs of juvenile pallid sturgeon revealed that their diets were seasonally dependent various insects were consumed during some seasons and various fish species during others these results support description of pallid sturgeon s eating habits as opportunistic fish is a more important dietary staple for pallid sturgeon than it is for shovelnose sturgeon in one study comparing dietary tendencies between adult shovelnose sturgeon and immature pallid sturgeon pallid sturgeon was found to consume far greater numbers of small fish such as minnows in another study conducted in upper missouri river region an examination of stomach contents of hatchery reared pallid sturgeon showed that 82 of wet weight was small fish and balance was mosquito like insects mayflies and caddis flies and small amounts of detritus and plant material conservation right thumb usfws employees release a pallid sturgeon into yellowstone river though never believed to be common pallid sturgeon populations rapidly declined during late 20th century and species was listed as endangered on september 6 1990 u s government and most of states with pallid sturgeon populations have commenced restoration efforts to save species from extinction wild reproduction of pallid sturgeon is rare to nonexistent in most areas therefore human intervention is needed to ensure survival of species pallid sturgeon were previously considered a prized trophy game fish species until their numbers declined and they were placed on endangered species list all captured pallid sturgeon must now be released back to wild species was known for being very palatable and roe from females was used as caviar route and environmental characteristics of missouri river in northern great plains states of north and south dakota nebraska and montana have been significantly altered resultant changes to missouri river in upper great plains from channelization and impoundment prevent upstream migration reduced water flow rates and sediment loads have brought an end to seasonal flooding of flood plains in region since construction of fort peck dam in montana in 1937 and subsequent damming and channelization missouri river has lost over 90 of its wetland and sandbar ecosystems more than of missouri river have been altered and only that stretch of river above fort peck reservoir in montana remains relatively unchanged these alterations of river have had a detrimental impact on a number of native fish species in 13 u s states where pallid sturgeon is found only a few other fish species are listed as endangered although substantial efforts are being implemented to ensure survival of this species rarity of self sustaining populations of pallid sturgeon ensures that it will remain federally protected for many decades species preservation efforts two populations of pallid sturgeon in missouri and yellowstone rivers of montana are both at risk of extinction and current projections are that wild pallid sturgeon populations in montana will be extinct by 2018 though a vigorous stocking effort was implemented in 1996 until pallid sturgeon females reach reproductive maturity sometime after they are 15 years of age recovery efforts in montana will not be readily measurable u s bureau of reclamation has been conducting spring pulse water releases from tiber dam every four to five years to try to recreate a semblance of an annual spring flood to restore and rejuvenate downstream floodplains these pulse releases are done in an effort to restore suitable habitat for numerous fish species right thumb surgical implant of a radio transmitter in a sexually mature pallid sturgeon in nebraska a small number of pallid sturgeon have been captured along lower reaches of platte river unlike most rivers in mississippi missouri river system platte river has only a few dams and they are well upstream from its confluence with missouri river lower platte river is shallow with numerous sand bars and small islands though pallid sturgeon prefer more turbulent and deeper rivers than platte between 1979 and 2003 over a dozen pallid sturgeon including some from hatcheries have been captured from platte river a number of these pallid sturgeon have been fitted with radio transmitters which track their return to platte river when water levels and turbidity conditions are favorable coinciding with majority of pallid sturgeon that have been captured period that is generally most favorable is during spring and early summer by midsummer a reduction in water levels and turbidity on platte river encourages pallid sturgeon to return to missouri river lower reaches of platte river a more than stretch from elkhorn river to its confluence with missouri river has suitable spawning habitat for pallid sturgeon although no conclusive evidence has been found that spawning is occurring in this region along with lower yellowstone river lower platte river was identified as one of best of remaining regions with potential for natural spawning in missouri at lisbon bottoms section of big muddy national fish and wildlife refuge wild pallid sturgeon larvae were collected in 1998 these nonhatchery raised larvae were first recovered on lower missouri river in previous 50 years recovery was made along a side channel of missouri river that had been developed to provide suitable habitat for pallid sturgeon and other fish spawning side channel was apparently being used by larva pallid sturgeon for protection from swifter currents of missouri river in 2007 usfws concluded that hatchery based reproduction efforts should be continued along with monitoring of any population changes to determine effectiveness of human intervention 2007 findings also emphasized need to determine most likely areas of spawning to identify any parasite or disease that may be impacting reproductive capabilities of pallid sturgeon and to examine engineering possibilities that may permit recreation of suitable habitats without reducing usfws s ability to protect people from harmful and destructive flooding and to maintain its ability to provide adequate water impoundment for irrigation and recreation purposes references external links pallid sturgeon recovery plan file revised recovery plan for pallid sturgeon
