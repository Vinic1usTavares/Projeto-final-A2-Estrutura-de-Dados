with main clan macewen at all another instance is crest badge of clan macinnes this crest badge is based upon a modern coat of arms of an armigerous clan member not a clan chief according to english officers of arms john martin robinson and thomas woodcock crests have played a relatively insignificant role in scottish heraldry when compared to english heraldry in consequence many scottish armigers including clan chiefs have comparatively similar crests to one another because of this crest badges can sometimes show an obvious association with another clan for example clans associated with confederation share very similar crest badges bearing wild cats clans associated with clan mactavish clan campbell of breadalbane clan maciver and clan campbell use a crest badges which contain similar crests and mottoes that allude to that of chief of clan mactavish who is entitled to wear a crest badge a person does not need to be a member of a clan society to be able to wear a crest badge any clan member has a right to it not just clan societies and clan society members according to court of lord lyon clan membership goes with surname although today many people who do not bear a clan surname do wear crest badges of their mother s clan and anyone who offers their allegiance to a clan chief is a member of a clan unless chief decides to refuse that person s allegiance many people bear names that while not actual clan surnames are sept names or associated names of certain clans surnames such as smith wright fletcher and miller are examples as such names that are associated names of many clans as every clan would have its own smiths wrights fletchers and millers it is up to individual to explore their personal ancestry and discovery correct clan that they belong to
