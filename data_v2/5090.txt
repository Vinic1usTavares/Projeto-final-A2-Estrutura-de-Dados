and cubot to run away in fear development development for sonic lost world started shortly after sonic colors was finished when a few core members started experimentation for former and took place over two and a half years sonic team sought to streamline controls increase length and add more diverse levels compared to previous entries in series after reviewing history of franchise with sonic generations game producer takashi iizuka hoped to deliver a new experience with sonic lost world development started on pc with early experiments involving twisted tube type level s inspired by jack and beanstalk as concept was totally new early levels had to be remade over and over players were given greater ability to control sonic s speed in an effort to create a more traditional platforming experience parkour mechanic was introduced to maintain a more fluid sense of movement in contrast to previous sonic games where running into a wall would force player to a complete stop iizuka stated that this game is like going into rabbit hole in alice in wonderland an action game where you can experience many strange and fun experiences development ultimately focused on wii u and 3ds because of success of previous sonic games on nintendo platforms because wii u has two monitors to use sonic team decided to include both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes wii u gamepad s touch screen and gyroscope were employed to activate returning color powers 3ds version co developed with dimps was designed to fully utilize 3ds hardware with 3d gameplay and motion controls development was harder on 3ds due to its more limited processing power iizuka stated that color powers are essential to level design of 3ds version while they work as an additional tool in wii u version a simple art style was used to make objects stand out more against backgrounds and to keep game running at a consistent 60 frames per second design of new deadly six villains was based on that of an ogre and each one s appearance was intended to reflect a certain key characteristic of their personality which developers hoped players could see just by looking at them wii u version of game was directed by morio kishimoto director of sonic colors and lead designer of sonic and black knight while 3ds version was directed by takao hirabayashi director of sonic colors ds and previously lead designer of sonic unleashed ps2 wii sega trademarked title sonic lost world in may 2013 game was revealed on may 17 2013 in a nintendo direct announcement as part of an exclusive partnership between sega and

lost world received mixed or average reviews according to video game review aggregator metacritic during its opening week in uk sonic lost world charted at 11 on all formats chart for sales but achieved top spot on wii u chart and 4 on nintendo 3ds chart as of end of 2013 sega had shipped 640 000 copies of game as of march 31 2014 game had sold 710 000 copies game s presentation was well received chris plante polygon praised wii u version s visuals and music as arguably best in series tim turi game informer wrote that orchestrated tracks evoke mario galaxy in best ways mark walton gamespot and chris scullion computer and video games singled out candy themed dessert ruins level as a visual highlight however turi made note of ultra compressed cutscenes in 3ds version vince ingenito ign was favorable to pleasant art direction and stable framerate but criticized subdued color palette roger hargreaves metro stated that imaginative designs and spectacular set piece s kept him interested to know what comes next chris schilling eurogamer was effusive blue skies forever strong criticism was directed at game s control scheme especially new parkour mechanic turi never got a good feel for rhythm of wall running and jumping and felt lucky to pass sections where it was forced hargreaves walton and matthew castle official nintendo magazine agreed ingenito found it problematic that sonic tends to wall run on every nearby vertical surface schilling singled out multi lock homing attack writing that while it usually worked perfectly well it appeared to inexplicably fail on occasion ingenito turi and hargreaves agreed castle struggled with homing attack locking on too late or attacking enemies in awkward sequence however justin towell gamesradar defended control scheme explaining that while it had a learning curve it also modernize s environmental traversal and provide s a distinct safety net towell argued that sonic was mainly hard to control in 2d because there are so many rules for how sonic reacts contextually to his environment famitsu stated that ability to slow down made game easier to play for beginners however turi criticized sonic s odd sense of momentum and imprecise jumps stating that switching between two speeds is jarring and produces touchy platforming schilling excoriated profoundly frustrating controls as worst in series explaining that sonic s too sluggish while walking and too skittish to cope with trickier platforming bits when running ingenito agreed i ve played a lot of sonic over years and controls have never felt as alien and inconsistent as they do here several critics felt that sonic controlled better on 3ds jose otero ign said parkour felt great and turned most obstructions into minor hurdles in this version joe skrebels official nintendo magazine felt that sonic controls far better at top speed on 3ds stephen totilo kotaku stated that 3ds version does a better job of teaching controls although turi derided its constant lengthy tutorial text however schilling called homing attack even more capricious on 3ds reaction to game s level design was mixed turi made note of oddly placed invisible springs in wii u version s confusing and aggravating levels and expressed frustration with 3ds version s head scratching puzzles walton preferred inoffensive 2d sections to frustrating mishmash of speed and exploration found in 3d plante praised wii u version s 3d stages as wildly creative exercises in platforming experimentation while decrying its 2d stages as so clunky and tiresome that it s hard to imagine a time when a side scrolling sonic was actually good philip kollar polygon was harsher on 3ds version due to its confusing and labyrinthine level design and awkward puzzles ingenito stated that wii u version s levels were stuck in design gridlock and lack ed rhythm and cohesion otero praised 3ds version s better levels as competently made race tracks full of alternate pathways but called trial and error required to complete slower paced 3d stages incredibly frustrating castle stated that wii u version s best stages play to strengths of sonic s tiered speed while skrebels felt 3ds version featured levels well suited for handheld play totilo praised intuitive flowing player friendly levels of 3ds version but panned badly explained choppy punitive levels of wii u version schilling wrote that i came perilously close to biting my gamepad at one particularly sharp difficulty spike edge noted that sonic games and platformers in general have always been about memorizing lay of land but rarely have mistakes been so costly or heavily punished alternate gameplay styles polarized many critics daniel cairns videogamer com and castle highlighted level where sonic becomes a giant snowball as genuinely excellent and a cool riff on monkey ball whereas turi and ingenito described it as atrocious e and exact opposite of fun turi received multiple game overs during a mundane mandatory pinball sequence walton felt that some of wisps were an amusing aside but problematic motion controls and short time limits impaired their utility justin speer gametrailers stated that wisps felt out of place in wii u version totilo preferred how wisps were implemented in 3ds version but towell stated that while they were more integral to design they tended to interrupt free form gameplay with clumsy mechanic s towell described 3ds version s motion controlled special stages as borderline unplayable totilo and castle criticized wii u version s jetpack joyride style flying levels as regrettable and horribly imprecise turi and totilo criticized wii u version s balloon popping minigame as mind numbing and awkward turi called wii u version s co op mode useless castle wrote that two player races would be a cool addition were it not for horrible framerate issues deadly six were negatively received although towell enjoyed their fun stereotypical personalities he was disappointed by their awful dialogue speer called boss battles weirdly anticlimactic and ingenito stated they were some of most boring in series history turi referred to deadly six as generic forgettable and some of most aggressively annoying villains ever egm now observed that deadly six s presence does subvert worn out sonic versus dr eggman concept adding i can t figure out if plot is brilliantly aware self parody or whether it was scrawled together by a couple of grade schoolers on a tokyo playground both options seem equally probable frankly critics disagreed over what to make of game as a whole in 2015 usgamer referred to lost world as perhaps sonic s best outing in years jim sterling destructoid said it can wildly swing from brilliant to horrific at drop of a hat but when one steps back and takes a look at whole production one sees far more to love than hate plante noted that early stages display a degree of design ingenuity and polish which gradually degrades david mccomb empire called it a cheap cruel crushing disappointment in wake of sonic colors and generations walton concluded that in overtly great italian plumber it smothers talents of its blazing blue hedgehog notes
