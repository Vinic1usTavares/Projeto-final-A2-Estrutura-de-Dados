ceasefire and established a demarcation line running through disputed suwalki region up to bastuny railway station line was incomplete and did not provide adequate protection to vilnius neither

1920 in front of building of conference at time of negotiations military situation on ground was threatening lithuania not only in suwalki region but also in vilnius polish leader jozef pilsudski

possible reaction of league in case military units in kresy decided to attack vilnius following example of italian gabriele d annunzio who in 1919 staged a mutiny and took over city of fiume by agreeing to negotiations poles sought to buy time and distract attention from vilnius region lithuanians hoped to avoid new polish attacks and with help of league to settle disputes conference began in evening of september 29 1920 polish delegation was led by colonel mieczyslaw mackiewicz who originated from lithuania and lithuanian delegation by general lithuania proposed an immediate armistice but polish delegation refused only after lithuanian delegation threatened to leave negotiation table did poland agree to stop fighting but only to west of neman river suwalki region fighting to east of river continued polish delegates demanded that lithuanians allow polish forces to use a portion of warsaw saint petersburg railway and train station in varena orany lithuanians refused their major forces were concentrated in suwalki region and moving them to protect vilnius without railway would be extremely difficult lithuanian side was ready to give up suwalki region in exchange for poland s recognition of lithuanian claims to vilnius thumb right polish left and lithuanian right delegates at negotiation table during suwalki conference lithuanian delegation after consultations in kaunas on october 2 proposed their demarcation line on october 3 line would be withdrawn about from border determined by soviet lithuanian peace treaty on october 4 polish delegation after consultations with pilsudski presented a counter offer in essence lithuanians wanted a longer demarcation line to provide better protection for vilnius and poles pushed for a shorter line while vilnius was not a topic of debate it was on everybody s mind on same day control commission sent by league according to its resolution of september 20 arrived in suwalki to mediate talks commission led by french colonel pierre included representatives from italy great britain spain and japan on october 5 1920 control commission presented a concrete proposal to draw demarcation line up to village of on neman river

bastuny claiming that polish army needed freedom to maneuver against soviet troops even though a provisional ceasefire agreement had been reached with soviet russia on october 5 poles proposed to discuss further demarcation lines in riga where poland and russia negotiated peace of riga on same day fighting east of neman river ceased as polish troops captured varena train station on october 7 at midnight final suwalki agreement was signed on october 8 control commission stated that they could not see why demarcation line could not be extended further than bastuny and urged another round of

finally signed on october 7 1920 ceasefire was to begin at noon on october 10 notably treaty made not a single reference to vilnius or vilnius region agreement contained following articles article i on demarcation line besides setting it out it also stated that line in no way prejudices territorial claims of two contracting parties demarcation line would start in west following curzon line until it reached neman river it would follow neman and rivers leaving town of varena to lithuanians but its train station on polish side from varena line would follow bastuny train station in bastuny also remained in polish hands demarcation line east of bastuny was to be determined by a separate agreement article ii on ceasefire notably ceasefire was to take place only along demarcation line not on entire polish lithuanian frontline i e not east of bastuny article iii on train station in varena orany it was to remain under polish control but polish side promised unrestricted passage of civilian trains but only two military trains per day article iv on prisoner exchange article v on date and time ceasefire would start october 10 at noon and expire when all territorial disputes are resolved and which map was to be used aftermath demarcation line drawn through suwalki region for most part remains border between poland and lithuania in modern times notably towns of sejny suwalki and augustow remained on polish side in 21st century suwalki region present day podlaskie voivodeship remains home to lithuanian minority in poland most controversial issue future of city of vilnius was not explicitly addressed when agreement was signed vilnius was garrisoned by lithuanian troops and behind lithuanian lines yet this changed almost immediately when staged zeligowski s mutiny began on october 8 soon after mutiny leon bourgeois president of council of league of nations expressed strong disapproval asserting that zeligowski s actions were a violation of engagements entered into with council of league of nations and demanding immediate polish evacuation of city in pilsudski s view signing even such a limited agreement was not in poland s best interests and he disapproved of it in a 1923 speech acknowledging that he had directed zeligowski s coup pilsudski stated i tore up suwalki treaty and afterwards i issued a false communique by general staff zeligowski and his mutineers captured vilnius established republic of central lithuania and after a disputed election in 1922 incorporated republic into poland conflict over city dragged on until world war ii in 21st century vilnius region is major center of polish minority in lithuania evaluations and historiography while lithuanian side considered agreement to be an enforceable political treaty polish side considered it to be a minor military agreement later superseded by a ceasefire agreement between lithuania and zeligowski reached on november 29 american historian alfred erich senn has argued that it was not a regular political treaty as it did not require ratification but presence of political representatives of both sides indicated that it was not a mere military agreement poland and lithuania also disagreed about agreement s relation to vilnius question which was not explicitly addressed in treaty lithuanian side considered that agreement assigned vilnius to lithuania while polish side argued that it did not concern vilnius or other territorial claims senn has described agreement as tacitly leaving vilnius to lithuania finally lithuanian side considered zeligowski s attack on vilnius a violation of suwalki agreement and as a major argument in international mediation poland disagreed and protested such interpretation of document at first poland claimed that zeligowski was a rebel who acted without approval from polish government later pilsudski s role in attack was acknowledged but polish side argued that agreement was not violated as attack was held to east from demarcation line league of nations considered polish attack a violation of agreement but placed emphasis on resumption of hostilities and not subsequent territorial changes senn said view that agreement has not been violated was specious in his opinion pilsudski himself did not seem to share that view as evidenced by his attempt to pretend that attacking forces were rebels in most cases historians tend to summarise issue by saying that agreement assigned vilnius to lithuania and polish attack violated it however piotr lossowski argued that such summaries are inadequate and misleading see also
