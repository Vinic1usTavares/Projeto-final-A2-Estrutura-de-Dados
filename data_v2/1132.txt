township catawissa township cleveland township and franklin township in columbia county and mayberry township in montour county watershed of creek has an area of it has three named tributaries south branch roaring creek lick run and mill creek creek is not considered to be impaired and is not affected by coal mining however its watershed has been impacted by human land use claystones conglomerates sandstones siltstones and shales all occur within watershed creek flows through a gorge in its lower reaches along border between columbia county and montour county most of watershed of roaring creek is in columbia county but small areas are in montour county northumberland county and schuylkill county more than 40 percent of watershed is forested and nearly 40 percent is agricultural land state game lands and state forests are also in watershed a total of approximately 3 500 people inhabit watershed as of 2000 creek s drainage basin is a high quality coldwater fishery and a migratory fishery upstream of lick run downstream of lick run main stem is a trout stocked fishery and migratory fishery a reach of creek above lick run is designated as class a wild trout waters 31 species of fish were observed at 20 sites in watershed in 2003 and 2004 roaring creek was historically known as popemetang but it was known as roaring creek by late 1700s settlers such as quakers first arrived in area in 1770s in 19th century various mills and furnaces were constructed on creek and several bridges were constructed agriculture was also a major industry in watershed in early 20th century more bridges were constructed across creek in 20th century roaring creek valley conservation association formed in february 2006 part of creek is navigable by canoe course thumb left roaring creek in springtime roaring creek begins on catawissa mountain in roaring creek township columbia county it flows west southwest for a short distance before turning south for a few tenths of a mile it then turns west for a few miles and flows off catawissa mountain before eventually crossing state route 2003 passing mill grove and entering locust township creek turns north northwest for a few tenths of a mile and reenters roaring creek township before turning west and reentering locust township it then flows west northwest for more than a mile and receives mill creek its first named tributary from right as well as receiving tributary lick run from left creek then turns northwest for more than a mile and enters slabtown before turning west for several tenths of a mile and crossing pennsylvania route 42 after this it turns northwest for several tenths of a mile before meandering west southwest for a few miles passing queen city parrs mill and a lake known as lake glory in this stretch creek leaves locust township and crosses border between catawissa township and cleveland township three or four times before entering franklin township near s mill creek then meanders northwest for a few miles crossing pennsylvania route 487 and receiving south branch roaring creek its least named tributary from left upon reaching montour county line creek turns north for a few miles flowing along border between franklin township columbia county and mayberry township montour county in this reach it passes through a gorge with sharp ridge on west after a few miles creek leaves gorge and crosses state route 3012 a few tenths of a mile further downstream it reaches its confluence with susquehanna river roaring creek joins susquehanna river upriver of its mouth tributaries roaring creek has three named tributaries south branch roaring creek lick run and mill creek south branch roaring creek joins roaring creek upstream of its mouth its watershed has an area of lick run joins roaring creek upstream of its mouth its watershed has an area of mill creek joins roaring creek upstream of its mouth its watershed has an area of hydrology concentration of alkalinity in roaring creek upstream of lick run is 9 milligrams per liter many nearby watersheds have been rendered nearly devoid of aquatic life due to acid mine drainage caused by coal mining however roaring creek has not been affected by this although it has been still impacted by human land use sedimentation siltation and agricultural impacts occur in watershed only impaired stream in watershed is a small unnamed tributary that is impaired by siltation from a chemical standpoint roaring creek is infertile specific conductance of creek ranges from 11 micro siemens per centimeter at site 2 to 127 micro siemens per centimeter at site 4 in 2003 and 2004 ph of creek ranged from 7 0 to 7 2 in a later survey it was found to be acidic at sites 1 and 2 6 50 and 6 89 respectively but alkaline at sites 3 and 4 7 34 and 8 27 respectively concentration of alkalinity in creek ranges from 5 1 milligrams per liter at site 1 to 32 milligrams per liter at site 2 concentration of water

it flows through a narrow gorge for its last creek s channel is sinuous there are and rocky rapids on some reaches of creek in gorge creek flows past cliffs and over ledges and waterfalls a set of wet limestone ledges known as roaring creek bluffs are located along creek in franklin township and montour county power lines also cross creek in this reach some strainers occur on creek upstream of state route 3012 a ridge known as sharp ridge is located near creek roaring creek is located in ridge and valley physiographic province a dividing ridge separates creek from susquehanna river one reach of creek is a mid sized coldwater stream another reach is a large freestone stream roaring creek flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale rocks in watershed include claystones conglomerates sandstones siltstones and shales from devonian and mississippian outcroppings of calcareous beds limestones and marine fossils occur in watershed as well some mineable coal is present in watershed of south branch roaring creek genesee beds appear along creek and are lowest beds that are visible above water line to east they are covered by chemung beds a soil known as series

of columbia county montour county northumberland county and schuylkill county most of watershed is in columbia county and smaller areas are in montour county and northumberland county only a very small area in its upper reaches is in schuylkill county watershed is in lower north branch susquehanna drainage basin creek s mouth is in united states geological survey quadrangle of danville however its source is in quadrangle of creek also passes through quadrangle of catawissa other quadrangles that watershed is in include shamokin ashland and mount carmel creek flows in a generally northwesterly direction and serves as border between montour county and columbia county in its last roaring creek is one of three major streams draining southern part of columbia county more than 40 percent of watershed of roaring creek is on forested land including evergreen and deciduous forests as well as mixed forests a significant portion of forested land in watershed is a tract of land along south branch roaring creek this tract was acquired by pennsylvania department of conservation and natural resources in 2003 a large tract of forested land on a ridge running from moosic to susquehanna river passes through watershed of roaring creek state forest land occurs along southern edge of watershed and pennsylvania state game lands pennsylvania state game lands number 58 occur along eastern edge nearly 40 percent of watershed is on agricultural land this land use occurs in creek s valley as does open space upstream of lick run 13 percent of roaring creek is on public land

in october and november 2007 scores ranged from 15 5 out of 28 55 percent lowest value in entire watershed to 23 out of 28 82 percent history and etymology roaring creek was entered into geographic names information system on august 2 1979 its identifier in geographic names information system is roaring creek was known to lenni lenape as popemetang which means roaring creek in english this name likely originates from waterfalls and rapids on creek s lower reaches creek was known as popemetang until late 1700s however several maps were referring to it as roaring creek as early as 1792 its name appears as roaring creek in even earliest survey warrants in area centre turnpike was constructed in 1770 and provided access to valley of roaring creek roughly following current course of pennsylvania route 487 and pennsylvania route 54 reading road was later constructed in watershed and ran in a southeasterly direction quakers were living in valley of creek by 1770s and land on creek was patented to samuel shakespeare in 1773 a number of settlers arrived in valley from philadelphia area via reading road soon after end of american revolutionary war farms were appearing along creek s banks second oldest mill in what is now columbia county was built in a gorge on roaring creek near its mouth in 1780s this mill was known as cleaver mill a second mill which was similar to first was later constructed at site john constructed a furnace on creek in 1816 it was first furnace in area first iron furnace in montour county was built near creek s mouth in 1839 or 1840 furnace was known as roaring creek anthracite water power furnace it was altered in 1854 in 1856 furnace produced 2350 tons of iron from ore on montour ridge despite low water only post office in mayberry township up to 1915 was built at mouth of creek in 1895 it was known as after w b howell its first postmaster in early 1900s major industries in watershed of roaring creek included agriculture however creek was also used as water power for a small gristmill during this time period major communities in watershed included roaring creek and bear gap their populations were 407 and 124 respectively in early 1900s only major industries in franklin township were gristmills on creek on border between it and cleveland township there were historically proposals to use creek as a water supply for danville transferring water via pipes under susquehanna river andrew once constructed a hotel on creek many bridges have been constructed across roaring creek and a number of covered bridges can be seen from creek first bridge over creek was constructed in 1874 at slabtown for a cost of 1500 it was replaced in 1913 for a cost of 5500 davis covered bridge was built northwest of slabtown in 1875 and

creek at 37 locations using united states environmental protection agency s rapid assessment protocol in 2004 robert carried out fisheries surveys on every named stream in watershed roaring creek valley conservation association formed in february 2006 to conserve natural and cultural resources of roaring creek watershed biology upstream of tributary lick run drainage basin of roaring creek is designated as a high quality coldwater fishery and a migratory fishery from lick run downstream to its mouth main stem of creek is a trout stocking fishery and a migratory fishery wild trout naturally reproduce in creek from its headwaters downstream to upstream of its mouth a distance of they also naturally reproduce throughout entire length of every other named tributary of creek roaring creek is considered by pennsylvania fish and boat commission to be class a wild trout waters for brown trout from its headwaters downstream to lick run a distance of in 2003 and 2004 31 fish species were found at 20 sites in watershed of roaring creek eastern blacknose dace are most common fish species in watershed and were observed at 85 percent of sites white suckers and brown trout occurred at 80 percent of sites longnose dace occurred at 70 percent of sites minnows occurred at 65 percent of sites and bluegills occurred at 60 percent of sites fallfish golden shiners yellow bullheads and american eels were all historically observed in watershed but were not found during survey however redside dace creek green sunfish and fathead minnows were observed in watershed for first time during 2003 2004 survey most common game species was wild brown trout although smaller numbers of brook trout were observed as well other game fish in creek s drainage basin include rainbow trout smallmouth bass largemouth bass and chain pickerel biomass of wild brown trout in section 02 of roaring creek was estimated in early 2000s to be 9 53 kilograms per hectare there were an estimated 42 brown trout of legal size per kilometer of stream this equates to an estimated 815 brown trout between in length in that section trout in section 02 of creek are up to approximately in length and some brown trout in creek can reach lengths of up to waterfowl have been known to inhabit watershed of roaring creek various macroinvertebrate taxa inhabit roaring creek at one site there is one abundant macroinvertebrate taxon with 25 to 100 individuals being observed at this site there are five common taxa and five present taxa with 10 to 25 and 3 to 9 individuals being observed respectively eleven taxa are rare with fewer than three individuals being observed at another site there are two abundant taxa three common taxa four present taxa and eight rare taxa at a third site on creek there are three abundant taxa four common taxa three present taxa and seven rare taxa hardwood trees and hemlocks occur on slopes of valley of roaring creek hemlocks also occur in creek s gorge canopy coverage at four sites on creek ranges from 0 percent to 75 percent algal biomass of creek ranges from 0 01 to 1 21 in terms of chlorophyll a per square centimeter roaring creek bluffs are listed on columbia county natural areas inventory jeweled shooting star which is threatened in pennsylvania occurs at this site other plant species in this area include hydrangea fragile fern maidenhair golden saxifrage however several weedy plants also grow in area recreation it is possible to canoe on of roaring creek from slabtown to mouth during fast snowmelt or within three days of heavy rain difficulty rating of creek ranges from 1 to 2 edward gertler s book keystone canoeing describes scenery as being fair to good book describes creek itself as being a small and easy to overlook wet weather stream there are two painted canoe gauges on creek one at pennsylvania route 42 and other at pennsylvania route 487 roaring creek is one of major fishing area in columbia county amusement park is in western part
