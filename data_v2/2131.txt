bending twist and periodic bursts of light in conclusion moultrie praised concert and its high energy songs sexy dance moves flawless vocals and a top flight light show bill white of seattle post intelligencer wrote that due to ciara s high energy it hardly mattered that she was singing to backing tracks regarding pre recorded vocals he said usually this type of performance seems cut rate and dishonest but ciara with help of slick lighting and sharp choreography made it work white concluded it may have been a 45 minute infomercial for her second release evolution but ciara s explosive display of crunk was a in its own right sia michel of new york times wrote a positive review stating ciara led a squad of hip hop dancers through stylishly choreographed routines striding about in a headset she was a commanding and relentlessly professional presence vincent jackson of press of atlantic city wrote that ciara exhibited a great deal of self confidence during course of night jackson

critical writing that pop concerts require strong personalities and at 21 ciara hasn t quite perfected hers yet gamboa called show as slick as an ice patch and often just as cool but noted that sometimes she got dwarfed by her surroundings of eight dancers and recorded backing vocals he praised up tempo songs and promise but criticized ballad i m just me for nearly halt ing set he ended on a more positive note writing that ciara shows that she is well on her way to becoming a superstar herself jon gilbertson of milwaukee journal sentinel was largely critical of show and criticized singer
