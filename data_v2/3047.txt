he was secretary of hockey club he moved to right back and won a second blue for 1934 35 season seamer was captain of hockey at oxford university match in february 1935 in which seamer again played at right back was a goal less draw in which defences proved too strong for forwards on either side seamer s reappearance in oxford for his arabic course after graduation meant that he was available for university hockey team in 1935 36 season as well 1936 university match due to be played at beckenham on 15 february had to be postponed because of dense fog on day match was played a week later on a pitch that was according to report in times pretty much waterlogged and seamer and his fellow back leeming were credited with enabling oxford to emerge with a 1 1 draw seamer set up attack that led to oxford goal and overall oxford owed much to their backs j w seamer and j a leeming whose defence although becoming a trifle wild in second half was saving of side county cricket on completion of his extra year learning arabic at oxford seamer joined sudan political service he continued to play cricket for somerset during his periods of leave but it dramatically reduced his availability for county during his time at oxford seamer had become good friends with mitchell innes pair both attended same college and played together for both university and somerset foot 1986 p 128 when mitchell innes graduated from oxford year after seamer he joined his friend in sudan where pair often organised cricket matches despite extreme heat seamer s duties prevented him from playing for somerset at all during 1937 but he appeared eight times following year through may and early june his average that season was highest he achieved after leaving university recording 20 78 from his 14 innings though his highest score was 47 runs scored against derbyshire in 1939 last season of first class county cricket in england before second world war seamer played seven times for somerset however unlike his appearances previous year in which he had generally batted as part of top order seamer predominantly appeared in middle order for county in 1939 and his highest score was 28 after conclusion of war county cricket resumed in 1946 during which year seamer played two matches with little success he did not appear in first class cricket in 1947 but was named as one of three captains of somerset in 1948 jack meyer had reluctantly captained side in 1947 but stepped down at end of season he was having problems with his sight and required daily painkillers for lumbago roebuck 1991 p 232 there was no obvious replacement for meyer like many counties somerset would not consider having a professional captain and finding an amateur with time and money to lead side was proving troublesome so with no single candidate suitable somerset committee announced that club would be captained first by mitchell innes during his leave from sudan then seamer during his own leave once both of these had returned to their duties george woodhouse would take over roebuck 1991 p 242 in his history of somerset county cricket club peter roebuck describes situation as a remarkable state of affairs while david foot suggests that true number of captains was closer to seven foot 1986 p 155 during his time as captain seamer carried an old train board saying to tonbridge in his cricket bag claiming that it brought good luck to team in eleven matches that somerset played under his captaincy though only one resulted in a victory roebuck 1991 p 243 seamer claimed that some of his best friends at club were among professionals who he praised for their team spirit despite strained leadership changes his friendship with professionals was in contrast to attitudes of both club s committee and its captain for previous season meyer had been unpopular with professionals due to his attitude to game and manner in which he utilised them roebuck 1991 p 235 while club s committee felt that professional players deserved little recognition when successful claiming that this was what they were paid for seamer s batting was no longer strong enough to support his inclusion in team and he played low in middle order he failed to reach double figures in any of his first seven innings that season but recorded a half century against kent in his final match for somerset his first since 1936 in first class cricket seamer did not appear again for somerset after his period as captain in 1948 in total for county he scored 1 405 runs at an average of 15 61 he made his final first class appearance following season appearing for free foresters against oxford university he later made three minor counties championship appearances for wiltshire in 1956 though without much success later life seamer married dorothy lee and had two children katherine judith and mary by 1948 seamer had risen to be district commissioner for khartoum north when he left sudan political service in 1950 he returned to england and took up a teaching position at his old school marlborough college in addition to teaching latin english and history he became a before his retirement in 1973 he served as mayor of marlborough twice and as a justice of peace and was awarded freedom of city in 2001 he died following an illness on 16 april 2006 aged 92 personality and style a personable man seamer was a popular captain of somerset he had some quirks to his personality and roebuck goes as far as describing him as an eccentric during his childhood he would often cycle from his home in shapwick to taunton a distance of over 15 miles to watch somerset play cricket when he began playing for county prior to starting at oxford university a number of his childhood heroes were still in side in one match seamer had been dismissed and passed one of these heroes jack white coming to wicket white asked what kind of bowler jim cornford was as he had not seen him play before seamer unsure bluffed and stated that he bowled outswingers shortly afterwards white returned to dressing room irate and declared fellow bowls bloody inswingers bespectacled seamer dressed smartly and was proud of his somerset heritage often putting on a broad accent when he was in london unlike most amateurs of time seamer prioritised defensive play when batting he watched ball and minimised risks valuing his own wicket this careful style was exemplified by his innings in university match of 1934 when he helped oxford salvage a draw by batting for two hours with tail during which time he scored 24 runs despite his circumspect batting technique seamer enjoyed his cricket and in a more relaxed setting he once scored a century before lunch playing in sudan match started at seven in morning to avoid worst of heat before their opponent s innings seamer and his team mates got them drunk to improve their chances of a win references bibliography category 1913 births category 2006 deaths category alumni of brasenose college
