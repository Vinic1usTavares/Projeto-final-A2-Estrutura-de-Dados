17th airborne division was an airborne infantry division of united states army during world war ii commanded by major general william m miley it was officially activated as an airborne division in april 1943 but was not immediately sent to a combat theater remaining in united states to complete its training during this training process division took part in several training exercises including knollwood maneuver in which it played a vital part in ensuring that airborne division remained as a military formation in u s army as such it did not take part in first two large scale airborne operations conducted by allies operation husky and operation neptune transferring to britain only after end of operation overlord when division arrived in britain it came under command of maj gen matthew b ridgway s xviii airborne corps a part of maj gen lewis h brereton s first allied airborne army but was not chosen to participate in operation market garden airborne landings in netherlands as allied planners believed it had arrived too late and could not be trained up in time for operation however after end of operation market garden division was shipped to france and then belgium to fight in ardennes during battle of bulge 17th gained its first medal of honor during its time fighting in ardennes and was then withdrawn to luxembourg to prepare for an assault over river rhine in march 1945 division participated in its first and only airborne operation dropping alongside british 6th airborne division as a part of operation varsity where it gained three more medals of honor division then advanced through northern germany until end of world war ii when it briefly undertook occupation duties in germany before shipping back to united states there it was officially inactivated in september 1945 although it was briefly reactivated as a training division between 1948 and 1949 formation german armed forces pioneered use of large scale airborne formations first during invasion of norway and denmark and later that year during assaults on netherlands and belgium in 1940 and later in battle of crete in 1941 flanagan p 6 allied governments were aware of success of these operations but not of heavy german casualties incurred particularly during assault on netherlands and invasion of crete and decided to form their own airborne formations harclerode p 197 this decision would eventually lead to creation of five american and two british airborne divisions as well as many smaller units harclerode p 107 flanagan p 31 17th airborne division was activated on 15 april 1943 at camp mackall in north carolina under command of newly promoted major general william miley division was originally composed of 513th parachute infantry regiment activated on 11 january 1943 at fort benning 193rd glider infantry regiment and 194th glider infantry regiment devlin p 200 official dedication ceremony for unit took place on 1 may 1943 with thousands of civilian and military spectators including major general eldridge g chapman overall commander of airborne command and of all american airborne forces during world war ii devlin p 201 thumb right william miley seen here as a brigadier general commanded 17th airborne division for entirety of its activation once activated division remained in united states for training and exercises as division like all airborne units was intended to be an elite formation training regime was extremely arduous flanagan p 15 there were and towers built from which prospective airborne troops would jump off of to simulate landing by parachute lengthy forced marches and practice jumps from transport aircraft to pause in doorway of an aircraft during a practice jump resulted in an automatic failure for candidate resultant failure rate was accordingly high but there was never a shortage of candidates especially for american divisions as rate of pay was much higher than that of an ordinary infantryman as division trained a debate developed in u s army over whether best use of airborne forces was en masse or as small compact units on 9 july 1943 first large scale allied airborne operation allied invasion of sicily operation husky was carried out by elements of u s 82nd airborne division and british 1st airborne division devlin p 204 commanding general cg of u s 11th airborne division major general joseph may swing had been temporarily assigned to act as airborne advisor to general dwight d eisenhower supreme allied commander in mediterranean for invasion of sicily and had observed airborne assault which went badly u s 82nd airborne division had been deployed by both parachute and glider and had suffered high casualties leading to a perception that it had failed to achieve many of its objectives devlin p 246 swing board general eisenhower had reviewed airborne role in operation husky and had concluded that large scale formations were too difficult to control in combat to be practical flanagan p 98 lieutenant general lesley j mcnair commander of army ground forces had similar misgivings once an airborne supporter he had been greatly disappointed by their performance in north africa and more recently sicily however other high ranking officers believed otherwise notably u s army chief of staff george marshall he persuaded eisenhower to set up a review board and to withhold judgement on effectiveness of divisional sized airborne forces until a large scale maneuver could be tried in december flanagan p 99 when swing returned to united states to resume command of 11th airborne division in mid september 1943 he had an additional role devlin pp 212 246 mcnair ordered him to form a committee swing board composed of u s army air forces parachute and glider infantry and artillery officers to arrange a large scale maneuver that would effectively decide fate of divisional sized airborne force as 11th airborne division was in reserve in united states and had not yet been earmarked for overseas shipment swing board chose it as test formation it would be opposed by a composite combat team from 17th airborne division with a battalion from 541st parachute infantry regiment temporarily attached flanagan p 100 maneuver would also provide both divisions with further airborne training as had occurred several months previously in a large scale maneuver undertaken by 82nd and 101st airborne divisions huston p 98 knollwood maneuver objective for 11th as attacking force was to capture knollwood army auxiliary airfield near fort bragg in north carolina after which maneuver was named defending forces were to try to defend airport and surrounding area and repel airborne assault flanagan p 100 entire operation would be observed by lieutenant general mcnair his observations and reports to u s war department and ultimately general eisenhower would do much to decide success or failure of exercise devlin p 247 knollwood maneuver took place on night of 7 december with troops of 11th airborne division being delivered to thirteen separate objectives by 200 c 47 dakota transport aircraft and 234 waco cg 4a gliders with eighty five percent of airborne troops being delivered to their target without navigational error huston p 136 transport aircraft were divided into four groups each taking off from a different airfield in carolinas with two groups dropping paratroopers and two towing gliders and between them deployed 4 800 airborne troops in first wave these airborne troops then seized knollwood army auxiliary airfield from defending troops and secured area in which rest of division landed all before daylight having secured their initial objectives 11th airborne division then conducted a coordinated ground attack against a reinforced infantry regiment as well as several aerial resupply and casualty evacuation missions in coordination with transport aircraft exercise was judged to be a great success by those who observed it mcnair reported that success of maneuver pleased him and highlighted great improvements in airborne training that had occurred in months between end of operation husky and knollwood maneuver huston p 137 due to success of units of 11th airborne division during exercise divisional sized airborne force was deemed to be effective and was allowed by eisenhower to remain world war ii division also participated in second army maneuvers in tennessee maneuver area from 6 february 1944 stanton p 96 it finished its training on 27 march 1944 hagerman p 15 and transferred to camp forrest on 24 march 1944 division staged at camp myles standish on 12 august 1944 before departing boston port of embarkation on 20 august 1944 17th airborne division arrived in united kingdom on 26 august hagerman p 29 once in britain division was attached to u s xviii airborne corps under major general matthew ridgway which commanded all american airborne formations and which in turn became part of first allied airborne army when it was formed on 21 august under command of lieutenant general lewis h brereton flanagan p 204 although attached to xviii airborne corps division was not chosen to participate in operation market garden a large scale airborne operation intended to seize several bridges through netherlands to allow allied armies to bypass rhine river and enter germany 17th was passed over in favour of 82nd and 101st airborne divisions because it had only recently arrived in european theater and was considered to be unprepared logistically as it was still collecting its combat equipment flanagan p 245 division now with colonel edson raff s 507th parachute infantry regiment under command a veteran unit which had fought in normandy under command of 82nd airborne division remained in england as a theater reserve during market garden and its aftermath as allied armies continued their advance towards germany battle of bulge on 16 december 1944 wehrmacht launched an offensive in ardennes region of belgium breaking through allied lines and rapidly advancing towards antwerp flanagan p 265 on afternoon of 17 december general eisenhower supreme allied commander decided to commit his theater reserve to ardennes in an attempt to halt german advance this consisted of 17th 82nd and 101st airborne divisions under control of xviii airborne corps three divisions were to be attached to courtney hodges s u s first army and were ordered to concentrate around town of st vith flanagan p 268 however while other two airborne divisions were able to immediately make their way to ardennes as they were already stationed in france bad weather prevented 17th from flying in from where division was stationed in britain for several days on 23 december weather cleared and division was finally flown to france by emergency night flights it moved to an assembly area near rheims on christmas day division was attached to george patton s u s third army and ordered to assume a thirty mile long defensive position that ran along meuse river near charleville flanagan p 281 by 1 january 1945 threat to charleville had eased sufficiently for division to be transferred to another area of ardennes being transported to an area south west of bastogne near village of on 3 january there it relieved 11th armored division which had occupied village prior to its arrival devlin p 546 on 4 january division entered combat for first time when it was ordered alongside 87th infantry division to seize a number of key towns to west of bastogne in order to prevent german forces from encircling town a second time it had been relieved by third army on 26 december with 87th infantry division on its left flank division advanced towards german positions with 194th glider infantry regiment and 513th parachute infantry regiment forming division s assault element 193rd glider infantry regiment and 507th parachute infantry regiment moved behind these two regiments to deal with expected german armoured counter attacks against them during its initial advance division engaged german forces including infantry and armour in an attempt to secure a narrow high rimmed road to north west of bastogne during a battle that lasted three days division suffered nearly 1 000 casualties attempting to hold what division s official historian labeled dead man s ridge flanagan p 282 it was during opening stages of this battle that division earned its first medal of honor staff sergeant isadore s of 513th parachute infantry engaged and damaged with a bazooka two german tanks that formed part of an armoured column attacking american positions forcing column to retreat but simultaneously being killed by machine gun fire flanagan p 283 between 19 and 26 january division broke through german lines and captured several towns before linking up with elements of british 51st infantry division after it had captured town of on 26 january entire division was withdrawn from front and transported by truck to luxembourg effectively ending its participation in ardennes campaign hagerman p 28 operation varsity preparation after participating in battle of bulge division was moved behind front lines as a reserve formation and theater reserve whilst allies continued their advance towards german interior however even as division received replacements and trained it had already been selected to take part in a highly ambitious airborne operation code named operation eclipse this operation which got to such an advanced stage that plans had been created and divisional commanders briefed called for 17th and 82nd airborne divisions along with a brigade from british 6th airborne division to be dropped in daylight in and around berlin to capture city flanagan p 285 operation received support of general henry h arnold chief of united states army air corps but planning ended on 28 march when general eisenhower sent a message to joseph stalin indicating that allied armies would not attempt to capture berlin thereby making eclipse obsolete eclipse and several other similarly ambitious airborne operations came to nothing but in february division finally received word that it would be involved in an allied airborne operation to cross river rhine in support of anglo canadian 21st army group that would take place during march devlin p 255 thumb left members of 466th parachute field artillery battalion prepare for operation varsity by march 1945 allies had advanced into germany and had reached river rhine rhine was a formidable natural obstacle to allied advance but if breached would allow allies to access north german plain and ultimately advance on berlin and other major cities in northern germany following broad front approach laid out by general eisenhower it was decided to attempt to breach rhine in several areas saunders tim p 41 british field marshal sir bernard montgomery commanding 21st army group devised a plan to allow forces under his command to breach rhine which he entitled operation plunder and which was subsequently authorized by eisenhower plunder envisioned british second army under lieutenant general miles dempsey and u s ninth army under lieutenant general william simpson crossing rhine at rees wesel and an area south of lippe canal to ensure that operation was a success montgomery insisted that an airborne component was inserted into plans for operation to support amphibious assaults that would take place which was code named operation varsity devlin p 258 259 three airborne divisions were initially chosen to take part in varsity these being british 6th airborne division u s 13th airborne division and 17th airborne division all of which were assigned to u s xviii airborne corps devlin p 259 however as planning for operation varsity began it soon became obvious that there was a lack of suitable transport aircraft to transport all three airborne divisions clay p 440 as such 13th airborne division was dropped from operational plan primarily because it had no combat experience whereas 6th airborne division had participated in operation tonga british airborne landings during operation neptune and 17th had seen combat in ardennes plan for operation was therefore altered to accommodate two remaining airborne divisions this would be first airborne operation 17th would take part in and indeed would be its only before it was disbanded two airborne divisions would be dropped behind german lines with their objective to land around wesel and disrupt enemy defences in order to aid advance of british second army to achieve this both divisions would be dropped near town of hamminkeln and were tasked with a number of objectives they were to seize diersfordter wald a forest that overlooked rhine and had a road linking several towns together several bridges over a smaller waterway issel were to be seized to facilitate advance and town of hamminkeln was to be captured jewell p27 once these objectives were taken airborne troops would consolidate their positions and await arrival of allied ground forces defending territory captured against german forces known to be in area 17th airborne was to land its units in southern portion of area chosen for operation engaging german forces that were defending area securing forest which dominated surrounding area and capturing three bridges that spanned river issel harclerode p 551 it would then hold territory it had captured until it linked up units from british 6th airborne division which would land in northern section of operational area and finally advance alongside 21st army group once allied ground forces had made contact with airborne forces to avoid heavy casualties such as those incurred by british 1st airborne division during operation market garden both allied airborne divisions would be dropped only after allied ground units had secured crossings over rhine two divisions would also be dropped only a relatively short distance behind german lines to ensure that reinforcements would be able to link up with them after only a few hours and they would not be isolated jewell p 28 battle thumb map of operation varsity planned drop zones operation plunder began at 21 00 on 23 march after a week long aerial bombardment of luftwaffe airfields and german transport system involving more than ten thousand allied aircraft o neill p 299 by early hours of 24 march units of 21st army group had crossed rhine against heavy german opposition and secured several crossings on eastern bank of river tugwell p 273 in first few hours of 24 march transport aircraft carrying two airborne divisions that formed operation varsity took off from airbases in england and france and rendezvoused over brussels before turning north east

personnel who were transported in 836 c 47 dakota transports 72 c 46 commando transports and more than 900 waco cg 4a gliders at 10 00 on morning of 24th first allied airborne units began to land on german soil on eastern bank of rhine some thirteen hours after allied assault had begun 507th parachute infantry regiment under command of colonel edson raff was lead assault formation for 17th airborne division and was consequently first u s airborne unit to land as part of operation varsity entire regiment was meant to be dropped in drop zone w a clearing two miles north of wesel however excessive ground haze confused pilots of transport aircraft carrying 507th and as such when regiment dropped it split into two halves devlin p 617 colonel raff and approximately 690 of his paratroopers landed north west of drop zone near town of diersfordt with rest of regiment successfully landing in drop zone w colonel rallied his separated paratroopers and led them to drop zone

transport aircraft and damaging a further thirty eight devlin p 620 just as 507th had 513th also suffered from pilot error due to ground haze and as such regiment actually missed their designated drop zone and were dropped on one of landing zones designated for british 6th airlanding brigade however despite this inaccuracy paratroopers swiftly rallied and aided british glider borne troops who were landing simultaneously eliminating several german artillery batteries which were covering area tugwell p 274 once german troops in area had been eliminated a combined force of american and british airborne troops stormed hamminkeln and secured that town devlin p 621 by 14 00 colonel coutts reported to divisional headquarters that 513th had secured all of its objectives having knocked out two tanks and destroyed two complete regiments of artillery during its assault during its attempts to secure its objectives regiment also gained a third medal of honor for division when private first class stuart s stryker posthumously received award after leading a charge against a german machine gun nest creating a distraction to allow rest of his platoon to capture fortified position machine gun was situated in third component of 17th airborne division to take part in operation was 194th glider infantry regiment under command of colonel james pierce devlin p 624 regiment landed accurately in landing zone s but their gliders and aircraft that towed them took heavy casualties twelve c 47 transports were lost due to anti aircraft fire and a further one hundred and forty were damaged by same fire regiment landed in midst of a number of german artillery batteries that were engaging allied ground forces crossing rhine and as such many of gliders were engaged by german artillery pieces which had their barrels lowered for direct fire however these artillery batteries and their crews were defeated by glider borne troops and regiment was soon able to report that its objectives had been secured having destroyed forty two artillery pieces ten tanks two mobile flak wagons and five self propelled guns aftermath thumb left churchill tanks of 6th guards tank brigade carrying american
