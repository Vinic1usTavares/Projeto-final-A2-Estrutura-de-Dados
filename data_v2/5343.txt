liberal movement lm was a south australian political party which existed from 1973 to 1976 and was a forerunner to australian democrats lm was initially organised in 1972 by former premier steele hall as an internal group of liberal and country league lcl in response to a perceived resistance to sought reform within lcl when tensions heightened between lcl s conservative wing and lm after march 1973 state election it was established in its own right as a progressive liberal party on 2 april 1973 when still part of league it had eleven state parliamentarians on its own it was reduced to three parliamentarians hall and robin millhouse in lower house and martin cameron in upper house at 1974 federal election hall won a senate seat and david boundy retained his south australia seat for lm at 1975 state election millhouse and boundy retained their seats while john carnie won a second seat and cameron retained his seat in upper house bringing party to a peak of five parliamentarians in 1974 federal election it succeeded in having hall elected to australian senate with a primary vote of 10 per cent in south australia it built upon this in 1975 state election gaining almost a fifth of total vote and an additional member however non labor parties narrowly failed to dislodge incumbent dunstan labor government that result together with internal weaknesses led in 1976 to lm s being re absorbed into lcl which by then had become south australian division of liberal party of australia non labor forces again failed at 1977 state election but succeeded in winning government for one term at 1979 state election a segment of lm led by former state attorney general robin millhouse did not rejoin liberals but instead formed a new party new lm this party combined with australia party under invited leadership of don chipp formed nucleus of australian democrats which aspired to a balance of power in federal senate and up to four state upper houses for three decades lm and its successor parties gave voice to what is termed small l liberalism in australia party system before parties became established in australian colonies in later 19th century all members of colonial parliaments were independents occasionally labelled as liberal or conservative amongst other terms jaensch 1986 p 179 with advent of labor these groups combined to form anti labor parties jaensch 1986 pp 180 190

summers and woodward 2006 pp 1 15 207 209 as a train of thought australian liberalism has been less rooted in any defined ideology and more in pragmatism and opposition to labor liberalism in

1891 born out of a trade union association that recommended and supported trade unionist candidates jaensch 1986 pp 180 181 in response national defence league ndl was born two years later jaensch 1986 pp 181 182 in 1909 ndl combined with liberal and democratic union and farmers and producers political union to form liberal union later known as liberal federation jaensch 1986 pp 226 228 ulp morphed into labor party in 1910 and has been known by this name ever since a separate country party subsequently emerged representing rural interests jaensch 1986 pp 384 386 but this was assimilated back into conservative side of politics with formation of liberal and country league lcl in 1932 jaensch 1986 p 382 south australian party system has not deviated from this two party divide and all other parties gained negligible representation or influence jaensch 1986 pp 497 498 until emergence of smaller parties such as australian democrats in late 20th century and greens and family first

establishment yeoman proprietary farmers and regional workers and adelaide middle class blewett and jaensch 1971 pp 8 9 of these groups middle class was most electorally depressed both in parliament and within party itself owing to a 2 1 ratio favouring regional areas both in electoral legislation and party organisation establishment influenced party with its financial backing while yeoman proprietary was most numerous only in 1956 did urban middle class achieve parliamentary representation through robin millhouse who was elected to urban middle class seat of mitcham jaensch 1997 p 37 millhouse was a vocal advocate of his broader constituency championing their case in a party dominated by rural conservatives he wrote a paper on liberal case for electoral reform arguing for a fairer electoral system as it was biased against voters resident in capital city adelaide whether they be progressive or conservative liberal or labor jaensch 1997 p 38 many younger urban middle class voters who would have normally been attracted to lcl were abandoning party for labor owing to their dissatisfaction with malapportioned electoral system known as playmander jaensch 1986 pp 253 259 but this concerned rural conservatives little who hoped to retain their hold on power through present system which included a legislative council where suffrage was based on land ownership resulting in a body dominated by ruling class and rural landholders and a 16 4 lcl majority millhouse s paper was quickly ignored lcl had governed primarily under stead of sir thomas playford for 32 years and finally lost to labor in 1965 jaensch 1986 p 488 a year and a half later when playford retired steele hall was elected to replace him a young farmer from a rural constituency hall had never conflicted with party line and was expected to uphold existing lcl principles having spoken out in support of playmander and restrictive legislative council before jaensch and bullock 1978 p 11 however when lcl was returned to office in 1968 under his leadership with help of malapportionment hall was under pressure labor had led lcl 52 0 to 43 8 on primary votes but owing to playmander both ended with 19 seats and an independent supported lcl and returned them to power large protests against playmander broke out and there were strong calls for reform lcl had routinely ignored such protests before but hall s course differed from what was expected he appointed millhouse his attorney general and continued a raft of social reform that had begun under previous labor government jaensch 1986 pp 299 300 this was opposed by some conservatives within party lines began to be drawn and factions began to appear hall commented in party s newsletter that too many people see lcl as a party tied to conservative traditions we must show voters that we can move with times that we are with it jaensch 1997 p 39 electoral reform level of malapportionment had grown to a level in excess of 3 1 in favour of rural areas and hall having won 1968 state election on 46 per cent of two party preferred vote committed himself to a fairer electoral system jaensch 1986 pp 297 298 previously 39 members were elected 13 from metropolitan adelaide and 26 from country hall s first attempt for reform was a system with 45 seats and 20 from country this proposal received scorn from both labor and rural councillors and was seen as not going far enough by former and going too far by latter a second proposal for 47 seats with 19 in country was adopted with bipartisan support in house of assembly but encountered opposition in legislative council new system would make an lcl win near impossible at coming 1970 state election and hall and lcl were aware of it for his weakening of rural constituencies hall became an enemy to those councillors who stood in defence of previous system blewett and jaensch 1971 pp 184 187 hall saw political situation as untenable and felt lcl needed reform to cope with removal of an artificial situation 240px thumb left rural conservatives whose power was grounded in legislative council pictured sought to retain their influence in both party and state through malapportionment in electoral districts and lcl party organisation labor s leader don dunstan also introduced a bill for reform of legislative council which sought to remove its wage and property based qualifications and instil adult suffrage hall himself stated he would approve bill if it included a clause guaranteeing that legislative council could only be abolished through a referendum dunstan agreed but hall s own party split on issue bill passed house of assembly with labor support but failed in legislative council where lcl s rural conservatives dominated its restricted electoral base dunstan 1981 pp 161 and bullock 1978 pp 18 21 behind votes in parliament was a personal antagonism between hall and ren degaris leader of lcl in legislative council degaris who was elected to council in 1962 was a staunch defender of its franchise and electoral boundaries two were de facto leaders of party s two factions hall represented urban based progressives and degaris rural based conservatives jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 15 16 conflict between two extended beyond politics and on to a personal level jaensch and bullock 1978 p 21 contributing to polarisation of views within lcl and making it difficult for an internal compromise to be reached on issue of electoral reform jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 18 23 after lcl lost government in 1970 primarily owing to electoral reform hall managed to be re elected as leader he convinced a majority of party s membership that reform was needed and sought to remove influence that party s representatives in legislative council held when dunstan government again introduced a bill to introduce universal suffrage to council hall gained support of 7 out of 20 members in assembly but only 2 of 16 lcl members in legislative council supported bill jaensch 1997 p 40 internally there was much opposition to any electoral reform when matter was debated at party conferences jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 28 34 conservatives then moved against hall putting forward party proposals to lessen influence of its parliamentary leader liberal parties in australia had long held to a tradition of separation of houses independence of members and ability of parliamentary leader to choose his own cabinet rural councillors sought to preserve their power and demanded that cabinet positions not be decided by leader but elected by parliamentary party as a whole as this would include legislative council dominated by its rural membership hall s support among moderate liberals would be overwhelmed by councillors inclusion hall privately told legislative council chairman david that he could not work with degaris and that he would resign if he was not allowed to choose his cabinet after parliamentary party agreed on this issue 12 8 hall resigned leadership on 16 march 1972 stating that i cannot continue to lead a party that will not follow i cannot lead a party which has lost its idealism and which has forgotten that its purpose for existence is to govern successfully for welfare of all south australians our party is still deeply cleft by persuasive influence of a number of its members in legislative council jaensch and bullock 1978 p 2 3 later in speech he said over last three years i have been subject to a great deal of disloyalty on a continuing basis i had hoped this afternoon to move a motion of no confidence in government instead i found out party had moved a vote of no confidence in itself premier dunstan with whom hall had never had amiable relations crossed floor of house and shook hall s hand in a gesture of solidarity dunstan 1981 p and bullock 1978 p 1 hall said he was knifed and said conservatives actions were a clear example of how deeply wooden horses of legislative council have entrenched themselves in ranks of assembly membership jaensch and bullock 1978 p 42 lcl president ian mclachlan put on a brave face saying mr hall had some personal problems with party but these differences do not make a divided party jaensch and bullock 1978 p 43 but he was quoted next day as saying that proposal was mooted to gauge hall s power obscure and low key conservative bruce eastick was installed as new leader as some more prominent figures such as millhouse were seen as too sympathetic to hall in meantime there was a strong reaction to hall s departure among public and segments of lcl notably youth wings demonstrated against events and made motions of objection hall had expected to become a normal backbencher but groundswell of support prompted a change of heart jaensch and bullock pp 44 45 formation hall initially sought to appeal to state council of lcl although body had no binding authority over parliamentary caucus which chose leader hall and his followers saw it as an opportunity for a media victory motion went narrowly against hall but it generated much attention and potential embarrassment for conservatives jaensch and bullock 1978 p 46 after this he thought of establishing his own separate party citing small opinion polls that supported this action but ian wilson former member for federal division of sturt convinced him to stay within lcl and bring about internal change hall 1973 p 1997 p 41 strong support emerged from within party for hall s stand particularly from its youth wing young liberals jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 45 46 on 21 march 1972 a faction but closer to a party within a party was formed new liberals on 28 march it was renamed liberal movement jaensch and bullock 1978 p 47 conservatives strongly criticised hall and his new movement accusing them of undermining eastick disrupting party and being disloyal jaensch and bullock 1978 p 48 240px right thumb house of assembly pictured had seven lm members while still part of lcl reduced to two when it split from its parent it quickly gained support within lcl s membership capturing a number of party branches and began its own members robin millhouse was a member of faction and served as deputy leader of both lcl and lm thanks to electoral reform that had occurred with more urban electoral districts to contest urban based lm greatly increased its parliamentary representation with seven members in house of assembly including hall millhouse and future premiers david tonkin and dean brown three in legislative council and one in australian house of representatives ian wilson jaensch 1997 pp 41 42 soon there were factional clashes during parliamentary debate combative television debates and some lcl members began campaigning anonymously against lcl one lcl branch president publicly called hall a traitor jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 50 52 lm managed to worry conservatives by managing to seize control of some rural branches within electorates held by strongly anti lm representatives including that of degaris conservatives tried to remove hall s endorsement for his seat but failed several bitterly fought pre selection battles followed as a former premier hall was much more proficient than eastick at dealing with press and used his skills to generate more media publicity prompting eastick to claim bias jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 52 54 lm sought to seize control of lcl agenda by winning key positions on state executive at annual general meeting in september but this was difficult as malapportionment towards rural groups was entrenched at party level and because conservatives had anticipated lm s plans lm president alex perryman challenged mclachlan for party presidency and in a high profile contest received 47 of vote in a narrow defeat he received around 90 among urban delegates and around 33 of rural votes latter figure shocking conservatives jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 54 55 lm later generated more publicity by inquiring about alleged impropriety in balloting process jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 56 57 lm s policies were generally progressive and hall himself stated that we had no major differences with written philosophies of lcl lm s colour purple was described by observers as lcl blue with a dash of labor red signifying faction s location on political spectrum lm was less concerned with creating differing policy as it was taking over and reforming lcl however on electoral reform front lm started by calling for legislative council to be devoid of ministers jaensch and bullock 1978 p 49 worried by lm conservatives in lcl tried to change party rules to prevent members from criticising organisation in public and enforce discipline this backfired as lm exploited it to portray conservatives as repressive and media also viewed it negatively and move was put on hold jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 58 60 non labor forces in their disunity were in a poor position to challenge dominance of charismatic premier dunstan lm itself contained two poorly defined internal groups moderates concerned with inequalities of electoral systems and lcl s aging image and radicals who espoused aforementioned in addition to desire for wide ranging social reform some of latter felt hall was most progressive option available but not progressive enough nevertheless lm had generated a large amount of campaign funds and had great name recognition hall was also favoured in opinions as a better leader than eastick by a threefold factor jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 66 68 they cited such figures to portray themselves as main threat to labor and justify why they were direction lcl needed to take late in year lm received another boost when wilson regained seat of sturt for liberal party at 1972 federal election making much of his lm membership jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 61 62 in 1973 state election lm largely ran a separate campaign from lcl as a whole majority of lcl s metropolitan candidates were also within lm and it was hoped that enough seats would be gained so that not only would lcl return to power but that lm would be able to overpower conservative faction in house of assembly and re elect hall as leader to do this they needed to capture at least three marginal labor seats in adelaide this also meant conservatives in lcl would be better off losing to labor if they wanted to maintain their hold on party as labor s vulnerable seats were in all in city and a labor loss meant a lm gain lcl campaign chairperson explicitly said that she would prefer losing if it meant keeping control of party jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 69 70 while lm ran an innovative campaign jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 72 75 lcl itself faltered losing support in country to a separate country party and to labor in metropolitan adelaide one lm seat held by a rural member was lost to country party jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 76 81 lm were branded by lcl conservatives as being reason behind lcl s defeat jaensch and bullock 1978 p 82 83 lm saw itself as a more modern and appropriate alternative to lcl more in tune with urban mainstream but there was no evidence that urban lm candidates were more popular than conservative lcl candidates in adelaide lm members made up majority of urban lcl candidates but were unable to wrest any labor seats in adelaide jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 79 80 labor s convincing win was not unexpected particularly as infighting in lcl had been ongoing for over a year friction was present throughout campaign as well as before it particularly as much of donations were given directly to lm jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 62 65 in months before election lcl members had thrown punches in corridors of parliament house jaensch and bullock 1978 p 66 internal battles between conservatives and lm members for party pre selection were keenly contested jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 70 71 around half of lcl candidates were lm supporters and avoided mention of lcl and its conservative leader bruce eastick in their pamphlets some of lm faction candidates instead trumpeted hall as their leader and printed books detailing their policies there was also an incident where a lm function celebrating wilson s win in 1972 federal election clashed with eastick s main policy speech eastick and his conservatives arrived at wilson s dinner after they finished campaigning for night but then walked out when wilson was delivering a speech calling for lcl to be more tolerant of diverse opinions within party labor ran a sedate campaign but made much of internal lcl divisions split despite lcl s defeat failure of lm to gain internal supremacy over conservatives was seen by latter as a vindication of their policies jaensch and bullock 1978 p 82 pressure from lcl s leader bruce eastick who called on lm to disband and conservative wing of party saw machinations against lm hall reiterated lm s intention to continue jaensch and bullock 1978 p 83 but millhouse was removed as lcl deputy leader in 1973 and pressure began to be mounted on faction which did not have any members on frontbench hall did not pursue a position in shadow ministry tension continued as rumours spread claiming that lcl state council was contemplating forbidding and vetoing of lm members from representing party in elections while hall and martin cameron responded by publicly vowing to stand firm several of their lm colleagues were ambivalent when asked about intentions if lm were no longer tolerated within lcl however heini becker left lm jaensch and bullock 1978 p 84 on 23 march a motion was passed at state council that allowed it to deny membership to those who belonged to outside political organisations and lm was subsequently declared to be one strangely an lcl member could also be a member of communist party of australia but not lm a motion by lm members to also declare league of rights an outside political organisation failed jaensch and bullock 1978 p 86 88 lcl conservatives were confident lm would capitulate and reintegrate as third parties had never been successful in south australia at first lm members tried to have their banning from lcl deemed illegal but this failed it was not expected that lm would split to form a separate party but before it was established hall promptly resigned from lcl declaring it hypocritical and decadent martin cameron quickly followed and robin millhouse consulted with members from his constituency before agreeing to resign from lcl ian wilson who had earlier managed to convince hall not to form a separate party tried in vain to sway him to remain with lcl and focus on reforming it from within he wanted to shut down lm in an attempt to limit damage to party believing that political groups come and go but ideals we aim for will never change all other lcl lm members did not follow three lower house members including tonkin and brown wilson in federal parliament and two mlcs all stayed in lcl david tonkin stated that every one of those liberals who resign from league is making it more and more certain that league will remain just as it is jaensch and bullock 1978 p 87 240px left thumb parliament house in adelaide a number of lcl branches remained with lm and there were mass resignations from lcl on whole eastick was relatively unconcerned lcl had a massive membership of over 30 000 and lm s split did little to dent it eastick admitted 200 individual resignations in meantime lcl tried to introduce a requirement for members to make pledge that they were not aligned with an outside political body jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 88 91 this prompted a second wave of resignations notably from sections of young liberal movement despite its leader s show of confidence many in lcl were concerned that expulsion of lm elements had apparently backfired it also prompted some disillusioned parliamentarians to suggest that rural and urban elements in lcl could not coexist new party was formally announced on 2 april after an lm convention jaensch 1997 p 42 as lm had already begun establishing an infrastructure while in lcl it was able to pick up momentum readily presenting itself as a centrist moderate party but it was never able to shed its reliance on hall as hall and millhouse were both competent parliamentary performers it was widely acknowledged in media that they outperformed lcl in providing an effective opposition in one parliamentary division with entirety of alp and lcl on one side of house and lm members on other millhouse took one of many opportunities to taunt eastick and damage lcl labelling him dunstan lover jaensch and bullock 1978 p 99 south australian media which had earlier warmed to premier dunstan then focused their attention on lm and gave fledgling party much needed publicity primary instigator for creation of lm in 1972 had been based around lack of electoral reform jaensch 1997 p 43 electoral system had been expected to continue to return rural lcl members in legislative council yet at 1973 state election labor had through mass registration of new voters for council vote managed to gain two seats giving a council of 14 lcl 6 labor jaensch 1986 pp 307 308 as half council was elected at each election labor only had to retain their vote to gain an additional two seats at 1975 state election and a minor rise in it would see additional council seats fall to them jaensch 1986 pp 495 498 it was increasingly plausible that labor would be able to gain a majority in legislative council within a decade and then carry through their goal of abolishing it and push through any electoral legislation it so wished jaensch 1981 p 226 to lcl this was a dangerous situation and seeing a need to avoid it they compromised their position abruptly changed to being in favour of wholesale reform of legislative council jaensch 1997 pp 43 44 when dunstan put forward bills to reform it lcl relented and eastick convinced lcl councillors to let them pass conditional on amendments to legislation these were a minor change to particular proportional system used to elect councillors and that it remained non compulsory to vote in council jaensch 1981 pp 226 230 new council would eventually have 22 members with half elected each election from a multi member constituency covering entirety of state dunstan 1981 p 214 1986 p 498 hall attacked lcl for its sudden change in stance on reform and managed to see first lm policy become law with lowering of council suffrage age to 18 jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 92 93 reform legislation for legislative council was not to take effect until next election and death of lcl mlc henry kemp necessitated a by election for council district of southern on 11 august 1973 southern was an ultra safe rural lcl seat and labor declined to stand in by election it was contested by lcl lm a separate country party and australia party three non lcl parties agreed on favourable preference deals in hope of one of them displacing lcl lm gained 29 per cent of vote and lcl candidate john burdett won by a 4 per cent margin once preferences had been distributed jaensch and bullock 1978 p 96 at start of 1974 lcl had undertaken some progressive reforms they brought in a less conservative membership at grassroots level although old guard was still prominent in parliamentary roles they tried to broach possibility of lm wilson and

national exposure hall decided to stand for australian senate at 1974 federal election another objective was to allow millhouse and cameron to become more prominent at state level and dispel established perception of lm as a hall party jaensch and bullock 1978 p 97 move was a risk as failure would have left lm s main out of spotlight entirely until a state election which was not due for another two years but hall said party had no future unless it could gain national stature another possible problem was that media could have lost interest in lm at a state level regardless of whether hall won a senate position jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 97 98 1975 federal election followed a double dissolution meaning that all senate seats rather than half were up for election and thus a

parkin summers and woodward 2006 pp 71 79 83 battle between lcl and lm was not seen as a large part of national campaign as south australia was only a small part of nation and most of marginal seats

evenly poised and subject of frantic electioneering surprisingly as lm was an urban movement they polled 46 per cent of vote which saw david boundy elected on back of country party preferences with a two party preferred vote beyond 60 jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 107 109 despite most of its preferences flowing to lm country party attacked lm for perceived hypocrisy as they had run in a rural seat

opportunity to capture senate seats in all states across nation and lm sought to create bases outside south australia on 18 november a lm rally was held at melbourne town hall to launch a branch in victoria a branch was formed in queensland and hall travelled to western australia to oversee formation of a state branch generally lm s attempts to spread its message failed owing to dramatic and highly polarising effects of whitlam s dismissal and constitutional crisis which produced angry demonstrations around country amid tumult media was almost completely focused on two main parties giving other groups almost no opportunities to capture public imagination lm also found it difficult to establish a connection with populace outside south australia owing to its formation within a state specific backdrop attempts were made to expand appeal of lm through secret merger talks with australia party who initiated idea but these collapsed campaign was also hampered by departure of two lm candidates who relabelled themselves as independent liberal movement first to leave lm c w henderson was a member of lm management committee who criticised hall s attempts to spread party nationally he accused hall of having delusions of grandeur leading to his membership being suspended two days later jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 136 139 next day j henderson sixth member of senate ticket quit saying he did not want to be a puppet on a party string groves and henderson aggressively campaigned against lm although they were to receive only 0 09 of senate vote themselves when election was held there was a 12 percent swing towards liberal party in south australia uwa senate election in south australia 1975 retrieved 2 march 2007 or 7 percent on two party preferred house of representatives two party preferred results 1949 present aec there was a large swing against labor owing to dissatisfaction with whitlam administration but it generally went directly to liberal party against this background and with relatively little media attention paid to lm and its cause despite gaining prominence for his stance on supply hall struggled to be re elected gaining only 6 5 per cent of senate vote and relying on preferences ironically from labor jaensch 1997 p 44 in south australia labor gained 41 per cent of vote and liberals 51 per cent in lower house lm managed only 6 2 across 12 seats again recording its best result in boothby with 10 4 hall s hope for australia wide support for lm was dashed owing to previous events with party gaining negligible results for their candidates in other states lower house candidates in australian capital territory registered around 3 but senate candidates in western australia new south wales victoria and queensland received less than 1 hall s opinion was that liberal movement was for its part in contest happy to have survived jaensch and bullock 1978 p 139 nevertheless hall was still adamant lm s future was as a standalone entity lm is going to continue as an australia wide party we shall have to go through sickening process of having liberal party make overtures to us once again i would like to tell them right now that they will be wasting their breath despite hall s defiance poor showing meant his senate term was only to last for three rather than six years and he no longer had balance of power and resulting media exposure this was a problem as party was largely centred around his personality jaensch 1997 p 48 decline independent of lm lcl had begun to change it eventually supported don dunstan s bills for electoral reform both to house of assembly and legislative council and its internal structure was reorganised and modernised particular with arrival of tonkin its first urban leader lcl renamed itself south australian division of liberal party of australia to bring itself into line with its federal counterpart thus many of reasons for lm s split had become null combined with lm s declining membership one third of members had not renewed and its large debt it found itself in a precarious position negotiations in 1976 began with aim for lm to merge into new liberal party and news of secret talks were leaked in april jaensch 1997 p 45 once news became public millhouse stated his complete opposition i will not rejoin liberal party i have meant what i said in past and i do not see any change in attitude of liberal party to alter my view jaensch 1997 p 46 he said doing so would entail a surrender of honour and self respect and described lm as only genuine liberal party in nation boldly predicting that its agenda would become dominant in society millhouse s stand was widely condemned by media who saw it as based on pride rather than pragmatism and unhelpful for anti labor politics jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 144 146 hall however wanted to unite non labor forces and acknowledged that there is no prospect of maintaining lm electorate groups in simple terms our alternatives are to swallow some little pride and unite to fight labor he said to do otherwise would be to exist in splendid selfish isolation and said they could not survive as a relevant force by holding goyder and mitcham and losing upper house seats owing to a dwindling vote hall said lm s reform agenda had been fulfilled their finances were untenable and contended there was no ideological reason remaining for a split this put him at increasing odds with millhouse who continued to describe liberals as very conservative jaensch and bullock 1978 pp 146 149 some members of liberals were also wary of a merger owing to long standing antipathy between two groups and persistent criticism of them from lm over years in meantime negotiations continued with hall prominent during informal discussions following 1975 state election millhouse had been offered deputy leadership in a merged party and cameron a leading role in upper house but following poor showing at federal election and deteriorating financial state of lm offer was reduced and posts that had been offered to millhouse and cameron were no longer available however hall was still able to negotiate for lm president and treasurer to be given positions on a new executive he also agreed to forgo any further senate bids an agreement was put in place to protect boundy from being ousted at a pre selection of new party but this was broken at next election lm was also given an equal voting share on pre selection committees for three urban lower house seats labor was not pleased with prospect of its opponents being reunited and potentially more effective and premier dunstan mocked opposition parties as a circus jaensch and bullock 1978 p 149 while his deputy des corcoran predicted new entity would not be able to last jaensch and bullock 1978 p 141 media continued to criticise millhouse s defiance as disruptive when lm voted narrowly in may 1976 to rejoin liberals 222 to 211 millhouse immediately created new lm and became its only parliamentary representative he tried to put an optimistic view on matter saying that close run vote as an endorsement of his position and merger as an opportunity to start with a clean slate with no debt merger was finalised on 4 june when liberals state council voted heavily in favour jaensch and bullock 1978 p 148 he was a prominent member of assembly and a constant irritant to liberals with whom he often sparred jaensch 1997 p 46 47 when don chipp resigned from federal liberal party and stated his intention to create a centrist and progressive third force in australian politics millhouse s new lm responded chipp s australian democrats was created and negotiations began for a merger between two parties new lm candidates at 1977 state election stood under a joint new lm australian democrats ticket winning 12 3 per cent of vote in 12 electorates they contested jaensch 1997 pp 47 48 and millhouse defeated liberal candidate in lower house seat of mitcham which he would hold until 1982 jaensch 1986 p 328 merger was finalised on 3 october 1977 and new lm was absorbed into democrats jaensch and bullock 1978 p and bullock 1978 pp 182 1997 p 47 meanwhile interstate branches of lm which had been in existence for only six months either disbanded in 1976 or eventually evolved and merged into state components of democrats western australian division of lm was strongest interstate branch and renamed itself centre line party before becoming state branch of democrats david tonkin an lm member before it split and became a separate party had gained liberal party leadership in 1975 succeeding eastick jaensch 1986 p 489 he worked swiftly to heal internal party wounds and to re establish non labor forces and provide an effective opposition 1977 state election saw a decline in liberal support but party gained power after abrupt resignation of premier dunstan jaensch 1986 pp 480 481 494 with an 11 per cent swing at 1979 state election receiving 55 per cent of two party preferred vote first democrats mlc was also elected in 1979 on a first preference vote of 6 5 per cent parkin 1986 p 1986 p 495 in 1982 however labor party again gained office and would rule for over a decade democrats continued to attract support and would solely hold balance of power in legislative council until 1997 state election parkin 1986 p stock 1997 pp 206 212 parliamentarians steele hall
