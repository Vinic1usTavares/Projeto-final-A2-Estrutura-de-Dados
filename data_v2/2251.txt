93 us 93 main highway connecting phoenix and las vegas nevada in kingman and again approximately to east and interstate 17 freeway linking phoenix to northern arizona in flagstaff for majority of its routing through arizona i 40 follows historic alignment of u s route 66 lone exception is a stretch between kingman and ash fork where us 66 took a more northerly less direct route that is now state route 66 construction of i 40 was ongoing in 1960s and 1970s and reached completion in 1984 with completion of i 40 in 1984 entire routing of us 66 had been bypassed by interstate highways which led to its decertification a year later in 1985 route description california to flagstaff thumb i 40 westbound towards la nearing i 17 junction and exit 195 in arizona i 40 enters arizona from california at a bridge that crosses colorado river at topock in mohave county it heads east from topock and begins to curve towards north at franconia completing curve at yucca interstate continues to head north until it reaches kingman in this city i 40 has a junction with us 93 at exit 48 us 93 heads towards northwest from this interchange to hoover dam and las vegas us 93 south begins to run concurrently with i 40 east as they both swing eastward through kingman two later separate at exit 71 as us 93 heads towards south towards phoenix while i 40 continues east toward flagstaff along way i 40 passes through town of seligman then at ash fork it meets state route 89 former u s highway that heads south to prescott next it passes through williams where it has an interchange with sr 64 exit 165 which heads north towards grand canyon national park i 40 continues to east to flagstaff where it has a major junction with i 17 at exit 195 i 17 heads south from this interchange to phoenix flagstaff to

northeast along this stretch it passes through petrified forest national park and continues to northeast passing through chambers and enters navajo nation highway still continues to northeast to new mexico border southwest of gallup new mexico as it continues on towards albuquerque history with exception of a stretch between kingman and flagstaff i 40 directly replaced famed us 66 across northern arizona where possible us 66 was upgraded to interstate standards to become i 40 directly exceptions to this were through central business districts of cities and towns that us 66 passed through and i 40 had to be built as a bypass outside cities on october 26 1984 after last section of i 40 was completed in williams us 66 was removed from state highway system of arizona portions through cities that did not overlap i 40 would become business loops of i 40 before u s highways routing of a road near current corridor of i 40 in arizona was first surveyed and built between 1857 and 1859 lt edward beale and his soldiers built road along 35th parallel that would come to be known as beale wagon road from fort smith arkansas to colorado river to serve as a military wagon road road was a popular route for immigrants during 1860s and 1870s until transcontinental railroad was built across northern arizona in 1880s in early 1900s road became part of national old trails road a transcontinental route from baltimore maryland to california and national park to park highway an auto trail linking national parks of west u s route 66 in 1920s as a nationwide system of highways called united states numbered highways was being developed route through was given designation of u s route 60 this designation was controversial since designations that are multiples of 10 are assigned to transcontinental east west routes and this route was a diagonal route from chicago to los angeles as a compromise to states east of chicago that felt us 60 should go through their state a different route was given number 60 while route from chicago to los angeles was given number 66 thumb left i 40 westbound heading towards flagstaff by 1927 routing of us 66 through arizona had been laid out but none of it had been paved yet by 1935 nearly entire route had been paved with lone exceptions being a short stretch northeast of valentine and a stretch between peach springs and seligman by 1938 entire route in arizona had been paved in 1953 us 66 was realigned between california border and kingman to an alignment to southeast to avoid mountain curves and grades of original alignment by 1961 several sections of highway had been expanded to a four lane divided highway in anticipation of coming interstate highway four lane sections included a section near ash fork another section east of winslow and a section east of holbrook near petrified forest national monument planning in flagstaff several different alternatives were considered as a potential routing of new interstate through area alternatives consisted of a routing north of downtown south of downtown through downtown along santa fe railroad right of way near alignment of us 66 and a more elaborate alternative of a routing above downtown on a long overpass in january 1959 flagstaff chamber of commerce recommended to bureau of public roads that route south of downtown be used which was approved by flagstaff city council and board of supervisors for coconino county this recommendation was accepted and would become planned routing of i 40 in flagstaff business owners along us 66 were opposed to this routing as it would draw motorists away from main through route of time us 66 as a result they created no by pass committee and sent a proposal to chamber of commerce s roads and highways committee to conduct a study of feasibility of a route for i 40 through downtown along santa fe railroad right of way committee sent an inquiry to railroad concerning proposal railroad rejected proposed rerouting of their main rail lines citing that it would result in worse grades than what currently exists and in order to reduce those grades considerable lengthening of rail line would be required with a routing through town now out of question business owners along us 66 drafted a city ordinance known as initiative 200 that was filed with city of flagstaff in november 1959 to appear on general election ballot in march 1960 ordinance would in effect ban all new commercial businesses on i 40 all routes leading from i 40 to us 66 and area between i 40 and us 66 in a record voter turnout voters overwhelmingly voted against ordinance by a vote of 2 280 to 556 in 1965 routing of i 40 west of kingman was being reconsidered from planned route through needles california to a route to north passing through searchlight in southern nevada and connecting with i 15 further north of its present connection with i 15 rationale for proposal was that it would be an overall shorter route and would cost much less to construct proposal was met with stiff opposition including all four u s senators from california and arizona sending secretary of commerce letters requesting that routing through needles be retained this proposal was eventually abandoned in 1966 and routing through needles was kept construction thumb i 40 near new mexico border construction of route of i 40 across arizona took nearly 25 years to complete with last segment being completed in 1984 much longer than ambitious goal of finishing by 1972 by end of 1960 had been completed with an additional being worked on in 1964 construction was still on schedule with complete and an additional under construction funding was becoming an issue at this time as state lacked available funds to stay on pace with a 1972 completion goal by 1967 arizona had completed almost half of highway with complete and another under construction in 1968 bypass around flagstaff was complete with three interchanges two at each end of where us 66 split off from i 40 to enter city and one at i 17 interchange an additional interchange at butler avenue was completed a year later one of big improvements of i 40 over us 66 was construction of segment between kingman and ash fork section is a more direct route between two cities and travels as far as south of us 66 alignment bypassing hackberry and peach springs and creating ghost towns construction of 69 1 million segment was also to be a much safer route as us 66 alignment had one of highest fatality rates of any section of highway in arizona this section of interstate was complete in 1975 construction of 7 7 million bypass around winslow began in 1977 i 40 was completed in arizona in 1984 with completion of a section in williams this was also last section of us 66 to be bypassed by interstate which led to it being decertified by american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto following year exit list see also references external links 40
