real time and party members will auto attack when enemies enter their attack radius manually input attacks called arts may also be performed by player but in a limited fashion battle arts are only available after a cool down period that occurs after every use while character specific talent arts only become available after enough auto attacks are executed both party members and enemies have a finite amount of health points and attacks deplete this value combat is won when all enemies lose their hp but game is lost if player s character loses all their hp and has no means of being revived health may be restored by player by using healing arts in battle or player may let characters hp regenerate automatically outside of battle winning battles earns player experience points which allows characters to grow stronger by leveling up and learning new arts arts for each character must be set by player on their respective set up called a battle palette outside battles several other systems are present to affect flow of battle party gauge slowly fills as party members successfully land hits on enemy players and filling gauge allows player to chain multiple attacks together for extra damage all party members have an aggro ring around them as well more actions a character performs larger it grows larger aggro rings lead enemies to focus their efforts on that respective character leading to a strategic aspect of luring and diverting attention of enemies each character has a tension gauge which represents a character s morale at its highest point characters have a high probability of dealing a critical blow and less chance of missing an enemy game s vision system where main character shulk can see glimpses of enemies future attacks also factors into battles with knowledge of an enemy s potentially dangerous attack player can prevent it from happening by alerting a teammate allowing player to activate one of their arts or by using an art of their own to stop attack vision system is tied to party gauge which is filled by boosting team morale using arts with special effects and avoiding or dealing critical hits three tiered gauge gradually depletes outside of battle and one tier is needed to either revive characters or alert a teammate to a vision when all three tiers are full party can execute a chain attack synopsis setting and characters setting of xenoblade chronicles originates in a world that was nothing but endless ocean until two titanic gods bionis and mechonis came into existence and battled each other until only their frozen corpses remained in eons following their battle they became home of multiple forms of life bionis is home to organic lifeforms most prominently humanoid homs who are virtually identical to humans both in appearance and biology diminutive and furry nopon and avian humanoid high entia whose lifespans span centuries conversely mechonis is home to mechanical humanoid machina whose lifespans span several millennia a key weapon used by homs in battle against mechonis is monado a mystical sword which grants visions of future to its wielder when fully controlled game s main character is shulk a young homs scientist who lives in colony 9 on bionis during an attack by machina warriors called mechon shulk comes into possession of monado during his journey shulk is joined by reyn one of shulk s

and begins an attack on bionis intent on destroying bionis as revenge for decimation it had caused to machina thousands of years ago despite fighting him shulk manages to make him see that they both

gods where everyone can decide their own fates in new universe survivors of bionis and mechonis build a new settlement and live peacefully together fiora is restored to her homs form and both she and shulk optimistically look forward to alvis parting promise of endless worlds and races of people beyond their own development right thumb a model depicting two giant gods frozen in mid combat created by tetsuya takahashi and yasuyuki honne from a concept by takahashi this model became starting point for development of xenoblade chronicles xenoblade chronicles was developed by japanese development company monolith soft with tetsuya takahashi forming original concept and serving as game s executive director takahashi had previously worked in 1990s on xenogears then on xenosaga trilogy after founding monolith soft in 1999 xenosaga was intended to be a six part series but low commercial performances forced planned xenosaga series to be halved after these events entire development team was in a state of low morale initial concept for xenoblade chronicles of people living on bodies of gigantic gods came to takahashi in june 2006 struck by his idea he immediately committed it to paper and showed draft to other senior staff who were favorably impressed one of them an executive called yasuyuki honne thought it would make a good 3d model and bought materials to create it construction began in july during this period younger staff acted as models so that takahashi could establish which parts of gods bodies could be used as habitable and navigable environments in various poses after model s construction takahashi decided to combine model s concept with an unrelated story idea which became basis for a new game after positive feedback from staff takahashi later said that one of main reasons for developing game was to bolster team morale after commercial failure of xenosaga games team first showed their proposal to nintendo prior to final development stages of disaster day of crisis development began over four years prior to its release with first prototypes for game being developed in april 2007 it was at this point that co director genki yokota was brought in by nintendo to handle any system related issues due to his previous experience with rpgs after being contacted regarding both xenoblade chronicles and fellow wii jrpg last story head of nintendo s licensing department shinji hatano said that games should be made for a wide audience and using a romanticist approach takahashi was involved in every aspect of game s development from its initial concept to debugging stage at beginning of development game was going to be a stand alone title unrelated to xeno series bearing title monado beginning of world later then nintendo president satoru iwata had title changed to its current one to honor both takahashi s previous titles and effort he was investing in xenoblade chronicles according to takahashi xeno designation was more along lines of a symbol calling back to previous works of monolith soft when describing title s meaning takahashi described xeno as meaning different nature or uniqueness while blade part was closely tied to narrative particularly game s ending a key element of game for takahashi was creating an ideal balance between gameplay and story something that he felt was lacking in other jrpgs which focused too much on story takahashi s previous experiences with xenosaga games and baten kaitos eternal wings and lost ocean which had been called out for being old fashioned when compared to other rpgs of day influenced his work in this regard mechanic of shulk getting glimpses of future became foundation of entire battle system takahashi briefly experimented with a turn based battle system that incorporated feature but it did not work out in a separate issue takahashi decided against a transition between environment and a battle arena as he felt such a transition would negatively interrupt flow of gameplay game features a fully open world which was described by takahashi as overwhelming like an mmorpg describing world size as being roughly equivalent to japanese archipelago scale of world was derived from takahashi s wish to showcase grandeur of experience in addition to this number and length of cutscenes was cut down significantly from those present in xenosaga games with takahashi considering such a development method as having become a dead end wish for an expansive world also became tied up with wish to reward players for exploration which entailed creating of a huge amount of content creation such as items and accessories gameplay was influenced both by previous japanese rpgs and western rpgs when team ran into difficulties takahashi went to nintendo in a deflated state to suggest numerous means of meeting game s projected deadline yamagami rejected all of takahashi s proposals and instead insisted team persist with their vision saying he would persuade nintendo to continue supporting them scenario scenario was created by takahashi yuichiro takeda and yurie hattori takahashi was responsible for creating main concept but as he was going to be director and executive producer he was unable to also take on full script writing duties so he asked takeda to be his partner in creating scenario takeda was a writer for anime who had previously collaborated with takahashi on adaptations of first xenosaga game in addition to writing script for xenosaga i ii nintendo ds remake of xenosaga and its sequel takahashi deliberately chose someone outside video game industry as he wanted a different perspective on story s pacing hattori was brought in during early development stages due to her experience with scenarios for nintendo games which enabled her to look at takahashi and takeda s scenario from an objective viewpoint a key element in scenario was contrasting senses of scale which takahashi described as contrasting realms of micro and macro while main story themes were characters embarking on a great and evolving journey and overcoming a predetermined future despite multiple fantasy elements xenoblade chronicles is based within a science fiction premise although such elements were kept low key during first part of game despite their earlier work together it was first time takahashi and takeda were so intimately involved in a project takeda found working on project more difficult than he initially anticipated his standard writing form was for anime series format which was limited to 20 25 minute episodes with xenoblade chronicles volume of story and writing work was much larger and offered more freedom for dramatic expression conversely his previous experience enabled takahashi to easily plan structure and scheduling for game during initial writing stages takahashi did not give precise instructions to takeda he instead gave a rough outline that they worked on together then they passed developing script between themselves along with producers shingo kawabata and koh kojima to iron out rough elements takahashi compared it to playing a game of catch something he was unused to doing for his game scenarios ending underwent revisions while takahashi and takeda felt they had created a fairly explanatory ending hattori still felt unsatisfied after a second look takahashi and takeda realized that it would appear perplexing for someone outside writing process so they rewrote it to be more player friendly final script contained a large amount of dialogue sheer volume which included dialogue spoken in battle made for a difficult experience while recording due to all effort takahashi was emphatic that as much of it as possible be used although he sometimes felt that there was too much in end some dialogue needed to be cut as testers felt that characters talked too much takahashi s overall writing style was made deliberately more mature and subdued than other games within genre one of elements that was of great concern to both takahashi and takeda was main protagonist shulk takahashi had noticed that in majority of rpgs main protagonist was all too easily disliked even if other characters became fan favorites consequently one of main priorities was to make shulk as appealing as possible to players during this process it was suggested that shulk be a silent protagonist but there was a general wish from staff for him to speak in addition to this takahashi needed to confront problem faced in any rpg with voiced characters which was developing them suitably and writing appropriate dialogue between them companion character riki was cited by takeda as a favorite of his on paper riki sounded an unlikable character but his voice and appearance acted as a counterbalance to his remarks one of scenes where hattori had input was a scene between shulk and fiora which showcased their connection original scene had shulk touching fiora s cheek which felt would look creepy coming out of blue scene was altered so shulk touched her hand instead one of early concepts takeda suggested was that one of main protagonist s party would betray them and become final boss but takahashi rejected this idea as he felt it would run counter to player expectation during course of its development story underwent so many revisions that takahashi forgot what his original concept was although basic framework remained intact throughout music original score for xenoblade chronicles was composed by manami kiyota ace a musical production group composed of tomori kudo hiroyo chico yamanaka and kenji hiramatsu and yoko shimomura as with other parts of development takahashi was deeply involved constantly rejecting pieces due to what he felt was not fitting for game he admitted that this was due to early samples he had given team for his vision for music which they had followed too faithfully for his liking at takahashi s request nobuo uematsu s record label dog ear records assisted with production music team was led by shimomura who was initially very confused by odd naming of tracks along with getting opportunity of using sounds not normally used in compositions in her other projects such as electric guitars kiyota had only previously done superficial work on video game titles she accepted dog ear records offer for her to compose music ace was recommended to takahashi by dog ear records kiyota handled environmental tracks while ace was in charge of battle tracks in addition to other musical pieces team s main goal was to create music that went beyond typical sound of rpgs in hindsight yamanaka attributed harmony of six composers works to takahashi s organization and overall direction final score contained around ninety tracks one of hardest tracks for shimomura was a nine minute track that takahashi requested to match with a movie scene later he said track needed to change midway through essentially necessitating creation of two conjoined themes majority of game s music was written by kiyota and ace with shimomura writing eleven tracks music was recorded at burnish stone recording studios in tokyo chorus work was provided by yamanaka kiyota and masao koori monolith soft xenoblade original soundtrack liner notes in japanese pp 2 3 7 dog ear records 23 june 2010 11 scans retrieved on 10 december 2015 game s ending theme beyond sky was composed by yasunori mitsuda and performed in english by australian singer sarah mitsuda was brought in to music team due to his previous experience with soundtracks of xenogears and first xenosaga game and due to takahashi s long working relationship with him takahashi himself personally wrote original japanese lyrics for track which were translated into english by lisa when mitsuda was contacted project was nearing completion with very little development and composition work left despite this before creating main theme mitsuda asked if he could read script which was much larger than he anticipated track caused much stress to mitsuda who was tasked to create game s most important song which needed to incorporate both diversity of entire rest of soundtrack and mesh with takahashi s grand vision for ending of game an official soundtrack album for game xenoblade original soundtrack was released by dog ear records on 23 june 2010 it entered oricon charts at 80 and remained in charts for five weeks upon release album received praise from critics while multiple critics were surprised that shimomura and mitsuda s contributions were less substantial than originally thought they found majority of music composed by kiyota and ace to be enjoyable beyond sky also received unanimous praise release xenoblade chronicles was announced during e3 2009 its official title and release window were not announced until beginning of 2010 alongside announcement of last story game released in japan on 10 june 2010 over a year after its japanese release it was confirmed for release in european territories under title xenoblade chronicles this version included both english and japanese voice tracks according to adam howden shulk s voice actor he was not given much information prior to his audition and was never given full script during recording according to him translated script needed to be altered as some lines came out as longer or shorter than japanese originals and he was told to give shulk a neutral british accented voice concerning game s localization takahashi stated that while some minor changes were made in english versions of game like some bug fixes minor adjustments to gameplay balance and slight rewriting of some written content none of changes led to any significant differences initially planned for release on 2 september 2011 it was released two weeks early on 19 august in addition to standard edition a special edition with a red wii controller pro was also released it was later re released in europe on wii u s nintendo eshop on 5 august 2015 despite being confirmed for a european release xenoblade chronicles did not have an official confirmation of a north american release additionally although project was announced at e3 2009 finished game was absent altogether from e3 2011 in an interview on french television station mathieu marketing manager of nintendo france stated that nintendo of europe had desired to show game at it but nintendo of america would not allow it sparking speculation that it would not be released in north america in response to this a dedicated fan campaign was launched called operation rainfall its goal was to raise fan awareness of situations felt by three wii rpgs xenoblade chronicles last story and pandora s tower among campaign tactics used by operation rainfall were emails organized campaigns online petitions phone calls and messages on nintendo s facebook and twitter accounts one of most notable efforts was a call to pre order game via original monado beginning of world placeholder on amazon com their efforts resulted in xenoblade chronicles becoming 1 in site s pre order gaming charts beating legend of zelda ocarina of time 3d and playstation 3 bundle for call of duty black ops campaign also received support from mistwalker developers of last story and xenogears and xenosaga writer soraya saga takahashi later stated that monolith soft developed game assuming that it would be released overseas in months following these activities nintendo of america officially stated that there were no current plans to release three asked for games in north america despite acknowledging great demand for titles rumors eventually emerged that title would see a north american release when it was listed on website of gaming retailer gamestop soon after this nintendo officially announced that game would be released in region in a 2013 interview nintendo of america president reggie fils aime revealed that nintendo were considering an american release for xenoblade chronicles while operation rainfall was active and that while campaign did not factor into their decision they were aware of it and took it into account while deciding whether release would make a profitable release xenoblade chronicles eventually released in north america on 6 april 2012 it was released in north america as an exclusive to nintendo s american store and gamestop s website and stores eshop version released for north america from 28 april 2016 xenoblade chronicles 3d a port for new nintendo 3ds titled xenoblade chronicles 3d was released worldwide in april 2015 it features streetpass functionality as well as compatibility with shulk amiibo port was originally announced in august 2014 alongside new nintendo 3ds port was co developed by monster games a frequent collaborator with nintendo on well received ports they were requested for job by nintendo as staff at monolith soft were already working on next xenoblade title development on port started between autumn and winter 2013 initially for original nintendo 3ds but initial testing showed that original platform lacked memory and power to effectively run game since wii s processing capabilities were greater than regular 3ds hearing about new 3ds it was decided to use its increased processing power to realize game s ambition its increased power made port possible and its button layout with inclusion of zl and zr shoulder buttons and c stick meant that original wii classic controller button layout could be used without adjustment as part of alterations made to title much of on screen information was moved down to bottom touch screen so as to de clutter top screen while layout was carefully arranged so as to maintain feel of original as much as possible to maintain frame rate and seamless transitions between environments unspecified technical tricks were used they also worked hard to include 3d capacity despite resultant technical difficulties most difficult part of development was getting game s scale to work within new hardware this entailed creation of a new graphics engine with a custom visibility culling and complex level of detail systems all of environments were rebuilt and optimized for new system while keeping original aesthetic intact reason given for porting game to new 3ds rather than wii u home console was that length of game could be intimidating for modern gamer who was becoming more used to on go quick gaming sessions
