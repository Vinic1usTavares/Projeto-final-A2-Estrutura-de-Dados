late night local service was replaced by r which ran as a queens boulevard local at all times f trains were cut back to 57th street on sixth avenue line during late nights in 1986 ta studied which two services should serve line during late nights as ridership at this time did not justify three services a public hearing was held in december 1986 and it was determined that having e and r run during late nights provided best service on december 11 1988 archer avenue lines opened and e was rerouted to its current terminus at jamaica center via queens boulevard line s express tracks e trains began running express east of continental avenue skipping 75th avenue and van wyck boulevard at all times r was extended from continental avenue to 179th street to provide local service this allowed f trains to continue running express to 179th street and f trains skipped 169th street between 10 a m and 3 30 p m during morning rush hour four r trains went into service at continental avenue because local ridership from 179th street during rush hours did not warrant it all r trains went to 179th street during afternoon rush to avoid taking loaded r trains out of service at continental avenue two service plans were identified prior to a public hearing on february 25 1988 concerning service plan for new extension first would have split rush hour e service between two branches with late night service to 179th street provided by r while second would have had all e trains run via archer avenue and would have extended r locals to 179th street a modified version of second plan was decided upon some e trains would run from 179th street instead of archer avenue during morning rush hours though all e trains would run to archer avenue during afternoon rush hour to reduce confusion for queens bound riders 1988 changes angered some riders because they resulted in loss of direct queens boulevard express service at local stations east of 71st avenue namely 169th street sutphin boulevard van wyck boulevard and 75th avenue stations local elected officials pressured mta to eliminate all local service at these stations as part of service cuts on september 30 1990 r was cut back to 71st continental avenue outside of rush hours local service to 179th street was replaced by f trains which provided queens boulevard express service during middays evenings and weekends late night r service became a shuttle between 36th street fourth avenue and bay ridge 95th street in brooklyn and service along queens boulevard to 179th street was replaced by g service in 1992 mta considered three options to improve service at these local stops including leaving service as is having e trains run local east of 71st avenue along with r service and having f trains run local east of 71st avenue replacing r service which would be cut back to 71st avenue at all times third option was chosen to be tested for six months starting in october or november 1992 on october 26 1992 r trains were cut back to 71st avenue at all times and in its place f ran local east of 71st avenue at all times thus eliminating express service along hillside avenue after six months change was kept because there was minimal negative passenger reaction and because of intensity of request even though 77 of passengers had benefited from pre october 1992 service plan change increased travel time along f by 3 5 minutes and reduced travel time for passengers at local stations by one to two minutes div class thumb tright file rr train yellow diamond svg div class 1979 1985 rr nassau bullet style width 80px

trains could terminate more quickly at 36th street fourth avenue their northern terminal previously northbound b n and r trains had stopped at same track at 36th street which resulted in delays because it took several minutes for r trains to be cleared on september 11 2001 after attack on world trade center bmt broadway line was damaged and r service was cut back to run only south of court street on september 17 r service was completely suspended being replaced with service in brooklyn and service in manhattan and queens all three trains returned to normal service by october 28 on september 8 2002 coney island stillwell avenue was closed for reconstruction as a result late night r service was extended to pacific street running express between that station and 36th street fourth avenue service was cut back to 36th street fourth avenue when north side of manhattan bridge reopened on february 22 2004 2010s changes after hurricane sandy flooded subway system montague street tunnel was completely flooded when service was restored r train was split into two sections between forest hills and 34th street herald square at all times except late nights and between jay street metrotech and bay ridge 95th street at all times on december 4 queens manhattan section was extended to whitehall street south ferry on december 21 full service was restored between manhattan and brooklyn after montague street tubes were drained however from august 2 2013 to fall 2014 tunnel was closed again so that extra repairs could be completed bringing back similar storm changes to r

train ran its full route via manhattan bridge skipping all stations between canal street and dekalb avenue weekday service between forest hills and whitehall street essentially recreated former ee route from 1967 to 1976 originally slated to open by october 2014 tunnel re opened a few weeks early on september 15 2014 and several million dollars under budget on june 16 2016 it was announced that late night r service would be extended north to whitehall street in order to provide a one seat ride into manhattan this eliminated need for northbound trains to skip 45th street and 53rd street as r trains no longer needed to reverse on express tracks at 36th street fourth avenue change took place on november 5 2016 during evenings many r trains originating from forest hills 71st avenue used to short turn at whitehall street resulting in long headways along r in brooklyn as part of changes these short turns were replaced by full length trips to 95th street starting november 6 2017 one northbound r trip was diverted to serve then new second avenue subway in order to increase service on that line during morning rush hour in february 2019 in midst of a transit crisis several bay ridge politicians proposed splitting r route in half similar to pattern enacted during montague street tunnel closures in 2013 and 2014 citing route s length and unreliability this proposal has been met
