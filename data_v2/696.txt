police department to register with a union police commissioner edwin u curtis announced that such an act would not be tolerated in august of that year american federation of labor issued a charter to boston police union curtis declared union s leaders were guilty of insubordination and would be relieved of duty but indicated he would cancel their suspension if union was dissolved by september 4 mayor of boston andrew peters convinced curtis to delay his action for a few days but with no results and curtis suspended union leaders on september 8 following day about three quarters of policemen in boston went on strike coolidge tacitly but fully in support of curtis position closely monitored situation but initially deferred to local authorities he anticipated that only a resulting measure of lawlessness could sufficiently prompt public to understand and appreciate controlling principle that a policeman does not strike that night and next there was sporadic violence and rioting in unruly city peters concerned about sympathy strikes by firemen and others called up some units of massachusetts national guard stationed in boston area pursuant to an old and obscure legal authority and relieved curtis of duty your assertion that commissioner was wrong cannot justify wrong of leaving city unguarded that furnished opportunity criminal element furnished action there is no right to

been placed by constitution and laws of her people telegram from governor calvin coolidge to samuel gompers september 14 1919 coolidge sensing severity of circumstances were then in need of his intervention conferred with crane s operative william butler and then acted he called up more units of national guard restored curtis to office and took personal control of police force curtis

disorder has occurred gompers wrote is due to curtis s order in which right of policemen has been denied coolidge publicly answered gompers s telegram denying any justification whatsoever for strike and his response launched him into national consciousness newspapers across nation picked up on coolidge s statement and he became newest hero to opponents of strike in midst of first red scare many americans were terrified of spread of communist revolution like those that had taken place in russia hungary and germany while coolidge had lost some friends among organized labor conservatives across nation had seen a rising star although he usually acted with deliberation boston police strike gave him a national reputation as a decisive leader and as a strict enforcer of law and order 1919 election thumb right upright coolidge inspects militia in boston police strike coolidge and cox were renominated for their respective offices in 1919 by this time coolidge s supporters especially stearns had publicized his actions in police strike around state and nation and some of coolidge s speeches were published in book form he faced same opponent as in 1918 richard long but this time coolidge defeated him by 125 101 votes more than seven times his margin of victory from a year earlier his actions in police strike combined with massive electoral victory led to suggestions that coolidge run for president in 1920 legislation and vetoes as governor by time coolidge was inaugurated on january 2 1919 first world war had ended and coolidge pushed legislature to give a 100 bonus to massachusetts veterans he also signed a bill reducing work week for women and children from fifty four hours to forty eight saying we must humanize industry or system will break down he signed into law a budget that kept tax rates same while trimming 4 million from expenditures thus allowing state to retire some of its debt coolidge also wielded veto pen as governor his most publicized veto prevented an increase in legislators pay by 50 although coolidge was personally opposed to prohibition he vetoed a bill in may 1920 that would have allowed sale of beer or wine of 2 75 alcohol or less in massachusetts in violation of eighteenth amendment to united states constitution opinions and instructions do not outmatch constitution he said in his veto message against it they are void vice presidency 1920 election at 1920 republican national convention most of delegates were selected by state party caucuses not primaries as such field was divided among many local favorites coolidge was one such candidate and while he placed as high as sixth in voting powerful party bosses running convention primarily party s us senators never considered him seriously after ten ballots bosses and then delegates settled on senator warren g harding of ohio as their nominee for president when time came to select a vice presidential nominee bosses also made and announced their decision on whom they wanted sen irvine of wisconsin and then prematurely departed after his name was put forth relying on rank and file to confirm their decision a delegate from oregon wallace having read have faith in massachusetts proposed coolidge for vice president instead suggestion caught on quickly with masses starving for an act of independence from absent bosses and coolidge was unexpectedly nominated democrats nominated another ohioan james m cox for president and assistant secretary of navy franklin d roosevelt for vice president question of united states joining league of nations was a major issue in campaign as was unfinished legacy of progressivism harding ran a front porch campaign from his home in marion ohio but coolidge took to campaign trail in upper south new york and new england his audiences carefully limited to those familiar with coolidge and those placing a premium upon concise and short speeches on november 2 1920 harding and coolidge were victorious in a landslide winning more than 60 percent of popular vote including every state outside south they also won in tennessee first time a republican ticket had won a southern state since reconstruction silent cal thumb president harding and vice president coolidge with their wives us vice presidency did not carry many official duties but coolidge was invited by president harding to attend cabinet meetings making him first vice president to do so he gave a number of unremarkable speeches around country as us vice president coolidge and his vivacious wife grace were invited to quite a few parties where legend of silent cal was born it is from this time that most of jokes and anecdotes involving coolidge originate although coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker in private he was a man of few words and was commonly referred to as silent cal an apocryphal story has it that a person seated next to him at a dinner said to him i made a bet today that i could get more than two words out of you he replied you lose however on april 22 1923 coolidge himself said that you lose quotation never occurred story about it was related by frank b noyes president of associated press to their membership at their annual luncheon at waldorf astoria hotel when toasting and introducing coolidge who was invited speaker after introduction and before his prepared remarks coolidge said to membership your president referring to noyes has given you a perfect example of one of those rumors now current in washington which is without any foundation dorothy parker upon learning that coolidge had died reportedly remarked how can they tell coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable washington society when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties he replied got to eat somewhere alice roosevelt longworth a leading republican wit underscored coolidge s silence and his dour personality when he wished he were elsewhere he pursed his lips folded his arms and said nothing he looked then precisely as though he had been weaned on a pickle as president coolidge s reputation as a quiet man continued words of a president have an enormous weight he would later write and ought not to be used indiscriminately coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation indeed he cultivated it i think american people want a solemn ass as a president he once told ethel barrymore and i think i will go along with them some historians suggest that coolidge s image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural deepening after death of his son in 1924 presidency on august 2 1923 president harding died unexpectedly from a heart attack in san francisco while on a speaking tour of western united states vice president coolidge was in vermont visiting his family home which had neither electricity nor a telephone when he received word by messenger of harding s death new president dressed said a prayer and came downstairs to greet reporters who had assembled his father a notary public and justice of peace administered oath of office in family s parlor by light of a kerosene lamp at 2 47 a m on august 3 1923 president coolidge then went back to bed coolidge returned to washington next day and was sworn in again by justice adolph a hoehling jr of supreme court of district of columbia to forestall any questions about authority of a state official to administer a federal oath this second oath taking remained a secret until it was revealed by harry m daugherty in 1932 and confirmed by hoehling when hoehling confirmed daugherty s story he indicated that daugherty then serving as united states attorney general asked him to administer oath without fanfare at willard hotel according to hoehling he did not question daugherty s reason for requesting a second oath taking but assumed it was to resolve any doubt about whether first swearing in was valid thumb president coolidge signing appropriation bills for veterans bureau on south lawn during garden party for wounded veterans june 5 1924 general john j pershing is at left man at right looking on appears to be veterans bureau director frank t hines nation initially did not know what to make of coolidge who had maintained a low profile in harding administration many had even expected him to be replaced on ballot in 1924 coolidge believed that those of harding s men under suspicion were entitled to every presumption of innocence taking a methodical approach to scandals principally teapot dome scandal while others clamored for rapid punishment of those they presumed guilty coolidge thought senate investigations of scandals would suffice this was affirmed by resulting resignations of those involved he personally intervened in demanding resignation of attorney general harry m daugherty after he refused to cooperate with congressional probe he then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in administration arranging for a full briefing on wrongdoing harry a slattery reviewed facts with him harlan f stone analyzed legal aspects for him and senator william e borah assessed and presented political factors coolidge addressed congress when it reconvened on december 6 1923 giving a speech that supported many of harding s policies including harding s formal budgeting process enforcement of immigration restrictions and arbitration of coal strikes ongoing in pennsylvania coolidge s speech was first presidential speech to be broadcast over radio washington naval treaty was proclaimed just one month into coolidge s term and was generally well received in country in may 1924 world war i veterans world war adjusted compensation act or bonus bill was passed over his veto coolidge signed immigration act later that year which was aimed at restricting southern and eastern european immigration but appended a signing statement expressing his unhappiness with bill s specific exclusion of japanese immigrants just before republican convention began coolidge signed into law revenue act of 1924 which reduced top marginal tax rate from 58 to 46 as well as personal income tax rates across board increased estate tax and bolstered it with a new gift tax on june 2 1924 coolidge signed act granting citizenship to all native americans born in united states by that time two thirds of people were already citizens

electoral vote results republican convention was held on june 10 12 1924 in cleveland ohio coolidge was nominated on first ballot convention nominated frank lowden of illinois for vice president on second ballot but he declined former brigadier general charles g dawes was nominated on third ballot and accepted democrats held their convention next month in new york city convention soon deadlocked and after 103 ballots delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate john w davis with charles w bryan nominated for vice president democrats hopes were buoyed when robert m la follette sr a republican senator from wisconsin split from gop to form a new progressive party many believed that split in republican party like one in 1912 would allow a democrat to win presidency after conventions and death of his younger son calvin coolidge became withdrawn he later said that when he son died power and glory of presidency went with him even as he mourned coolidge ran his standard campaign not mentioning his opponents by name or them and delivering speeches on his theory of government including several that were broadcast over radio it was most subdued campaign since 1896 partly because of coolidge s grief but also because of his naturally non confrontational style other candidates campaigned in a more modern fashion but despite split in republican party results were similar to those of 1920 coolidge and dawes won every state outside south except wisconsin la follette s home state coolidge won election with 382 electoral votes and popular vote by 2 5 million over his opponents combined total industry and trade it is probable that a press which maintains an intimate touch with business currents of nation is likely to be more reliable than it would be if it were a stranger to these influences after all chief business of american people is business they are profoundly concerned with buying selling investing and prospering in world emphasis added president calvin coolidge s address to american society of newspaper editors washington d c january 25 1925 during coolidge s presidency united states experienced a period of rapid economic growth known as roaring twenties he left administration s industrial policy in hands of his activist secretary of commerce herbert hoover who energetically used government auspices to promote business efficiency and develop airlines and radio coolidge disdained regulation and demonstrated this by appointing commissioners to federal trade commission and interstate commerce commission who did little to restrict activities of businesses under their jurisdiction regulatory state under coolidge was as one biographer described it thin to point of invisibility historian robert sobel offers some context of coolidge s laissez faire ideology based on prevailing understanding of federalism during his presidency as governor of massachusetts coolidge supported wages and hours legislation opposed child labor imposed economic controls during world war i favored safety measures in factories and even worker representation on corporate boards did he support these measures while president no because in 1920s such matters were considered responsibilities of state and local governments taxation and government spending coolidge adopted taxation policies of his secretary of treasury andrew mellon who advocated scientific taxation notion that lowering taxes will increase rather than decrease government receipts congress agreed and tax rates were reduced in coolidge s term in addition to federal tax cuts coolidge proposed reductions in federal expenditures and retiring of federal debt coolidge s ideas were shared by republicans in congress and in 1924 congress passed revenue act of 1924 which reduced income tax rates and eliminated all income taxation for some two million people they reduced taxes again by passing revenue acts of 1926 and 1928 all while continuing to keep spending down so as to reduce overall federal debt by 1927 only wealthiest 2 of taxpayers paid any federal income tax federal spending remained flat during coolidge s administration allowing one fourth of federal debt to be retired in total state and local governments saw considerable growth however surpassing federal budget in 1927 by 1929 after coolidge s series of tax rate reductions had cut tax rate to 24 percent on those making over 100 000 federal government collected more than a billion dollars in income taxes of which 65 percent was collected from those making over 100 000 in 1921 when tax rate on people making over 100 000 a year was 73 percent federal government collected a little over 700 million in income taxes of which 30 percent was paid by those making over 100 000 opposition to farm subsidies thumb upright coolidge with his vice president charles g dawes perhaps most contentious issue of coolidge s presidency was relief for farmers some in congress proposed a bill designed to fight falling agricultural prices by allowing federal government to purchase crops to sell abroad at lower prices agriculture secretary henry c wallace and other administration officials favored bill when it was introduced in 1924 but rising prices convinced many in congress that bill was unnecessary and it was defeated just before elections that year in 1926 with farm prices falling once more senator charles l mcnary and representative gilbert n haugen both republicans proposed mcnary haugen farm relief bill bill proposed a federal farm board that would purchase surplus production in high yield years and hold it when feasible for later sale or sell it abroad coolidge opposed mcnary haugen declaring that agriculture must stand on an independent business basis and said that government control cannot be divorced from political control instead of manipulating prices he favored instead herbert hoover s proposal to increase profitability by modernizing agriculture secretary mellon wrote a letter denouncing mcnary haugen measure as unsound and likely to cause inflation and it was defeated after mcnary haugen s defeat coolidge supported a less radical measure curtis crisp act which would have created a federal board to lend money to farm co operatives in times of surplus bill did not pass in february 1927 congress took up mcnary haugen bill again this time narrowly passing it and coolidge vetoed it in his veto message he expressed belief that bill would do nothing to help farmers benefiting only exporters and expanding federal bureaucracy congress did not override veto but it passed bill again in may 1928 by an increased majority again coolidge vetoed it farmers never have made much money said coolidge vermont farmer s son i do not believe we can do much about it flood control coolidge has often been criticized for his actions during great mississippi flood of 1927 worst natural disaster to hit gulf coast until hurricane katrina in 2005 although he did eventually name secretary hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief scholars argue that coolidge overall showed a lack of interest in federal flood control coolidge did not believe that personally visiting region after floods would accomplish anything and that it would be seen as mere political grandstanding he also did not want to incur federal spending that flood control would require he believed property owners should bear much of cost on other hand congress wanted a bill that would place federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation when congress passed a compromise measure in 1928 coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed bill in private on may 15 civil rights thumb right osage men with coolidge after he signed bill granting native americans u s citizenship according to one biographer coolidge was devoid of racial prejudice but rarely took lead on civil rights coolidge disliked ku klux klan and no klansman is known to have received an appointment from him in 1924 presidential election his opponents robert la follette and john davis and his running mate charles dawes often attacked klan but coolidge avoided subject coolidge spoke in favor of civil rights of african americans saying in his first state of union address that their rights were just as sacred as those of any other citizen under u s constitution and that it was a public and a private duty to protect those rights s calvin coolidge s first state of union address coolidge repeatedly called for laws to make lynching a federal crime it was already a state crime though not always enforced congress refused to pass any such legislation on june 2 1924 coolidge signed indian citizenship act which granted u s citizenship to all american indians living on reservations those off reservations had long been citizens on june 6 1924 coolidge delivered a commencement address at historically black non segregated howard university in which he thanked and commended african americans for their rapid advances in education and their contributions to us society over years as well as their eagerness to render their services as soldiers in world war all while being faced with discrimination and prejudices at home in a speech in october 1924 coolidge stressed tolerance of differences as an american value and thanked immigrants for their contributions to u s society saying that they have contributed much to making our country what it is he stated that although diversity of peoples was a detrimental source of conflict and tension in europe it was peculiar for united states that it was a harmonious benefit for country coolidge further stated united states should assist and help immigrants who come to country and urged immigrants to reject race hatreds and prejudices foreign policy thumb official portrait of calvin coolidge coolidge was neither well versed in nor very interested in world affairs his focus was directed mainly at american business especially pertaining to trade and maintaining status quo although not an isolationist he was reluctant to enter into foreign alliances coolidge considered 1920 republican victory as a rejection of wilsonian position that united states should join league of nations while not completely opposed to idea coolidge believed league as then constituted did not serve american interests and he did not advocate u s membership he spoke in favor of united states joining permanent court of international justice world court provided that nation would not be bound by advisory decisions in 1926 senate eventually approved joining court with reservations league of nations accepted reservations but it suggested some modifications of its own senate failed to act and so united states did not join world court coolidge authorized dawes plan a financial plan by charles dawes to provide germany partial relief from its reparations obligations from world war i plan initially provided stimulus for german economy additionally coolidge attempted to pursue further curbs on naval strength following early successes of harding s washington naval conference by sponsoring geneva naval conference in 1927 which failed owing to a french and italian boycott and ultimate failure of great britain and united states to agree on cruiser tonnages as a result conference was a failure and congress eventually authorized for increased american naval spending in 1928 kellogg briand pact of 1928 named for coolidge s secretary of state frank b kellogg and french foreign minister aristide briand was also a key peacekeeping initiative treaty ratified in 1929 committed signatories united states united kingdom france germany italy and japan to renounce war as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another treaty did not achieve its intended result outlawry of war but it did provide founding principle for international law after world war ii coolidge also continued previous administration s policy of withholding recognition of soviet union efforts were made to normalize ties with post revolution mexico coolidge recognized mexico s new governments under alvaro obregon and plutarco elias calles and continued american support for elected mexican government against national league for defense of religious liberty during war lifting arms embargo on that country he also appointed dwight morrow as ambassador to mexico with successful objective to avoid further american conflict with mexico coolidge s administration would see continuity in occupation of nicaragua and haiti and an end to occupation of dominican republic in 1924 as a result of withdrawal agreements finalized during harding s administration in 1925 coolidge ordered withdrawal of marines stationed in nicaragua following perceived stability after 1924 nicaraguan general election but redeployed them there in january 1927 following failed attempts to peacefully resolve rapid deterioration of political stability and avert ensuing constitutionalist war henry l stimson was later sent by coolidge to mediate a peace deal that would end civil war and extend american military presence in nicaragua beyond coolidge s term in office to extend an olive branch to latin american leaders embittered over america s interventionist policies in central america and caribbean coolidge
