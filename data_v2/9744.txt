espenson and she was thrilled to get it as she wanted to explore character in his own story she elaborated that jiminy is actor raphael sbarge became attracted to join series because he would effectively be helping tell two stories one in a fantasy world and other in a modern setting in an interview with hollywood reporter sbarge compared once upon a time to television series lost in that they have a large ensemble and what they do is that they take a few characters and they kind of take them effectively on a deep dive when sbarge read script for that still small voice he was worried about treading into people s imaginations but ultimately decided that they cast me for a reason because there are some qualities in me that they obviously recognize for story they want to tell believing that his character was sort of a surrogate father figure to henry sbarge admitted that script made me weep because what they came up with is so lovely and magical and delightful referring to his character s storyline as a hero s journey sbarge said intention was to show that jiminy cricket did not just begin as a noble guy what you get to see on this trip are fire rings he had to walk

satisfying hour of television deepening our understanding of archie jiminy s character and giving us some welcome development in mary margaret and david s tragic romance i don t know about you but i really could watch a whole hour of those two playing hangman and innocently flirting and need nothing else from show entertainment weekly columnist murphy wrote that while she ragged on robert carlyle initially his campy is quickly becoming one of my favorite parts of this show tor com s teresa jusino called espenson s script so engaging because it deviated from series typical two story format and incorporated a third separate modern storyline that featured other characters in addition to jiminy cricket in which each storyline got just enough attention she added that episode s best parts were its intimate character moments particularly scenes between archie jiminy and boys in his life and attributed this to espenson s strength as a writer jusino felt another highlight was sbarge s performance as he navigated both archie and jiminy s journeys from being pawns to being their own men with precision and warmth oliver sava of a v club graded episode with a c he criticized gilmore s performance in that still small voice and earlier episodes writing that gilmore struggles to make a connection with his character so it always looks like he s reading lines which might have a negative effect on henry s character development sava felt that espenson based on her previous work was good at balancing large casts and wrote this episode juggles expansive character roster of this series better than its predecessors conversely ign s amy ratcliffe said she has never liked henry as much as i did in this episode especially his explanation to archie on why he is jiminy cricket ratcliffe added that jiminy had most touching backstory of season up to that point opining that transformation of dr hopper was moving and this episode maybe felt most like a fairytale of stories we ve seen so far she graded that still small voice with 8 out of 10 an indication of a great episode notes references external links category 2011 american television episodes category once upon a time season 1
