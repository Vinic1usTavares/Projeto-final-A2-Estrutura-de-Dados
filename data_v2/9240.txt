first half of die another day is classic bond but that things start to go downhill when ice palace gets introduced first 20 minutes of die another day was regarded as much closer to grimmer post 9 11 bond played by daniel craig pierce brosnan s successor as actor portraying james bond and able to go toe to toe with darkest moments in franchise history some reviewers felt film relied too heavily on gadgets and special effects with plot being neglected james berardinelli of reelviews net said this is a train wreck of an action film a stupefying attempt by filmmakers to force feed james bond into mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs of action sequences he said die another day is an exercise in loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects cgi work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything i have seen in a major motion picture coupled with lousy production design die another day looks like it was done on cheap gary brown of houston community newspapers also described weak point of film as seemingly non stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while bond character is almost relegated to second string roger moore who played bond in earlier films said i thought it just went too far and that s from me first bond in space invisible cars and dodgy cgi footage please amount of product placement in film was a point of criticism with bbc time and reuters all using pun buy another day to refer to film by choice number of companies involved in product placement was dropped to eight for next bond film casino royale in 2006 media die another day was novelised by then official james bond writer raymond benson based on screenplay by neal purvis and robert wade an effort is made to depict some of film s more outlandish elements with more believability in style of fleming s original novels use of cutting edge technology so for example non bodywork elements of aston martin with its cloaking function glass windows and rubber tyres are described as having retractable covers to achieve invisibility effect fan reaction to it was above average after its publication benson retired as official james bond novelist and a new series featuring secret agent s adventures as a teenager by charlie higson was launched in 2005 as novelisation was published
