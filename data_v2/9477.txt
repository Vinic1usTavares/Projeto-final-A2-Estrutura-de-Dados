all their electoral votes to whichever presidential candidate wins overall popular vote in 50 states and district of columbia compact is designed to ensure that candidate who receives most votes nationwide is elected president and it would come into effect only when it would guarantee that outcome it has been adopted by states and district of columbia together they have electoral votes which is of electoral college and of 270 votes needed to give compact legal force mechanism proposed in form of an interstate compact agreement would go into effect among participating states in compact only after they collectively represent an absolute majority of votes currently at least 270 in electoral college in next presidential election after adoption by requisite number of states participating states would award all of their electoral votes to candidate with largest national popular vote total across 50 states and district of columbia as a result that candidate would win presidency by securing a majority of votes in electoral college until compact s conditions are met all states award electoral votes in their current manner compact would modify way participating states implement article ii section 1 clause 2 of u s constitution which requires each state legislature to define a method to appoint its electors to vote in electoral college constitution does not mandate any particular legislative scheme for selecting electors and instead vests state legislatures with exclusive power to choose how to allocate their states electors although systems that violate 14th amendment which mandates equal protection of law and prohibits racial discrimination would be prohibited mcpherson v blacker states have chosen various methods of allocation over years with regular changes in nation s early decades today all but two states maine and nebraska award all their electoral votes to single candidate with most votes statewide so called winner take all system maine and nebraska currently award one electoral vote to winner in each congressional district and their remaining two electoral votes to state wide winner motivation elections in which popular vote winner 9 113 4 157 7 26 9 9 4 034 9 4 288 5461 2 81 8 8 5 443 6 5 534 7 79 3 9 50 456 4 50 999 7 51 2 1 62 984 2 65 853 7 55 7 reasons given for compact include current electoral college system allows a candidate to win presidency while losing popular vote as happened in elections of 1824 1876 1888 2000 and 2016 1960 election is also a disputed example in 2000 election for instance al gore won 543 895 more votes nationally than george w bush but bush secured 5 more electors than gore in part due to a narrow bush victory in florida in 2016 election hillary clinton won 2 868 691 more votes nationally than donald trump but trump secured 77 more electors than clinton in part due to narrow trump victories in michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin a cumulative 77 744 votes state winner take all laws encourage candidates to focus disproportionately on a limited set of swing states and in case of maine and nebraska swing districts as small changes in popular vote in those areas produce large changes in electoral college vote for example in 2016 election a shift of 2 736 votes or less than 0 4 of all votes cast toward donald trump in new hampshire would have produced a 4 electoral vote gain for his campaign a similar shift in any other state would have produced no change in electoral vote thus encouraging campaign to focus on new hampshire above other states a study by fairvote reported that 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of their peak season campaign resources to just five states while other 45 states received very little attention report also stated that 18 states received no candidate visits and no tv advertising this means that swing state issues receive more attention while issues important to other states are largely ignored state winner take all laws tend to decrease voter turnout in states without close races voters living outside swing states have a greater certainty of which candidate is likely to win their state this knowledge of probable outcome decreases their incentive to vote a report by committee for study of american electorate found that 2004 voter turnout in competitive swing states grew by 6 3 from previous presidential election compared to an increase of only 3 8 in noncompetitive states a report by center for information and research on civic learning and engagement circle found that turnout among eligible voters under age 30 was 64 4 in ten closest battleground states and only 47 6 in rest of 17 gap debate project has been supported by editorials in newspapers including new york times chicago sun times los angeles times boston globe and minneapolis star tribune arguing that existing system discourages voter turnout and leaves emphasis on only a few states and a few issues while a popular election would equalize voting power others have argued against it including honolulu star bulletin an article by pete du pont a former governor of delaware in opinion section of wall street journal has called project an urban power grab that would shift politics entirely to urban issues in high population states and allow lower caliber candidates to run a collection of readings pro and con has been assembled by league of women voters some of major points of debate are detailed below protective function of electoral college opponents of a national popular vote contend that electoral college serves to protect country from election of a person who is unfit to be president certain founders conceived of electoral college as a deliberative body which would weigh inputs of states but not be bound by them in selecting president however electoral college has never served such a role in practice from 1796 onward presidential electors have acted as rubber stamps for their parties nominees as of 2016 no election outcome has been determined by an elector deviating from will of their state and twenty nine states and district of columbia have laws punishing such faithless electors moreover national popular interstate compact does not eliminate electoral college or affect faithless elector laws it merely changes way in which electors are pledged by participating states campaign focus advertising and visits by major party candidates during final stretch of 2004 presidential campaign sept 26 nov 2 2004 spending on advertising per capita campaign visits per 1 million residents 220px under current system campaign focus in terms of spending visits and attention paid to regional or state issues is largely limited to few swing states whose electoral outcomes are competitive with politically solid states mostly ignored by campaigns adjacent maps illustrate amount spent on advertising and number of visits to each state relative to population by two major party candidates in last stretch of 2004 presidential campaign supporters of compact contend that a national popular vote would encourage candidates to campaign with equal effort for votes in competitive and non competitive states alike critics of compact argue that candidates would have less incentive to focus on states with smaller populations or fewer urban areas and would thus be less motivated to address rural issues disputed results and electoral fraud opponents of compact have raised concerns about handling of close or disputed outcomes national popular vote contends that election being decided on basis of a disputed tally is far less likely under npvic which creates one large nationwide pool of voters than under current system in which national winner may be determined by an extremely small margin in any one of fifty one smaller statewide tallies however it is possible for national popular vote to be closer than vote tally within any one state in event of an exact tie in nationwide tally npvic member states will award their electors to winner of popular vote in their state under npvic each state will continue to handle disputes and statewide recounts as governed by their own laws npvic does not include any provision for a nationwide recount though congress has authority to create such a provision pete du pont argues that in 2000 mr gore s 540 000 vote margin amounted to 3 1 votes in each of country s 175 000 precincts finding three votes per precinct in urban areas is not a difficult thing however national popular vote contends that electoral fraud affecting outcome would be more difficult to achieve under a national popular vote than under current system because of greater number of votes that would likely need to be shifted under current system a close election may be determined by outcome in just one tipping point state margin of which is likely to be far smaller than nationwide margin this is due to smaller pool of voters at state level and fact that several states may have close results suggested partisan advantage some supporters and opponents of npvic believe it gives one party an advantage relative to current electoral college system former delaware governor pete du pont a republican has argued that compact would be an urban power grab and benefit democrats however saul former chairman of michigan republican party wrote that republicans need compact citing what he believes to be center right nature of american electorate a statistical analysis by fivethirtyeight s nate silver of all presidential elections from 1864 to 2016 see adjacent chart found that electoral college has not consistently favored one major party or other and that any advantage in electoral college does not tend to last long noting that there s almost no correlation between which party has electoral college advantage in one election and which has it four years later although in all four elections since 1876 in which winner lost popular vote republican became president silver s analysis shows that such splits are about equally likely to favor either major party a popular vote electoral college split favoring democrat john kerry nearly occurred in 2004 new yorker essayist hendrik hertzberg also concluded that npvic would benefit neither party noting that historically both republicans and democrats have been successful in winning popular vote in presidential elections state power relative to population thumb right upright 2 state population per electoral vote from 2010 census there is some debate over whether electoral college favors small or large population states those who argue that college favors low population states point out that such states have proportionally more electoral votes relative to their populations in least populous states with three electors this results in voters having 143 greater voting power than they would under purely proportional allocation while in most populous state california voters power is 16 smaller than under proportional allocation npvic would give equal weight to each voter s ballot regardless of what state they live in others however believe that since most states award electoral votes on a winner takes all system unit rule potential of populous states to shift greater numbers of electoral votes gives them more clout than would otherwise be expected negation of state level majorities two governors who have vetoed npvic legislation arnold schwarzenegger of california and linda lingle of hawaii both in 2007 objected to compact on grounds that it could require their states electoral votes to be awarded to a candidate who did not win a majority in their state both states have since enacted laws joining compact supporters of compact counter that under a national popular vote system state level majorities are irrelevant in any state votes contribute to nationwide tally which determines winner preferences of individual voters are thus paramount while state level majorities are an obsolete intermediary measure legality constitutionality compact clause compact clause of article i section x of u s constitution decrees that no state shall without consent of congress enter into any agreement or compact with another state in a report released in october 2019 congressional research service crs cited u s supreme court s ruling in virginia v tennessee 1893 reaffirmed in u s steel corp v multistate tax commission 1978 and cuyler v adams 1981 which states that explicit congressional consent of interstate compacts is not required for agreements which united states can have no possible objection or have any interest in interfering with however explicit congressional consent of interstate compacts is required when underlying compact is directed to formation of any combination tending to increase of political power in states which may encroach upon or interfere with just supremacy of united states meaning where vertical balance of power between federal government and state governments is altered in favor of state governments crs report states that whether npv initiative requires congressional consent under compact clause first requires a determination as to whether npv even constitutes an interstate compact yale law school professor akhil amar one of compact s framers has argued that because npvic does not create a new interstate governmental apparatus and because cooperating states acting together would be exercising no more power than they are entitled to wield individually npvic probably does not constitute an interstate compact conversely crs report states that opinion in northeast bancorp v federal reserve board of governors 1985 suggests that a requirement of a new interstate governmental entity is a sufficient but not a necessary condition to qualify an agreement as being an interstate compact under compact clause instead crs report cites court s opinion in virginia v tennessee as stating that words compacts and agreements are synonyms and in conjunction with court s opinion in northeast bancorp v federal reserve board of governors 1985 also cites court s opinion as stating that any agreement between two or more states that cover s all stipulations affecting conduct or claims of parties that prohibit states from modify ing or repeal ing agreement unilaterally and requires of mutual obligations under agreement constitutes an interstate compact and crs report notes that npvic meets all of those requirements in addition to concerns about vertical balances of power crs report cites supreme court s rulings in florida v georgia 1855 and in texas v new mexico and colorado 2018 as recognizing that explicit congressional consent of interstate compacts under compact clause is also required for interstate compacts that alter horizontal balance of power amongst state governments university of colorado law school professor jennifer s hendricks has argued that npvic would not alter power of non compacting state governments because all state governments would retain their right to select electors of their choosing additionally bloomberg law editor michael brody has argued that role of electors has yet to be defined by a court and cites supreme court ruling in ray v blair 1952 as suggesting that 12th amendment does not require that electors must vote for candidate whom they are pledged to and that because npvic only binds state legislatures and not electors those electors would retain independent withdrawal power as faithless electors at request of compacting states unless compacting states adopt criminal penalties or other statutes that bind electors which 10 of 15 states that have enacted npvic as well as district of columbia currently do in addition to 19 other states other legal scholars have argued that power of non compacting states would be altered because under npvic a state s power in determining outcomes of presidential elections would be changed from percentage of electors it has in electoral college to state s percentage of popular vote rendering right of non compacting state governments to appoint their own electors moot additionally ian j drake an associate professor of political science and law at montclair state university has argued that because supreme court has held in cuyler v adams that congressional approval of interstate compacts makes them federal laws if u s congress is required to approve npvic because of a horizontal balance of power shift congressional passage of such a law would be in violation of supremacy clause of article vi because under article i section viii and 12th amendment congress has no enumerated or implied powers to alter presidential election process except as outlined in article v as part of constitutional amendment process labor lawyer bradley t and organizers of npv inc dispute drake s conclusion and npv inc organizers have stated that they plan to seek congressional approval if compact is approved by a sufficient number of states citing drake crs report concludes that if npvic were to be enacted by necessary number of states it would likely become source of considerable litigation and it is likely that supreme court will be involved in any resolution of constitutional issues surrounding it contingent elections clause at least two legal scholars have suggested that npvic would require explicit congressional approval because npvic would remove possibility of contingent elections for president being conducted by u s house of representatives under 12th amendment crs report notes that only two presidential elections 1800 and 1824 have been determined by a contingent election and whether loss of such elections would be a de minimis of federal power is unresolved by relevant case law report does reference u s steel corp v multistate tax commission as stating that pertinent inquiry with respect to compact clause is one of potential rather than actual impact on federal supremacy in that potential erosion of an enumerated power of u s house of representatives could arguably require congressional approval proponents of compact counter that if removing possibility of contingent elections is grounds for unconstitutionality then congress setting size of house at an odd number as it did in 1911 resulting in an odd number of electors until 1961 was also unconstitutional see public law 62 5 of 1911 though congress has authority to change that number reapportionment act of 1929 capped size of house at 435 and 23rd amendment to us constitution increased number of electors by 3 to current 538 in 1961 plenary power doctrine proponents of compact such as law professors akhil and vikram amar compact s original framers as well as u s representative jamie raskin from maryland s 8th congressional district a former law professor have argued that state legislatures have plenary power to appoint electors in accordance with national popular vote under elections clause of article ii section i which states that each state shall appoint in such manner as legislature thereof may direct a number of electors equal to whole number of senators and representatives to which state may be entitled in congress vikram amar along with other legal scholars have also cited supreme court s rulings in mcpherson v blacker 1892 and arizona state legislature v arizona independent redistricting commission 2015 as recognizing that states have wide discretion in selecting method by which they appoint their electors however crs report cites supreme court s opinion in mcpherson v blacker as stating that state legislatures have conceded plenary power in matter of appointment of electors and citing court s opinions in williams v rhodes 1968 and oregon v mitchell 1970 that struck down state laws concerning appointment of electors that violated equal protection clause of 14th amendment crs report concludes that a state s power to select method by which its electors are appointed is not absolute robert a senior fellow at libertarian independence institute in constitutional jurisprudence and a member of conservative american legislative exchange council s board of scholars has also argued that a state legislature s power to appoint its electors cannot be absolute because otherwise states would be permitted to appoint their electors in a manner that would violate public trust e g by holding an auction to sell their electoral votes to highest bidder additionally crs report notes that while court s opinion in mcpherson v blacker emphasized that variety of state laws that existed shortly after ratification of constitution indicates that state legislatures have multiple alternative modes of choosing electors court did not identify selecting electors in accordance with results of national popular vote as one of them because according to crs report there appears to be no evidence contemporaneous with ratification of constitution of a state selecting its electors in such a manner and crs report cites court s opinion in u s term limits inc v thornton 1995 as concluding that states cannot exercise their enumerated powers under article i or article ii in a way that would effect a fundamental change in constitutional structure except as outlined in article v as part of constitutional amendment process a view at least three legal scholars have argued applies for npvic voting rights act of 1965 a 2008 columbia law review article by columbia law school student david gringer suggested that npvic could potentially violate sections 2 and 5 of voting rights act of 1965 vra however in 2012 u s justice department civil rights division declined to challenge california s entry into npvic under section 5 of act and october 2019 crs report notes that u s supreme court decision in shelby county v holder 2013 which invalidated section 4 b of vra has rendered section 5 currently inoperable in response to gringer s argument that npvic would violate section 2 of vra fairvote s rob richie says that npvic treats all voters equally and npv inc has stated national popular vote bill manifestly would make every person s vote for president equal throughout united states in an election to fill a single office presidency it is entirely consistent with goal of voting rights act history public support for electoral college reform public opinion surveys suggest that a majority or plurality of americans support a popular vote for president gallup polls dating back to 1944 showed consistent majorities of public supporting a direct vote a 2007 washington post and kaiser family foundation poll found that 72 favored replacing electoral college with a direct election including 78 of democrats 60 of republicans and 73 of independent voters a november 2016 gallup poll following 2016 u s presidential election showed that americans support for amending u s constitution to replace electoral college with a national popular vote fell to 49 with 47 opposed republican support for replacing electoral college with a national popular vote dropped significantly from 54 in 2011 to 19 in 2016 which gallup attributed to a partisan response to 2016 result where republican candidate won electoral college despite losing popular vote in march 2018 a pew research center poll showed that 55 of americans supported replacing electoral college with a national popular vote with 41 opposed but that a partisan divide remained in that support as 75 of self identified democrats supported replacing electoral college with a national popular vote while only 32 of self identified republicans did proposals to abolish electoral college by amendment several proposals to abolish electoral college by constitutional amendment have been introduced in congress over decades these efforts have however been hampered because a two thirds vote in both house and senate are required to send an amendment to states where ratification by three fourths of state legislatures or by conventions in three fourths of states is required for it to become operative interstate compact plan thumb upright 1 5 distribution of electoral votes following 2010 census in 2001 northwestern university law professor robert w bennett suggested a plan in an academic publication to implement a national popular vote through a mechanism that would embrace state legislatures power to appoint electors rather than resist that power by coordinating states constituting a majority of electoral college could effectively implement a popular vote law professors and brothers akhil reed amar and vikram amar defended constitutionality of such a plan they proposed that a group of states through legislation form a compact wherein they agree to give all of their electoral votes to national popular vote winner regardless of balance of votes in their own state these state laws would only be triggered once compact included enough states to control a majority of electoral college 270 votes thus guaranteeing that national popular vote winner would also win electoral college academic plan uses two constitutional features presidential electors clause article 2 section 1 clause 2 which gives each state power to determine manner in which its electors are selected compact clause article i section 10 clause 3 under which it creates an enforceable compact amar brothers noted that such a plan could be enacted by passage of laws in as few as eleven states and would probably not require congressional approval though this is not certain see above organization and advocacy in 2006 john koza a computer science professor at stanford was lead author of every vote equal a book that makes a detailed case for his plan for an interstate compact to establish national popular vote koza had previously had exposure to interstate compacts from his work with state lottery commissions after inventing scratch off lottery ticket that year koza barry fadem and others formed national popular vote a non profit group to promote legislation group has a advisory committee including former us senators jake garn birch bayh and david and former representatives john anderson john buchanan and tom campbell by time of group s opening news conference in february 2006 proposed interstate compact had been introduced in illinois

legislation has been introduced in all 50 states npvic has been adopted by states and district of columbia together they have electoral votes which is of electoral college and of 270 votes needed to

of may 6 2018 prospects nate silver noted in 2014 that all jurisdictions that had adopted compact at that time were blue states and that there were not enough electoral votes from remaining blue states to achieve required majority he concluded that as swing states were unlikely to support a compact that reduces their influence compact could not succeed without adoption by some red states as well republican led chambers have adopted measure in new york 2011 oklahoma 2014 and arizona 2016 and measure has been unanimously approved by republican led committees in georgia and missouri prior
