worrying about chase standings it s only three races in grubb commented on stewart s victory tony was able to get out there in clean air and was able to take off other guys who took two tyres ended up 7th and 9th so tony was able to get that clean air and just take off he did an awesome job today entire pit crew and everybody did an awesome job all day long although he finished seventh martin said he was pleased with result as he was able to keep points lead this is first time we missed it that much in a while there have been times when i was off this much and finish 25th but our team fought
