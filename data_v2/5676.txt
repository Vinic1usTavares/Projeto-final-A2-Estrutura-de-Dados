georgia tech research institute gtri is nonprofit applied research arm of georgia institute of technology in atlanta georgia united states gtri employs around 2 400 people and is involved in approximately 600 million in research annually for more than 200 clients in industry and government initially known as engineering experiment station ees organization was proposed in 1929 by w harry vaughan as an analogue to agricultural experiment stations georgia general assembly passed a law that year creating organization on paper but did not allocate funds to start it to boost state s struggling economy in midst of great depression funds were found and station was finally established with us 5 000 equivalent to in in april 1934 gtri s research spans a variety of disciplines including national defense homeland security public health education mobile and wireless technologies and economic development major customers for gtri research include united states department of defense agencies state of georgia non defense federal agencies and private industry overall contracts and grants from department of defense agencies account for approximately 84 of gtri s total research funding since it was established gtri has expanded its engineering focus to include science economics policy and other areas that leverage gtri s partnership with georgia tech gtri

little state initiative to see school expand significantly until 1919 that year in a move similar to hatch act of 1887 s establishment of agricultural experiment stations federal debate over whether to create engineering experiment stations in a similar manner spurred georgia general assembly to pass an act titled establishing state engineering experiment station at georgia school of technology this station was established with goal of encouragement of industries and commerce within state federal effort ultimately failed and state did not finance organization wallace p 238 in 1929 some georgia tech faculty members belonging to sigma xi started a research club at tech that met once a month mcmath pp 186 one of monthly subjects proposed by w harry vaughan was a collection of issues related to georgia tech such as library development and development of a state engineering station this group investigated forty existing engineering experiment stations at universities around country and a report was compiled by harold bunger montgomery knight and vaughan in december 1929 their report noted that several similar organizations had been opened across country at other engineering schools and were successful in local economic development in 1933 s v sanford president of university of georgia proposed that a technical research activity be established at georgia tech in order to boost state s struggling economy in midst of great depression georgia board of regents provided new engineering experiment station with 5 000 equivalent to in and georgia tech provided infrastructure and personnel station started operation in april 1934 early years thumb left thomas hinman research building built in 1939 and expanded in 1950s alt a black and white photograph of a one story building with windows all along it and a multi story portion of building set further back from road in front of building there are two cars parked on a brick paved road vaughan was selected as engineering experiment station s acting director in april 1934 and hired 13 part time faculty and a few graduate assistants station s initial areas of focus were textiles ceramics and helicopter engineering early work of station was conducted in basement of old shop building next to tech tower and vaughan s office was in aeronautical engineering building mcmath p 187 station s name was technically state engineering experiment station but it was generally referred to as engineering experiment station ees or simply research station by 1938 engineering experiment station was producing useful technology and station needed a method to conduct contract work outside state budget consequently industrial development council idc was formed idc was created as a non profit contract organization for ees which allowed ees to receive federal contracts while still retaining its relationship with georgia tech and state of georgia it was created by chancellor of university system and president of georgia power company and engineering experiment station s director was a member of council idc later became georgia tech research corporation which currently serves as sole contract organization for all georgia tech faculty and departments in addition contract organization manages intellectual property that results from research examples of projects undertaken under vaughan s directorship include montgomery knight s helicopter research georgia economic survey 6 000 equivalent to in in aeronautical research for guggenheim foundation and textile research that created cotton roving and spinning processes that were three to five times faster than contemporary practices vaughan was instrumental in securing a permanent building for station initially known as research building several years later it was expanded and named thomas hinman research building after atlanta dentist and university donor thomas hinman after vaughan left for tennessee valley authority in 1940 harold bunger head of chemistry department took over as acting director however bunger died not long thereafter in august 1941 mcmath p 213 bunger s successor was gerald rosselot who had been appointed assistant director by georgia tech s president in 1940 world war ii thumb right ees researcher jim hubbard with electron microscope alt a black and white photograph of a young man examining a large microscope man has short dark hair is wearing a white shirt and a white lab coat and is holding a smoking pipe in his mouth microscope has a black conical base with three trapezoidal windows and a silver cylindrical body number and value of contracts coming to station significantly increased during world war ii 1943 1944 budget was first in which industry and government contracts exceeded station s other income most notably its state appropriation mcmath p 214 director vaughan had initially prepared faculty for fewer incoming contracts as georgia general assembly had cut station s appropriation by 40 but increased support from industry and government eventually compensated for lower state funding world war ii is credited with gtri s entry into electronics especially telecommunications and electronic warfare electronics and communications work that director rosselot attracted is still a mainstay of gtri research mcmath p 216 two of larger projects were a study on propagation of electromagnetic waves and united states navy sponsored radar research at end of world war ii georgia tech had about 240 000 equivalent to in annually in sponsored research important investments during rosselot s administration at engineering experiment station included purchase of an electron microscope in 1946 for 13 000 equivalent to in first such instrument in southeastern united states and one of few in united states at time research building was expanded and a 300 000 equivalent to in westinghouse a c network calculator was given to georgia tech by georgia power in 1947 rosselot s administration included 1946 establishment of industrial development council renamed to georgia tech research institute in 1948 and to its present name georgia tech research corporation in 1984 wallace p 239 georgia board of regents had ruled that all money received in a year had to be spent that year which was problematic because most government contracts ees had received spanned multiple years georgia tech president blake van leer and vice president cherry emerson solution was to create industrial development council a non profit corporation that would manage contracts for research services and subsequently hire engineering experiment station to perform research it would handle patents garnered through research and distribute funds garnered from contracts and patents as needed mcmath p 215 new organization was almost immediately used to weather a severe drop in state support from 89 000 to 3 000 during recession of 1949 scientific atlanta glen p robinson and six other georgia tech researchers including robinson s former professor and future ees director jim boyd and ees director gerald rosselot each contributed 100 equivalent to in and founded scientific associates later known as scientific atlanta on october 31 1951 with initial goal of marketing antenna structures being developed by radar branch of ees robinson worked as general manager without pay for first year after fledgling company s first contract resulted in a 4 000 loss robinson upon request refunded five of six other initial investors from 1950 to 1952 there were a series of disputes between ees director rosselot and georgia tech vice president cherry emerson over station s finances and rosselot s hand in founding scientific associates mcmath p 262 when it was founded in october 1951 rosselot was president and ceo of scientific associates at issue was potential conflict of interest with his role at georgia tech and what if any role georgia tech should have in technology transfer to marketplace mcmath p 263 emerson later instituted a policy requiring ees employees wishing to work with scientific associates to make a written request to president of georgia tech however rosselot s participation in scientific associates founding and early operations ensured eventual success of scientific atlanta and facilitated subsequent technology transfer by georgia tech s and advanced technology development center in september 1952 board of regents requested an audit of ees s financial operation of primary concern was reporting of overhead income which board suspected was inadequate audit found discrepancies in accounts receivable that were attributed to ees s practice of delaying reporting information on by a month a tactic that had become common to ensure working capital due regents failure to adequately fund station mcmath p 264 though rosselot denied malfeasance practice nonetheless did not conform to university system of georgia s established procedures for budget reporting as a result rosselot went on leave from his post at georgia tech in november 1952 pending acceptance of his resignation by chancellor which became effective march 1 1953 following his resignation rosselot soon accepted a position with bendix corporation s aviation division mcmath p 265 cold war era comparison of ranks at georgia non tenure research scientist or professorresearch scientist or research scientist or assistant in march 1950 herschel h cudd was appointed head of ees s chemical sciences division after gerald rosselot went on leave pending his resignation cudd was named acting director of ees in november 1952 then named director in july 1953 and resigned in november 1953 to accept a much higher paying position at american corporation mcmath p 268 although he was in post for only a year cudd made far reaching changes to station under rosselot research had been increasingly concentrated on a few researchers cudd reversed this trend to extent that ees s 1952 53 annual report stated that 66 faculty in 15 schools performed research at station that year mcmath p 266 cudd created a new promotion system for researchers that is still in use to this day many ees researchers held rank of professor despite lacking a doctorate or a comparable qualification for promotion as determined by georgia board of regents something that irritated members of teaching faculty new system approved in spring of 1953 used board of regents qualifications for promotion and mirrored academic tenure track mcmath p 267 cudd spent a significant amount of ees operating budget on improving laboratory facilities cudd s successor paul k calaway previously director of school of chemistry made a last minute request to contract organization in may 1954 to cover resulting 20 000 equivalent to in deficit wallace p 240 in 1954 a faculty committee appointed to do a comprehensive study of georgia tech aims and objectives of georgia institute of technology noted that of ees s budget of 2 million for 1953 1954 equivalent to million in about 83 was sponsored by governmental agencies and about two thirds of that was classified mcmath p 268 in 1955 rich electronic computer center a new wing on hinman research building was dedicated project was paid for by 85 000 equivalent to in from rich foundation and a matching grant from ees s contract organization wallace p 241 this period saw a significant expansion in georgia tech s postgraduate education programs which received substantial support from ees despite its slow start with first master of science programs in 1920s and first doctorate in 1946 program became firmly established in 1952 alone around 80 students earned graduate degrees while working at ees thumb left neely

of research at station in 1954 and succeeded calaway as director on july 1 1957 while at georgia tech boyd wrote an influential article about role of research centers at institutes of technology which argued that research should be integrated with education and boyd correspondingly involved undergraduates in his research boyd was known for recruiting faculty capable of both teaching and performing notable research one such example is his recruitment of noted physicist and nuclear scientist earl w mcdaniel under boyd s purview engineering experiment station gained many electronics related contracts to extent that an electronics division was created in 1959 it would focus on radar and communications boyd championed establishment of research facilities in 1955 georgia tech president blake van leer appointed boyd to georgia tech s nuclear science committee committee recommended creation of a radioisotopes laboratory facility and a large research reactor on campus former was built and dedicated on january 7 1959 and could receive store and process radioactive materials frank h neely research reactor was completed in 1963 and was operational until 1996 when it was due to safety concerns related to nearby 1996 summer olympics events reactor was permanently decommissioned in 1999 throughout cold war era radar and antenna related applications remained a prominent research activity in ees contracts with defense department millimeter wave radar research in particular was prominent in ees defense activities from late 1950s when first military designation millimeter wave radar was built at georgia tech to 1980s when gtri developed what was then world s highest frequency microwave radar ees high frequency radar research found applications in radio astronomy meteorology and climate studies which improved weather forecasting and climate models and assisted in nasa s planning of cassini and galileo missions expansion of ees antenna research in 1970s in particular development of an air defense antenna for u s army missile command resulted in establishment of huntsville research laboratory gtri s oldest off campus research center in 1980 ees developed a tempest approved version of apple ii plus for u s army and used it as a component in earliest versions of microfix system fielded in 1982 microfix system was first tactical system using video disk map technology providing zoom and scroll over map imagery coupled with a point database of intelligence data such as order of battle airfields roadways and bridges president ronald reagan s strategic defense initiative resulted in largest research contract in georgia tech s history in 1985 21 3 million contract equivalent to million in was divided between gtri and school of electrical engineering gtri landed its own largest ever contract in 1986 14 7 million equivalent to million in to create a soviet surface to air missile system simulator in 1989 as part of a project with u s army and using technology it had been developing since late 1960s gtri completed largest outdoor compact antenna range at fort huachuca arizona on april 10 1989 gtri announced that one of its research groups led by james mahaffey had duplicated results of a controversial university of utah experiment that had allegedly achieved cold fusion in a jar of water four days following announcement researchers discovered that instrument used to measure neutrons was damaged by heat of liquid and gave false elevated readings gtri immediately retracted its support of utah researchers findings citing flawed measurement director donald j grace referred to mistake as embarrassing recalling that he and mahaffey blushed whole time expansion and reorganization georgia general assembly amended ees charter in early 1960s authorizing an industrial extension service to meet technical informational and other needs of industry and local development groups this led to an expansion of some of ees activities that it had been involved in since 1940s in particular ees began providing additional services as a technological incubator during this time frame and began an international development initiative that improved infrastructure and facilitated technology transfer in over 40 developing nations station s expanded mission bolstered its traditional research strengths resulting in work on projects that improved radar operation on saturn rocket and in invention of compact antenna range by richard c johnson throughout 1960s these changes brought about an increased focus on research that sought to solve societal problems rather than research for sake of pure scientific knowledge this came at a time when director maurice w long began placing an emphasis on graduate education and multidisciplinary research thumb right james e boyd speaking at georgia tech alt a man wearing a suit and glasses standing at a podium outside late 1960s saw a period of student unrest and university research centers that worked on contracts for department of defense were often site of student protests neither georgia tech nor ees became focus of protests and long attributed this to school s conservative student body for other reasons however ees became embattled financially and politically as a result of cuts in federal and state spending as well as cuts to space program georgia tech s academic units were similarly affected by these cuts which helped rekindle debate over ees relationship with school georgia tech president arthur g hansen s bold and controversial solution to both entities problems was to completely absorb station into georgia tech s academic units mcmath p 399 on paper this would dramatically increase georgia tech s stated research funding as all of it would be performed through academic units and it would increase options and financial aid for graduate students another less publicized reason was that georgia tech would gain access to contract organization s reserve fund which was said to be over 1 million equivalent to million in thomas e stelson dean of college of engineering at georgia tech was named to reorganize station publicly stelson s task was simply to recommend a plan for reorganization but administration clearly intended for georgia tech and engineering experiment station to be closely integrated maurice w long who was director of station at time viewed move as a violation of ees s charter as legislatively established by georgia general assembly in 1919 and asserted that georgia tech did not have authority to merge two institutions mcmath p 400 ees employees and business executives involved with station appealed to georgia board of regents and to governor of georgia and future united states president jimmy carter himself a georgia tech alumnus controversy received coverage in both technique and atlanta constitution when former ees director james e boyd was appointed as interim president of georgia tech following departure of hansen he stopped plan for complete absorption of station but did allow plans for closer control and more aggressive contract solicitation to proceed among these measures were increased resource sharing including increased sharing of physical assets and research staff latter was evidenced by increase in joint faculty appointments between ees and georgia tech move paid off and fiscal year 1970 1971 saw ees win new contracts and grants totaling a record 5 2 million equivalent to million in stelson was left in charge of station s reorganization and was named interim director upon long s departure in 1975 mcmath p 399 during his tenure stelson reorganized station into eight semi autonomous laboratories in order to allow each to develop a specialization and clientele a model it retains with slight modifications to this day mcmath p 401 engineering experiment station was renamed georgia tech research institute in 1984 a separate organization originally called industrial development council changed its name to georgia tech research institute in february 1946 and finally to georgia tech research corporation in 1984 mcmath p p 434 there are legal difficulties when an american university wishes to accept contracts from some entities especially federal government so second organization is a contracting organization most importantly it allows university to perform multi year contracts that are not possible under state law which requires that money received must be spent in same fiscal year name change coincided with a shift in focus toward obtaining industrial research contracts in addition to its contracts with federal government gtri expanded its footprint in mid to late 1980s centennial research building opened on north end of georgia tech campus in 1985
