donald cousens parkway or york regional road 48 also referred to historically as markham bypass or markham bypass extension is a regionally maintained arterial bypass of markham in canadian province of ontario named for former markham mayor don cousens in april 2007 route initially travelled northward from copper creek drive in box grove south of highway 407 to major mackenzie drive york regional road 25 a southern extension to steeles avenue was later completed and name donald cousens parkway applied along extension to ninth line in addition to its role of funneling through traffic around downtown markham route serves as a boundary to residential development as land to north and east are part of protected rouge national urban park and southwest limits of planned pickering airport construction of route began in 2002 north of 16th avenue in 2004 an interchange with highway 407 was constructed along with a connection north to highway 7 both segments and interchange were opened by december of that year following year construction began to connect these two segments as well as on box grove bypass along ninth line former opened in october 2006 and latter in spring of 2007 construction of most recently opened segment connecting box grove bypass to interchange with highway 407 began in 2009 it opened after several delays in 2012 and included a realignment of 14th avenue donald cousens parkway and a planned connection with morningside avenue in toronto form an east metro transportation corridor originally envisioned by province in 1970s as a six lane municipal expressway during mid 1990s ministry of transportation of ontario mto conducted studies and identified need for corridor by 2011 although york region had intended for a continuous alignment city of toronto government opposed direct connection between morningside and donald cousens parkway as a result it is now proposed to connect morningside avenue and donald cousens parkway via a widened steeles avenue however no timeline has been announced as of 2015 route description donald cousens parkway is intended to relieve north south traffic congestion on york regional road 68 main street former highway 48 and york regional road 69 ninth line with signage suggesting drivers use parkway as a through route past markham as trucks are prohibited along main street signage guides them onto parkway road begins north of steeles avenue east which serves as boundary between markham and toronto a two laned ninth line curves northeast after crossing and being crossed by two separate railway tracks canadian pacific cp havelock subdivision and canadian national cn york subdivision and becomes donald cousens parkway expanding to four lanes and travelling along eastern fringe of community of box grove alongside which it was built in mid 2000s on west side is a new residential subdivision while on east side beyond cp havelock subdivision which road parallels is completely undeveloped bob hunter memorial park after passing box grove bypass where for some time route ended road also becomes known as box grove collector road bgcr route intersects 14th avenue york regional road 71 and continues as before eventually curving north and meeting copper creek drive while departing from railway tracks and park it passes a supercenter before an interchange with highway 407 where it crosses over toll route no longer known by bgcr name route meanders north slowly edging east towards reesor road and now surrounded by undeveloped greenspace it encounters highway 7 north of which it becomes a divided roadway travelling on eastern edge of cornell as well as parallel to and alongside reesor road approaching and intersecting 16th avenue road makes a broad sweeping curve northwest continuing to serve as boundary of urban development in markham it narrows to a two lane road with adjacent land along northern side prepared for future northbound lanes before encountering ninth line again quickly curving north then east sandwiched between neighbourhood of and little rouge creek route makes a final curve north to end at major mackenzie drive on northern edge of urban development in eastern markham a future extension will carry donald cousens parkway north crossing over stouffville go train line on a new bridge and merging into current southern terminus of highway 48 as a result of this highway 48 and donald cousens parkway york regional road 48 will become through route while main street will meet them at an intersection demarcating two history planning history of donald cousens parkway dates back to 1970s when metropolitan toronto and ontario department of highways now ministry of transportation of ontario or mto planned out east metro transportation corridor this corridor was originally envisioned as a six lane expressway connecting highway 401 with planned but unbuilt highway 407 to service future towns of cornell and seaton using greenspace between two however drive for expressway construction faded through 1970s and 1980s as a result of opposition and resulting cancellation of toronto expressway network studies nonetheless continued to be performed confirming need for route formation of rouge park in 1990 resulted in a commitment for no new roads through park south of steeles avenue ending potential for any expressway proposals to be approved during 1994 and 1995 mto conducted two studies termed morningside transportation corridor review while study once again confirmed need for route it also suggested that while an expressway was ideal solution an arterial road would be practical solution it also suggested that road be a municipal route rather than a provincial one in 1997 environmental assessment for markham bypass extension was completed approving construction of an interchange at future ontario highway 407 then open only as far as ontario highway 404 and a divided roadway north from there to major mackenzie drive construction construction on two lane section between 16th avenue and major mackenzie drive connecting with north end of old markham bypass began in 2002 and was completed by end of 2004 phase 2 which included construction of a partial interchange with highway 407 began in 2004 and was completed by end of year it and four lane section north of it to highway 7 opened on december 17 2004 in 2005 construction began on third phase of bypass connecting southern segment at highway 7 with northern segment north of 16th avenue this four lane section opened on october 24 2006 two lane road between this new section and 16th avenue was subsequently closed and removed phase 1 cost an estimated 19 3 million phase 2 an estimated 5 5 million phase 3 an estimated 10 8 million on october 19 2006 york regional council voted to rename markham bypass to honour work of mayor don cousens following this decision a report was prepared outlining costs it was presented to council on february 22 2007 and a bylaw enacted name change became effective april 1 2007 south of highway 407 planning for controversial link to morningside avenue has been underway since 2002 although york had intended for donald cousens parkway to tie directly into morningside thus completing and arterial link highway 401 toronto has firmly opposed this direct link since 2005 due to requirement for a new crossing of rouge river after a lengthy and contentious debate between two province brought in former york region cao alan wells as a mediator in 2007 in september 2010 york announced that it had reached a compromise to construct a discontinuous route with donald cousens parkway ending at current steeles avenue ninth line intersection widening two laned steeles to six west of that point and extending morningside north to steeles immediately east of drive regional municipality of york applied for and obtained environmental assessment approval for this undertaking in july 2011 and january 2013 respectively in july 2014 it was announced that toronto and york would begin sharing jurisdiction over of steeles west from ninth line in order to move forward on planned widening project in interim period since debate erupted in 2005 york region and town of markham began collaboration on linking donald cousens parkway between steeles and highway 407 markham oversaw construction of box grove bypass or ninth line bypass and town arterial road or box grove collector road with construction carried out by it and developers of adjacent box grove community box grove bypass was constructed by town beginning in 2005 and opened in spring of 2007 partially utilizing donald cousens parkway alignment along north side of cp havelock railway subdivision construction of box grove collector road between box grove bypass and highway 407 began in 2009 and included a realignment of 14th avenue developers of surrounding communities box grove hill developments inc to north of 14th avenue and box grove developers group to south were contracted to build this section which was scheduled for completion by december 2010 although a short portion between copper creek drive and highway 407 including unfinished ramps at interchange was opened by 2011 remainder of project was delayed by issues involving a new railway crossing along 14th avenue it opened in 2012 at an estimated cost of 15 5 million future original intention of markham bypass was to link highway 48 with highway 401 via morningside avenue extension through toronto york region planned for a continuous connection between bypass and morningside meeting steeles avenue west of its intersection with ninth line however toronto resisted citing environmental effects that would come from two new crossings over rouge river as such a discontinuous alignment was planned as a compromise beginning in 2010 although steeles avenue widening has a construction schedule with construction planned to start in 2020 no timeline or construction schedule for extension of morningside north of oasis boulevard has been determined donald cousens parkway will be extended north from major mackenzie drive to tie in with highway 48 becoming through route in process and completing markham bypass poor soil conditions at a planned overpass of stouffville go train line have required several years of ongoing soil consolidation beginning in july 2012 and scheduled for completion in fall of 2017 construction was set to begin in april 2018 but was later deferred to 2026 major intersections references 48 48
