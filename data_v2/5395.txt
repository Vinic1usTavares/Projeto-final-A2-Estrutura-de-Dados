lamarckism or lamarckian inheritance is notion that an organism can pass on to its offspring physical characteristics that parent organism acquired through use or disuse during its lifetime this idea is also called inheritance of acquired characteristics or soft inheritance it is inaccurately named after french biologist jean baptiste lamarck 1744 1829 who incorporated action of soft inheritance into his evolutionary theories as a supplement to his concept of orthogenesis a drive towards complexity theory is cited in textbooks to contrast with darwinism this paints a false picture of history of biology as lamarck did not originate idea of soft inheritance which was known from classical era onwards and it was not primary focus of lamarck s theory of evolution further in on origin of species 1859 charles darwin supported idea of use and disuse inheritance though rejecting other aspects of lamarck s theory darwin s own concept of pangenesis implied soft inheritance many researchers from 1860s onwards attempted to find evidence for lamarckian inheritance but these have all been explained away either by other mechanisms such as genetic contamination or as fraud on other hand august weismann s experiment is now considered to have failed to disprove lamarckism as it did not address use and disuse later mendelian genetics supplanted notion of inheritance of acquired traits eventually leading to development of modern synthesis and general abandonment of lamarckism in biology despite this interest in lamarckism has continued studies in fields of epigenetics genetics and somatic hypermutation have highlighted possible inheritance of traits acquired by previous generation characterization of these findings as lamarckism has been disputed inheritance of hologenome consisting of genomes of all an organism s symbiotic microbes as well as its own genome is also somewhat lamarckian in effect though entirely darwinian in its mechanisms early history origins thumb jean baptiste lamarck repeated ancient folk wisdom of inheritance of acquired characteristics inheritance of acquired characteristics was proposed in ancient times and remained a current idea for many centuries historian of science conway zirkle wrote in 1935 that zirkle noted that hippocrates described pangenesis theory that what is inherited derives from whole body of parent whereas aristotle thought it impossible but that all same aristotle implicitly agreed to inheritance of acquired characteristics giving example of inheritance of a scar or of blindness though noting that children do not always resemble their parents zirkle recorded that pliny elder thought much same zirkle also pointed out that stories involving idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics appear numerous times in ancient mythology and bible and persisted through to rudyard kipling s just so stories erasmus darwin s c 1795 suggested that warm blooded animals develop from one living filament with power of acquiring new parts in response to stimuli with each round of improvements being inherited by successive generations darwin s pangenesis thumb upright 1 5 charles darwin s pangenesis theory every part of body emits tiny gemmules which migrate to gonads and contribute to next generation via fertilised egg changes to body during an organism s life would be inherited as in lamarckism charles darwin s on origin of species proposed natural selection as main mechanism for development of species but did not rule out a variant of lamarckism as a supplementary mechanism but darwin was to let go of notion that a well used and strengthened organ could be inherited darwin called this pangenesis and explained it in final chapter of his book variation of animals and plants under domestication 1868 after describing numerous examples to demonstrate what he considered to be inheritance of acquired characteristics pangenesis which he emphasised was a hypothesis was based on idea that somatic cells would in response to environmental stimulation use and disuse throw off gemmules or pangenes which travelled around body though not necessarily in bloodstream these pangenes were microscopic particles that supposedly contained information about characteristics of their parent cell and darwin believed that they eventually accumulated in germ cells where they could pass on to next generation newly acquired characteristics of parents darwin s half cousin francis galton carried out experiments on rabbits with darwin s cooperation in which he blood of one variety of rabbit into another variety in expectation that its offspring would show some characteristics of first they did not and galton declared that he had disproved darwin s hypothesis of pangenesis but darwin objected in a letter to scientific journal nature that he had done nothing of sort since he had never mentioned blood in his writings he pointed out that he regarded pangenesis as occurring in protozoa and plants which have no blood as well as in animals lamarck s evolutionary framework thumb upright 1 7 lamarck s two factor theory involves 1 a complexifying force that drives animal body plans towards higher levels orthogenesis creating a ladder of phyla and 2 an adaptive force that causes animals with a given body plan to adapt to circumstances use and disuse inheritance of acquired characteristics creating a diversity of species and genera popular views of lamarckism only consider an aspect of adaptive force between 1800 and 1830 lamarck proposed a systematic theoretical framework for understanding evolution he saw evolution as comprising four laws life by its own force tends to increase volume of all organs which possess force of life and force of life extends dimensions of those parts up to an extent that those parts bring to themselves production of a new organ in an animal body results from a new requirement arising and which continues to make itself felt and a new movement which that requirement gives birth to and its upkeep maintenance development of organs and their ability are constantly a result of use of those organs all that has been acquired traced or changed in physiology of individuals during their life is conserved through genesis reproduction and transmitted to new individuals who are related to those who have undergone those changes lamarck s discussion of heredity in 1830 in an aside from his evolutionary framework lamarck briefly mentioned two traditional ideas in his discussion of heredity in his day considered to be generally true first was idea of use versus disuse he theorized that individuals lose characteristics they do not require or use and develop characteristics that are useful second was to argue that acquired traits were heritable he gave as an imagined illustration idea that when giraffes stretch their necks to reach leaves high in trees they would strengthen and gradually lengthen their necks these giraffes would then have offspring with slightly longer necks in same way he argued a blacksmith through his work strengthens muscles in his arms and thus his sons would have similar muscular development when they mature lamarck stated following two laws premiere loi dans tout animal qui n a point le terme de ses l emploi plus frequent et d un organe peu a peu cet organe le l et lui donne une puissance a la de cet emploi que le defaut constant d usage de tel organe l le ses et par le faire deuxieme loi tout ce que la nature a fait ou aux individus par l influence des circonstances ou leur race se trouve depuis long temps et par consequent par l influence de l emploi predominant de tel organe ou par celle d un defaut constant d usage de partie elle le conserve par la generation aux nouveaux individus qui en que les aux deux sexes ou a ceux qui ont ces nouveaux individus english translation first law use and disuse in every animal which has not passed limit of its development a more frequent and continuous use of any organ gradually strengthens develops and enlarges that organ and gives it a power proportional to length of time it has been so used while permanent disuse of any organ imperceptibly weakens and deteriorates it and progressively diminishes its functional capacity until it finally disappears second law soft inheritance all acquisitions or losses wrought by nature on individuals through influence of environment in which their race has long been placed and hence through influence of predominant use or permanent disuse of any organ all these are preserved by reproduction to new individuals which arise provided that acquired modifications are common to both sexes or at least to individuals which produce young in essence a change in environment brings about change in needs resulting in change in behavior bringing change in organ usage and development bringing change in form over time and thus gradual transmutation of species however as evolutionary biologists and historians of science michael ghiselin and stephen jay gould have pointed out these ideas were not original to lamarck moreover studying weismann s work over span of his entire career carefully shows that he had more nuanced views about role of environment on germ plasm indeed like darwin he consistently insisted that a variable environment was necessary to cause variation in hereditary material weismann s experiment thumb upright 1 7 august weismann s germ plasm theory hereditary material germ plasm is confined to gonads and gametes somatic cells of body develop afresh in each generation from germ plasm creating an invisible weismann barrier to lamarckian influence from soma to next generation idea that germline cells contain information that passes to each generation unaffected by experience and independent of somatic body cells came to be referred to as weismann barrier as it would make lamarckian inheritance from changes to body difficult or impossible august weismann conducted experiment of removing tails of 68 white mice and those of their offspring over five generations and reporting that no mice were born in consequence without a tail or even with a shorter tail in 1889 he stated that 901 young were produced by five generations of artificially mutilated parents and yet there was not a single example of a rudimentary tail or of any other abnormality in this organ experiment and theory behind it were thought at time to be a refutation of lamarckism however experiment s effectiveness in refuting lamarck s hypothesis is doubtful as it did not address use and disuse of characteristics in response to environment biologist peter gauthier noted in 1990 that can weismann s experiment be considered a case of disuse lamarck proposed that when an organ was not used it slowly and very gradually atrophied in time over course of many generations it would gradually disappear as it was inherited in its modified form in each successive generation cutting tails off mice does not seem to meet qualifications of disuse but rather falls in a category of accidental misuse lamarck s hypothesis has never been proven experimentally and there is no known mechanism to support idea that somatic change however acquired can in some way induce a change in germplasm on other hand it is difficult to disprove lamarck s idea experimentally and it seems that weismann s experiment fails to provide evidence to deny lamarckian hypothesis since it lacks a key factor namely willful exertion of animal in overcoming environmental obstacles biologist and historian of science michael ghiselin also considered weismann tail chopping experiment to have no bearing on lamarckian hypothesis writing in 1994 that acquired characteristics that figured in lamarck s thinking were changes that resulted from an individual s own drives and actions not from actions of external agents lamarck was not concerned with wounds injuries or mutilations and nothing that lamarck had set forth was tested or disproven by weismann tail chopping experiment textbook lamarckism thumb long neck of giraffe is often used as an example in popular explanations of lamarckism however this was only a small part of his theory of evolution towards perfection it was a hypothetical illustration and he used it to discuss his theory of heredity not evolution identification of lamarckism with inheritance of acquired characteristics is regarded by evolutionary biologists including michael ghiselin as a falsified artifact of subsequent history of evolutionary thought repeated in textbooks without analysis and wrongly contrasted with a falsified picture of darwin s thinking ghiselin notes that darwin accepted inheritance of acquired characteristics just as lamarck did and darwin even thought that there was some experimental evidence to support it american paleontologist and historian of science stephen jay gould wrote that in late 19th century evolutionists re read lamarck cast aside guts of it and elevated one aspect of mechanics inheritance of acquired characters to a central focus it never had for lamarck himself he argued that restriction of lamarckism to this relatively small and non distinctive corner of lamarck s thought must be labelled as more than a misnomer and truly a discredit to memory of a man and his much more comprehensive system neo lamarckism context thumb left upright edward drinker cope period of history of evolutionary thought between darwin s death in 1880s and foundation of population genetics in 1920s and beginnings of modern evolutionary synthesis in 1930s is called eclipse of darwinism by some historians of science during that time many scientists and philosophers accepted reality of evolution but doubted whether natural selection was main evolutionary mechanism among most popular alternatives were theories involving inheritance of characteristics acquired during an organism s lifetime scientists who felt that such lamarckian mechanisms were key to evolution were called neo lamarckians they included british botanist george henslow 1835 1925 who studied effects of environmental stress on growth of plants in belief that such environmentally induced variation might explain much of plant evolution and american entomologist alpheus spring packard jr who studied blind animals living in caves and wrote a book in 1901 about lamarck and his work also included were paleontologists like edward drinker cope and alpheus hyatt who observed that fossil record showed orderly almost linear patterns of development that they felt were better explained by lamarckian mechanisms than by natural selection some people including cope and darwin critic samuel butler felt that inheritance of acquired characteristics would let organisms shape their own evolution since organisms that acquired new habits would change use patterns of their organs which would kick start lamarckian evolution they considered this philosophically superior to darwin s mechanism of random variation acted on by selective pressures lamarckism also appealed to those like philosopher herbert spencer and german anatomist ernst haeckel who saw evolution as an inherently progressive process german zoologist theodor eimer combined with ideas about orthogenesis idea that evolution is directed towards a goal with development of modern synthesis of theory of evolution and a lack of evidence for a mechanism for acquiring and passing on new characteristics or even their heritability lamarckism largely fell from favour unlike neo darwinism neo lamarckism is a loose grouping of largely heterodox theories and mechanisms that emerged after lamarck s time rather than a coherent body of theoretical work 19th century thumb upright charles edouard brown sequard tried to demonstrate lamarckism by mutilating guinea pigs neo lamarckian versions of evolution were widespread in late 19th century idea that living things could to some degree choose characteristics that would be inherited allowed them to be in charge of their own destiny as opposed to darwinian view which placed them at mercy of environment such ideas were more popular than natural selection in late 19th century as it made it possible for biological evolution to fit into a framework of a divine or naturally willed plan thus neo lamarckian view of evolution was often advocated by proponents of orthogenesis according to historian of science peter j bowler writing in 2003 scientists from 1860s onwards conducted numerous experiments that purported to show lamarckian inheritance some examples are described in table 19th century experiments attempting to demonstrate lamarckian inheritance scientist date experiment claimed result rebuttal charles edouard

successful but from beginning these were either criticised on scientific grounds or shown to be fakes for instance in 1906 philosopher eugenio argued for a version that he called centro but it was

results not replicable late 20th century british anthropologist frederic wood jones and south african paleontologist robert broom supported a neo lamarckian view of human evolution german anthropologist hermann relied on a neo lamarckian model of evolution to try and explain origin of bipedalism neo lamarckism remained influential in biology until 1940s when role of natural selection was reasserted in evolution as part of modern evolutionary synthesis herbert graham cannon a british zoologist defended lamarckism in his 1959 book lamarck and modern genetics in 1960s biochemical lamarckism was advocated by embryologist paul neo lamarckism was dominant in french biology for more than a century french scientists who supported neo lamarckism included edmond perrier 1844 1921 alfred 1846 1908 gaston bonnier 1853 1922 and pierre paul grasse 1895 1985 they followed two traditions one mechanistic one vitalistic after henri bergson s philosophy of evolution in 1987 ryuichi matsuda coined term pan environmentalism for his evolutionary theory which he saw as a fusion of darwinism with neo lamarckism he held that heterochrony is a main mechanism for evolutionary change and that novelty in evolution can be generated by genetic assimilation book reviews of animal evolution in changing environments with special reference to abnormal metamorphosis 1987 by ryuichi matsuda and evolution of individuality 1987 by leo w buss his views were criticized by arthur m shapiro for providing no solid evidence for his theory shapiro noted that matsuda himself accepts too much at face value and is prone to wish fulfilling interpretation ideological neo lamarckism thumb upright trofim lysenko promoted an ideological form of neo lamarckism which adversely influenced soviet agricultural policy in 1930s a form of lamarckism was revived in soviet union of 1930s when trofim lysenko promoted ideologically driven research programme lysenkoism this suited ideological opposition of joseph stalin to genetics lysenkoism influenced soviet agricultural policy which in turn was later blamed for crop failures critique george gaylord simpson in his book tempo and mode in evolution 1944 claimed that experiments in heredity have failed to corroborate any lamarckian process simpson noted that neo lamarckism stresses a factor that lamarck rejected inheritance of direct effects of environment and neo lamarckism is closer to darwin s pangenesis than lamarck s views simpson wrote inheritance of acquired characters failed to meet tests of observation and has been almost universally discarded by biologists botanist conway zirkle pointed out that lamarck did not originate hypothesis that acquired characteristics could be inherited so it is incorrect to refer to it as lamarckism what lamarck really did was to accept hypothesis that acquired characters were heritable a notion which had been held almost universally for well over two thousand years and which his contemporaries accepted as a matter of course and to assume that results of such inheritance were cumulative from generation to generation thus producing in time new species his individual contribution to biological theory consisted in his application to problem of origin of species of view that acquired characters were inherited and in showing that evolution could be inferred logically from accepted biological hypotheses he would doubtless have been greatly astonished to learn that a belief in inheritance of acquired characters is now labeled lamarckian although he would almost certainly have felt flattered if evolution itself had been so designated peter medawar wrote regarding lamarckism very few professional biologists believe that anything of kind occurs or can occur but notion persists for a variety of nonscientific reasons medawar stated there is no known mechanism by which an adaptation acquired in an individual s lifetime can be imprinted on genome and lamarckian inheritance is not valid unless it excludes possibility of natural selection but this has not been demonstrated in any experiment martin gardner wrote in his book fads and fallacies in name of science 1957 a host of experiments have been designed to test all that have been verified have proved negative on other hand tens of thousands of experiments reported in journals and carefully checked and by geneticists throughout world have established correctness of gene mutation theory beyond all reasonable doubt in spite of rapidly increasing evidence for natural selection lamarck has never ceased to have loyal followers there is indeed a strong emotional appeal in thought that every little effort an animal puts forth is somehow transmitted to his progeny according to ernst mayr any lamarckian theory involving inheritance of acquired characters has been refuted as dna does not directly participate in making of phenotype and that phenotype in turn does not control composition of dna recognition that dna does not directly participate in making of phenotype and that phenotype in turn does not control composition of dna represents ultimate invalidation of all theories involving inheritance of acquired characters this definitive refutation of lamarck s theory of evolutionary causation clears air peter j bowler has written that although many early scientists took lamarckism seriously it was discredited by genetics in early twentieth century mechanisms resembling lamarckism studies in field of epigenetics genetics and somatic hypermutation have highlighted possible inheritance of traits acquired by previous generation however characterization of these findings as lamarckism has been disputed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance thumb dna molecule with epigenetic marks created by methylation enabling a neo lamarckian pattern of inheritance for some generations epigenetic inheritance has been argued by scientists including eva jablonka and marion j lamb to be lamarckian epigenetics is based on hereditary elements other than genes that pass into germ cells these include methylation patterns in dna and chromatin marks on histone proteins both involved in gene regulation these marks are responsive to environmental stimuli differentially affect gene expression and are adaptive with phenotypic effects that persist for some generations mechanism may also enable inheritance of behavioral traits for example in chickens rats and human populations that have experienced starvation dna methylation resulting in altered gene function in both starved population and their offspring methylation similarly mediates epigenetic inheritance in plants such as rice small rna molecules too may mediate inherited resistance to infection handel and commented that epigenetics allows peaceful co existence of darwinian and lamarckian evolution joseph springer and dennis holley commented in 2013 that lamarck and his ideas were ridiculed and discredited in a strange twist of fate lamarck may have last laugh epigenetics an emerging field of genetics has shown that lamarck may have been at least partially correct all along it seems that reversible and heritable changes can occur without a change in dna sequence genotype and that such changes may be induced spontaneously or in response to environmental factors lamarck s acquired traits determining which observed phenotypes are genetically inherited and which are environmentally induced remains an important and ongoing part of study of genetics developmental biology and medicine prokaryotic crispr system and interacting rna could be classified as lamarckian within a darwinian framework however significance of epigenetics in evolution is uncertain critics such as evolutionary biologist jerry coyne point out that epigenetic inheritance lasts for only a few generations so it is not a stable basis for evolutionary change gonzalez o toro ma bach a 2015 past

variation g3 genes genomes genetics 5 4 477 485 evolutionary biologist t ryan gregory contends that epigenetic inheritance should not be considered lamarckian according to gregory lamarck did not claim that environment directly affected living things instead lamarck argued that environment created needs to which organisms responded by using some features more and others less that this resulted in those features being accentuated or attenuated and that this difference was then inherited by offspring gregory has stated that lamarckian evolution in epigenetics is more like darwin s point of view than lamarck s in 2007 david haig wrote that research into epigenetic processes does allow a lamarckian element in evolution but processes do not challenge main tenets of modern evolutionary synthesis as modern lamarckians have claimed haig argued for primacy of dna and evolution of epigenetic switches by natural selection haig has written that there is a visceral attraction to lamarckian evolution from public and some scientists as it posits world with a meaning in which organisms can shape their own evolutionary destiny a review of transformations of lamarckism from subtle fluids to molecular biology edited by b and eva jablonka mit press 2011 thomas dickens and qazi rahman 2012 have argued that epigenetic mechanisms such as dna methylation and histone modification are genetically inherited under control of natural selection and do not challenge modern synthesis they dispute claims of jablonka and lamb on lamarckian epigenetic processes thumb upright 1 35 edward j steele s disputed neo lamarckian mechanism involves somatic hypermutation and reverse transcription by a retrovirus to breach weismann barrier to germline dna in 2015 iqbal and colleagues discovered that although endocrine exert direct epigenetic effects in exposed fetal germ cells these are corrected by reprogramming events in next generation also in 2015 adam weiss argued that bringing back lamarck in context of epigenetics is misleading commenting we should remember lamarck for good he contributed to science not for things that resemble his theory only superficially indeed thinking of crispr and other phenomena as lamarckian only obscures simple and elegant way evolution really works somatic hypermutation and reverse transcription to germline in 1970s australian immunologist edward j steele developed a neo lamarckian theory of somatic hypermutation within immune system and coupled it to reverse transcription of rna derived from body cells to dna of germline cells this reverse transcription process supposedly enabled characteristics or bodily changes acquired during a lifetime to be written back into dna and passed on to subsequent generations mechanism was meant to explain why homologous dna sequences from gene regions of parent mice were found in their germ cells and seemed to persist in offspring for a few generations mechanism involved somatic selection and clonal amplification of newly acquired antibody gene sequences generated via somatic hypermutation in b cells messenger rna products of these novel genes were captured by retroviruses endogenous to b cells and were then transported through bloodstream where they could breach weismann or soma germ barrier and reverse transcribe newly acquired genes into cells of germ line in manner of darwin s pangenes thumb upright 2 5 neo lamarckian inheritance of hologenome historian of biology peter j bowler noted in 1989 that other scientists had been unable to reproduce his results and described scientific consensus at time bowler commented that steele s work was bitterly criticized at time by biologists who doubted his experimental results and rejected his hypothetical mechanism as implausible hologenome theory of evolution hologenome theory of evolution while darwinian has lamarckian aspects an individual animal or plant lives in symbiosis with many microorganisms and together they have a hologenome consisting of all their genomes hologenome can vary like any other genome by mutation sexual recombination and chromosome rearrangement but in addition it can vary when populations of microorganisms increase or decrease resembling lamarckian use and disuse and when it gains new kinds of microorganism resembling lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics these changes are then passed on to offspring mechanism is largely uncontroversial and natural selection does sometimes occur at whole system hologenome level but it is not clear that this is always case thumb upright 2 5 lamarckian use and disuse compared to darwinian evolution baldwin effect and waddington s genetic assimilation all theories offer explanations of how organisms respond to a changed environment with adaptive inherited change baldwin effect baldwin effect named after psychologist james mark baldwin by george gaylord simpson in 1953 proposes that ability to learn new behaviours can improve an animal s reproductive success and hence course of natural selection on its genetic makeup simpson stated that mechanism was not inconsistent with modern synthesis of evolutionary theory depew david j 2003 baldwin boosters baldwin skeptics in though he doubted that it occurred very often or could be proven to occur he noted that baldwin effect provide a reconciliation between neo darwinian and neo lamarckian approaches something that modern synthesis had seemed to render unnecessary in particular effect allows animals to adapt to a new stress in environment through behavioural changes followed by genetic change this somewhat resembles lamarckism but without requiring animals to inherit characteristics acquired by their parents baldwin effect is broadly accepted by darwinists dennett daniel 2003 baldwin effect a crane not a skyhook in in sociocultural evolution within history of technology lamarckism has been used in linking cultural development to human evolution by classifying artefacts as extensions of human anatomy in other words as acquired cultural characteristics of human beings ben cullen has shown that a strong element of lamarckism exists in sociocultural evolution
