seven states oklahoma was struck by six tornadoes most of any state first day of outbreak produced most tornadoes second brought mainly high wind damage and rain or snow in most of northeast storm system responsible for tornado outbreak resulted from unusual congruence of a cold dry system originating in four corners and a warm moist system moving north out of texas complicating factors included daytime heating and a strong wind field favorable to creation of circulating thunderstorms on second day stronger cold front limited discrete supercell activity and risk of tornadoes decreased significantly a squall line however produced high winds and rain along river valleys primarily those of mississippi and ohio rivers this squall line continued to renew its energy as it passed through midwest pennsylvania new jersey new york and new england causing wind and water damage and dumping of snow in central and eastern massachusetts resulting power outages affected homes

northward across texas and louisiana into eastern oklahoma and ozarks ahead of system daytime heating of boundary layer increased throughout afternoon across oklahoma and texas as cloud cover shifted eastward cooling aloft in conjunction with approaching storm system led to atmospheric instability resulting in thunderstorms a very strong wind field increased with height through lower troposphere

from central oklahoma southward into north central texas in afternoon during night a cold front moved eastward toward mississippi valley and organized thunderstorms into a lengthy squall line along
