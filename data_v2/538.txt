emily e g 23 march 1882 14 april 1935 was a jewish german mathematician who made important contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics she invariably used name emmy noether in her life and publications she was described by pavel alexandrov albert einstein jean dieudonne hermann weyl and norbert wiener as most important woman in history of mathematics as one of leading mathematicians of her time she developed theories of rings fields and algebras in physics noether s theorem explains connection between symmetry and conservation laws noether was born to a jewish family in franconian town of erlangen her father was a mathematician max noether she originally planned to teach french and english after passing required examinations but instead studied mathematics at university of erlangen where her father lectured after completing her dissertation in 1907 under supervision of paul gordan she worked at mathematical institute of erlangen without pay for seven years at time women were largely excluded from academic positions in 1915 she was invited by david hilbert and felix klein to join mathematics department at university of gottingen a world renowned center of mathematical research philosophical faculty objected however and she spent four years lecturing under hilbert s name her habilitation was approved in 1919 allowing her to obtain rank of privatdozent noether remained a leading member of gottingen mathematics department until 1933 her students were sometimes called noether boys in 1924 dutch mathematician b l van der waerden joined her circle and soon became leading of noether s ideas her work was foundation for second volume of his influential 1931 textbook moderne algebra by time of her plenary address at 1932 international congress of mathematicians in zurich her algebraic acumen was recognized around world following year germany s nazi government dismissed jews from university positions and noether moved to united states to take up a position at bryn mawr college in pennsylvania in 1935 she underwent surgery for an ovarian cyst and despite signs of a recovery died four days later at age of 53 noether s mathematical work has been divided into three epochs in first 1908 1919 she made contributions to theories of algebraic invariants and number fields her work on differential invariants in calculus of variations noether s theorem has been called one of most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding development of modern physics in second epoch 1920 1926 she began work that changed face of abstract algebra in her classic 1921 paper idealtheorie in ringbereichen theory of ideals in ring domains noether developed theory of ideals in commutative rings into a tool with wide ranging applications she made elegant use of ascending chain condition and objects satisfying it are named noetherian in her honor in third epoch 1927 1935 she published works on noncommutative algebras and hypercomplex numbers and united representation theory of groups with theory of modules and ideals in addition to her own publications noether was generous with her ideas and is credited with several lines of research published by other mathematicians even in fields far removed from her main work such as algebraic topology personal life thumb noether grew up in bavarian city of erlangen depicted here in a 1916 postcard thumb emmy noether with her brothers alfred fritz and robert before 1918 emmy s father max noether was descended from a family of wholesale traders in germany at age 14 he had been paralyzed by polio he regained mobility but one leg remained affected largely self taught he was awarded a doctorate from university of heidelberg in 1868 after teaching there for seven years he took a position in bavarian city of erlangen where he met and married ida amalia kaufmann daughter of a prosperous merchant max noether s mathematical contributions were to algebraic geometry mainly following in footsteps of alfred his best known results are brill noether theorem and residue or af bg theorem several other theorems are associated with him see max noether s theorem emmy noether was born on 23 march 1882 first of four children extract of p 21 her first name was amalie after her mother and paternal grandmother but she began using her middle name at a young age as a girl noether was well liked she did not stand out academically although she was known for being clever and friendly she was near sighted and talked with a minor lisp during her childhood a family friend recounted a story years later about young noether quickly solving a brain teaser at a children s party showing logical acumen at that early age she was taught to cook and clean as were most girls of time and she took piano lessons she pursued none of these activities with passion although she loved to dance she had three younger brothers eldest alfred was born in 1883 was awarded a doctorate in chemistry from erlangen in 1909 but died nine years later fritz noether born in 1884 is remembered for his academic accomplishments after studying in munich he made a reputation for himself in applied mathematics youngest gustav robert was born in 1889 very little is known about his life he suffered from chronic illness and died in 1928 university education thumb paul gordan supervised noether s doctoral dissertation on invariants of biquadratic forms noether showed early proficiency in french and english in spring of 1900 she took examination for teachers of these languages and received an overall score of gut very good her performance qualified her to teach languages at schools reserved for girls but she chose instead to continue her studies at university of erlangen this was an unconventional decision two years earlier academic senate of university had declared that allowing mixed sex education would overthrow all academic order one of only two women in a university of 986 students noether was only allowed to audit classes rather than participate fully and required permission of individual professors whose lectures she wished to attend despite these obstacles on 14 july 1903 she passed graduation exam at a realgymnasium in nuremberg during 1903 1904 winter semester she studied at university of gottingen attending lectures given by astronomer karl schwarzschild and mathematicians hermann minkowski otto blumenthal felix klein and david hilbert soon thereafter restrictions on women s participation in that university were rescinded noether returned to erlangen she officially reentered university in october 1904 and declared her intention to focus solely on mathematics under supervision of paul gordan she wrote her dissertation uber die bildung des der biquadratischen form on complete systems of invariants for ternary biquadratic forms 1907 gordan was a member of computational school of invariant researchers and noether s thesis ended with a list of over 300 explicitly worked out invariants this approach to invariants was later superseded by more abstract and general approach pioneered by hilbert although it had been well received noether later described her thesis and a number of subsequent similar papers she produced as crap write that she completed her doctorate at gottingen but this appears to be an error teaching university of erlangen for next seven years 1908 1915 she taught at university of erlangen s mathematical institute without pay occasionally substituting for her father when he was too ill to lecture in 1910 and 1911 she published an extension of her thesis work from three variables to n variables thumb 250px upright noether sometimes used postcards to discuss abstract algebra with her colleague ernst fischer this card is postmarked 10 april 1915 gordan retired in spring of 1910 but continued to teach occasionally with his successor erhard schmidt who left shortly afterward for a position in breslau gordan retired from teaching altogether in 1911 when schmidt s successor ernst fischer arrived gordan died a year later in december 1912 according to hermann weyl fischer was an important influence on noether in particular by introducing her to work of david hilbert from 1913 to 1916 noether published several papers extending and applying hilbert s methods to mathematical objects such as fields of rational functions and invariants of finite groups this phase marks beginning of her engagement with abstract algebra field of mathematics to which she would make groundbreaking contributions noether and fischer shared lively enjoyment of mathematics and would often discuss lectures long after they were over noether is known to have sent postcards to fischer continuing her train of mathematical thoughts university of gottingen in spring of 1915 noether was invited to return to university of gottingen by david hilbert and felix klein their effort to recruit her however was blocked by philologists and historians among philosophical faculty women they insisted should not become one faculty member protested what will our soldiers think when they return to university and find that they are required to learn at feet of a woman hilbert responded with indignation stating i do not see that sex of candidate is an argument against her admission as privatdozent after all we are a university not a bath house thumb left upright in 1915 david hilbert invited noether to join gottingen mathematics department challenging views of some of his colleagues that a woman should not be allowed to teach at a university noether left for gottingen in late april two weeks later her mother died suddenly in erlangen she had previously received medical care for an eye condition but its nature and impact on her death is unknown at about same time noether s father retired and her brother joined german army to serve in world war i she returned to erlangen for several weeks mostly to care for her aging father during her first years teaching at gottingen she did not have an official position and was not paid her family paid for her room and board and supported her academic work her lectures often were advertised under hilbert s name and noether would provide assistance soon after arriving at gottingen however she demonstrated her capabilities by proving theorem now known as noether s theorem which shows that a conservation law is associated with any differentiable symmetry of a physical system paper was presented by a colleague f klein on 26 july 1918 to a meeting of royal society of sciences at gottingen noether presumably did not present it herself because she was not a member of society american physicists leon m lederman and christopher t hill argue in their book symmetry and beautiful universe that noether s theorem is certainly one of most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding development of modern physics possibly on a par with pythagorean theorem thumb 210px mathematics department at university of gottingen allowed noether s habilitation in 1919 four years after she had begun lecturing at school when world war i ended german revolution of 1918 1919 brought a significant change in social attitudes including more rights for women in 1919 university of gottingen allowed noether to proceed with her habilitation eligibility for tenure her oral examination was held in late may and she successfully delivered her habilitation lecture in june 1919 three years later she received a letter from prussian minister for science art and public education in which he conferred on her title of nicht professor an professor with limited internal administrative rights and functions this was an unpaid extraordinary professorship not higher ordinary professorship which was a civil service position although it recognized importance of her work position still provided no salary noether was not paid for her lectures until she was appointed to special position of fur algebra a year later work in abstract algebra although noether s theorem had a significant effect upon classical and quantum mechanics among mathematicians she is best remembered for her contributions to abstract algebra in his introduction to noether s collected papers nathan jacobson wrote development of abstract algebra which is one of most distinctive innovations of twentieth century mathematics is largely due to her in published papers in lectures and in personal influence on her contemporaries she sometimes allowed her colleagues and students to receive credit for her ideas helping them develop their careers at expense of her own noether s work in algebra began in 1920 in collaboration with w she then published a paper about theory of ideals in which they defined left and right ideals in a ring following year she published a paper called idealtheorie in ringbereichen analyzing ascending chain conditions with regard to mathematical ideals noted algebraist irving called this work revolutionary publication gave rise to term noetherian ring and naming of several other mathematical objects as noetherian in 1924 a young dutch mathematician b l van der waerden arrived at university of gottingen he immediately began working with noether who provided invaluable methods of abstract conceptualization van der waerden later said that her originality was absolute beyond comparison in 1931 he published moderne algebra a central text in field its second volume borrowed heavily from noether s work although noether did not seek recognition he included as a note in seventh edition based in part on lectures by e artin and e noether van der waerden s visit was part of a convergence of mathematicians from all over world to gottingen which became a major hub of mathematical and physical research from 1926 to 1930 russian topologist pavel alexandrov lectured at university and he and noether quickly became good friends he began referring to her as der noether using masculine german article as a term of endearment to show his respect she tried to arrange for him to obtain a position at gottingen as a regular professor but was only able to help him secure a scholarship from rockefeller foundation they met regularly and enjoyed discussions about intersections of algebra and topology in his 1935 memorial address alexandrov named emmy noether greatest woman mathematician of all time graduate students and influential lectures in addition to her mathematical insight noether was respected for her consideration of others although she sometimes acted rudely toward those who disagreed with her she nevertheless gained a reputation for constant helpfulness and patient guidance of new students her loyalty to mathematical precision caused one colleague to name her a severe critic but she combined this demand for accuracy with a nurturing attitude a colleague later described her this way completely and free of vanity she never claimed anything for herself but promoted works of her students above all gottingen thumb left noether c 1930 in gottingen noether supervised more than a dozen doctoral students her first was grete hermann who defended her dissertation in february 1925 she later spoke reverently of her dissertation mother noether also supervised max deuring who distinguished himself as an undergraduate and went on to contribute significantly to field of arithmetic geometry hans fitting remembered for fitting s theorem and fitting lemma and zeng also rendered chiungtze c tsen in english who proved tsen s theorem she also worked closely with wolfgang krull who greatly advanced commutative algebra with his and his dimension theory for commutative rings her frugal lifestyle at first was due to being denied pay for her work however even after university began paying her a small salary in 1923 she continued to live a simple and modest life she was paid more generously later in her life but saved half of her salary to bequeath to her nephew gottfried e noether mostly unconcerned about appearance and manners biographers suggest she focused on her studies a distinguished algebraist olga taussky todd described a luncheon during which noether wholly engrossed in a discussion of mathematics gesticulated wildly as she ate and spilled her food constantly and wiped it off from her dress completely unperturbed appearance conscious students cringed as she retrieved handkerchief from her blouse and ignored increasing disarray of her hair during a lecture two female students once approached her during a break in a two hour class to express their concern but they were unable to break through energetic mathematics discussion she was having with other students according to van der waerden s obituary of emmy noether she did not follow a lesson plan for her lectures which frustrated some students instead she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students to think through and clarify important problems in mathematics some of her most important results were developed in these lectures and lecture notes of her students formed basis for several important textbooks such as those of van der waerden and deuring reprinted in several of her colleagues attended her lectures and she allowed some of her ideas such as crossed product in german of associative algebras to be published by others noether was recorded as having given at least five semester long courses at gottingen w emmy noether s contributions to theory of algebras in winter 1924 1925 und hyperkomplexe zahlen group theory and hypercomplex numbers winter 1927 1928 hyperkomplexe grossen und hypercomplex quantities and representation theory summer 1928 nichtkommutative algebra noncommutative algebra summer 1929 nichtkommutative arithmetik noncommutative arithmetic winter 1929 30 algebra der hyperkomplexen grossen algebra of hypercomplex quantities these courses often preceded major publications on same subjects noether spoke quickly reflecting speed of her thoughts many said and demanded great concentration from her students students who disliked her style often felt alienated some pupils felt that she relied too much on spontaneous discussions her most dedicated students however relished enthusiasm with which she approached mathematics especially since her lectures often built on earlier work they had done together she developed a close circle of colleagues and students who thought along similar lines and tended to exclude those who did not outsiders who occasionally visited noether s lectures usually spent only 30 minutes in room before leaving in frustration or confusion a regular student said of one such instance enemy has been defeated he has cleared out noether showed a devotion to her subject and her students that extended beyond academic day once when building was closed for a state holiday she gathered class on steps outside led them through woods and lectured at a local coffee house later after she had been dismissed by third reich she invited students into her home to discuss their plans for future and mathematical concepts moscow thumb 140px pavel alexandrov in winter of 1928 1929 noether accepted an invitation to moscow state university where she continued working with p s alexandrov in addition to carrying on with her research she taught classes in abstract algebra and algebraic geometry she worked with lev and nikolai who later praised her contributions to development of galois theory thumb right noether taught at moscow state university during winter of 1928 1929 although politics was not central to her life noether took a keen interest in political matters and according to alexandrov showed considerable support for russian revolution she was especially happy to see soviet advances in fields of science and mathematics which she considered indicative of new opportunities made possible by bolshevik project this attitude caused her problems in germany culminating in her eviction from a pension lodging building after student leaders complained of living with a marxist leaning jewess noether planned to return to moscow an effort for which she received support from alexandrov after she left germany in 1933 he tried to help her gain a chair at moscow state university through soviet education ministry although this effort proved unsuccessful they corresponded frequently during 1930s and in 1935 she made plans for a return to soviet union meanwhile her brother fritz accepted a position at research institute for mathematics and mechanics in tomsk in siberian federal district of russia after losing his job in germany and was subsequently executed during great purge recognition in 1932 emmy noether and emil artin received ackermann teubner memorial award for their contributions to mathematics prize included a monetary reward of 500 reichsmarks and was seen as a long overdue official recognition of her considerable work in field nevertheless her colleagues expressed frustration at fact that she was not elected to gottingen gesellschaft der wissenschaften academy of sciences and was never promoted to position of professor full professor thumb left noether visited zurich in 1932 to deliver a plenary address at international congress of mathematicians noether s colleagues celebrated her fiftieth birthday in 1932 in typical mathematicians style helmut hasse dedicated an article to her in mathematische annalen wherein he confirmed her suspicion that some aspects of noncommutative algebra are simpler than those of commutative algebra by proving a noncommutative reciprocity law this pleased her immensely he also sent her a mathematical riddle which he called riddle of syllables she solved it immediately but riddle has been lost in november of same year noether delivered a plenary address grosser on hyper complex systems in their relations to commutative algebra and to number theory at international congress of mathematicians in zurich congress was attended by 800 people including noether s colleagues hermann weyl edmund landau and wolfgang krull there were 420 official participants and twenty one plenary addresses presented apparently noether s prominent speaking position was a recognition of importance of her contributions to mathematics 1932 congress is sometimes described as high point of her career expulsion from gottingen by third reich when adolf hitler became german reichskanzler in january 1933 nazi activity around country increased dramatically at university of gottingen german student association led attack on un german spirit attributed to jews and was aided by a privatdozent named werner weber a former student of noether antisemitic attitudes created a climate hostile to jewish professors one young protester reportedly demanded aryan students want aryan mathematics and not jewish mathematics one of first actions of hitler s administration was law for restoration of professional civil service which removed jews and politically suspect government employees including university professors from their jobs unless they had demonstrated their loyalty to germany by serving in world war i in april 1933 noether received a notice from prussian ministry for sciences art and public education which read on basis of paragraph 3 of civil service code of 7 april 1933 i hereby withdraw from you right to teach at university of gottingen several of noether s colleagues including max born and richard courant also had their positions revoked noether accepted decision calmly providing support for others during this difficult time hermann weyl later wrote that emmy noether her courage her frankness her about her own fate her conciliatory spirit was in midst of all hatred and meanness despair and sorrow surrounding us a moral solace typically noether remained focused on mathematics gathering students in her apartment to discuss class field theory when one of her students appeared in uniform of nazi paramilitary organization sturmabteilung sa she showed no sign of agitation and reportedly even laughed about it later this however was before bloody events of kristallnacht in 1938 and their praise from propaganda minister joseph goebbels refuge at bryn mawr and princeton in america thumb right bryn mawr college provided a welcoming home for noether during last two years of her life as dozens of newly unemployed professors began searching for positions outside of germany their colleagues in united states sought to provide assistance and job opportunities for them albert einstein and hermann weyl were appointed by institute for advanced study in princeton while others worked to find a sponsor required for legal immigration noether was contacted by representatives of two educational institutions bryn mawr college in united states and somerville college at university of oxford in england after a series of negotiations with rockefeller foundation a grant to bryn mawr was approved for noether and she took a position there starting in late 1933 at bryn mawr noether met and befriended anna wheeler who had studied at gottingen just before noether arrived there another source of support at college was bryn mawr president marion edwards park who enthusiastically invited mathematicians in area to see dr noether in action noether and a small team of students worked quickly through van der waerden s 1930 book moderne algebra i and parts of erich s theorie der algebraischen zahlen theory of algebraic numbers in 1934 noether began lecturing at institute for advanced study in princeton upon invitation of abraham flexner and oswald veblen she also worked with and supervised abraham albert and harry however she remarked about princeton university that she was not welcome at men s university where nothing female is admitted her time in united states was pleasant surrounded as she was by supportive colleagues and absorbed in her favorite subjects in summer of 1934 she briefly returned to germany to see emil artin and her brother fritz before he left for tomsk although many of her former colleagues had been forced out of universities she was able to use library as a foreign scholar death thumb 250px right noether s ashes were placed under walkway surrounding cloisters of bryn mawr s m carey thomas library in april 1935 doctors discovered a tumor in noether s pelvis worried about complications from surgery they ordered two days of bed rest first during operation they discovered an ovarian cyst size of a large cantaloupe two smaller tumors in her uterus appeared to be benign and were not removed to avoid prolonging surgery for three days she appeared to convalesce normally and she recovered quickly from a circulatory collapse on fourth on 14 april she fell unconscious her temperature soared to and she died i t is not easy to say what had occurred in dr noether one of physicians wrote it is possible that there was some form of unusual and virulent infection which struck base of brain where heat centers are supposed to be located a few days after noether s death her friends and associates at bryn mawr held a small memorial service at college president park s house hermann weyl and richard brauer traveled from princeton and spoke with wheeler and taussky about their departed colleague in months that followed written tributes began to appear around globe albert einstein joined van der waerden weyl and pavel alexandrov in paying their respects her body was cremated and ashes interred under walkway around cloisters of m carey thomas library at bryn mawr contributions to mathematics and physics noether s work in abstract algebra and topology was influential in mathematics while in physics noether s theorem has consequences for theoretical physics and dynamical systems she showed an acute propensity for abstract thought which allowed her to approach problems of mathematics in fresh and original ways her friend and colleague hermann weyl described her scholarly output in three epochs in first epoch 1907 1919 noether dealt primarily with differential and algebraic invariants beginning with her dissertation under paul gordan her mathematical horizons broadened and her work became more general and abstract as she became acquainted with work of david hilbert through close interactions with a successor to gordan ernst sigismund fischer after moving to gottingen in 1915 she produced her work for physics two noether s theorems in second epoch 1920 1926 noether devoted herself to developing theory of mathematical rings in third epoch 1927 1935 noether focused on noncommutative algebra linear transformations and commutative number fields although results of noether s first epoch were impressive and useful her fame among mathematicians rests more on groundbreaking work she did in her second and third epochs as noted by hermann weyl and b l van der waerden in their obituaries of her in these epochs she was not merely applying ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians rather she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions that would be used by future mathematicians in particular she developed a completely new theory of ideals in rings generalizing earlier work of richard dedekind she is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions a simple condition that yielded powerful results in her hands such conditions and theory of ideals enabled noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective such as elimination theory and algebraic varieties that had been studied by her father historical context in century from 1832 to noether s death in 1935 field of mathematics specifically algebra underwent a profound revolution whose reverberations are still being felt mathematicians of previous centuries had worked on practical methods for solving specific types of equations e g cubic quartic and quintic equations as well as on related problem of constructing regular polygons using compass and straightedge beginning with carl friedrich gauss s 1832 proof that prime numbers such as five can be factored in gaussian integers reprinted in evariste galois s introduction of permutation groups in 1832 although because of his death his papers were published only in 1846 by liouville william rowan hamilton s discovery of quaternions in 1843 and arthur cayley s more modern definition of groups in 1854 research turned to determining properties of ever more abstract systems defined by ever more universal rules noether s most important contributions to mathematics were to development of this new field abstract algebra g e background on abstract algebra and begriffliche mathematik conceptual mathematics two of most basic objects in abstract algebra are groups and rings a group consists of a set of elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group it must be closed when applied to any pair of elements of associated set generated element must also be a member of that set it must be associative there must be an identity element an element which when combined with another element using operation results in original element such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one and for every element there must be an inverse element a ring likewise has a set of elements but now has two operations first operation must make set a group and second operation is associative and distributive with respect to first operation it may or may not be commutative this means that result of applying operation to a first and a second element is same as to second and first order of elements does not matter if every non zero element has a multiplicative inverse an element x such that a x x a 1 ring is called a division ring a field is defined as a commutative division ring groups are frequently studied through group representations in their most general form these consist of a choice of group a set and an action of group on set that is an operation which takes an element of group and an element of set and returns an element of set most often set is a vector space and group represents symmetries of vector space for example there is a group which represents rigid rotations of space this is a type of symmetry of space because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though positions of objects in it do noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics a powerful way of studying rings is through their modules a module consists of a choice of ring another set usually distinct from underlying set of ring and called underlying set of module an operation on pairs of elements of underlying set of module and an operation which takes an element of ring and an element of module and returns an element of module underlying set of module and its operation must form a group a module is a ring theoretic version of a group representation ignoring second ring operation and operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation real utility of modules is that kinds of modules that exist and their interactions reveal structure of ring in ways that are not apparent from ring itself an important special case of this is an algebra word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in subject of algebra an algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of second ring this operation makes second ring into a module over first often first ring is a field words such as element and combining operation are very general and can be applied to many real world and abstract situations any set of things that obeys all rules for one or two operation s is by definition a group or ring and obeys all theorems about groups or rings integer numbers and operations of addition and multiplication are just one example for example elements might be computer data words where first combining operation is exclusive or and second is logical conjunction theorems of abstract algebra are powerful because they are general they govern many systems it might be imagined that little could be concluded about objects defined with so few properties but precisely therein lay noether s gift to discover maximum that could be concluded from a given set of properties or conversely to identify minimum set essential properties responsible for a particular observation unlike most mathematicians she did not make abstractions by generalizing from known examples rather she worked directly with abstractions in his obituary of noether her student van der waerden recalled that this is begriffliche mathematik purely conceptual mathematics that was characteristic of noether this style of mathematics was consequently adopted by other mathematicians especially in then new field of abstract algebra example integers as a ring integers form a commutative ring whose elements are integers and combining operations are addition and multiplication any pair of integers can be added or multiplied always resulting in another integer and first operation addition is commutative i e for any elements a and b in ring a b b a second operation multiplication also is commutative but that need not be true for other rings meaning that a combined with b might be different from b combined with a examples of noncommutative rings include matrices and quaternions integers do not form a division ring because second operation cannot always be inverted there is no integer a such that 3 x a 1 integers have additional properties which do not generalize to all commutative rings an important example is fundamental theorem of arithmetic which says that every positive integer can be factored uniquely into prime numbers unique do not always exist in other rings but noether found a unique factorization theorem now called lasker noether theorem for ideals of many rings much of noether s work lay in determining what properties do hold for all rings in devising novel analogs of old integer theorems and in determining minimal set of assumptions required to yield certain properties of rings first epoch 1908 1919 algebraic invariant theory thumb 250px right table 2 from noether s dissertation on invariant theory this table collects 202 of 331 invariants of ternary biquadratic forms these forms are graded in two variables x and u horizontal direction of table lists invariants with increasing grades in x while vertical direction lists them with increasing grades in u much of noether s work in first epoch of her career was associated with invariant theory principally algebraic invariant theory invariant theory is concerned with expressions that remain constant invariant under a group of transformations as an everyday example if a rigid yardstick is rotated coordinates x1 y1 z1 and x2 y2 z2 of its endpoints change but its length l given by formula l2 remains same invariant theory was an active area of research in later nineteenth century prompted in part by felix klein s erlangen program according to which different types of geometry should be characterized by their invariants under transformations e g cross ratio of projective geometry an example of an invariant is discriminant b2 4 a c of a binary quadratic form x a x y b x y c y where x and y are vectors and is dot product or inner product for vectors a b and c are linear operators on vectors typically matrices discriminant is called invariant because it is not changed by linear substitutions x a x b y y c x d y with determinant a d b c 1 these substitutions form special linear group sl2 there are no invariants under general linear group of all invertible linear transformations because these transformations can be multiplication by a scaling factor to remedy this classical invariant theory also considered relative invariants which were forms invariant up to a scale factor one can ask for all polynomials in a b and c that are unchanged by action of sl2 these are called invariants of binary quadratic forms and turn out to be polynomials in discriminant more generally one can ask for invariants of homogeneous polynomials a0 xr ar x0 yr of higher degree which will be certain polynomials in coefficients a0 ar and more generally still one can ask similar question for homogeneous polynomials in more than two variables one of main goals of invariant theory was to solve finite basis problem sum or product of any two invariants is invariant and finite basis problem asked whether it was possible to get all invariants by starting with a finite list of invariants called generators and then adding or multiplying generators together for example discriminant gives a finite basis with one element for invariants of binary quadratic forms noether s advisor paul gordan was known as king of invariant theory and his chief contribution to mathematics was his 1870 solution of finite basis problem for invariants of homogeneous polynomials in two variables he proved this by giving a constructive method for finding all of invariants and their generators but was not able to carry out this constructive approach for invariants in three or more variables in 1890 david hilbert proved a similar statement for invariants of homogeneous polynomials in any number of variables furthermore his method worked not only for special linear group but also for some of its subgroups such as special orthogonal group first epoch 1908 1919 galois theory galois theory concerns transformations of number fields that roots of an equation consider a polynomial equation of a variable x of degree n in which coefficients are drawn from some ground field which might be for example field of real numbers rational numbers or integers modulo 7 there may or may not be choices of x which make this polynomial evaluate to zero such choices if they exist are called roots if polynomial is x2 1 and field is real numbers then polynomial has no roots because any choice of x makes polynomial greater than or equal to one if field is extended however then polynomial may gain roots and if it is extended enough then it always has a number of roots equal to its degree continuing previous example if field is enlarged to complex numbers then polynomial gains two roots i and i where i is imaginary unit that is i 2 1 more generally extension field in which a polynomial can be factored into its roots is known as splitting field of polynomial galois group of a polynomial is set of all transformations of splitting field which preserve ground field and roots of polynomial in mathematical jargon these transformations are called automorphisms galois group of consists of two elements identity transformation which sends every complex number to itself and complex conjugation which sends i to i since galois group does not change ground field it leaves coefficients of polynomial unchanged so it must leave set of all roots unchanged each root can move to another root however so transformation determines a permutation of n roots among themselves significance of galois group derives from fundamental theorem of galois theory which proves that fields lying between ground field and splitting field are in one to one correspondence with subgroups of galois group in 1918 noether published a paper on inverse galois problem instead of determining galois group of transformations of a given field and its extension noether asked whether given a field and a group it always is possible to find an extension of field that has given group as its galois group she reduced this to noether s problem which asks whether fixed field of a subgroup g of permutation group sn acting on field k x1 xn always is a pure transcendental extension of field k she first mentioned this problem in a 1913 paper where she attributed problem to her colleague fischer she showed this was true for n 2 3 or 4 in 1969 r g swan found a counter example to noether s problem with n 47 and g a cyclic group of order 47 although this group can be realized as a galois group over rationals in other ways inverse galois problem remains unsolved first epoch 1908 1919 physics noether was brought to gottingen in 1915 by david hilbert and felix klein who wanted her expertise in invariant theory to help them in understanding general relativity a geometrical theory of gravitation developed mainly by albert einstein hilbert had observed that conservation of energy seemed to be violated in general relativity because gravitational energy could itself gravitate noether provided resolution of this paradox and a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics with noether s first theorem which she proved in 1915 but did not publish until 1918 she not only solved problem for general relativity but also determined conserved quantities for every system of physical laws that possesses some continuous symmetry upon receiving her work einstein wrote to hilbert for illustration if a physical system behaves same regardless of how it is oriented in space physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric from this symmetry noether s theorem shows angular momentum of system must be conserved physical system itself need not be symmetric a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry rather symmetry of physical laws governing system is responsible for conservation law as another example if a physical experiment has same outcome at any place and at any time then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time by noether s theorem these symmetries account for conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system respectively noether s theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics both because of insight it gives into conservation laws and also as a practical calculation tool in teicher 1999 her theorem allows researchers to determine conserved quantities from observed symmetries of a physical system conversely it facilitates description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws for illustration suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered noether s theorem provides a test for theoretical models of phenomenon if theory has a continuous symmetry then noether s theorem guarantees that theory has a conserved quantity and for theory to be correct this conservation must be observable in experiments second epoch 1920 1926 ascending and descending chain conditions in this epoch noether became famous for her deft use of ascending or descending chain conditions a sequence of non empty subsets a1 a2 a3 etc of a set s is usually said to be ascending if each is a subset of next conversely a sequence of subsets of s is called descending if each contains next subset a chain becomes constant after a finite number of steps if there is an n such that for all m n a collection of subsets of a given set satisfies ascending chain condition if any ascending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps it satisfies descending chain condition if any descending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps ascending and descending chain conditions are general meaning that they can be applied to many types of mathematical objects and on surface they might not seem very powerful noether showed how to exploit such conditions however to maximum advantage for example how to use chain conditions to show that every set of sub objects has a maximal minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements these conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof many types of objects in abstract algebra can satisfy chain conditions and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition they are called noetherian in her honor by definition a noetherian ring satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals whereas a noetherian group is defined as a group in which every strictly ascending chain of subgroups is finite a noetherian module is a module in which every strictly ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps a noetherian space is a topological space in which every strictly ascending chain of open subspaces becomes constant after a finite number of steps this definition makes spectrum of a noetherian ring a noetherian topological space chain condition often is inherited by sub objects for example all subspaces of a noetherian space are noetherian themselves all subgroups and quotient groups of a noetherian group are likewise noetherian and mutatis mutandis same holds for submodules and quotient modules of a noetherian module all quotient rings of a noetherian ring are noetherian but that does not necessarily hold for its chain condition also may be inherited by combinations or extensions of a noetherian object for example finite direct sums of noetherian rings are noetherian as is ring of formal power series over a noetherian ring another application of such chain conditions is in noetherian induction also known as well founded induction which is a generalization of mathematical induction it frequently is used to reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection suppose that s is a partially ordered set one way of proving a statement about objects of s is to assume existence of a counterexample and deduce a contradiction thereby proving of original statement basic premise of noetherian induction is that every non empty subset of s contains a minimal element in particular set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element minimal counterexample in order to prove original statement therefore it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker for any counter example there is a smaller counter example second epoch 1920 1926 commutative rings ideals and modules noether s paper idealtheorie in ringbereichen theory of ideals in ring domains 1921 is foundation of general commutative ring theory and gives one of first general definitions of a commutative ring before her paper most results in commutative algebra were restricted to special examples of commutative rings such as polynomial rings over fields or rings of algebraic integers noether proved that in a ring which satisfies ascending chain condition on ideals every ideal is finitely generated in 1943 french mathematician claude coined term noetherian ring to describe this property a major result in noether s 1921 paper is lasker noether theorem which extends lasker s theorem on primary decomposition of ideals of polynomial rings to all noetherian rings lasker noether theorem can be viewed as a generalization of fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that any positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers and that this decomposition is unique noether s work aufbau der idealtheorie in algebraischen und funktionenkorpern abstract structure of theory of ideals in algebraic number and function fields 1927 characterized rings in which ideals have unique factorization into prime ideals as dedekind domains integral domains that are noetherian 0 or 1 dimensional and integrally closed in their quotient fields this paper also contains what now are called isomorphism theorems which describe some fundamental natural isomorphisms and some other basic results on noetherian and modules second epoch 1920 1926 elimination theory in 1923 1924 noether applied her ideal theory to elimination theory in a formulation that she attributed to her student kurt hentzelt she showed that fundamental theorems about factorization of polynomials could be carried over directly traditionally elimination theory is concerned with eliminating one or more variables from a system of polynomial equations usually by method of for illustration a system of equations often can be written in form m v 0 where a matrix or linear transform m without variable x times a vector v that only has non zero powers of x is equal to zero vector 0 hence determinant of matrix m must be zero providing a new equation in which variable x has been eliminated second epoch 1920 1926 invariant theory of finite groups techniques such as hilbert s original non constructive solution to finite basis problem could not be used to get quantitative information about invariants of a group action and furthermore they did not apply to all group actions in her 1915 paper noether found a solution to finite basis problem for a finite group of transformations g acting on a finite dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero her solution shows that ring of invariants is generated by homogeneous invariants whose degree is less than or equal to order of finite group this is called noether s bound her paper gave two proofs of noether s bound both of which also work when characteristic of field is to g factorial of order g of group g degrees of generators need not satisfy noether s bound when characteristic of field divides number g but noether was not able to determine whether this bound was correct when characteristic of field divides g but not g for many years determining truth or falsehood of this bound for this particular case was an open problem called noether s gap it was finally solved independently by fleischmann in 2000 and fogarty in 2001 who both showed that bound remains true in her 1926 paper noether extended hilbert s theorem to representations of a finite group over any field new case that did not follow from hilbert s work is when characteristic of field divides order of group noether s result was later extended by william haboush to all reductive groups by his proof of mumford conjecture in this paper noether also introduced noether normalization lemma showing that a finitely generated domain a over a field k has a set x1 xn of algebraically independent elements such that a is integral over k x1 xn second epoch 1920 1926 contributions to topology thumb right 250px a continuous deformation of a coffee cup into a doughnut torus and back as noted by pavel alexandrov and hermann weyl in their obituaries noether s contributions to topology illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics in topology mathematicians study properties of objects that remain invariant even under deformation properties such as their connectedness an old joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug since they can be continuously deformed into one another noether is credited with fundamental ideas that led to development of algebraic topology from earlier combinatorial topology specifically idea of homology groups according to account of alexandrov noether attended lectures given by heinz hopf and by him in summers of 1926 and 1927 where she continually made observations which were often deep and subtle and he continues that noether s suggestion that topology be studied algebraically was adopted immediately by hopf alexandrov and others and it became a frequent topic of discussion among mathematicians of gottingen hirzebruch friedrich emmy noether and topology in noether observed that her idea of a betti group makes euler poincare formula simpler to understand and hopf s own work on this subject bears imprint of these remarks of emmy noether noether mentions her own topology ideas only as an aside in a 1926 publication where she cites it as an application of group theory in this algebraic approach to topology was also developed independently in austria in a 1926 1927 course given in vienna leopold defined a homology group which was developed by walther mayer into an axiomatic definition in 1928 hirzebruch friedrich emmy noether and topology in thumb upright right helmut hasse worked with noether and others to found theory of central simple algebras third epoch 1927 1935 hypercomplex numbers and representation theory much work on hypercomplex numbers and group representations was carried out in nineteenth and early twentieth centuries but remained disparate noether united these results and gave first general representation theory of groups and algebras briefly noether subsumed structure theory of associative algebras and representation theory of groups into a single arithmetic theory of modules and ideals in rings satisfying ascending chain conditions this single work by noether was of fundamental importance for development of modern algebra third epoch 1927 1935 noncommutative algebra noether also was responsible for a number of other advances in field of algebra with emil artin richard brauer and helmut hasse she founded theory of central simple algebras a paper by noether helmut hasse and richard brauer pertains to division algebras which are algebraic systems in which division is possible they proved two important theorems a local global theorem stating that if a finite dimensional central division algebra over a number field splits locally everywhere then it splits globally so is trivial and from this deduced their main theorem every finite dimensional central division algebra over an algebraic number field f splits over a cyclic cyclotomic extension these theorems allow one to classify all finite dimensional central division algebras over a given number field a subsequent paper by noether showed as a special case of a more general theorem that all maximal subfields of a division algebra d are splitting fields this paper also contains skolem noether theorem which states that any two embeddings of an extension of a field k into a finite dimensional central simple algebra over k are conjugate brauer noether theorem gives a characterization of splitting fields of a central division algebra over a field assessment recognition and memorials thumb 250px right emmy noether campus at university of siegen is home to its mathematics and physics departments noether s work continues to be relevant for development of theoretical physics and mathematics and she is consistently ranked as one of greatest mathematicians of twentieth century in his obituary fellow algebraist bl van der waerden says that her mathematical originality was absolute beyond comparison and hermann weyl said that noether changed face of algebra by her work during her lifetime and even until today noether has been characterized as greatest woman mathematician in recorded history by mathematicians such as pavel alexandrov hermann weyl and jean dieudonne in a letter to new york times albert einstein wrote also online at mactutor history of mathematics archive on 2 january 1935 a few months before her death mathematician norbert wiener wrote that at an exhibition at 1964 world s fair devoted to modern mathematicians noether was only woman represented among notable mathematicians of modern world noether s birthday noether has been honored
