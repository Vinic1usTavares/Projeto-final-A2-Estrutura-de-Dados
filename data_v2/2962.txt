production thumb left upright damien chazelle first conceived idea for film while attending harvard university with justin hurwitz film s composer as a drummer damien chazelle has a predilection for musical films he wrote screenplay for la la land in 2010 when film industry seemed out of reach for him his idea was to take old musical but ground it in real life where things don t always exactly work out and to salute creative people who move to los angeles to chase their dreams he conceived film when he was a student at harvard university with his classmate justin hurwitz two explored concept in their senior thesis through a low budget musical about a boston jazz musician guy and madeline on a park bench chazelle was moved by tradition of 1920s city symphony films such as manhattan 1921 and man with a movie camera 1929 that paid tribute to cities after graduating both moved to los angeles in 2010 and continued writing script but made a few modifications such as altering location to los angeles instead of boston rather than trying to match l a to charms of paris or san francisco he focused on qualities that make city distinctive traffic sprawl and skylines style and tone of film were inspired by jacques demy s umbrellas of cherbourg and young girls of rochefort especially latter which was more dance and jazz oriented film also makes visual allusions to hollywood classics such as broadway melody of 1940 singin in rain band wagon and an american in paris about an american in paris chazelle commented that s a movie that we just pillaged it s an awesome example of how daring some of those old musicals really were it shares some character development and themes with chazelle s previous musical work whiplash chazelle said they re both about struggle of being an artist and reconciling your dreams with need to be human la la land is just much less angry about it he said that both films reflect his own experiences as a filmmaker working his way up hollywood ladder la la land in particular is inspired by his experience of moving from east coast with preconceived notions of what l a would be like that it was all just strip malls and freeways chazelle was unable to produce film for years as no studio was willing to finance an original contemporary musical with no familiar songs it was also a jazz musical which hollywood reporter called an extinct genre he believed that since he and hurwitz were unknown at that time it might have made financiers dubious about project s potential chazelle found producers through friends who introduced him to fred berger and jordan horowitz with two producers on board script went to focus features at a budget of around 1 million studio demanded alterations male lead was asked to be changed from a jazz pianist to a rock musician complicated opening number had to be altered and story s bittersweet ending needed to be dropped chazelle scrapped project and moved on chazelle later wrote whiplash which was an easier concept to sell and a less risky investment after whiplash was well received by critics upon its premiere at 2014 sundance film festival in january chazelle continued his efforts to bring la la land to big screen a year later when whiplash earned five oscar nominations at 87th academy awards including best picture and grossed nearly 50 million worldwide off a 3 3 million production budget chazelle and his project began to attract attention from studios five years after chazelle wrote script summit entertainment and black label media along with producer marc platt agreed to invest in la la land and distribute it they had been impressed by critical and commercial success of whiplash lionsgate s patrick who previously had worked on step up franchise pushed chazelle to increase film s budget since he felt high quality musicals could not be made cheaply casting initially miles teller and emma watson were slated to star in leads watson dropped out because of a commitment to 2017 musical adaptation of beauty and beast while teller departed via long contract negotiations conversely gosling turned down a role as beast in beauty and beast in favor of la la land chazelle decided to make his characters somewhat older with experience in struggling to make their dreams rather than younger newcomers just arriving in los angeles emma stone plays mia a struggling actress in los angeles stone has loved musicals since she saw les miserables when she was eight years old saying that bursting into song has always been a real dream of mine and that her favorite film is 1931 charlie chaplin romantic comedy city lights she studied pom dancing as a child with a year of ballet she moved to hollywood with her mother at age of 15 to pursue a career and struggled constantly to get an audition during her first year when she did she often was turned away after singing or saying just one line stone drew from her own experiences for her character of mia and some were added into film thumb right upright ryan gosling learned tap dancing and piano for his role she met chazelle in 2014 while she was making her broadway debut in cabaret chazelle and hurwitz saw her perform on a night when actress had a cold she met with chazelle at brooklyn diner in new york city where director outlined his vision for planned film stone gained confidence from performing in cabaret to handle demands of film in preparation for her role stone watched some of musical movies that inspired chazelle including umbrellas of cherbourg and fred astaire and ginger rogers collaborations stone accepted offer because chazelle was so passionate about project ryan gosling plays sebastian a jazz pianist like stone gosling drew from his own experiences as an aspiring artist one incident was used for mia gosling was performing a crying scene in an audition and casting director took a phone call during it talking about her lunch plans while he was emoting chazelle met with gosling at a bar near latter s home in hollywood hills when gosling was about to begin filming for big short chazelle cast two immediately after summit bought film he said two feel like closest thing that we have right now to an old hollywood couple as akin to spencer tracy and katharine hepburn fred astaire and ginger rogers humphrey bogart and lauren bacall and myrna loy and william powell film marked third collaboration between gosling and stone following crazy stupid love 2011 and gangster squad 2013 chazelle asked two about their audition disasters when they were both trying to make it both learned how to sing and dance for film s six original tunes rest of cast j k simmons sonoya mizuno jessica rothe callie hernandez finn wittrock rosemarie dewitt john legend jason fuchs meagen fay were announced between july and august 2015 legend plays keith a long time friend of sebastian film was choreographed by mandy moore rehearsals took place at a production office in atwater village los angeles over span of three to four months beginning in may 2015 gosling practiced piano in one room stone worked with moore in another and costume designer mary zophres had her own corner of complex gosling with no previous experience had to learn how to play piano as no hand models were used moore emphasized working on emotion rather than technique which stone said was key when they filmed prius car scene to help his cast and crew get their creative mode flowing chazelle held screenings on soundstages every friday night of classical films that had inspired him for film including umbrellas of cherbourg singin in rain top hat and boogie nights filming from beginning chazelle wanted film s musical numbers to be filmed head to toe and performed in a single take like those of 1930s works of fred astaire and ginger rogers he also wanted film to emulate widescreen cinemascope look of 1950s musicals such as it s always fair weather consequently movie was shot on celluloid film not digitally with panavision equipment in cinemascope s 2 55 1 aspect ratio but not in true cinemascope as that technology is no longer available chazelle wanted los angeles to be primary setting for his film commenting that there is something very poetic about city i think about a city that is built by people with these unrealistic dreams and people who kind of just put it all on line for that principal photography on film officially began in city on august 10 2015 and filming took place in more than 60 locations both in and near los angeles including angels flight trolley in downtown houses in hollywood hills colorado street bridge rialto theatre in south pasadena warner bros studio lot grand central market hermosa beach s lighthouse cafe griffith observatory griffith park chateau marmont and watts towers with many scenes shot in one take it took 40 days to complete shooting finishing in mid september 2015 opening pre credits sequence was first to be shot and was filmed on a closed off portion of two carpool direct connector ramps of judge harry interchange connecting i 105 carpool lane to i 110 express lanes leading to downtown los angeles it was filmed in a span of two days and required over 100 dancers for this particular scene chazelle wanted to give a sense of how vast city is scene was originally planned for a stretch of ground level highway until chazelle decided to shoot it in 105 110 interchange which arcs in air production designer david wasco said i thought somebody was going to fall off and get killed not every portion of highway was blocked chazelle compared scene to yellow brick road leading to emerald city in wizard of oz 1939 thumb left upright 1 05 angels flight pictured which was shut down for about four years including at time of filming was re opened for a single day exclusively for film to shoot a scene chazelle scouted for old l a locations that were in ruins or were perhaps razed one such example was use of angels flight trolley built in 1901 funicular had been closed in 2013 after a derailment attempts were made to repair and re open railway but to no avail however production team was able to secure permission to use it for a day chazelle and his crew then arranged to have it run for shooting it was re opened to public in 2017 mia works at a coffee shop on warner bros studio lot chazelle considered studio lots to be monuments of hollywood production designer wasco created numerous fake old film posters chazelle occasionally created names for them deciding to use title of his first feature guy and madeline on a park bench 2009 for one poster which reimagines it as a 1930s musical six minute long prius car scene had to be completed during brief magic hour moment at sunset it took eight takes and two days to shoot it when ryan gosling and emma stone finally nailed it everybody just exploded stone said since gosling and stone were not primarily dancers two made a number of mistakes especially during long uninterrupted single take musical numbers however chazelle was very sympathetic towards them understanding their lack of experience and not minding their errors while shooting sebastian and mia s first dance together stone stumbled over back of a bench but picked right up and kept on going with scene argument during romantic dinner that sebastian prepared for mia was one of scenes that was re written more than any other gosling and stone also helped create dialogue of scene to get it to be one of more realistic scenes in a film filled with fantasy and fantastical elements chazelle spent nearly a year editing film with editor tom cross as two were primarily concerned with getting tone right music songs and score for la la land were composed and orchestrated by justin hurwitz chazelle s harvard university classmate who also worked on his two prior films lyrics were written by pasek and paul except for start a fire which was written by john legend hurwitz marius de vries and angelique a soundtrack album was released on december 9 2016 by interscope records featuring selections from hurwitz s score and songs performed by cast release la la land had its world premiere as

middleburg film festival in late october 2016 virginia film festival held at university of virginia on november 6 2016 and afi fest on november 15 2016 film was originally set for a july 15 2016 release however in march 2016 it was announced film would be given a limited release starting december 2 2016 before expanding on december 16 2016 chazelle stated that change was because he felt that release date was not right for context of film and because he wanted to have a slow rollout beginning with early fall film festivals film was later pushed back a week to december 9 2016 with wide release still being planned for december 16 2016 lionsgate opened film in five locations on december 9 2016 and expanded it to about 200 theaters on december 16 2016 before going nationwide on
