right alt a headshot of a man seated at a microphone tooms was directed by david nutter who crew felt was best director working on x files devising a sequel to squeeze posed a challenge for writers glen morgan and james wong who had never written a follow up to any of their work previously morgan felt that primary difficulty was in moving story forward while still leaving room to recap what had happened previously for benefit of viewers who had not seen first episode this led to use of courtroom scene as a means to repeat any necessary information morgan also felt that harry longstreet initial director for squeeze had been a problem and a second episode allowed for use of scenes which longstreet had failed to film for earlier episode to this end episode was helmed by david nutter who series creator chris carter considered best director working on series morgan was inspired to write this episode after seeing men working on an open escalator in a mall around christmas time he thought of scare factor from a creature living underneath escalator and felt tooms would be perfect choice for creature tooms was first villain in show s history to make an appearance in a second episode it was actor doug hutchison s idea to play tooms nude during escalator sequence a decision which carter felt caused a little discomfort but that actually added to scene bile like substance coating tooms and his nest was actually a yellow piping gel which cast found would stick to their skin and pull out hair upon removal tooms framing mulder for assault seems to have been inspired by a similar plot point in film dirty harry tooms introduced character of walter skinner although this would be his only appearance in first season character had been conceived as playing against stereotypical bureaucratic paper pusher being instead someone more quietly dynamic actor mitch pileggi had auditioned unsuccessfully for several other parts on series before being cast as skinner at first fact that he was asked back to audition for role had puzzled him until he discovered reason he had not been cast for previous parts chris carter had been unable to imagine pileggi as any of those characters due to fact that actor had been shaving his head when pileggi attended audition for skinner he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow back pileggi s attitude fit well with character of skinner causing carter to assume that actor was only pretending to be grumpy after successfully auditioning for role pileggi thought he had been lucky that he had not been cast in one of earlier roles as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed opportunity to play recurring role of skinner episode s climactic scene in shopping mall where tooms had made his nest was filmed in city square mall vancouver shooting at location required permission of every store owner on premises and care was taken to ensure that stage blood used for escalator scene did not seep into escalator s motor to avoid possible damage tooms includes smoking man s first line of dialogue in series and his only lines of first season carter was initially unsure that character would ever receive any dialogue feeling that he would seem more forbidding if he remained silent however he described actor william b davis as an extremely competent actor noting character s increasing popularity reception tooms premiered on fox network on april 22 1994 and was first broadcast in united kingdom on bbc two on february 16 1995 this episode earned a nielsen rating of 8 6 with a 15 share meaning that roughly 8 6 percent of all television equipped households and 15 percent of households watching television were tuned in to episode it was viewed by 8 1 million households in a retrospective of first season in entertainment weekly tooms was rated an a with hutchison s appearance being noted as another sublimely slimy performance whilst pileggi s performance was said to have an engagingly steely presence zack handlen writing for a v club called episode a richly rewarding one finding interaction between characters of mulder and scully to have been a highlight of episode however handlen felt that some of episode s plot development was ultimately needless and found motives of several characters to have been unexplained and baffling matt haigh writing for den of geek felt that plot thread of tooms framing mulder for assault never really amounts to much though he felt that episode showed tooms to be a creepier villain than his previous appearance in squeeze robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to x files millennium lone gunmen rated episode four and a half stars out of five finding it to be a better instalment than squeeze shearman felt that episode featured very little plotting consisting simply of a series of set pieces but considered its wit and character development to adequately compensate for this character of eugene tooms has also attracted positive criticism author neil gaiman listed character of eugene tooms as one of his favourite monsters in a guest column for entertainment weeklys 1 000th issue whilst ugo networks listed character as one of their best tv serial killers describing hutchison s acting as uber creepy writing for den of geek john moore listed eugene tooms as his top 10 x files baddies noting that popularity of both squeeze and tooms proved to be largely responsible for shifting emphasis of show away from dwelling solely on alien conspiracy
