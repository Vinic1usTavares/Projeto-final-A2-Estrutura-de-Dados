battle of arsuf was a battle of third crusade in which richard i of england defeated forces of ayyubid leader saladin battle took place just outside of arsuf where saladin attacked richard s army as it was moving from acre to jaffa following a series of harassing attacks by saladin s forces battle was joined on morning of 7 september 1191 richard s army successfully resisted attempts to disrupt its cohesion until hospitallers broke ranks and charged richard then committed all his forces to attack he regrouped his army after its initial success and led it to victory battle resulted in coastal area of central palestine including port of jaffa returning to christian control prelude south from acre thumb 170px left map showing progress of third crusade following capture of acre in 1191 richard was aware that he needed to capture port of jaffa before making an attempt on jerusalem richard began to march down coast from acre towards jaffa in august 1191 saladin whose main objective was to prevent recapture of jerusalem mobilised his army to attempt to stop crusaders advance richard organised advance with attention to detail a large part of egyptian fleet had been captured at fall of acre and with no threat from this quarter he could march south along coast with sea always protecting his right flank gillingham p 187 mindful of lessons of disaster at hattin richard knew that his army s greatest need was water and that heat exhaustion was its greatest danger although pressed for time he proceeded at a relatively slow pace he marched his army only in morning before heat of day making frequent rest stops always beside sources of water fleet sailed down coast in close support a source of supplies and a refuge for wounded aware of ever present danger of enemy raiders and possibility of hit and run attacks he kept column in tight formation with a core of twelve mounted regiments each with a hundred knights infantry marched on landward flank covering flanks of horsemen and affording them some protection from missiles outermost ranks of infantry were composed of crossbowmen on seaward side was baggage and also units of infantry being rested from continuous harassment inflicted by saladin s forces richard wisely rotated his infantry units to keep them relatively fresh oman pp 309 p 234 though provoked and tormented by skirmish tactics of saladin s archers richard s generalship ensured that order and discipline were maintained under most difficult of circumstances nicholson p 241 baha al din ibn shaddad muslim chronicler and eyewitness describes march moslems discharged arrows at them from all sides to annoy them and force them to charge but in this they were unsuccessful these men exercised wonderful self control they went on their way without any hurry whilst their ships followed their line of march along coast and in this manner they reached their halting place baha al din part ii ch cxvii p 283 baha al din also described difference in power between crusader crossbow and bows of his own army he saw frankish infantrymen with from one to ten arrows sticking from their armoured backs marching along with no apparent hurt whilst crossbows struck down both horse and man amongst muslims oman p 309 saladin s strategy thumb right 300px near east 1190 at outset of third crusade showing location of battle of arsuf acre and other strategic sites crusader army s pace was dictated by infantry and baggage train ayyubid army being largely mounted had advantage of superior mobility gillingham p 186 efforts to burn crops and deny countryside to frankish army were largely ineffective as it could be continuously provisioned from fleet which moved south parallel with it on 25 august crusader rearguard was crossing a defile when it was almost cut off however crusaders closed up so speedily that muslim soldiery was forced to flee from 26 to 29 august richard s army had a respite from attack because while it hugged coast and had gone round shoulder of mount carmel saladin s army had struck across country saladin arrived in vicinity of caesarea before crusaders who were on a longer road from 30 august to 7 september saladin was always within striking distance and waiting for an opportunity to attack if crusaders exposed themselves oman p 308 verbruggen p 235 by early september saladin had realised that harassing frankish army with a limited portion of his troops was not going to stop its advance in order to do this he needed to commit his entire army to a serious attack fortuitously for saladin crusaders had to traverse one of few forested regions of palestine wood of arsuf which ran parallel to sea shore for more than woodland would mask disposition of his army and allow a sudden attack to be launched oman pp 310 311 gillingham p 188 verbruggen pp 235 236 crusaders traversed half of forest with little incident and they rested on 6 september with their camp protected by marsh lying inland of mouth of river nahr el called by them to south of camp in crusaders needed to march before gaining ruins of arsuf forest receded inland to create a narrow plain wide between wooded hills and sea this is where saladin intended to make his decisive attack while threatening and skirmishing along whole length of crusader column saladin reserved his most sustained direct assault for its rear his plan appears to have been to allow frankish van and centre to proceed in hope that a fatal gap might be created between them and more heavily engaged rearmost units into such a gap saladin would have thrown his reserves in order to defeat crusaders in detail oman pp 312 battle estimates of size of opposing armies itinerarium regis ricardi implies that ayyubid army outnumbered crusaders three to one however unrealistically inflated numbers of 300 000 and 100 000 respectively are described anonymous translation of itinerarium book iv ch xvi p 175 modern estimates of saladin s army place it at around 25 000 soldiers almost all cavalry horse archers light cavalry and a minority of heavy cavalry boas p 78 based on number of soldiers that three kings brought to holy land as well as what troops kingdom of jerusalem could muster mclynn calculates total crusader forces at arsuf as numbering 20 000 9 000 english and norman troops brought by richard 7 000 french troops left by phillip 2 000 troops from outremer and 2 000 more soldiers from every other source danes frisians genoese pisans boas notes that this calculation doesn t account for losses in earlier battles or desertions but that it is probable that crusader army had 10 000 men and perhaps more boas adrian crusader world 2015 page 78 cambridge illustrated atlas of warfare lists richard s army as possessing 10 000 infantry including spearmen and crossbowmen and 1 200 heavy cavalry with saladin s army possessing twice as many men with a preponderance of cavalry bennett matthew cambridge illustrated atlas of warfare middle ages 768 1487 vol 1 january 26 1996 page 101 organisation and deployment of armies at dawn on 7 september 1191 as richard s forces began moving out of camp enemy scouts were visible in all directions hinting that saladin s whole army lay hidden in woodland king richard took especial pains over disposition of his army probable posts of greatest danger at front and especially rear of column were given to military orders they had most experience of fighting in east were arguably most disciplined and were only formations which included cavalry who fought like turkish horse archers of ayyubid army oman p 307 vanguard of crusader army consisted of knights templar under robert de sable they were followed by three units composed of richard s own subjects angevins and bretons then poitevins including guy of lusignan titular king of jerusalem and lastly english and normans who had charge of great standard mounted on its waggon next seven corps were made up of french barons of outremer and small contingents of crusaders from other lands forming rearguard were knights hospitaller led by garnier de nablus twelve corps were organised into five larger formations though their precise distribution is unknown additionally a small troop under leadership of henry ii of champagne was detached to scout towards hills and a squadron of picked knights under king richard and hugh of burgundy leader of french contingent was detailed to ride up and down column checking on saladin s movements and ensuring that their own ranks were kept in order oman pp 311 312 verbruggen p 236 first saracen attack did not come until all crusaders had left their camp and were moving towards arsuf ayyubid army then burst out of woodland front of army was composed of dense swarms of skirmishers both horse and foot bedouin sudanese archers and lighter types of turkish horse archers behind these were ordered squadrons of armoured heavy cavalry saladin s mamluks also termed kurdish troops and contingents of emirs and princes of egypt syria and mesopotamia army was divided into three parts left and right wings and centre saladin directed his army from beneath his banners surrounded by his bodyguard and accompanied by his kettle drummers oman p 312 saladin s attack thumb right king richard i charging with couched lance english floor tile c 1250 in an attempt to destroy cohesion of crusader army and unsettle their resolve ayyubid onslaught was accompanied by clashing of cymbals and gongs trumpets blowing and men screaming war cries gillingham p 189 in truth our people so few in number were hemmed in by multitudes of saracens that they had no means of escape if they tried neither did they seem to have valour sufficient to withstand so many foes nay they were shut in like a flock of sheep in jaws of wolves with nothing but sky above and enemy all around them anonymous translation of itinerarium book iv ch xviii p 178 repeated ayyubid harrying attacks followed same pattern bedouin and nubians on foot launched arrows and javelins into enemy lines before parting to allow mounted archers to advance attack and wheel off a well practiced technique crusader crossbowmen responded when this was possible although chief task among crusaders was simply to preserve their ranks in face of sustained provocation when incessant attacks of skirmishers failed to have desired effect weight of attack was switched to rear of crusader column with hospitallers coming under greatest pressure verbruggen p 237 here right wing of ayyubid army made a desperate attack on squadron of hospitaller knights and infantry corps covering them hospitallers could be attacked from both their rear and flank many of hospitaller infantry had to walk backwards in order to keep their faces and shields to enemy oman p 313 saladin eager to urge his soldiers into closer combat personally entered fray accompanied by two pages leading spare horses sayf al din saladin s brother was also engaged in actively encouraging troops both brothers were thus exposing themselves to considerable danger from crossbow fire baha al din part ii ch cxxii p 290 oman pp 313 314 hospitallers break ranks all saladin s best efforts could not dislocate crusader column or halt its advance in direction of arsuf richard was determined to hold his army together forcing enemy to exhaust themselves in repeated charges with intention of holding his knights for a concentrated counter attack at just right moment there were risks in this because army was not only marching under severe enemy provocation but troops were suffering from heat and thirst just as serious saracens were killing so many horses that some of richard s own knights began to wonder if a counter strike would be possible many of unhorsed knights joined infantry gillingham p pp 236 237 just as vanguard entered arsuf in middle of afternoon hospitaller crossbowmen to rear were having to load and fire walking backwards inevitably they lost cohesion and enemy was quick to take advantage of this opportunity moving into any gap wielding their swords and maces for crusaders battle of arsuf had now entered a critical stage garnier de nablus repeatedly pleaded with richard to be allowed to attack he was refused master was ordered to maintain position and await signal for a general assault six clear trumpet blasts richard knew that charge of his knights needed to be reserved until ayyubid army was fully committed closely engaged and saracens horses had begun to tire gillingham p 189 goaded beyond endurance master and another knight baldwin de carron thrust their way through their own infantry and charged into saracen ranks with a cry of st george they were then followed by rest of hospitaller knights itinerarium book vi ch iv pp 251 2 verbruggen p 237 moved by this example french knights of corps immediately preceding hospitallers also charged oman p 314 crusader counterattack thumb 300px richard lionheart and saladin at battle of arsuf by gustave dore precipitate action of hospitallers could have caused richard s whole strategy to unravel however he recognised that counterattack once started had to be supported by all his army and ordered signal for a general charge to be sounded unsupported hospitallers and other rear units involved in initial breakout would have been overwhelmed by superior numbers of enemy gillingham p 190 frankish infantry opened gaps in their ranks for knights to pass through and attack naturally developed in echelon from rear to van to soldiers of saladin s army as baha al din noted sudden change from passivity to ferocious activity on part of crusaders was disconcerting and appeared to be result of a preconceived plan oman p 315 having already been engaged in close combat with rear of crusader column right wing of ayyubid army was in compact formation and too close to their enemy to avoid full impact of charge indeed some of cavalry of this wing had dismounted in order to fire their bows more effectively verbruggen p 238 as a result they suffered great numbers of casualties knights taking a bloody revenge for all they had had to endure earlier in battle baha al din noted that rout was complete he had been in centre division of saladin s army when it turned in flight he looked to join left wing but found that it also was in rapid flight noting disintegration of right wing he finally sought saladin s personal banners but found only seventeen members of bodyguard and a lone drummer still with them baha al din part ii ch cxxii p 291 oman pp 315 316 being aware that an over rash pursuit was greatest danger when fighting armies trained in fluid tactics of turks richard halted charge after about had been covered right flank crusader units which had formed van of column including english and normans had not yet been heavily engaged in close combat and they formed a reserve on which rest regrouped freed from pressure of being actively pursued many of ayyubid troops turned to cut down those of knights who had unwisely drawn ahead of rest james d avesnes commander of one of franco flemish units was most prominent of those killed in this episode amongst ayyubid leaders who rallied quickly and returned to fight was taqi al din saladin s nephew he led 700 men of sultan s own bodyguard against richard s left flank once their squadrons were back in order richard led his knights in a second charge and forces of saladin broke once again oman p p 238 leading by example richard was in heart of fighting as itinerarium describes there king fierce extraordinary king cut down turks in every direction and none could escape force of his arm for wherever he turned brandishing his sword he carved a wide path for himself and as he advanced and gave repeated strokes with his sword cutting them down like a reaper with his sickle rest warned by sight of dying gave him more ample space for corpses of dead turks which lay on face of earth extended over half a mile anonymous translation of itinerarium book iv ch xix p 182 alert to danger presented to his scattered ranks richard prudent as ever halted and regrouped his forces once more after a further pursuit ayyubid cavalry turned once again showing they still had stomach to renew fight however a third and final charge caused them to scatter into woodland where they dispersed into hills in all directions showing no inclination to continue conflict richard led his cavalry back to arsuf where infantry had pitched camp during night saracen dead were looted oman pp 316 317 aftermath thumb 350px right imaginary encounter between richard lionheart and a saracen 13th century manuscript as always with medieval battles losses are difficult to assess with any precision christian chroniclers claim that saladin s force lost 32 emirs and 7 000 men but it is possible that true number may have been fewer ambroise mentions that richard s troops counted several thousand bodies of dead saracen soldiers on field of battle after rout baha al din records only three deaths amongst leaders of ayyubid army grand emir of kurds kaimaz el and king richard s own dead are said to have numbered no more than 700 only crusader leader of note to die in battle was james d avesnes a french knight of whom ambroise made claim that he cut down 15 saracen cavalrymen before being killed baha al din part ii ch cxxii p p p 121 122 arsuf was an important victory ayyubid army was not destroyed despite considerable casualties it suffered but it did rout this was considered shameful by muslims and boosted morale of crusaders a contemporary opinion stated that had richard been able to choose moment to unleash his knights rather than having to react to actions of an insubordinate unit commander crusader victory might have been much more effective possibly being so complete a victory that it would have disabled saladin s forces for a long time anonymous translation of itinerarium book iv ch xix pp 180 p 317 after rout saladin was able to regroup and attempted to resume his skirmishing method of warfare but to little effect shaken by crusaders sudden and devastatingly effective counterattack at arsuf he was no longer willing to risk a further full scale attack arsuf had dented saladin s reputation as an invincible warrior and proved richard s courage as a soldier and his skill as a commander richard was able to take defend and hold jaffa a strategically crucial move toward securing jerusalem also saladin had to evacuate and demolish most of fortresses of southern palestine ascalon gaza blanche garde lydda and ramleh as he realised he could not hold them richard took fortress of darum sole fortress that saladin had garrisoned with only his own household troops so low had saracen morale been reduced by depriving saladin of coast richard seriously threatened saladin s hold on jerusalem oman pp 317 p 239 although third crusade in end failed to retake jerusalem a three year truce was eventually negotiated with saladin truce known as treaty of jaffa ensured that christian pilgrims from west would once again be allowed to visit jerusalem saladin also recognised crusaders control of levantine coast as far south as jaffa both sides had become exhausted by struggle richard needed to return to europe in order to protect his patrimony from aggression of philip of france and palestine was in a ruinous state runciman pp 72 73 references bibliography primary sources ambroise history of holy war translated by
