455 456 strong s time as governor was also marked by virulent political debate in state principally over foreign policy related to british interference with massachusetts maritime trade that interference was a consequence of ongoing napoleonic wars engulfing europe over years of strong s tenure republicans gradually gained in power both nationally and in massachusetts hart pp 3 456 457 in 1806 election republicans secured a majority in massachusetts assembly and gubernatorial election was notably close running mainly against james sullivan strong barely received a majority of votes cast with fewer than 200 votes in balance republican controlled legislature scrutinized returns in a partisan manner discarding ballots that had misspelled strong s name while retaining those that misspelled sullivan s and performing tallies in ways that favored their candidate this process concluded with a finding that strong in fact lacked a majority of votes which was what was then required to carry election as opposed to modern plurality requirement strong s federalist allies in legislature were able to publicize partisan nature of analysis resulting in a hostile public backlash he was proclaimed winner after further less biased analysis corrected count in his favor morison p 272 however in 1807 election rising tide of republicanism swept strong along with other new england

sought a strong candidate to oppose elbridge gerry who had been victorious against christopher gore in previous two elections buel p 147 gerry who had originally been somewhat moderate became increasingly partisan during his tenure and federalists viewed strong s earlier success in office and relatively modest demeanor as assets strong s victory in election which saw federalists also regain control of legislature was attributed to several factors federalists capitalized on partisanship of recent redistricting of state that resulted in coining of term gerrymander and there was strong antiwar sentiment in state buel pp 147 149 strong was reelected by wide margins in following war years buel pp 175 202 thumb left fort adams principal defense of boston harbor in 1789 it was later rededicated fort independence butler et al p 10 strong took a principled stand against war of 1812 generally refusing to assist federal government efforts to prosecute war strong was part of a chorus of massachusetts and more broadly new england federalists who complained that in mr madison s war federal government was trampling state and individual rights stuart p 109 he adhered to view that state militia could not be required to serve under regular army command buel p 166 when first such requests were made by u s army general henry dearborn strong with backing of not just governor s council but also supreme judicial court refused arguing that there was no need to call out militia because invasion was not imminent hickey p 590 because of his stance against regular army command state was denied a shipment of arms that was instead diverted to frontier areas and war theater buel p 176 strong also took no particular actions to prevent widespread smuggling along state s frontiers with neighboring british provinces stuart pp 89 90 strong s opposition to regular army control was more nuanced than that of neighboring connecticut governor john cotton smith who ensured that his militia always remained under state command hickey pp 592 593 strong was more concerned that state militia not be used except in defense of state s borders and compromised on issue of command in 1812 not long after refusing general dearborn s request he authorized dispatch of militia companies to state s eastern district now maine under united states army command hickey p 594 with british naval blockade tightening and threatening state s coastal communities in early 1814 strong authorized u s brigadier general thomas h cushing to command militia forces in defenses of boston harbor subject to reasonable limitations cushing was transferred to connecticut and general dearborn again commanded regular army forces in massachusetts dearborn interpreted agreement strong had made with cushing to apply statewide and began reorganizing militia companies to conform to regular army practices hickey p 595 this engendered ill will among militia and strong refused to place additional levies under dearborn s command hickey p 596 thumb right upright british general sir john coape sherbrooke lieutenant governor of nova scotia and leader of expedition that in 1814 occupied castine defense of maine however proved problematic strong s aide william h sumner negotiated an agreement with army command for defense of portland but ironically republican dominated district militia objected first to idea of serving under any regular army leadership and then to serving under a relatively low ranked officer a lieutenant colonel who was given command of portland after agreement was signed several units of local militia refused perform their assigned duties hickey pp 596 597 one consequence of dispute was that most militia in state remained under state control and were thus paid for from state coffers at a cost that ran to 200 000 per month hickey p 598 this further strained state economy which was already suffering due to british blockade hickey pp 599 600 following british seizure of castine in september 1814 strong called legislature into session early in october to respond to occupation buel p 212 given that federal government was unwilling to fund militia not under its control legislature authorized strong to borrow money to fund a major expansion of militia but most of funds acquired were spent improving boston s defenses banks p 60 another result of special session was a call for a meeting of states opposed to war which became known as hartford convention around time of convention which was held in hartford connecticut beginning in december 1814 strong secretly wrote to nova scotia lieutenant governor sir john coape sherbrooke essentially offering a separate peace in exchange for return of seized territory morison pp 362 370 he also refused to authorize temporary massachusetts funding for a federally led expedition to recover castine leading to further cries of indignation from maine s republicans banks pp 61 62 treaty of ghent ended war
