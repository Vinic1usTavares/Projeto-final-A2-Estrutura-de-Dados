eurasian tree sparrow passer montanus is a passerine bird in sparrow family with a rich chestnut crown and nape and a black patch on each pure white cheek sexes are similarly plumaged and young birds are a duller version of adult this sparrow breeds over most of temperate eurasia and southeast asia where it is known as tree sparrow and it has been introduced elsewhere including united states where it is known as eurasian tree sparrow or german sparrow to differentiate it from native unrelated american tree sparrow although several subspecies are recognised appearance of this bird varies little across its extensive range eurasian tree sparrow s untidy nest is built in a natural cavity a hole in a building or large nest of a european magpie or white stork typical clutch is five or six eggs which hatch in under two weeks this sparrow feeds mainly on seeds but invertebrates are also consumed particularly during breeding season as with other small birds infection by parasites and diseases and predation by birds of prey take their toll and typical life span is about two years eurasian tree sparrow is widespread in towns and cities of eastern asia but in europe it is a bird of lightly wooded open countryside with house sparrow breeding in more urban areas eurasian tree sparrow s extensive range and large population ensure that it is not endangered globally but there have been large declines in western european populations in part due to changes in farming practices involving increased use of herbicides and loss of winter stubble fields in eastern asia and western australia this species is sometimes viewed as a pest although it is also widely celebrated in oriental art description eurasian tree sparrow is long with a wingspan of about and a weight of making it roughly 10 smaller than house sparrow adult s crown and nape are rich chestnut and there is a kidney shaped black ear patch on each pure white cheek chin throat and area between bill and throat are black upperparts are light brown streaked with black and brown wings have two distinct narrow white bars legs are pale brown and bill is lead blue in summer becoming almost black in winter this sparrow is distinctive even within its genus in that it has no plumage differences between sexes juvenile also resembles adult although colours tend to be duller its contrasting face pattern makes this species easily identifiable in all plumages smaller size and brown not grey crown are additional differences from male house sparrow adult and juvenile eurasian tree sparrows undergo a slow complete moult in autumn and show an increase in body mass despite a reduction in stored fat change in mass is due to an increase in blood volume to support active feather growth and a generally higher water content in body eurasian tree sparrow has no true song but its vocalisations include an excited series of calls given by unpaired or courting males other monosyllabic chirps are used in social contacts and flight call is a harsh teck a study comparing vocalisations of introduced missouri population with those of birds from germany showed that us birds had fewer shared syllable types memes and more structure within population than european sparrows this may have resulted from small size of founding north american population and a consequent loss of genetic diversity taxonomy thumb alt page from an old book description of house and eurasian tree sparrows from systema linnaeus gives location as simply in europa type specimen was from bagnacavallo italy linnaeus s text for tree sparrow translates f inch with dusky wings and tail black and grey body paired white wing bars old world sparrow genus passer is a group of small passerine birds that is believed to have originated in africa and which contains 15 25 species depending on authority its members are typically found in open lightly wooded habitats although several species notably house sparrow p domesticus have adapted to human habitations most species in genus are typically long predominantly brown or greyish birds with short square tails and stubby conical beaks they are primarily ground feeding seed eaters although they also consume invertebrates especially when breeding genetic studies show that eurasian tree sparrow diverged from other eurasian members of its genus relatively early before speciation of house plain backed and spanish sparrows eurasian species is not closely related to american tree sparrow arborea which is in a different family american sparrows eurasian tree sparrow s binomial name is derived from two latin words passer sparrow and montanus of mountains from mons mountain eurasian tree sparrow was first described by carl linnaeus in his 1758 systema naturae as fringilla montana f fuscis corpore fascia alba gemina but along with house sparrow it was soon moved from finches family into new genus passer created by french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson in 1760 eurasian tree sparrow s common name is given because of its preference of tree holes for nesting this name and scientific name montanus do not appropriately describe this species s habitat preferences german name field sparrow comes closer to doing so subspecies this species varies little in appearance across its large range and differences between seven extant subspecies recognised by clement are slight at least 15 other subspecies have been proposed but are considered to be intermediates of listed races p m montanus nominate subspecies ranges across europe except southwestern iberia southern greece and former yugoslavia it also breeds in asia east to lena river and south to northern regions of turkey caucasus kazakhstan mongolia and korea p m described by sergei aleksandrovich in 1906 breeds from southern caucasus east to northern iran it is duller and greyer than nominate race p m dilutus described by charles wallace richmond in 1856 is resident in extreme northeast of iran northern pakistan and northwest india it also occurs further north from uzbekistan and tajikistan east to china compared to p m montanus it is paler with sandy brown upperparts p m largest race by size was described by stuart baker in 1925 it is found in northern himalayas from nepal east through tibet to northwest china it resembles p m dilutus but is darker p m saturatus described by leonhard hess stejneger in 1885 breeds in sakhalin kuril islands japan taiwan and south korea it is deeper brown than nominate subspecies and has a larger bill p m described by alphonse dubois in 1885 is found from southern himalayas east to hainan and indonesia it is a dark race like p m saturatus but is smaller and more heavily streaked on its upperparts p m described by sidney dillon ripley in 1948 breeds from northeast assam to northwest burma it is similar to p m saturatus but redder on its head and upperparts distribution and habitat eurasian tree sparrow s natural breeding range comprises most of temperate europe and asia south of about latitude north of this summers are too cold with july average temperatures below 12 degc and through southeast asia to java and bali it formerly bred in faroes malta and gozo in south asia it is found mainly in temperate zone it is sedentary over most of its extensive range but northernmost breeding populations migrate south for winter and small numbers leave southern europe for north africa and middle east eastern subspecies p m dilutus reaches coastal pakistan in winter and thousands of birds of this race move through eastern china in autumn eurasian tree sparrow has been introduced outside its native range but has not always become established possibly due to competition with house sparrow it was introduced successfully to sardinia eastern indonesia philippines and micronesia but introductions to new zealand and bermuda did not take root ship carried birds colonised borneo this sparrow has occurred as a natural vagrant to gibraltar tunisia algeria egypt israel united arab emirates morocco and iceland in north america a population of about 15 000 birds has become established around st louis and neighbouring parts of illinois and southeastern iowa these sparrows are descended from 12 birds imported from germany and released in late april 1870 as part of a project to enhance native north american avifauna within its limited us range of about eurasian tree sparrow has to compete with house sparrow in urban centres and is therefore mainly found in parks farms and rural woods american population is sometimes referred to as german sparrow to distinguish it from both native american tree sparrow species and much more widespread english house sparrow thumb left urban nest under a roof tile of a wooden house in japan in australia eurasian tree sparrow is present in melbourne towns in central and northern victoria and some centres in riverina region of new south wales it is a prohibited species in western australia where it often arrives on ships from southeast asia despite its scientific name passer montanus this is not typically a mountain species and reaches only in switzerland although it has bred at in northern caucasus and as high as in nepal in europe it is frequently found on coasts with cliffs in empty buildings in pollarded willows along slow water courses or in open countryside with small isolated patches of woodland eurasian tree sparrow shows a strong preference for nest sites near wetland habitats and avoids breeding on intensively managed mixed farmland when eurasian tree sparrow and larger house sparrow occur in same area house sparrow generally breeds in urban areas while smaller eurasian tree sparrow nests in countryside where trees are in short supply as in mongolia both species may utilise man made structures as nest sites eurasian tree sparrow is rural in europe but is an urban bird in eastern asia in southern and central asia both passer species may be found around towns and villages in parts of mediterranean such as italy both tree and italian or spanish sparrows may be found in settlements in australia eurasian tree sparrow is largely an urban bird and it is house sparrow which utilises more natural habitats behaviour and ecology breeding thumb eggs from collection of museum de toulouse thumb a fledgling eurasian tree sparrow reaches breeding maturity within a year from hatching and typically builds its nest in a cavity in an old tree or rock face some nests are not in holes as such but are built among roots of overhanging gorse or similar bush roof cavities in houses may be used and in tropics crown of a palm tree or ceiling of a verandah can serve as a nest site this species will breed in disused domed nest of a european magpie or an active or unused stick nest of a large bird such as white stork white tailed eagle osprey black kite or grey heron it will sometimes attempt to take over nest of other birds that breed in holes or enclosed spaces such as barn swallow house martin sand martin or european bee eater pairs may breed in isolation or in loose colonies and will readily use nest boxes in a spanish study boxes made from a mixture of wood and concrete woodcrete had a much higher occupancy rate than wooden boxes 76 5 versus 33 5 and birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches a shorter incubation period and more breeding attempts per season clutch size and chick condition did not differ between nest box types but reproductive success was higher in woodcrete perhaps because synthetic nests were 1 5 degc warmer than their wooden counterparts male calls from near nest site in spring to proclaim ownership and attract a mate he may also carry nest material into nest hole display and nest building is repeated in autumn preferred locations for autumn display are old eurasian tree sparrow nests particularly those where nestlings had hatched empty nest boxes and sites used by house sparrows or other hole nesting birds such as tits pied flycatchers or common redstarts are rarely used for autumn display a woodcrete nest box thumb left untidy nest is composed of hay grass wool or other material and lined with feathers which improve thermal insulation a complete nest consists of three layers base lining and dome typical clutch is five or six eggs rarely more than four in malaysia white to pale grey and heavily marked with spots small blotches or speckling they are in size and weigh of which 7 is shell eggs are incubated by both parents for 12 13 days before altricial naked chicks hatch and a further 15 18 days elapse before they fledge two or three broods may be raised each year birds breeding in colonies produce more eggs and fledglings from their first broods than solitary pairs but reverse is true for second and third clutches females which copulate frequently tend to lay more eggs and have a shorter incubation time so within pair mating may be an indicator of pairs reproductive ability there is a significant level of promiscuity in a hungarian study more than 9 of chicks were sired by extra pair males and 20 of broods contained at least one extra pair young hybridisation between eurasian tree sparrow and house sparrow has been recorded in many parts of world with male hybrids tending to resemble eurasian tree sparrow while females have more similarities with house sparrow a breeding population in eastern ghats of india said to be introduced may also hybridise with house sparrows on at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young a wild hybridisation with resident sparrows of malta which are intermediate between spanish sparrow p and italian sparrows p italiae was recorded in malta in 1975 feeding thumb at a feeder tree sparrow is a predominantly seed and grain eating bird which feeds on ground in flocks often with house sparrows finches or buntings it eats weed seeds such as and goosefoot spilled grain and it may also visit feeding stations especially for peanuts it will also feed on invertebrates especially during breeding season when young are fed mainly on animal food it takes insects woodlice millipedes centipedes spiders and harvestmen adults use a variety of wetlands when foraging for invertebrate prey to feed nestlings and aquatic sites play a key role in providing adequate diversity and availability of suitable invertebrate prey to allow successful chick rearing throughout long breeding season of this multi brooded species large areas of formerly occupied farmland no longer provide these invertebrate resources due to effects of intensive farming and availability of supplementary seed food within of nest site does not influence nest site choice or affect number of young raised in winter seed resources are most likely to be a key limiting factor at this time of year individuals in a flock form linear dominance hierarchies but there is no strong relation between size of throat patch and position in that hierarchy this is in contrast to house sparrow in that species fights to establish dominance are reduced by display of throat patch size of which acts as a signalling badge of fitness although there is evidence that black throat patch of male but not female tree sparrows predicts fighting success in foraging flocks risk of predation affects feeding strategies a study showed increased distance between shelter and a food supply meant that birds visited a feeder in smaller flocks spent less time on it and were more vigilant when far from shelter sparrows can feed as producers searching for food directly or just joining other flock members who have already discovered food was 30 more likely at exposed feeding sites although this is not due to increased anti predator vigilance a possible explanation is that riskier places are used by individuals with lower fat reserves survival thumb sparrowhawk is a widespread predator predators of tree sparrow include a variety of accipiters falcons and owls such as eurasian sparrowhawk common kestrel little owl and sometimes long eared owl and white stork it does not appear to be at an increased risk of predation during its autumn moult despite having fewer flight feathers at that time nests may be raided by eurasian magpies jays least weasels rats cats and constricting snakes such as horseshoe whip snake cordero p j m breeding season population and reproduction rate of tree sparrow passer montanus l in barcelona ne spain in cordero p j predation in house sparrow and tree sparrow passer sp nests in many species of are present on birds and in their nests and mites of genus have been known to infest populations resulting in lesions on legs and toes parasitisation of nestlings by protocalliphora blow fly larvae is a significant factor in nestling mortality egg size does not influence nestling mortality but chicks from large eggs grow faster tree sparrows are also subject to bacterial and viral infections bacteria have been shown to be an important factor in failure of eggs to hatch and in nestling mortality and mass deaths due to salmonella infection have been noted in japan avian malaria parasites have been found in blood of many populations and birds in china were found to harbour a strain of h5n1 that was highly virulent to chickens immune response of tree sparrows is less robust than that of house sparrow and has been proposed as a factor in greater invasive potential of latter house sparrow and tree sparrow are most frequent victims of roadkill on roads of central eastern and southern europe maximum recorded age is 13 1 years but three years is a typical lifespan status thumb winter stubble is a seasonal food resource tree sparrow has a large range estimated as and a population of 190 310 million individuals although population is declining species is not believed to approach thresholds for population decline criterion of iucn red list that is declining more than 30 in ten years or three generations for these reasons species conservation status is evaluated at global level as being of least concern although tree sparrow has been expanding its range in fennoscandia and eastern europe populations have been declining in much of western europe a trend reflected in other farmland birds such as skylark corn bunting and northern lapwing from 1980 to 2003 common farmland bird numbers fell by 28 collapse in populations seems to have been particularly severe in great britain where there was a 95 decline between 1970 and 1998 and ireland which had only 1 000 1 500 pairs in late 1990s in british isles such declines may be due to natural fluctuations to which tree sparrows are known to be prone breeding performance has improved substantially as population sizes have decreased suggesting that decreases in productivity were not responsible for decline and that survival was critical factor large decline in tree sparrow numbers is probably result of agricultural intensification and specialisation particularly increased use of herbicides and a trend towards autumn sown crops at expense of spring sown crops that produce stubble fields in winter change from mixed to specialised farming and increased use of insecticides has reduced amount of insect food available for nestlings relationships with humans thumb a horticultural pest common asparagus beetle is a prey item thumb detail from hokusai s suzume odori tree sparrow is seen as a pest in some areas in australia it damages many cereal and fruit crops and spoils cereal crops animal feed and stored grain with its droppings quarantine rules prohibit transport of this species into western australia chairman mao zedong of china attempted in april 1958 to reduce crop damage by tree sparrows estimated at of grain per bird each year by mobilising three million people and many scarecrows to drive birds to death by exhaustion although initially successful great sparrow campaign had overlooked numbers of locusts and other insect pests consumed by birds and crop yields fell exacerbating a famine which led to deaths of 30 million people between 1959 and 1961 tree sparrow s consumption of insects has led to its use in agriculture to control fruit tree pests and common asparagus beetle tree sparrow has long been depicted in chinese and japanese art often on a plant spray or in a flying flock and representations by oriental artists including hiroshige have featured on postage stamps of antigua and barbuda central african republic china and gambia more straightforward illustrations were used on stamps of belarus belgium cambodia estonia and taiwan fluttering of bird gave rise to a traditional japanese dance suzume odori developed in sendai which was depicted by artists such as hokusai in philippines where it is one of several species referred to as maya and is sometimes specifically referred to as mayang simbahan church maya or church
