pumila said that episode was extremely fun and entertaining i hadn t watched spongebob in a while but laughs in this episode provided more laughs than i would get in an entire day maxie zeus of toon zone cited episode as an example of series decline lesley aeschliman of yahoo voices wrote i have to look at this special like friend or foe special while whobob whatpants works well as a regular story for spongebob squarepants i m not entirely convinced that it deserved to be hyped up as a special while this story had potential to be special material it just didn t materialize in final produced product roy of dvd verdict said it makes me sad to think about how something so pleasurable has declined into something so tedious paul mavis of dvd talk said with a laugh skimpy script what ever happened to spongebob may be confirming a trend i noticed back with last original spongebob toon to get its own disc release pest of west spongebob shorts are starting to get tired and what ever happened to spongebob is even less funny than pest of west adding episode was not a good sign references external links category 2008 american television episodes category 2008 television specials
