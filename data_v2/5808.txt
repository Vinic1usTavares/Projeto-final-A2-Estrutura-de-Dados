building was cast in limestone colored glazed architectural terracotta panels lowest floors are clad in limestone f w woolworth initially wanted to clad skyscraper in granite while gilbert wanted to use limestone decision to use terracotta for facade was based on both aesthetic and functional concerns not only was terracotta fireproof gilbert believed that terracotta would be a purely ornamental addition clarifying woolworth building s steel construction atlantic terra cotta company provided original terracotta cladding during construction gilbert requested that atlantic terra cotta use an office adjacent to his own while it was drawing several hundred designs he also asked that an outside firm donnelly and ricci create full size designs based on atlantic terra cotta s models in 1932

supported on massive caissons that penetrate to bedrock in order to give structure a sturdy foundation builders used metal tubes in diameter filled with concrete these tubes were driven into ground with a pneumatic caisson process to anchor foundations to bedrock 69 caissons range in depth from because slope of bedrock was so sharp steps had to be carved into rock before caissons could be sunk into ground each column carries a load of supporting building s overall weight of strongly articulated piers which carry right to pyramidal cap without intermediate cornices give building its upward thrust portal braces on building s exterior direct crosswinds downward toward ground rather than into building copper roof is connected to woolworth building s steel superstructure which serves to electrically ground roof gothic detailing concentrated at highly visible crown is over scaled and building s silhouette could be made out from several miles away gilbert s choice of gothic style was described as an expression of verticality of tower form and as gilbert himself later wrote style was light graceful delicate and flame like when woolworth building was being erected gilbert considered several proposals for exterior lighting to emphasize structure s form and size these included placing four powerful searchlights atop nearby buildings and a constantly rotating lamp at apex of woolworth building s roof ultimately builders decided to erect nitrogen lamps and reflectors above 31st floor and having intensity of lighting increase with height interior thumb upright part of lobby

but various sources state that woolworth building has 2 843 4 400 or 5 000 windows because structure was built before air conditioning became common every office is located within 10 feet of a window

dimes 5 and 10 cent stores began planning a new headquarters for f w woolworth company in 1910 around same time woolworth s friend lewis pierson was having difficulty getting shareholder approval for merger of his irving national bank and rival new york exchange bank woolworth offered to acquire shares in new york exchange bank and vote in favor of merger if pierson agreed to move combined banks headquarters to a new building he was planning as f w woolworth company s headquarters having received commitment from banks woolworth acquired a corner site on broadway and park place in lower manhattan opposite city hall entrepreneur briefly considered purchasing a plot at west broadway and reade street a few blocks north of woolworth building s current site but decided against it due to prestige that a broadway address provided woolworth and irving national exchange bank then set up broadway park place company to construct and finance proposed structure initially bank was supposed to gradually purchase company s stock until it owned entire company and thus woolworth building irving would be able to manage 18 floors of rentable space on a 25 year lease while negotiations to create broadway park place company were ongoing woolworth and his real estate agent edward j hogan purchased several parcels from luther park estate and other owners entirety of current building s footprint a rectangular lot had been acquired by april 15 1910 at a total cost of 1 65 million thumb woolworth building under construction in february 1912 alt woolworth commissioned cass gilbert to design new building there are few print documents that indicate early correspondence between woolworth and gilbert and news articles as late as march 1910 mentioned that no architect had been chosen gilbert later mentioned that he had received commission for woolworth building after getting a phone call from woolworth one day architect had recently finished designing nearby broadway chambers building and 90 west street and woolworth admired architecture of latter woolworth also wanted his new structure to be of similar design to palace of westminster in london which was designed in gothic style gilbert was originally retained to design a standard 12 to 16 story commercial building for woolworth who later said he had no desire to erect a monument that would cause posterity to remember me however woolworth then desired to surpass nearby new york world building which sat on other side of city hall park and stood 20 stories and a drawing by thomas r johnson dated april 22 1910 shows a 30 story building rising from site due to change in plans organization of broadway park place company was rearranged woolworth would now be major partner contributing 1 million of planned 1 5 million cost irving bank would pay remainder and it would take up a 25 year lease for ground floor fourth floor and basement by september 1910 gilbert had designed an even taller structure with a 40 story tower on park place adjacent to a shorter 25 story annex yielding a tall building next month gilbert s latest design had evolved into a 45 story tower roughly height of nearby singer building after latest design woolworth wrote to gilbert in november 1910 and asked for building s height to be increased to which was taller than singer building lower manhattan s tallest building at time woolworth was inspired by his travels in europe where he would constantly be asked about singer building he decided that housing his company in an even taller building would provide invaluable advertising for f w woolworth company and make it renowned worldwide this design unveiled to public same month was a 45 story tower rising referring to revised plans woolworth said i do not want a mere building i want something that will be an ornament to city he later said that he wanted visitors to be able to brag that they had visited world s tallest building even after revised height was unveiled woolworth still yearned to make building even taller as it was now close to height of metropolitan life insurance company tower tallest building in new york city and world at time on december 20 1910 woolworth sent a team of surveyors to measure building s height and come up with a precise measurement so he could make his skyscraper taller he then ordered gilbert to revise building s design so as to reach or despite ongoing worries over whether additional height would be worth increased financial cost in order to fit larger base that a taller tower necessitated woolworth bought remainder of frontage on broadway between park place and barclay street on january 1 1911 new york times reported that woolworth was planning a building at a cost of 5 million by january 18 1911 woolworth and hogan had acquired final site for project totaling 4 5 million in a new york times article two days later woolworth said that his building would rise to its tip in order to fit correct architectural proportions gilbert redesigned building to its current height renderings by illustrator hughson hawley completed in april 1911 are first official materials that reflect this final height gilbert had to reconcile both woolworth s and pierson s strict requirements for design of structure architect s notes describe late night conversations that he had with both men current design of lobby with its arcade reflected these conflicting pressures sometimes gilbert also faced practical conundrums such as woolworth s requirement that there be many windows so divided that all of offices should be well lighted and so that tenants could erect partitions to fit their needs gilbert wrote that this naturally prevented any broad wall space woolworth and gilbert sometimes clashed during design process especially because of constantly changing designs and architect s fees gilbert nevertheless commended woolworth s devotion to details and beauty of building s design as well as entrepreneur s enthusiasm for project construction thumb left woolworth building under construction in april 1912 in september 1910 wrecking crews demolished five and six story structures which previously occupied site construction officially began on november 4 1910 with excavation by foundation company using a contract negotiated personally by frank woolworth start of construction instantly raised site s value from 2 25 million to 3 2 million contract of over 1 million was described as largest contract for foundation construction ever awarded in world it took months for woolworth to decide upon general construction company george a fuller s fuller company was well experienced and had practically invented skyscraper construction but louis j horowitz s thompson starrett company was local to new york and despite being newer horowitz had worked for fuller before so had a similar knowledge base on april 20 1911 thompson starrett won contract with a guaranteed construction price of 4 308 500 for building s frame and structural elements company was also paid 300 000 for their oversight and management work despite woolworth s attempts to get company to do job for free due to prestige of project construction process involved hundreds of workers and daily wages ranged from 1 50 for laborers to 4 50 for skilled workers by august 1911 building s foundations were complete ahead of target date of september 15 construction of skyscraper s steel frame began august 15 steel beams and girders used in framework weighed so much that in order to prevent streets from caving in a group of surveyors examined streets on route along which beams would be transported steel for building was provided by american bridge company from their foundries in philadelphia and pittsburgh and took over 45 weeks to manufacture thumb woolworth building topped out on july 1 1912 alt first above ground steel had been erected by october 1911 and installation of building s terracotta began on february 1 1912

landmark status in 1970 f w woolworth company called landmark law as a whole onerous since it would restrict company from making modifications to many aspects of building commission ultimately declined to give woolworth building a designated landmark status because of f w woolworth company s opposition to such a measure as well as increased costs and scrutiny f w woolworth company commissioned an appraisal of building s facade in 1975 and found serious deterioration in building s terracotta many of blocks of terracotta had loosened or cracked from constant thermal expansion and contraction caused by new york s climate cracks in facade let in rain which in turn caused steel superstructure to rust in 1977 f w woolworth company began a five year restoration of building s terracotta and limestone facade as well as replacement of all of building s windows initially company had considered replacing entire terracotta facade with concrete to prevent further deterioration but backed away from plan due to cost and potential backlash from preservationists renovation involved replacement of roughly one fifth of building s terracotta surface as well as all of building s windows by turner construction under a plan by new york architectural firm ehrenkrantz group since terracotta had become rare in 1970s few manufacturers remained to supply replacement tiles so company replaced 26 000 of tiles with concrete lookalikes many of those tiles had to be custom cut concrete was coated with a surface that was meant to be replaced at five year intervals a similar replacement

time witkoff planned to partner with rubin to create an office club on top 25 floors building to attract high end tenants like hedge funds and private equity firms plan would have restored 58th floor

result conversion was expected to be completed by february or march 2019 about six and a half years after alchemy bought property by february 2019 only three of building s 31 condos had been sold
