a disguised alex krycek nicholas lea a rogue fbi agent who formerly worked for syndicate and who continues to control potentially debilitating nanotechnology in skinner s system production writing at start of season six producers of x files began to worry that walter skinner was becoming expendable as mulder and scully s transfer from x files division meant that they saw less and less of him originally john shiban writer of episode wanted to infect mulder with nanobots however he decided that since audience knew mulder would not be killed this plot would not be very effective hurwitz and knowles p 159 shiban thus decided to re work skinner back into series mythology by putting him in mulder s place shiban inspired by noir film d o a 1950 and its 1988 remake which he jokingly called two pretty bad movies decided to craft an episode of x files around concept of a guy who s been poisoned and has only a short time to live and has to use that time to find out why and by whom he s being murdered meisler p 132 shiban began crafting his story by incorporating a nanobot plot that had been considered by various writers for several seasons shiban and rest of writing room were conscious in their decision to give alex krycek full control over skinner via nanobot infection as it caused skinner to once again become a mysterious character whose true loyalties could be tested shiban noted that krycek s control gives skinner an agenda that mulder doesn t know about which was something we ultimately used again in and will carry us into next year filming and effects originally episode was slated to feature a time consuming fight scene pitting skinner against krycek but scene was cut because of time constraints and worries about going over budget however skinner s boxing match proved much eas ier to stage mitch pileggi had boxed competitively in college and went for refresher course s at gym in los angeles to prep for episode he later remarked it makes me happy that some people will assume there was a stunt double in ring there wasn t we both had a pretty good time location manager ilt jones called s r 819 damn parking lot episode because he was personally tasked with finding variety of parking lots used in episode he later joked i started to wake up screaming about barriers and parking tickets and entrances and exit ramps pileggi had to endure long hours of makeup application and to create principal illusion of monstrous veins long black faux veins were glued to his body pileggi had had little to no makeup in previous episodes and later said they did a beautiful job and veins looked awesome but man i hated it i really don t know how those guys on star trek or babylon 5 can stand having that done to them every day i just wouldn t work if that s what it took to show nanobot infection progressing special effects makeup supervisor john vulich used two different makeup sets one representing early stage of disease and other representing later stage nanobots in blood sample were designed on a computer and then cloned with an animation program meisler p 133 broadcast and reception s r 819 first aired in united states on january 17 1999
