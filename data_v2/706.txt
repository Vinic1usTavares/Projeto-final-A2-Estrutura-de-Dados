liberty head nickel sometimes referred to as v nickel because of its reverse or tails design is an american five cent piece it was struck for circulation from 1883 until 1912 with at least five pieces being surreptitiously struck dated 1913 obverse features a left facing image of goddess of liberty original copper nickel five cent piece shield nickel had longstanding production problems and in early 1880s united states mint was looking to replace it mint chief engraver charles barber was instructed to prepare designs for proposed one three and five cent pieces which were to bear similar designs only new five cent piece was approved and went into production in 1883 for almost thirty years large quantities of coin of this design were produced to meet commercial demand especially as coin operated machines became increasingly popular beginning in 1911 mint began work to replace liberty head design and a new design which became known as buffalo nickel went into production in february 1913 although no 1913 liberty head nickels were officially struck five are known to exist while it is uncertain how these pieces originated they have come to be among most expensive coins in world with one selling in 2018 for 4 5 million origin industrialist joseph wharton who had interests in nickel mining and production had been influential in decision to use metal in coinage in mid 1860s leading to introduction of shield nickel in 1866 shield nickel presented difficulties through its life intricate design made coins not strike well modification to design failed to solve technical problems and mint had considered replacing design as early as 1867 nevertheless shield nickel remained in production with production of copper nickel five cent pieces lagging in late 1870s and with production of copper nickel three cent pieces nearly moribund wharton sought to increase his sales of nickel to united states mint although copper nickel coins were struck only in small numbers bronze cent represented a major portion of mint s production and wharton began to lobby for piece to be struck in copper nickel in 1881 this lobbying led mint superintendent archibald loudon snowden to order mint chief engraver charles barber to produce uniform designs for a new cent three cent nickel and five cent piece snowden informed barber that proposed designs were to feature on obverse or heads side a classic head of liberty with legend liberty and date reverse or tails side was to feature a wreath of wheat cotton and corn around a roman numeral designating denomination of coin thus five cent piece was to have roman numeral v proposal for cent would decrease its size to and its weight to and modifications to three cent piece would increase its size to and its weight to nickel would retain its weight of but its diameter would be increased to thumb left a pattern for nickel by barber barber duly produced required designs fairly large numbers of pattern coins were struck barber s design for nickel showed a portrait similar to that eventually adopted for obverse with united states of america and date reverse featured required wreath surrounding v and no other lettering a modified pattern design later that year added words in god we trust to reverse snowden decided that proposed cents and three cent pieces would be too small for effective use but barber continued work on nickel with size adjusted to barber reworked design in 1882 adding e pluribus unum to reverse one variant that was struck as a pattern but was not adopted was a coin with five equally spaced notches in rim of coin this blind man s nickel was struck at request of congressman and former union general william s rosecrans who stated that many of his wartime colleagues had been blinded by combat or disease late that year barber s 1882 design was endorsed by mint authorities and 25 specimens were sent to washington for routine approval by treasury secretary charles j folger to snowden s surprise folger rejected design secretary on review of coinage statutes had realized that laws required united states of america to appear on reverse not obverse folger had then consulted with president chester arthur who confirmed folger s opinion snowden suggested that an exception should be made but folger refused and barber modified his design accordingly revised design was approved and coin was ready for striking in early 1883 release striking of new coins began on january 30 1883 and mint placed first pieces in circulation on february 1 snowden concerned about reports of speculation in 1883 proof shield nickels received permission on february 6 to continue striking proof shield nickels for several months alongside new pieces it had not been thought necessary to inscribe word cents on nickel silver and copper nickel three cent pieces had circulated for years with only a roman numeral to indicate denomination enterprising fraudsters soon realized that new nickel was close in diameter to that of five dollar gold piece and if new coin was gold plated it might be passed for five dollars they soon did so and had success in passing coin some coins were given a edge by fraudsters to make them appear more like gold coins a widespread tale is that one of perpetrators of this fraud was a man named josh tatum who would go into a store select an item costing five cents or less and offer gold plated piece in payment and many clerks gave him 4 95 in change according to tale law had no recourse against tatum as he had tendered value of his purchase and had merely accepted change as a gift by some accounts tatum could not have misrepresented value of coin as he was a deaf mute plating of nickels caused consternation at mint and brought production of liberty head nickels to a sudden stop barber was told to modify his design which he did moving other design elements to accommodate word cents at bottom of reverse design revised nickel was issued on june 26 1883 date on which production of shield nickel was finally stopped public responded by hoarding nickels egged on by reports that treasury department intended to recall those nickels and that they would become rare production after heavy mintages of nickel in 1883 and 1884 production was much lower in 1885 and 1886 this was due to an economic downturn which lowered demand for coins 1886 production was also depressed by treasury s decision to reissue large numbers of worn minor coins it was not until september 1886 that mint resumed full production of coin by 1887 however mint was overwhelmed by orders melting down large quantities of older copper nickel coins to meet demand despite these efforts mint was forced to return many orders unfilled demand remained strong until 1894 when mint temporarily suspended production as it had accumulated a surplus during panic of 1893 coinage act of 1890 retired a number of obsolete denominations including three cent piece another act of congress also enacted on september 26 1890 required that coinage designs not be changed until they had been in use 25 years unless congress authorized change however second act indicated that nothing in law was to prevent redesign of current five cent piece and silver dollar as soon as practicable after passage of this act in 1896 pattern nickels were struck for first time since 1885 when experimental holed coins had been tested 1896 pieces which featured a simple shield with arrows crossed behind it were struck in response to a resolution of house of representatives asking secretary of treasury to report to it on advantages and disadvantages of using various alloys in coinage pattern nickels would not be struck again until 1909 thumb left 1912 d nickel mintmark d for denver is found at lower left by dot turn of century saw unprecedented demand for nickels due to a booming economy and use of nickels in coin operated machines in 1900 mint director george e roberts called on congress to grant mint a larger appropriation to purchase base metals allowing for greater production of nickels and cents same year design was modified slightly lengthening some of leaves on reverse this change occurred with introduction of a new hub from which coining dies were made demand for coins remained heavy in march 1911 mehl s numismatic monthly reported that mint was working twenty four hours a day to produce cents and nickels and even so was failing to satisfy demand mint directors in their annual reports had long called for authority to strike cents and nickels at all mints by law they could then only be struck at philadelphia on april 24 1906 this restriction was removed although first base metal coins cents in both cases were not struck at san francisco until 1908 and denver until 1911 in 1912 nickels were coined for first time at each of two branch mints 1912 s for san francisco nickel was not struck until christmas eve and was only struck for four business days a 1912 s nickel one of first forty coined was used by former san francisco mayor james d phelan to pay first fare on city s first streetcar on december 28 1912 excluding 1913 nickel 1912 s with only 238 000 struck is by far rarest in series replacement thumb treasury secretary franklin macveagh depicted on a mint medal was instrumental in replacement of liberty head nickel by buffalo nickel in 1909 consideration was given to replacement of liberty head nickel by a new design in an attempt to modernize coinage cent and gold pieces had been redesigned prominent artists from outside mint had been contracted to provide designs of new coins much to barber s disgruntlement mint director frank a leach was an admirer of barber s work and had him prepare designs to be struck as patterns barber at leach s request prepared a design showing washington s head and newspapers reported that new coins might be issued by end of 1909 in july 1909 however leach resigned putting an end to matter for time being on may 4 1911 eames macveagh son of treasury secretary franklin macveagh wrote to his father a little matter that seems to have been overlooked by all of you is opportunity to beautify design of nickel or five cent piece during your administration and it seems to me that it would be a permanent souvenir of a most attractive sort as possibly you are aware it is only coin design of which you can change during your administration as i believe there is a law to effect that designs must not be changed oftener than every twenty five years i should think also it might be coin of which greatest numbers are in circulation soon afterwards deputy secretary of treasury abram andrew announced that mint would be soliciting new designs well known sculptor james earle fraser approached treasury officials who were impressed by his proposals mint director roberts initially asked fraser for a design featuring a bust of lincoln which he produced mainly to please roberts but fraser also developed a design featuring a native american on obverse with an american bison on reverse this design was given preliminary approval by macveagh on january 13 1912 and would come to be known as buffalo nickel in late june fraser completed model of final design specifications of new nickel were provided to hobbs manufacturing company a maker of vending machines which following a meeting with fraser in early november opined that new coins would likely jam its machines at company s request fraser prepared a revised version but secretary macveagh rejected it on grounds that changes compromised design which he greatly admired on december 13 1912 roberts warned mint staff to take no action in preparation for 1913 five cent coinage until new designs were ready he ended production of liberty head nickel at philadelphia mint same day a minor change was made to buffalo design in an attempt to satisfy hobbs company which promptly provided a lengthy list of changes it wanted made to coin on february 15 1913 with less than three weeks until he would have to leave office on advent of wilson administration mcveagh wrote to roberts noting that no other vending or slot machine maker had complained about new design secretary concluded that everything possible had been done to satisfy hobbs company and ordered new nickel put into production 1913 thumb ad placed by brown in numismatist december 1919 first information that a 1913 liberty head nickel might have been struck came in december 1919 when coin dealer samuel w brown placed advertisements in numismatic publications offering to buy any such nickels in august 1920 brown displayed one such coin at annual american numismatic association ana convention brown related that a master die had been prepared for 1913 liberty head nickels and a few pieces had been run off to test die as it turned out brown possessed five coins which he eventually sold after spending fifteen years in hands of eccentric col e h r green famous fort worth texas area collector coins were finally dispersed in 1943 since then coins have had several owners each today two are on public display at smithsonian institution in washington and ana s money museum in colorado springs while three are owned privately one price recorded for a 1913 liberty head nickel was in january 2010 when one sold for 3 737 500 in an auction recent sales of a 1913 liberty head nickel were in april 2013 for more than 3 1 million and for 4 5 million at auction in august 2018 it is uncertain how 1913 nickels came to be made mint s records show no production of 1913 liberty head nickels and none were authorized to be made dies were prepared in advance and sent to california for a 1913 s liberty head nickel coinage but upon roberts s instruction to stop coinage they were ordered returned to philadelphia they were received by december 23 and were almost certainly destroyed routinely by early january brown had been an employee at philadelphia mint although this was not known
