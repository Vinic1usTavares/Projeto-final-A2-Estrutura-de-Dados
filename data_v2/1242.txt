sandwich inspiration for big king sandwich that would eventually become big king was preceded by a similar sandwich called double supreme cheeseburger burger king s take on rival mcdonald s well known big mac sandwich was released as a test product in january 1996 when mcdonald s was having difficulties within american market hoping to build on improving sales of burger king and take advantage of perceived market weakness of mcdonald s chain introduced double supreme as part of an advertising blitz against its competitor originally burger had a look and composition that resembled big mac it had two beef patties king sauce lettuce cheese pickles and onions on a three part sesame seed bun because its patties are flame broiled and larger than mcdonald s grill fried and seasoned patties and formulation of king sauce was different from mcdonald s special sauce sandwich had a similar but not exact taste and different caloric content sandwich was reformulated after initial test run removing center roll double supreme was advertised with a direct attack on big mac using claims that it had 75 more beef and less bread than mcdonald s sandwich a review of burger king sandwich by chicago tribune verified these claims and also stated that ingredients of newer sandwich were of better quality than those of mcdonald s product after initial testing period sandwich was renamed big king and added to national menu at end of summer of 1997the first major product introduction since company added its bk broiler chicken sandwich in 1990 unlike double supreme new big king lacked interior bread piece big mac had and advertising used to promote big king continued to utilize 75 more beef claim however new sandwich was introduced while company was dealing with a highly publicized beef recall from one of its key suppliers hudson foods and had to deal with accusations that introduction was designed to distract public and media from recall sandwich was initially introduced in united states at a 99c usd price point which helped propel sales to nearly twice estimated volume and causing many locations to sell out of burger patties used to produce sandwich mcdonald s initially downplayed new sandwich with a spokesman stating that there was only one place to get real big mac despite mcdonald s claims that sandwich was not a major issue for company its highly promoted arch deluxe sandwich was not a success and its campaign 55 promotion which reduced price of certain sandwiches to usd was eliminated after franchisees complained that it had failed to boost sales against mcdonald s struggles burger king s successful introduction of big king was later paired with a newly introduced improved type of french fry in november of same year along with these two product introductions company began a massive financial investment in product development across all parts of its menu which in total provided a boost in chain s market performance mirrored failure and success for two companies showed itself in market share of united states fast food market burger king s share rose a percentage point to 19 2 while mcdonald s share slipped 0 4 points to 41 9 by end of 1997 mcdonald s drop capped a three year decline in larger chain s market share in united states which stood at 42 3 at start of 1995 by 2001 burger king s chain wide sales were lagging corporate indifference from parent diageo coupled with lagging sales at larger franchises caused by declining consumer demand for its products led company to initiate a menu redesign to try to lure customers back into stores

king changed ownership in 2002 when diageo sold its interest in company to a group of investment firms led by tpg capital after assuming ownership tpg s newly appointed management team began focusing

this new super fan focused menu expansion chain introduced its new bk stacker sandwich in late 2006 a family of sandwiches featuring same set of toppings served as a single double triple or quadruple hamburger stacker line was part of a series of larger more calorie laden products introduced by company to entice super fan into chain s restaurants these new additions helped propel same store profits for more than sixteen quarters stacker consisted of anywhere from one to four beef patties american cheese bacon and a thousand island dressing variant called stacker sauce served on a sesame seed bun new sandwiches had a muted reaction in several reviews com readers rated quad stacker as one of most over top gluttonous burgers in a poll while impulsive buy stated that sandwich was much like any other bacon cheeseburger but meatier despite its lukewarm reception an internet meme relating to sandwich developed rather quickly customers would create an octo stacker sandwich by purchasing two quad stackers and mashing two together sandwiches to create a sandwich with eight patties eight slices of cheese and sixteen half pieces of bacon they would then film themselves trying to eat sandwich in under five minutes with onset of great recession in 2008 2009 this narrowly defined demographic based sales plan faltered and sales and profits for chain declined burger king s same store comparable sales in united states and canada declined 4 6 in three months ended september 30 while mcdonald s posted same store comparable sales growth of 2 5 within united states stacker line underwent a minor reformulation in 2011 that involved deleting top layer of cheese and changing amount of bacon in sandwiches and moving sandwiches from core section of its menu to company s value menu changed ingredient list and pricing structure created a situation such that distribution of ingredients did not scale at same rate as increasing numbers of burger patties consumer reports blog

layer of sauce to increase moisture content of sandwich sandwich was introduced nationwide in u s after a period of testing in indiana while chicken version of sandwich was new to burger king it again copied a product from mcdonald s in middle east competing chain offers a chicken big mac sandwich a primary reason product was brought back was because of a new approach company was taking regarding new and limited time offering lto products instead of putting out large numbers of products that may only appeal to a small audience it would only add a smaller amount of products that have broader market appeal along with its bk chicken fries product big king was part of that goal with reintroduction utilizing a three prong approach its stated intention to introduce products to those that will have most impact a bid to appeal to millennials utilizing social media focused campaigns and to utilize a former product from its portfolio that company probably should have thought about before discontinuing idea of reintroducing older possibly discontinued products is appealing to companies such as burger king and mcdonald s because it is operationally easier than launching a completely new product in many cases reintroduction allows these companies to utilize older advertising along with its existing supply chain which is already established to deliver product ingredients while catering to public s feelings of nostalgia for these products limited time offers allow chains to bring new products to menu without adding permanent complexity to their kitchen operations chicken big king was
