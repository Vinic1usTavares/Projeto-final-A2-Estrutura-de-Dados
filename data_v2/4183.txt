relief of qasr al bahili was successful relief of arab garrison of small fortress of qasr al bahili from siege by turkic turgesh khaganate sent by umayyad governor of khurasan an arab relief force under al musayyab ibn bishr al managed to break siege and escort garrison to safety in samarkand siege marked beginning of turgesh invasion of transoxiana which arabs had only recently subdued and which became a battleground between two empires for following two decades background region of transoxiana arabic ma wara al nahr had been conquered by umayyad leader qutayba ibn muslim in reign of al walid i following muslim conquests of persia and khurasan in mid 7th century loyalties of transoxiana s native iranian and turkic populations and those of autonomous local rulers remained questionable however as demonstrated in 719 when transoxianian princes sent a petition to chinese and their turgesh vassals for military aid against caliphate s governors situation was made worse by incompetence of arab governor abd al rahman ibn nu aym his successor sa id who took office in 720 appointed capable shu bah ibn zuhayr al as his deputy in samarkand but after locals rioted he was dismissed and replaced by uthman ibn abdallah ibn mutarrif ibn al shikhkhir perhaps as h a r gibb writes in a vain attempt to appease insurgents siege and relief of qasr al bahili weakness of arab administration and petitions of transoxianian princes led turgesh ruler khagan suluk to launch an attack which caught arabs entirely off guard under leadership of kursul turgesh were able to surround fortress of qasr al bahili fort of whose garrison numbered 100 families according to report of al tabari fearing that reinforcements from samarkand would not arrive in time garrison of qasr al bahili proposed to buy peace for 40 000 silver dirham as well as giving seventeen of their own men as hostages to kursul until tribute was paid when arab governor of samarkand uthman ibn abdallah ibn mutarrif ibn al shikhkhir learned of turgesh attack he called for volunteers from arab settlers of khurasan 4 000 men from all arab tribes present in khurasan presented themselves but according to al tabari when appointed commander al musayyab ibn bishr warned them that they were about to enter arena of turks arena of where they faced death and martyrdom 1 300 left after he had marched a farsakh km he repeated his exhortation for only steadfast to remain with him and another thousand left and again same after another farsakh leaving him with barely 700 men during march arabs were met by a local ruler king of qiyy who informed them of events at qasr al bahili and added that kursul having learned of arabs approach had slain his hostages king of qiyy also warned arabs that all iranian aristocracy of area had gone over to turgesh and offered 300 of his own men to assist them when he was two farsakhs from fort al musayyab sent two riders one arab and one a non arab to approach fort and scout out situation under cover of night although turgesh had flooded area around castle to obstruct access they managed to make contact with garrison and inform them of arab army s approach before returning to al musayyab when his spies informed him of situation al musayyab decided to march immediately and attack turgesh under cover of night he instructed his men to muzzle their horses until attack and to focus on breaking enemy resistance rather than pursue anyone fleeing battle with break of dawn arabs who had approached within two of turgesh camp issued cry allahu akbar and charged arabs penetrated deep in turgesh encampment but latter recovered quickly and pushed attack back arabs withdrew around their commander with many dismounting to fight they suffered numerous casualties in process according to an eyewitness who was in fortress when two armies engaged in battle we thought that day of resurrection had arrived on account of what we heard namely groans emitted by soldiers clashing of iron and neighing of horses in end arabs prevailed although sources cited by al tabari mentions no details al musayyab instructed his men to move straight for fortress and help evacuate its garrison and not carry off any goods except money and do not carry off anyone who can walk but only women children and weak of body together arabs made for samarkand so that when turgesh returned next day they found fortress empty aftermath these events prompted umayyads to appoint capable general sa id ibn amr al harashi as governor of khurasan al harashi quickly seized initiative defeated rebels at samarkand and proceeded to restore muslim rule almost to what it had been during time of qutayba except for ferghana valley effective control over which was lost nevertheless in 724 al harashi s successor muslim ibn sa id al kilabi and his army suffered a heavy defeat so called day of thirst at hands of turgesh when he tried to subdue ferghana this defeat pushed arabs on defensive and even though no pitched battles took place over next few years arab position in transoxiana collapsed swiftly widespread dissatisfaction with arab rule resulted in a general uprising of transoxiana in 728 and with turgesh military aid arabs were evicted from almost entire region even invading khurasan itself in 737 transoxiana thereafter remained contested and arabs did not recover their previous position until campaigns of umayyad governor nasr ibn sayyar in 739 741 who took advantage of collapse of turgesh khaganate into civil wars after suluk s murder in 738 references
