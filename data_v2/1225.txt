principality until her marriage baldwinii died on 1131 and died a week later alice again laid claim to regency however most antiochene lords remained hostile to idea of a female ruler and sent envoys to baldwinii s successor fulk of anjou who was alice s brother in law alice made an alliance with joscelin ii count of edessa and pons count of tripoli in early 1132 fulk had to travel to antioch by sea because pons did not allow him to march through county of tripoli fulk landed at st symeon where antiochene barons acknowledged him as regent he appointed rainald i masoir constable of antioch to administer principality fulk returned to antioch when zengi dispatched governor of aleppo to invade principality in 1132 or 1133 after defeating invaders fulk entered antioch since principality needed a firm government antiochene noblemen approached fulk to select a husband for constance he chose raymond of poitiers younger son of william ix duke of aquitaine he did not announce his decision in public because he wanted to prevent alice and rogerii of sicily from intervening alice s sister melisende fulk s wife persuaded fulk to allow alice to return to antioch in 1135 alice wanted to tighten relationship of principality and byzantine empire therefore she offered constance s hand to manuel a son of byzantine emperor john ii komnenos to prevent byzantine marriage fulk sent his envoy to france to raymond of poitiers to urge him to come to antioch which he did traveling in disguise because rogerii of sicily wanted to capture him in southern italy first marriage raymond of poitiers arrived at antioch in april 1136 ralph of domfront latin patriarch of jerusalem made alice believe that raymond came to antioch to marry her instead of her nine year old daughter however constance was kidnapped from palace and ralph of domfront blessed her marriage to raymond in cathedral with marriage raymond became ruler of principality and alice retired to lattakieh in early 1147 roger ii of sicily extended an offer to louis vii of france to transport french crusaders to holy land during second crusade fearing that roger only wanted to assert his claim to antioch louisvii and his wife eleanor of aquitaine niece of raymond of poitiers declined louis and his crusaders came to principality in march 1148 before long rumors spread among crusaders about a love affair between raymond and eleanor crusaders tried to convince her husband to launch a campaign against aleppo capital of nur ad din but louisvii decided to leave antioch to jerusalem forcing eleanor to accompany him widowhood raymond was killed in battle of inab during an expedition against nur ad din zangi on june29 1149 since raymond and constance s four children were still underage there was no one to perform duties of a prince and raise people from despair according to william of tyre nur ad din invaded principality and seized all antiochene territories to east of orontes river aimery of limoges latin patriarch of antioch directed defense but most noblemen preferred a secular ruler after learning of raymond s fate constance s cousin baldwin iii of jerusalem hurried to antioch and assumed regency he also concluded a truce with nur ad din baldwin iii returned to antioch in summer 1150 he wanted to persuade constance to remarry proposing three candidates yves count of soissons walter of saint omer and ralph of merle but she declined urged by baldwiniii constance went to tripoli in early 1152 to meet him and her two aunts melisende and hodierna two ladies tried to persuade constance to choose among three candidates but she returned to antioch without making a promise to remarry according to william of tyre patriarch aimery convinced constance to resist because he wanted to control government of principality byzantine emperor manueli komnenos sent his widowed brother in law middle aged john dalassenos to antioch to marry constance however because of his age she regarded him with displeasure according to contemporaneous john kinnamos and refused to marry him historian steven runciman says that constance may have refused candidates proposed by baldwiniii and manueli because she had met raynald of chatillon a knight from france even though william of tyre described raynald as a knight of common sort constance decided to marry raynald their betrothal was kept secret because constance wanted to obtain baldwiniii s permission for marriage second marriage after baldwin sanctioned marriage constance and raynald married in early 1153 raynald took charge of administration of principality however he was unpopular because his subjects regarded him as an upstart his frequent attempts to raise funds brought him into conflict with patriarch aimery and emperor manueli during subsequent years emperor forced raynald to pay homage to him in spring of 1159 raynald was captured and imprisoned by majd al din governor of aleppo during a plundering raid in november 1160 or 1161 after her husband fell into captivity constance announced her intention to administer principality but most antiochene noblemen preferred a male ruler baldwiniii of jerusalem hurried to antioch and declared constance s fifteen year old son bohemond iii lawful prince charging patriarch aimery with administration of principality constance did not accept baldwin s decision and protested against it to emperor manuel manuel dispatched his nephew alexios bryennios komnenos and john kamateros to antioch to begin negotiations about his marriage to constance s daughter maria marriage contract was signed and emperor s delegates confirmed constance s position as ruler of principality baldwiniii who came to antioch to meet imperial envoys did not protest constance s son bohemond reached age of majority in 1163 to strengthen her position against her son constance sought assistance from constantine kalamanos byzantine governor of cilicia however antiochene barons made an alliance with ii of cilician armenia and forced her to leave antioch after constance s removal bohemondiii took control of principality before long constance died probably in lattakieh or according to steven runciman family constance s first husband raymond of poitiers was second son of william ix duke of aquitaine and his second wife philippa of toulouse he was born in 1114 according to william of tyre constance was left with two sons and as many daughters still underage when her husband died in 1149 their elder son bohemond was five at time of raymond s death he seized antioch from his mother in 1163 constance and raymond s eldest daughter maria who was born in late 1140s was famed for her beauty she married byzantine emperor manuel i komnenos in 1161 her younger sister philippa of antioch was given in marriage to humphrey ii of toron in late 1160s whether father of constance s second son baldwin was raymond of poitiers or raynald of chatillon cannot be determined with certainty baldwin died fighting at head of a byzantine cavalry regiment in battle of myriokephalon on 1176 it is certain that raynald fathered agnes who became wife of bela iii of hungary raynald and constance s second daughter alice became third wife of azzo vi of este in 1204 references sources further reading category 1128 births category 1163 deaths category 12th century princes of antioch category roman
