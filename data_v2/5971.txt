faster tyres towards end of session sebastian vettel aborted his last flying lap believing his time to be sufficient for proceeding into next round only for jenson button to set a time to relegate vettel into 16th place on grid eliminating him from qualifying vettel would later describe his and team s judgement as a small mistake with a big consequence fernando alonso in other mclaren did not

first with rosberg right behind him a much better time in third sector of track allowed rosberg to take his sixth consecutive pole position almost four tenths ahead of his teammate sergio perez held third spot for much of session but was beaten to it by kimi raikkonen during second turn of runs two were followed by daniel ricciardo and valtteri bottas on third row of grid following a gearbox

to pit for a new front wing and was later given a drive through penalty dropping him to end of field meanwhile nico hulkenberg and sebastian vettel made up places sitting in fifth and twelfth respectively after first lap valtteri bottas on other hand lost positions finding himself in tenth rosberg soon built a lead of over one second giving hamilton no chance to deploy drs for an overtake manoeuvre by lap 5 both kvyat and nasr had come into pits for harder compound tyre followed by ricciardo massa and perez one lap later on lap seven both hulkenberg and sainz jr made pit stops while hulkenberg was able to stay ahead of massa sainz s stop was unfortunate and he lost time due to a problem with tyre change another two laps later valtteri bottas pitted and was sent out into path of button damaging his front wing which he needed to replace following lap he also received a five second penalty to be served at his next scheduled stop leaders pitted for new tyres around laps ten and eleven with order now being rosberg ahead of vettel who was yet to stop hamilton and raikkonen romain grosjean who started on harder tyres just as vettel was up to sixth thumb jenson button left and kimi raikkonen on lap 13 felipe massa passed marcus ericsson for ninth place and one lap later hamilton capitalised on a mistake by vettel and overtook him to retake second position vettel lost another position when he let raikkonen pass him on lap 16 two being on different strategies meanwhile rosberg had built up a lead of around six seconds to hamilton on lap 19 carlos sainz jr allowed

brakes forcing him to pit he emerged in 15th position vettel came in for his first pit stop on lap 24 coming out in sixth place ahead of compatriot nico hulkenberg at same time hamilton started to reduce gap to rosberg in front cutting it down to less than two seconds by lap 29 with his teammate closing in rosberg made pit stops on lap 32 with raikkonen following suit whose pit stop was delayed losing him around four seconds sergio perez was starting to close gap to both ferrari drivers in front of him after pitting early vettel reacted on lap 41 and changed to super soft tyres coming out behind both perez and ricciardo in sixth one lap later hamilton came in for his second and final stop having asked his team before if it would be possible to finish race without stopping again he emerged twelve seconds behind rosberg and started to cut into his advantage immediately further back in field max verstappen overtook nasr and button to move into twelfth place on laps 44 and 46 respectively however he was deemed to have forced button wide and was handed a five second penalty to be added to his finishing time lap 53 saw romain grosjean move into final point scoring position of tenth by passing carlos sainz jr into turn eight just one lap later he took ninth place from daniil kvyat at front hamilton proved unable to reach his teammate who took checkered flag for his sixth

nico rosberg expressed excitement over how end of season had worked out for him describing race in united states as his low point speaking about racing his teammate hamilton he called him one of best out there and said that it was an even better feeling to win definitely against such opposition hamilton in turn praised his team for their performance over whole season saying that they had surpassed their own expectations albeit confessing that he was happy that season was over during press conference third placed kimi raikkonen said it s never nice to finish third but i ll take it after previous races pointing to a season that had been marred with small mistakes and misfortunes for him he also stated that securing fourth place in world championship did not mean much to him dismissing idea of a finnish championship between himself and valtteri bottas fourth placed sebastian vettel said after race best result one way or another would be p3 and p4 so we can be very happy with today adding that he and raikkonen had a clean race for p3 he also described his 2015 campaign as a miracle after ferrari had endured a winless speaking about incident between bottas and button at first round of pit stops williams head of performance engineering rob smedley said that team had released their driver at right moment declaring accident happened because bottas saw button too late following two incidents during race max verstappen was given time penalties and three penalty points on his fia super licence one for overtaking jenson button outside track limits and two for ignoring blue flags while lewis hamilton tried to lap him penalties meant that he was just four points away from a one race ban raikkonen taking fourth position from bottas in drivers championship was only change in both
