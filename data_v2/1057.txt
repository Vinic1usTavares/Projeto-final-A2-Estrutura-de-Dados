zinc oxide is an inorganic compound with formula zno is a white powder that is insoluble in water and it is widely used as an additive in numerous materials and products including rubbers plastics ceramics glass cement lubricants paints ointments adhesives sealants pigments foods batteries ferrites fire retardants and first aid tapes although it occurs naturally as mineral zincite most zinc oxide is produced synthetically de marcel 2006 2 3 zinc oxide zinc white pigments inorganic 1 in ullmann s encyclopedia of industrial chemistry wiley vch weinheim zno is a wide bandgap semiconductor of ii vi semiconductor group native doping of semiconductor due to oxygen vacancies or zinc interstitials is n type this semiconductor has several favorable properties including good transparency high electron mobility wide bandgap and strong room temperature luminescence those properties are valuable in emerging applications for transparent electrodes in liquid crystal displays energy saving or heat protecting windows and electronics as thin film transistors and light emitting diodes chemical properties pure zno is a white powder but in nature it occurs as rare mineral zincite which usually contains manganese and other impurities that confer a yellow to red color crystalline zinc oxide is changing from white to yellow when heated in air and reverting to white on cooling this color change is caused by a small loss of oxygen to environment at high temperatures to form non stoichiometric xo where at 800 degc x 0 zinc oxide is an amphoteric oxide it is nearly insoluble in water but it will dissolve in most acids such as hydrochloric acid zno 2 hcl zncl2 h2o solid zinc oxide will also dissolve in alkalis to give soluble zno 2 naoh h2o na2 zn oh 4 zno reacts slowly with fatty acids in oils to produce corresponding carboxylates such as or stearate zno forms cement like products when mixed with a strong aqueous solution of zinc chloride and these are best described as zinc hydroxy chlorides this cement was used in dentistry thumb 150px left hopeite zno also forms cement like material when treated with phosphoric acid related materials are used in dentistry a major component of zinc phosphate cement produced by this reaction is hopeite po4 2 zno decomposes into zinc vapor and oxygen at around 1975 degc with a standard oxygen pressure in a carbothermic reaction heating with

unit cell structure zinc oxide crystallizes in two main forms hexagonal wurtzite and cubic zincblende wurtzite structure is most stable at ambient conditions and thus most common zincblende form can be stabilized by growing zno on substrates with cubic lattice structure in both cases zinc and oxide centers are tetrahedral most characteristic geometry for zn ii zno converts to rocksalt motif at relatively high pressures about 10 gpa hexagonal and zincblende have no inversion symmetry reflection of a crystal relative to any given point does not transform it into itself this and other lattice symmetry properties result in piezoelectricity of hexagonal and zincblende zno and of hexagonal zno hexagonal structure has a point group 6 mm hermann notation or notation and space group is or lattice constants are a 3 25 a and c 5 2 a their ratio c a 1 60 is close to ideal value for hexagonal cell c a 1 633 as in most group ii vi materials bonding in zno is largely ionic zn2 o2 with corresponding radii of 0 074 nm for zn2 and 0 140 nm for o2 this property accounts for preferential formation of wurtzite rather than zinc blende structure as well as strong piezoelectricity of zno because of polar zn o bonds zinc and oxygen planes are electrically charged to maintain electrical neutrality those planes reconstruct at atomic level in most relative materials but not in zno its surfaces are atomically flat stable and exhibit no reconstruction this anomaly of zno is not fully explained however studies using structures explained origin of surface flatness and absence of reconstruction at zno wurtzite surfaces in addition to origin of charges on zno planes mechanical properties zno is a relatively soft material with approximate hardness of 4 5 on mohs scale its elastic constants are smaller than those of relevant iii v semiconductors such as gan high heat capacity and heat conductivity low thermal expansion and high melting temperature of zno are beneficial for ceramics e2 optical phonon in zno exhibits an unusually long lifetime of 133 ps at 10 k among bonded semiconductors it has been stated that zno has highest piezoelectric tensor or at least one comparable to that of gan and aln this property makes it a technologically important material for many applications which require a large electromechanical coupling electrical properties zno has a relatively large direct band gap of 3 3 ev at room temperature advantages associated with a large band gap include higher breakdown voltages ability to sustain large electric fields lower electronic noise and high temperature and high power operation bandgap of zno can further be tuned to 3 4 ev by its alloying with magnesium oxide or cadmium oxide most zno has n type character even in absence of intentional doping is typically origin of n type character but subject remains controversial an alternative explanation has been proposed based on theoretical calculations that unintentional hydrogen impurities are responsible controllable n type doping is easily achieved by substituting zn with group iii elements such as al ga in or by substituting oxygen with group vii elements chlorine or iodine reliable p type doping of zno remains difficult this problem originates from low solubility of p type dopants and their compensation by abundant n type impurities this problem is observed with gan and znse measurement of p type in intrinsically n type material is complicated by of samples current limitations to p doping limit electronic and optoelectronic applications of zno which usually require junctions of n type and p type material known p type dopants include group i elements li na k group v elements n p and as as well as copper and silver however many of these form deep acceptors and do not produce significant p type conduction at room temperature electron mobility of zno strongly varies with temperature and has a maximum of 2000 cm2 v s at 80 k data on hole mobility are scarce with values in range 5 30 cm2 v s zno discs acting as a are active material in most surge arresters rene smeets lou van der sluis mirsad david f anton janssen switching in electrical transmission and distribution systems 2014 p 316 r patel introduction to electrical power and power electronics 2012 p 247 production for industrial use zno is produced at levels of 105 tons per year by three main processes indirect process in indirect or french process metallic zinc is melted in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907 degc typically around 1000 degc zinc vapor reacts with oxygen in air to give zno accompanied by a drop in its temperature and bright luminescence zinc oxide particles are transported into a cooling duct and collected in a bag house this indirect method was popularized by leclaire france in 1844 and therefore is commonly known as french process its product normally consists of zinc oxide particles with an average size of 0 1 to a few micrometers by weight most of world s zinc oxide is manufactured via french process direct process direct or american process starts with diverse contaminated zinc composites such as zinc ores or smelter by products zinc precursors are reduced carbothermal reduction by heating with a source of carbon such as anthracite to produce zinc vapor which is then oxidized as in indirect process because of lower purity of source material final product is also of lower quality in direct process as compared to indirect one wet chemical process a small amount of industrial production involves wet chemical processes which start with aqueous solutions of zinc salts from which zinc carbonate or zinc hydroxide is precipitated solid precipitate is then calcined at temperatures around 800 degc laboratory synthesis thumb red and green colors of these synthetic zno crystals result from different concentrations of oxygen vacancies numerous specialised methods exist for producing zno for scientific studies and niche applications these methods can be classified by resulting zno form bulk thin film nanowire temperature low that is close to room temperature or high that is t 1000 degc process type vapor deposition or growth from solution and other parameters large single crystals many cubic centimeters can be grown by gas transport vapor phase deposition hydrothermal synthesis or melt growth however because of high vapor pressure of zno growth from melt is problematic growth by gas transport is difficult to control leaving hydrothermal method as a preference thin films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy pulsed laser deposition sputtering sol gel synthesis atomic layer deposition spray pyrolysis etc ordinary white powdered zinc oxide can be produced in laboratory by electrolyzing a solution of sodium bicarbonate with a zinc anode zinc hydroxide and hydrogen gas are produced zinc hydroxide upon heating decomposes to zinc oxide zn 2 h2o zn oh 2 h2 zn oh 2 zno h2o zno nanostructures nanostructures of zno can be synthesized into a variety of morphologies including nanowires nanorods tetrapods nanoparticles etc nanostructures can be obtained with most above mentioned techniques at certain conditions and also with vapor liquid solid method synthesis is typically carried out at temperatures of about 90 degc in an aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and hexamine latter providing basic environment certain additives such as polyethylene glycol or can improve aspect ratio of zno nanowires doping of zno nanowires has been achieved by adding other metal nitrates to growth solution morphology of resulting nanostructures can be tuned by changing parameters relating to precursor composition such as zinc concentration and ph or to thermal treatment such as temperature and heating rate aligned zno nanowires on pre seeded silicon glass and gallium nitride substrates have been grown using aqueous zinc salts such as zinc nitrate and zinc acetate in basic environments pre seeding substrates with zno creates sites for homogeneous nucleation of zno crystal during synthesis common pre seeding methods include in situ thermal decomposition of zinc acetate crystallites of zno nanoparticles and use of physical vapor deposition methods to deposit zno thin films pre seeding can be performed in conjunction with top down patterning methods such as electron beam lithography and lithography to designate nucleation sites prior to growth aligned zno nanowires can be used in dye sensitized solar cells and field emission devices history zinc compounds were probably used by early humans in processed and unprocessed forms as a paint or medicinal ointment but their composition is uncertain use of probably zinc oxide as a salve for eyes and open wounds is mentioned in indian medical text charaka samhita thought to date from 500 bc or before zinc oxide ointment is also mentioned by greek physician dioscorides 1st century ad galen suggested treating cancers with zinc oxide as did avicenna in his canon of medicine zinc oxide is no longer used for treating skin cancer though it is still used as an ingredient in products such as baby powder and creams against diaper rashes calamine cream anti dandruff shampoos and antiseptic ointments romans produced considerable quantities of brass an alloy of zinc and copper as early as 200 bc by a cementation process where copper was reacted with zinc oxide zinc encyclopaedia britannica 2009 encyclopaedia britannica 10 march 2009 zinc oxide is thought to have been produced by heating zinc ore in a shaft furnace this liberated metallic zinc as a vapor which then ascended flue and condensed as oxide this process was described by dioscorides in 1st century ad zinc oxide has also been recovered from zinc mines at in india dating from second half of first millennium bc this was presumably also made in same way and used to produce brass from 12th to 16th century zinc and zinc oxide were recognized and produced in india using a primitive form of direct synthesis process from india zinc manufacture moved to china in 17th century in 1743 first european zinc smelter was established in bristol united kingdom general information of zinc from national institute of health who and international zinc association retrieved 10 march 2009 main usage of zinc oxide zinc white was in paints and as an additive to ointments zinc white was accepted as a pigment in oil paintings by 1834 but it did not mix well with oil this problem was solved by optimizing synthesis of zno in 1845 leclaire in paris was producing oil paint on a large scale and by 1850 zinc white was being manufactured throughout europe success of zinc white paint was due to its advantages over traditional white lead zinc white is essentially permanent in sunlight it is not blackened by sulfur bearing air it is non toxic and more economical because zinc white is so clean it is valuable for making tints with other colors but it makes a rather brittle dry film when unmixed with other colors for example during late 1890s and early 1900s some artists used zinc white as a ground for their oil paintings all those paintings developed cracks over years zinc white org retrieved 10 march 2009 in recent times most zinc oxide was used in rubber industry to resist corrosion in

non comedogenic zinc from zinc oxide is however slightly absorbed into skin many sunscreens use nanoparticles of zinc oxide along with nanoparticles of titanium dioxide because such small particles do not scatter light and therefore do not appear white there has been concern that they might be absorbed into skin a study published in 2010 found a 0 23 to 1 31 mean 0 42 of blood zinc levels in venous blood samples could be traced to zinc from zno nanoparticles applied to human skin for 5 days and traces were also found in urine samples in contrast a comprehensive review of medical literature from 2011 says that no evidence of systemic absorption can be found in literature zinc oxide nanoparticles can enhance antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin it has been shown that nano zno which has average size between 20 nm and 45 nm can enhance antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli in vitro enhancing effect of this nanomaterial is concentration dependent against all test strains this effect may be due to two reasons first zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with nora protein which is developed for conferring resistance in bacteria and has pumping activity that mediate of hydrophilic from a cell second zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with omf protein which is responsible for permeation of antibiotics into cell
