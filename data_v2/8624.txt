1957 atlantic hurricane season featured one of longest travelling tropical cyclones in atlantic basin hurricane carrie nevertheless season was generally inactive with eight tropical storms two of which went unnamed and three hurricanes two of which intensified further to attain major hurricane intensity season officially began on june 15 and ended on november 15 though year s first tropical cyclone developed prior to start of season on june 8 final storm dissipated on october 27 well before official end of season strongest hurricane of year was carrie which reached equivalent of a category 4 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale on two separate occasions in open atlantic carrie later caused sinking of german ship pamir southwest of azores resulting in 80 deaths in total season resulted in at least 513 fatalities and 152 5 million in damages hurricane audrey was season s most destructive and deadly storm causing 416 deaths and about 150 million in damages audrey made landfall just east of sabine pass texas in u s state of louisiana as a strong category 3 hurricane in late june three other tropical storms in year made landfalls along gulf coast of united states bringing heavy rains that resulted in widespread flooding across much of southeastern united states highest rainfall total measured associated with a tropical cyclone was in quarantine louisiana during tropical storm esther however an unofficial reading of was measured in an unknown location in florida panhandle during tropical storm one year s other tropical systems curved out to sea without causing much impact after season name audrey was retired season summary atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 15 1957 it was a below average season in which eight tropical cyclones formed of which three became hurricanes of these hurricanes two became major hurricanes in an average season ten tropical cyclones form of which five become hurricanes five of season s eight tropical cyclones developed in gulf of mexico most since 1936 season in which six formed in gulf first tropical storm of season formed on june 8 a week before official start of hurricane season however first named storm audrey formed afterwards on june 25 these two storms were only to form in june during season july featured no atlantic tropical cyclones tropical storm bertha was only system to form during august developing in gulf of mexico despite warm sea surface temperatures ssts in tropical atlantic no storms formed during month below climatological average of one low monthly activity was in part due to an unfavorable wind pattern which prevailed across atlantic for much of month in september however conditions for tropical cyclogenesis were more favorable with concomitant cyclonic activity four storms formed of which two attained hurricane strength higher than mean activity of last 70 septembers by contrast only one tropical storm formed in october below average of two in month this tropical storm dissipated on october 27 16 days before official end of hurricane season five tropical cyclones made landfall during hurricane season including one hurricane all of these storms made landfall on gulf coast of united states property damage that resulted from cyclone related impacts totaled to 152 million in united states with most caused by hurricane audrey which made landfall near border between texas and louisiana 513 deaths were also caused by tropical storms during season with 416 deaths attributable to hurricane audrey season s activity was reflective with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 84 which is categorized as being near normal however this was under 1950 2000 average of 96 1 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricanes multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical cyclones with winds exceeding 39 mph 63 km h which is tropical storm strength systems tropical storm one an area of disturbed weather accompanied by low barometric pressure was first identified near yucatan peninsula on june 7 reports from following day in region reported pressures that were indicative of a developing tropical cyclone and at 06 00 utc disturbance attained tropical depression strength first of season depression quickly developed into a tropical storm later that day though hurricane reconnaissance flights could not locate a well defined center ship observations showed that tropical storm was moving quickly to northeast due to its fast forward motion storm gained little in organization and made landfall near port leon florida on june 9 with winds of 50 mph 85 km h however system gradually strengthened as it crossed florida peninsula reentering north atlantic later that day on june 10 storm reached peak winds of 65 mph 100 km h prior to becoming an extratropical storm post tropical cyclone then strengthened and moved erratically in open seas before entirely dissipating on june 15 despite tropical storm s fast passage over land heavy rainfall was reported officially peaking at in live oak florida however unofficial reports of at least of rain were collected in perry florida 100 200 families were evacuated due to floodwater field crops including tobacco and watermelon were damaged with flood damage estimated at 30 000 storm also spawned ten tornadoes with nine in northeastern florida and one on georgia s jekyll island all of these tornadoes were relatively weak and caused minor damage totaling to 12 000 at coast tropical storm s strong winds generated waves high which caused moderate damage though located south of where storm made landfall buildings and roads along tampa bay area waterfront were flooded by waves cabin cruiser capsized in gulf of mexico due to waves and five of seven crew on board drowned these were only deaths associated with system coastal damages due to storm surge amounted to 10 000 and overall storm caused 52 000 in damages across southeastern united states hurricane audrey an ill defined tropical wave was first identified in caribbean sea on june 20 and moved westward into bay of campeche disturbance slowly strengthened as it developed a low pressure system a nearby trough aided intensification of system and it developed into a tropical depression on june 25 while remaining generally stationary in bay of campeche situated in an area of favorable upper air divergence and warm ssts storm quickly organized and strengthened reaching hurricane strength later that day audrey began to accelerate northward due to troughing in upper levels in atmosphere during this time hurricane rapidly intensified attaining category 3 hurricane strength on june 27 audrey reached peak intensity with winds of and made landfall at this intensity near mouth of sabine river later that day hurricane quickly weakened as it moved inland becoming an extratropical cyclone by june 28 extratropical remnants of audrey moved northeastward across united states before completely dissipating on june 29 over southern quebec hurricane audrey caused widespread impacts across a wide swath of united states and canada storm s worst effects were felt in louisiana where storm caused 120 million in damages highest storm surge measured with hurricane was reported west of cameron louisiana strong surge inundated much of coast killing much of local wildlife and causing widespread property damage heavy rainfall also caused flooding peaking at west of basile louisiana rainfall was concentrated particularly in atchafalaya basin in texas effects of storm were much less severe but storm still caused 8 million in damages primarily as a result of strong winds further inland weakening hurricane spawned tornadoes and caused additional flooding in conjunction with a frontal boundary effects of audrey were felt as far north as canada where 15 people died due to strong winds and heavy rain in total storm caused 152 million in damages and at least 416 deaths tropical storm bertha a weak extratropical low entered gulf of mexico on august 6 and drifted slowly westward system slowly organized developing into a tropical storm on august 8 about south of mississippi river delta moving generally northward bertha quickly organized system attained its peak intensity with and an estimated minimum pressure of 998 mbar hpa 29 47 inhg on august 9 that same day bertha came ashore near cameron louisiana at same intensity after landfall storm moved northward due to a strong high pressure system and weakened over land before degenerating into a remnant low at 1800 utc on august 11 over oklahoma storm s remnants later moved across u s interior highlands before dissipating in gulf of mexico 1 350 workers on offshore oil drilling platforms were evacuated in preparation for storm oil drilling tender no 1 sunk due to strong waves though two people on board at time were evacuated by helicopter at coast maximum storm surge height measured was at schooner bayou control structure bertha dropped heavy rainfall primarily as a remnant low across much of ozarks rainfall peaked at near damascus arkansas which set a 24 hour rainfall record for city and made august 1957 wettest month on record across arkansas heavy rains triggered flash floods after numerous rivers exceeded flood stage flash floods caused property damage in cities adjacent to rivers though damage estimates were difficult to accurately obtain four arkansas counties reported combined losses of 925 000 and two deaths were reported hurricane carrie hurricane carrie formed from an easterly tropical wave off western coast of africa on september 2 moving to west storm gradually intensified reaching hurricane strength on september 5 carrie intensified further before reaching peak intensity on september 8 as a category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of in open atlantic ocean hurricane curved northward and fluctuated in intensity before recurving to west and restrengthening attaining category 4 intensity for a second time as it neared bermuda on september 14 however carrie passed well north of island and turned to northeast towards europe weakening as it reached higher latitudes storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on september 23 prior to affecting areas of british isles due to its distance away from any major land masses carrie caused relatively minor damage along its path on september 16 hurricane passed well north of bermuda causing minimal damage despite its intensity at time though hurricane reconnaissance flights in area were postponed due to damage sustained by one of aircraft as it was transitioning into an extratropical cyclone southwest of azores german ship pamir encountered storm and capsized on september 21 resulting in deaths of 80 crew members on board on september 23 carrie completed its extratropical transition as an extratropical storm carrie brought strong storm surge and heavy rain to british isles which claimed three lives hurricane s long duration and path in open water also helped it attain a number of atlantic hurricane records tropical storm debbie on september 5 a weak easterly wave moved into gulf of mexico from caribbean sea due to influence of an upper level trough wave organized and spawned a weak area of circulation which developed into a tropical storm by 0600 utc on september 7 moving steadily towards northeast at roughly debbie only marginally strengthened due to presence of cooler air entrainment early on september 8 debbie made landfall near fort walton beach florida as a minimal tropical storm with winds of a minimum barometric pressure of 1005 mbar hpa 29 68 inhg was recorded in pensacola florida tropical storm weakened as it moved over land degenerating to a tropical depression on september 9 system became increasingly diffuse and later merged with strong weather systems by 0600 utc later that day offshore tropical storm generated high tides above average in apalachee bay located about east of where debbie made landfall strong surf caused some localized flooding in st marks florida a station recorded maximum sustained winds of highest measured in association with storm however a station in tampa florida recorded a peak wind gust of in a squall heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding though rainfall was mostly beneficial to crops rainfall peaked at in florida while precipitation was reported as far north as pennsylvania tropical storm only caused minor damage but was indirectly responsible for four deaths tropical storm esther on september 12 a mid level circulation area formed over nicaragua and slowly drifted northeastward into gulf of mexico as it entered gulf system developed thunderstorm activity and an area of low pressure and as a result weather bureau began initiating advisories on a newly formed tropical depression by 1800 utc on september 16 depression quickly intensified and attained tropical storm strength by next day at time esther had a minimum pressure of 1000 mbar hpa 29 53 inhg as reported by a hurricane reconnaissance flight this would be lowest pressure measured associated with esther large tropical storm intensified to peak winds of later that day and held that intensity before making landfall in southeastern louisiana on morning on september 18 esther weakened over land and later dissipated over mississippi valley by 1200 utc on september 19 like tropical storm debbie which had made landfall just a week prior in same area esther s wind impacts were minimal strongest gust measured associated with storm was as recorded at pensacola international airport other locations reported similar gusts and strong winds in squalls heavy rains persisted in region well after esther moved inland resulting in high rainfall amounts rainfall peaked at in quarantine louisiana near mouth of mississippi river heavy rains breached several levees resulting in severe flooding particularly in buras louisiana although rainfall was beneficial in many places due to an existing drought cotton pecan and peanut crops were damaged by floods while crop damage amounted to 1 million property damage amounted to 1 5 million esther also caused three indirect deaths all of which were in louisiana hurricane frieda on september 20 a low pressure area developed within same frontal boundary that had curved hurricane carrie towards azores rapidly developing system was classified as a tropical depression at 1200 utc later that day southwest of bermuda initially depression was ill defined and was slowly moving to southwest following day attached cold front dissipated allowing for system to intensify system was subsequently upgraded a tropical storm by september 22 following a reconnaissance flight into system which reported a minimum pressure of 1001 mbar hpa 29 56 inhg at time however frieda was a small system with minimal shower activity gradually strengthening frieda reached an initial peak intensity with winds of later that day following split of an upper level ridge to north frieda recurved towards northeast next day as it sped to northeast a westerly shortwave progressed eastward enhancing environmental conditions as a result tropical storm began to quickly strengthen by 1200 utc on september 25 frieda attained hurricane strength and reached peak intensity with winds of and a minimum pressure of 992 mbar hpa 29 30 inhg as reported by canadian merchant ship however a cold front associated with shortwave encountered hurricane which caused it to transition into an extratropical cyclone on september 26 frieda s extratropical remnants later passed over newfoundland though frieda remained far from any land masses a peak rainfall amount of was measured in bermuda tropical storm eight on october 22 an area of thunderstorm activity developed north of lesser antilles and barometric pressures fell throughout region following day a cut off low developed and strengthened along edge of a trough extending from bermuda this justified classification of system as a tropical depression on october 23 northeast of puerto rico moving towards west depression attained tropical storm strength shortly after formation a ship reported a minimum pressure of 999 mbar hpa 29 50 inhg in storm s vicinity large system gradually strengthened following day reaching its peak intensity by 1800 utc on october 24 a ship reported a minimum pressure of 993 mbar hpa 29 33 inhg early next day lowest pressure measured in association with tropical storm at same time tropical storm also recurved towards northeast heading towards more northerly latitudes a gradual weakening trend began due to presence of an extratropical system tropical storm was itself absorbed by same system on october 27 this storm may not have been named operationally due to a lack of discernible tropical characteristics storm names following names were used for tropical cyclones that reached at least tropical storm intensity in north atlantic in 1957 however two of such storms first and last went unnamed name audrey would later be retired only seventh name to do so storms were named audrey bertha carrie debbie esther and frieda for first time in 1957 audrey bertha carrie debbie esther frieda see also 1957 pacific hurricane season 1957 pacific typhoon season list of atlantic hurricanes list of atlantic hurricane seasons notes
