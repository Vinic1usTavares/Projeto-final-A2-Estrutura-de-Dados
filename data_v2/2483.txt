white winged fairywren malurus leucopterus is a species of passerine bird in australasian wren family maluridae it lives in drier parts of central australia from central queensland and south australia across to western australia like other fairywrens this species displays marked sexual dimorphism and one or more males of a social group grow brightly coloured plumage during breeding season female is sandy brown with light blue tail feathers it is smaller than male which in breeding plumage has a bright blue body black bill and white wings younger sexually mature males are almost indistinguishable from females and are often breeding males in spring and summer a troop of white winged fairywrens has a brightly coloured older male accompanied by small inconspicuous brown birds many of which are also male three subspecies are recognised apart from mainland subspecies one is found on dirk hartog island and another on barrow island off coast of western australia males from these islands have black rather than blue breeding plumage white winged fairywren mainly eats insects supplementing this with small fruits and leaf buds it occurs in heathland and arid scrubland where low shrubs provide cover like other fairywrens it is a cooperative breeding species and small groups of birds maintain and defend territories year round groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising young these helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity but remain with family group for one or more years after fledging although not yet confirmed genetically white winged fairywren may be promiscuous and assist in raising young from other pairings as part of a courtship display male wren plucks petals from flowers and displays them to female birds taxonomy and systematics a specimen of white winged fairywren was first collected by french naturalists jean rene constant quoy and joseph paul gaimard in september 1818 on louis de freycinet s voyage around southern hemisphere specimen was subsequently lost in a shipwreck but a painting entitled merion by jacques arago survived and led to bird s description in 1824 by french ornithologist charles dumont de sainte croix schodde 1982 p 108 name for species was derived from ancient greek leuko white and pteron wing ironically original specimen was of black plumaged subspecies from dirk hartog island which was not recorded again for 80 years meanwhile widespread blue plumaged subspecies was discovered and described as two separate species by john gould in 1865 he called one specimen collected from inland new south wales white winged superb warbler m while another which appeared to have a white back and wings was described as white backed superb warbler m leuconotus it was not until early 20th century that both of these blue plumaged mainland forms were found to be of a single species rowley russell 1997 p 177 george mack ornithologist of national museum of victoria considered specific name leuconotus to take precedence in his 1934 revision of genus and more recent studies have followed suit rowley russell 1997 p 178 back region between shoulders is in fact bare with feathers that arise from shoulder scapular region and sweep inwards in different patterns this variation confused early naturalists who described white backed and blue backed species white winged fairywren was often referred to as blue and white wren and early observers such as norman of victoria refer to them by this name however like other fairywrens white winged fairywren is unrelated to true wren family troglodytidae other alternative names used include white backed fairywren white backed wren and white winged wren it was previously classified as a member of old world flycatcher family muscicapidae and later as a member of warbler family sylviidae before they were placed in newly recognised australasian wren family maluridae in 1975 more recently dna analysis has shown family maluridae to be related to family meliphagidae honeyeaters and pardalotidae pardalotes scrubwrens thornbills gerygones and allies in large superfamily meliphagoidea white winged fairywren is one of eleven species in genus malurus it is most closely related to australian red backed fairywren with which it makes up a phylogenetic clade with white shouldered fairywren of new guinea as next closest relative termed bicoloured wrens by ornithologist richard schodde these three species are notable for their lack of head patterns and ear tufts and their uniform black or blue plumage with contrasting shoulder or wing colour they replace each other geographically across northern australia and new guinea schodde 1982 p 31 subspecies there are three recognised subspecies both black plumaged forms have been called black and white fairywren and black and white wren m l leucopterus dumont 1824 range of nominate subspecies is restricted to dirk hartog island off western coast of australia and nuptial males display black and white plumage this subspecies is smallest of three and bears a proportionally longer tail rowley russell 1997 pp 177 178 it was collected again in 1916 by tom carter 98 years after de freycinet s expedition collected type specimen m l edouardi campbell a j 1901 originally described as a separate species this subspecies like nominate subspecies have black and white coloured males but are found only on barrow island also off western coast of australia birds of this subspecies are larger than those of nominate subspecies but have a shorter tail female has a more cinnamon tinge to her plumage than grey brown of other two subspecies blue and white fairywren m l leuconotus gould 1865 originally described as a separate species it is endemic to mainland australia and distinct in that it is only subspecies to have nuptial males that show prominent blue and white plumage scientific name of this subspecies is derived from ancient greek leukos white and notos back birds in southern parts of its range tend to be smaller than those in north m l leucopterus and m l edouardi are both generally smaller than their mainland relatives and both subspecies tend to have smaller family groups that consist of only one male and one female with an occasional helper bird while island subspecies and mainland species have been found to have similar social structure breeding pairs on both islands have on average smaller clutches longer incubation times and fewer live fledglings additionally while m l leuconotus is considered of least concern by iucn due to its widespread occurrence both island subspecies are considered vulnerable by australian government due to their delicate nesting sites that are easily disturbed by human construction and habitation evolutionary history both island subspecies are nearer in genetic distance to mainland populations of leuconotus than to each other dirk hartog island is from mainland while barrow island is from mainland gene flow between populations existed at beginning of present interglacial period some 8 000 to 10 000 years ago at a time when sea levels were lower and both islands connected with mainland there are three theories as to how three races of white winged fairywren could have evolved first suggests that black and white plumage is an ancestral condition and following separation of three populations blue and white plumage evolved in mainland species second hypothesis suggests that black and white plumage evolved convergently on two separate islands third suggests that black and white plumage evolved once from blue and white ancestral condition and later mainland species re evolved blue plumage distribution of three bi coloured fairywren species indicates their ancestors lived across new guinea and northern australia in a period when sea levels were lower and two regions were joined by a land bridge populations became separated as sea levels rose and new guinea birds evolved into white shouldered fairywren and australian forms into red backed fairywren and arid adapted white winged fairywren rowley russell 1997 p 31 description thumb left male ssp leuconotus in partial breeding plumage dam queensland measuring in length white winged fairywrens are one of two smallest species of malurus males typically weigh between while females weigh between averaging in males and in females bill is relatively long narrow and pointed and wider at base rowley russell 1997 p 38 wider than it is deep bill is similar in shape to those of other birds that feed by probing for or picking insects off their environs it is finer and more pointed in this species than in other fairywrens thumb female white winged fairywren fully mature adults are sexually dimorphic with male being larger and differing in colour from female adult female is sandy brown with a very light blue tail and a pinkish buff bill male in breeding plumage has a black bill white wings and shoulders and a wholly cobalt blue or black body depending on subspecies these contrasting white feathers are especially highlighted in flight and ground displays in breeding season male in eclipse plumage resembles female though it may be distinguished by its darker bill rowley russell 1997 p 176 both sexes have long slender distinct tails held at an upward angle from their bodies measuring around tail feathers have a white fringe which disappears with wear rowley russell 1997 p 37 nestlings fledglings and juveniles have brown plumage and pink brown bills with shorter tails than adults young males develop blue tail feathers and darker bills by late summer or autumn following a spring or summer breeding season while young females develop light blue tails by subsequent spring all males are fertile and have developed cloacal protuberances which store sperm in contrast during breeding season fertile females develop brood patches which are bare areas on their bellies males entering their second or third year may develop spotty blue and white plumage during breeding season by their fourth year males have assumed their nuptial plumage where scapulars secondary wing coverts and secondary flight feathers are white while rest of their bodies are a vibrant cobalt blue all sexually mature males moult twice a year once before breeding season in winter or spring and again afterwards in autumn rarely a male may moult directly from nuptial to nuptial plumage breeding males blue plumage particularly ear coverts is highly iridescent due to flattened and twisted surface of barbules rowley russell 1997 p 44 blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens whose colour vision extends into this part of spectrum vocalisations in 1980 tideman characterised five different patterns of calls among malurus leucopterus leuconotus these were recognised by pruett and jones among island subspecies m l edouardi main call is a reel made by both sexes in order to establish territory and unify group it is a long song of rising and falling notes that is first signaled by 3 5 chip notes although seemingly weak in sound reel carries a long way above stunted shrubland a harsh call is often used to establish contact especially between mothers and their young and to raise alarm it is characterised by a series of loud and abrupt calls that vary in frequency and intensity adults will use a high pitched peep that may be made intermittently with reels as a contact call to birds that are more distant nestlings fledglings and females around nest will use high pips quiet high pitched and short calls when used by a mature female they are mixed with harsh calls nestlings may also make noises when they are being fed subordinate helpers and feeders may also make this sound rowley russell 1997 pp 178 179 distribution and habitat white winged fairywren is well adapted to dry environments and m l leuconotus is found throughout arid and semi arid environments between latitudes 19 and in mainland australia it occupies coastal western australia from around port hedland south to perth and stretches eastwards over to mount isa in queensland and along western parts of great dividing range through central queensland and central western new south wales into northwestern corner of victoria and eyre peninsula and across nullarbor schodde 1982 p 110 it commonly with other species of fairywren including purple backed fairy wren m white winged fairywrens often inhabit heathlands or treeless shrublands dominated by saltbush atriplex and small shrubs of genus or grasses such as tussock grass triodia and cane grass as well as floodplain areas vegetated with lignum m l leucopterus inhabits similar habitats on dirk hartog island and m l edouardi does same on barrow island white winged fairywren is replaced to north of its range on mainland australia by red backed fairywren rowley russell 1997 p 179 behaviour and ecology usual form of locomotion is hopping with both feet leaving ground and landing simultaneously however birds may run when performing rodent run display rowley russell 1997 p 42 its balance is assisted by a proportionally large tail which is usually held upright and rarely still short rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights though not for extended jaunts rowley russell 1997 p 41 white winged fairywrens live in complex social groups rowley russell 1997 p 57 clans consist of 2 4 birds typically one brown or partially blue male and a breeding female nest helpers are birds raised in previous years which remain with family group after fledging and assist in raising young rowley russell 1997 p 88 they may be male that have retained their brown plumage or female birds in a group roost side by side in dense cover and engage in mutual preening rowley russell 1997 pp 61 62 several subgroups live within one territory and make up a clan which is presided over by one blue or black male who assumes breeding plumage while blue male is dominant to rest of brown and partially blue males within his clan he nests with only one female and contributes to raising of only her young it is unclear whether or not he fathers young in any of other nests within his territory each clan has a specified area of land that all members contribute to foraging from and defending frequently territory sizes normally are correlated with abundance of rain and resources in a region smaller territories occur where insects and resources are plentiful additionally feeding territories are larger during winter months when these birds spend much of their time foraging with entire clan white winged fairywrens occupy much larger territories than other fairywren species rowley russell 1997 p 59 observed in this species rowley russell 1997 p 180 wing fluttering display is seen in several situations females responding and presumably acquiescing to male courtship displays juveniles begging for food by helpers to older birds and immature males to senior ones fairywren lowers its head and tail and quivers its wings and holds its beak open silently rowley russell 1997 p 77 both male and female adult white winged fairywren may utilise a rodent run display to distract predators from nests with young birds head neck and tail are lowered wings are held out and feathers are fluffed as bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call courtship and breeding fairywrens exhibit one of highest incidences of extra pair mating and many broods are brought up a by male who is not natural father however courtship methods among white winged fairywrens remain unclear blue plumaged males have been seen outside of their territory and in some cases carrying pink or purple petals which among other species advertise male to neighboring females in contrast black plumaged males on barrow and dirk hartog islands often carry blue petals while petal carrying outside of clan territories strongly suggests mating with other females is occurring further genetic analysis is necessary during another courtship display male bows deeply forward facing female reaching ground with his bill and spreading and flattening his plumage in a near horizontal plane for up to 20 seconds in this pose white plumage forms a striking white band across his darker plumage schodde 1982 p 112 breeding females begin to build their nests in spring and construct domed structures composed of spider webs fine grasses thistle down and vegetable down typically tall and thick each nest has a small entrance on one side and they are normally placed in thick shrubs close to ground a clutch of 3 4 eggs is generally laid anywhere from september to january with incubation lasting around 14 days white winged fairywren generally breeds in spring in southwest of western australia but is more opportunistic in arid regions of central and northern australia with breeding recorded almost any month after a period of rainfall rowley russell 1997 p 105 incubation is by breeding female alone while breeding male a brown or blue male and nest helpers aid in feeding nestlings and removing their fecal sacs newly hatched nestlings are altricial gaping immediately for food and developing downy feather tracts and opening their eyes by third or fourth day schodde 1982 p 114 nestlings remain in nest for 10 11 days and fledglings continue to be fed for 3 4 weeks following their departure from nest fledglings then either stay on to help raise next brood or move to a nearby territory rowley russell 1997 p 181 it is not unusual for a pair bond to hatch and raise two broods in one breeding season and helpers tend to lessen stress on breeding female rather than increase overall number of feedings like other fairywrens white winged fairywren is particularly prone to parasitic nesting by horsfield s bronze cuckoo basalis parasitism by shining bronze cuckoo c lucidus and black eared cuckoo c is rarely recorded rowley russell 1997 p 119 feeding white winged fairywren is primarily insectivorous its diet includes small beetles bugs moths praying mantises caterpillars and smaller insects including spiders larger insects are typically fed to nestlings by breeding female and her helpers including breeding male adults and juveniles forage by hopping along shrubland floor and may supplement their diets with seeds and fruits of saltbush goosefoot chenopodium and new shoots of samphire schodde 1982 p 111 during spring and summer birds are active in bursts through day and accompany their foraging with song insects are numerous and easy to catch which allows birds to rest between forays group often shelters and rests together during heat of day food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend day foraging continuously threats adults and their young may be preyed upon by mammalian predators such as red fox vulpes vulpes or feral cat felis catus and native predatory birds such as australian magpie gymnorhina tibicen butcherbird species cracticus spp laughing kookaburra dacelo novaeguineae currawongs strepera spp crows and ravens corvus spp shrike thrushes spp and reptiles such as goannas rowley russell 1997 p 121 another threat to birds is from humans many nests are trampled on even by occasional bird watcher during breeding season
