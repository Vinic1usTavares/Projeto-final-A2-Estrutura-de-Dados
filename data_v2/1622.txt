love you to is a song by english rock band beatles from their 1966 album revolver song was written and sung by george harrison and features indian instrumentation such as sitar and tabla following harrison s introduction of sitar on norwegian wood in 1965 it was first beatles song to fully reflect influence of indian classical music recording was made with minimal participation from harrison s bandmates instead he created track with tabla player anil bhagwat and other indian musicians from asian music circle in london composition adheres to pitches of indian equivalent of dorian mode and emulates khyal vocal tradition of hindustani classical music for musical inspiration harrison drew from work of master sitarist ravi shankar who became his sitar tutor shortly after recording was completed in its lyrical themes love you to is partly a love song to harrison s wife pattie boyd while also incorporating philosophical concepts inspired by his experimentation with hallucinogenic drug lsd in context of its release song served as one of first examples of beatles expressing an ideology aligned with that of emerging counterculture love you to has been hailed by musicologists and critics as groundbreaking in its presentation of a non western musical form to rock audiences particularly with regard to authenticity and avoidance of parody author jonathan gould describes song s slow sitar introduction as one of most brazenly exotic acts of stylistic experimentation ever heard on a popular lp ronnie montrose bongwater jim james and cornershop are among artists who have covered love you to background and inspiration on 1965 album rubber soul george harrison had led beatles towards indian classical music through his use of indian sitar on john lennon s song norwegian wood this bird has flown while his own composition if i needed someone reflected genre s influence in its melody and suggestion of drone he subsequently wrote love you to as a way to showcase sitar and to feature tabla a pair of indian hand drums for first time music critic richie unterberger describes song as beatles first all out excursion in raga rock a genre that author nicholas schaffner says was launched by harrison s use of sitar on norwegian wood harrison wrote love you to in early 1966 while beatles were enjoying an unusually long period free of professional commitments due to their inability to find a suitable film project he used available time to further explore his interest in indian music and sitar which journalist maureen cleave noted in a contemporary article has given new meaning to his life available at rock s backpages subscription required aside from honeymooning in barbados with his wife english model pattie boyd harrison s activities included receiving sitar tuition from an indian musician at asian music circle amc in north london where he also attended music recitals and seeing indian sitarist ravi shankar perform at royal festival hall as reflected in love you to harrison continued to immerse himself in recordings by shankar who when pair met in june 1966 would agree to take harrison as his student this meeting took place at home of amc s founders ayana and patricia angadi whose network of friends and visitors added to harrison s self education in new forms of art culture and politics typically of his songs over this period harrison was unable to commit to naming new composition at start of sessions for beatles revolver album geoff emerick band s recording engineer gave song working title of granny smith after variety of apple song was partly inspired by harrison s experimentation with hallucinogenic drug lsd which he credited as a catalyst for increased awareness and his interest in eastern philosophical concepts author ian macdonald views subject matter as part philosophical and part love song to boyd composition musical form love you to is in key of c and adheres to pitches of kafi thaat indian equivalent of dorian mode composition emulates khyal vocal tradition of hindustani or north indian classical music structurally it comprises an opening alap a gat section which serves as main portion of song and a short drut fast gat to close piece alap consists of sitar played in free tempo during which song s melody is previewed in style of an indian raga described by harrison biographer simon leng as essentially an adaptation of a blues lick seven note motif that closes alap serves as a recurring motif during ensuing gat change of metre following alap marks first such example in beatles work it would shortly be repeated in lennon s composition she said she said which harrison helped complete by joining together three separate pieces that lennon had written thumbnail right 190px song s working title granny smith referenced same variety of apple that beatles later adopted for logo of their company apple corps gat is set in madhya laya medium tempo and features a driving rock rhythm accentuated by heavy tambura drone this portion of composition consists of eight bar a sections and twelve bar b sections structured in an a b a b pattern alap s lack of a distinct time signature is contrasted with a temporal reference in lyrics to opening verse each day just goes so fast i turn around it s past throughout vocal line avoids melodic embellishment typical of khyal apart from use of melisma over last line in each of a sections in keeping with minimal harmonic movement of indian music composition s only deviation from its i chord of c is a series of implied vii chord changes which occur in b sections during mid song instrumental passage melody line of sitar incorporates aspects of alap raising melody previewed there by an octave song then returns to verses sung over a and b sections culminating in line i ll make love to you if you want me to arrival of drut gat follows hindustani convention by ending composition at an accelerated tempo although brevity of this segment marks a departure from same tradition lyrical interpretation as with all of songs written by harrison or lennon and recorded by beatles in 1966 lyrics to love you to marked a departure from standard love song themes that had defined group s previous work harrison presents a worldview that variously reflects cynicism sardonic humour and a degree of detachment with regard to personal relationships according to music critic john harris lines there s people standing round who ll screw you in ground they ll fill you in with all sins you ll see serve as one of first examples of beatles ideology aligning with that of emerging 1960s counterculture by highlighting division between traditional mores and an lsd inspired perspective authors russell reising and jim leblanc recognise this and other statements in love you to as part of beatles espousal of anti materialism from 1966 onwards a message that inspired by lsd experience suggested a psychedelic vision of society among other commentators discussing lyrical themes mark hertsgaard writes that harrison s response to fleetingness of time was to affirm and celebrate life make love all day long make love singing songs while robert rodriguez describes love you to as a somewhat oblique expression of love directed toward his bride along with larger concerns regarding mortality and purpose in ian inglis estimation lyrics remind us that in a world of material dissatisfaction and moral disharmony there is always solace of sexual pleasure recording love you to was third track beatles recorded for revolver after tomorrow never knows and got to get you into my life rodriguez comments that love you to made explicit indian influence implicit throughout entire album as songs such as tomorrow never knows and got to get you into my life together with non album single tracks paperback writer and rain all incorporate drone sounds or otherwise display limited harmonic movement that typifies genre in a 1997 interview harrison said that song s inclusion reflected band s willingness to experiment during this period adding we were listening to all sorts of things stockhausen avant garde music whatever and most of it made its way onto our records basic track for love you to was taped in london at emi studios now abbey road studios on 11 april 1966 according to beatles historian mark lewisohn harrison initially sang and played acoustic guitar accompanied by paul mccartney on backing vocals by end of first session that day three takes of song had been made with harrison introducing his sitar on last of these takes work resumed at 8 pm with participation of anil bhagwat a tabla player that harrison had sourced through patricia angadi other outside contributors also from amc included musicians on tambura and sitar according to inglis love you to is defined by interplay between sitar and tabla bhagwat later recalled of his involvement george told me what he wanted and i tuned tabla with him he suggested i play something in ravi shankar style 16 beats though he agreed that i should improvise indian music is all improvisation after rehearsing song together many times harrison and bhagwat recorded sitar and tabla parts onto vocal and guitar performance taped earlier that day thumbnail 180px left track makes extensive use of double hand drum tabla along with sitar with take 6 selected as best performance a reduction mix was carried out on 13 april freeing up space for more overdubs on four track tape harrison added another vocal part onto what was now referred to as take 7 and ringo starr played tambourine mccartney contributed a high harmony vocal over words they ll fill you in with all their sins you ll see but this part was omitted from final mix harrison also overdubbed fuzz tone electric guitar controlling output via a volume pedal producer tony visconti has marvelled at guitar sounds beatles introduced on revolver particularly harrison s part on love you to which he says sounds like a chainsaw cutting down a tree in vermont credit for main sitar part on love you to has traditionally been subject of debate among commentators while macdonald says that rather than harrison it was sitarist from amc who played this part rodriguez writes that others point to harrison s single minded diligence in mastering instrument as well as his study through private lessons proximity to accomplished musicians and close listening to pertinent records in his official history of beatles recording career complete beatles recording sessions lewisohn states george played sitar but an outside musician anil bhagwat was recruited to play tabla musicologist walter everett also identifies harrison as main sitar player on recording as does peter lavezzoli author of dawn of indian music in west leng comments that as on norwegian wood harrison is still playing sitar like a guitar player on recording using blues and rock n roll bends rather than intensely intricate indian equivalents speaking to author steve turner bhagwat has dismissed idea that sitarist was not harrison saying i can tell you here and now 100 percent it was george on sitar throughout final mixing for song took place on 21 june as beatles rushed to complete revolver before beginning first leg of their 1966 world tour harrison discussed love you to with shankar when two musicians met that month spencer neil eastern rising in at a social event hosted by angadi family although he was unaware of band s popularity and had yet to hear norwegian wood shankar was impressed with harrison s humility as guitarist downplayed his sitar recordings with beatles as merely experiments soon after this meeting shankar gave harrison his first sitar lesson at kinfauns his and boyd s home in surrey and later with tablist alla rakha performed a private recital there for harrison lennon and starr harrison subsequently recalled of his first lesson with shankar i felt i wanted to walk out of my home that day and take a one way ticket to calcutta i would even have left pattie behind in that moment release revolver was released on 5 august 1966 with love you to sequenced as fourth track in advance of release emi had issued songs to radio stations throughout july in increments to prepare beatles audience for progression band had made with their latest work according to cultural historian simon philo album represented pop s most sustained deployment of indian instruments musical form and even religious philosophy thus far which all came together most notably on love you to by that point beatles association with indian music had been firmly established after at harrison s suggestion band stopped over in delhi on return flight from their concerts in far east during highly publicised visit all four members of group bought musical instruments from ram sons in connaught place bhagwat s name appeared on lp s back cover one of few times that an outside musician received an official credit on a beatles album thumb right harrison top in august 1966 with his beatles bandmates and american disc jockey jim stagg among commentators recalling song s release barry miles describes love you to as having sounded astonishing next to electrifying pop of revolver album hertsgaard writes what caught most people s interest was exotic rhythm track opening descent of shimmering notes beckoned even those who resisted indian music while lyrics melded mysticism of east with pragmatism of west and hedonism of youth culture in his 1977 book beatles forever schaffner wrote that next to dominant lennon mccartney songwriting partnership harrison s three compositions on revolver love you to taxman and i want to tell you offered ample indication that there were now three prolific songwriting beatles schaffner also commented that through his championing of sitar and shankar s music harrison came to be seen as maharaja of raga rock among western musicians in beatles 1968 animated film yellow submarine a brief portion of song is used to introduce harrison s character as a guru like figure standing on a hill critical reception in a joint album review with peter jones for record mirror richard green enthused about love you to saying starts like a classical indian recital this is great so different play it again best track so far available at rock s backpages subscription required allen evans of nme said song had a kama sutra type lyric shaar murray charles revolver talking about a revolution in and lauded harrison s sitar playing as stunning and tremendous before concluding fascinating mixture of minor melody with indian accompaniment one of most striking tracks in his role as guest reviewer for disc and music echo ray davies of kinks also admired performance and suggested that harrison must have quite a big influence on group now writing in recently launched crawdaddy paul williams heaped praise on love you to according to rodriguez while critic lester bangs termed it first injection of ersatz eastern wisdom into rock majority of contemporary us reviews were lukewarm towards revolver however in reaction to publication of lennon s comment to maureen cleave that beatles had become more popular than christ an exception was new york critic richard goldstein who praised album as a revolutionary record and later wrote that song s lyrics exploded with a passionate sutra quality available at rock s backpages subscription required while bemoaning initial lack of recognition for revolver krla beats reviewer said that harrison had created a new extension of music form which he introduced in rubber soul and described love you to as well done and musically valid also musically unrecognized available at rock s backpages subscription required retrospective assessment and legacy writing in journal asian music ethnomusicologist david reck has cited love you to as being revolutionary in western culture adding one cannot emphasise how absolutely unprecedented this piece is in history of popular music for first time an asian music was not parodied utilising familiar stereotypes and misconceptions but rather transferred in toto into a new environment with sympathy and rare understanding reck views it as first in a series of finely crafted indian based songs by harrison that would extend through his solo career and while admiring range of authentic hindustani musical elements in composition he concludes all of this in a three minute song peter lavezzoli describes love you to as first conscious attempt in pop to emulate a non western form of music in structure and instrumentation while reck calls it first song in euro american pop music canon that is scored predominantly for asian musical instruments with sitar tabla and tambura replacing rock band guitars keyboards bass and drums lavezzoli says of sitar part harrison s playing throughout song is an astonishing improvement over norwegian wood in fact love you to remains most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician love you to has been recognised as a precursor to world music genre through success of revolver in 1966 it was a key factor in rise in popularity of indian classical music among contemporary western youth in addition song inspired other rock musicians to experiment with non western instruments and tones and so helped expand scope of raga rock while its mix of indian instrumentation and distorted electric guitar was highly influential in development of 1960s psychedelic music reviewing harrison s musical career in a 2002 issue of goldmine magazine dave thompson wrote that love you to opened creative doors through which harrison s bandmates may not and george martin certainly would not have ever dreamed of passing rolling stone contributor greg kot pairs it with taxman as two major contributions that saw harrison come into his own as a songwriter on revolver kot describes love you to as a boldly experimental track and first full scale incorporation of eastern instruments on a beatles album writing on his music website elsewhere graham reid views song as a classic due to its standing as arguably first in western pop which owes nothing to pop music traditions it is an indian song in its structure and execution allmusic editor stephen thomas erlewine considers love you to to be harrison s first and best foray into indian music while bruce eder also writing for allmusic views it as exquisite in his song review for same website richie unterberger is unimpressed with track while acknowledging that love you to was undoubtedly another indication of group s rapidly broadening barriers he cites a lead vocal that drone s on in a rather lugubrious way harrison s slightly disheveled sitar playing and lyrics that constitute a rather muddled mix of free love advocacy meditations on transience of life on earth and chip on shoulder wariness of people out to exploit him although he finds melody sourly repetitious ian macdonald writes that track is distinguished by authenticity of its hindustani classical instrumentation and techniques and admires harrison s understanding of genre in a 2009 review for paste magazine mark kemp described revolver as album on which beatles completed their transformation from mop tops of three years earlier into bold groundbreaking experimental rockers and added harrison s love you to is pure indian raga sitar and tablas punctuated by occasional luminous guitar riff jolting through song s paranoid drug fueled lyrics like a blinding ray of sun into a dark forest cover
