lo en or hess is an albian campanian guyot in marshall islands one among a number of seamounts in pacific ocean it was probably formed by a hotspot in what is present day french polynesia lo en lies southeast of eniwetok which rises above sea level and lo en is almost connected to it through a ridge seamount is formed by basaltic rocks that probably formed a shield volcano first it is believed that a number of hotspots such as macdonald hotspot rarotonga hotspot and rurutu hotspot may have been involved in formation of lo en after volcanic activity by turonian seamount was submerged although it is possible that a carbonate platform formed during albian after a hiatus sedimentation commenced on seamount in oligocene time and led to deposition of manganese crusts and pelagic sediments including limestone some of which were later modified by phosphate name and research history name lo en is a reference to hibiscus tree seamount was formerly known as hess guyot in 1992 seamount was targeted for drilling in ocean drilling program geography and geology local setting lo en lies within northern marshall islands less than south southeast from eniwetok it is part of a cluster of seamounts and islands that surrounds eniwetok but also appears to be part of a chain running parallel to ralik chain and chain two seamount and island chains in marshall islands seamount rises above seafloor to a depth of below sea level lo en is elongated in north south direction and is a typical guyot its flat top has dimensions of and a surface area of a volcanic pinnacle is embedded in sediments on top of lo en it is either a volcanic formation that resisted erosion or a volcanic vent that was active after lo en was submerged there are other cones which emerge from sediments and which appear to be of volcanic origin in light of dredged rocks as well as lobate structures terraces occur on lo en s southwestern rim and may be products of landslides magnetization pattern of seamount has been investigated it is classified as normal but with particular magnetization patterns that are different from topography no carbonate cap or limestones have been found on platform of lo en unlike in several other guyots of region a drill core at lo en found pelagic sediments directly on volcanic basement however remains of reefs and of lagoonal sediments have been detected on seismic profiles although existence of a barrier reef has been questioned and lo en has a thick pelagic sediment cap it is possible that shallow water limestones exist at margins of platform which were not drilled lo en shares its volcanic edifice with eniwetok a northern spur from lo en almost reaches eniwetok while another spur emerges in south southeast direction and is about long another seamount lies farther west from lo en seafloor underneath lo en is 113 156 9 5 million years old and lies at a depth of more than regional setting thumb illustration of how hotspot volcanoes work pacific ocean seafloor especially parts that are of mesozoic age contains most of world s guyots these are flat topped submarine mountains which are characterized by steep slopes a flat top and usually presence of corals and carbonate platforms it is not clear whether cretaceous guyots were atolls in present day sense but many of these seamounts were which today still exist all these structures originally formed as volcanoes in mesozoic ocean first fringing reefs may have developed on volcanoes which then became barrier reefs as volcano subsided and turned into an atoll continued subsidence balanced by upward growth of reefs led to formation of thick carbonate platforms sometimes volcanic activity occurred even after formation of atoll or atoll like landforms and during episodes where carbonate platforms were lifted above sea level erosional features such as channels and blue holes developed crust underneath these seamounts tends to subside as it cools and thus islands and seamounts sink thumb maps of paths of some pacific hotspots formation of many such seamounts including has been explained with hotspot theory which discusses formation of chains of volcanoes which get progressively older along length of chain with an active volcano only at one end of system seamounts and islands in marshall islands do not appear to have originated from such simple age progressive hotspot volcanism as age progressions in individual island and seamount chains are often inconsistent with a hotspot origin one solution to this dilemma may be that more than one hotspot passed through marshall islands as well as possibility that hotspot volcanism is affected by contemporaneous lithospheric extension candidate hotspots responsible for formation of lo en are macdonald hotspot which passed close to lo en between 115 105 million years ago and rarotonga hotspot and rurutu hotspot both of which were at lo en between 90 and 74 million years ago of these first two also have strongest geochemical similarity to lo en in case of lo en volcanism on ogasawara fracture zone may also have contributed to its formation considering that seamount is much older than surrounding seamounts based on plate motion reconstructions region of marshall islands was located in region of present day french polynesia during time of active volcanism both regions display numerous island chains anomalously shallow ocean floors and presence of volcanoes about 8 hotspots have formed a large number of islands and seamounts in that region with disparate and that geological province has been called south pacific isotopic and thermal anomaly or anomaly composition lo en has erupted alkali basalt and hawaiite minerals contained in rocks include apatite biotite clinopyroxene ilmenite magnetite and plagioclase strong alteration has occurred and has given rise to calcite carbonate clay hematite smectite and zeolite as well as palagonite other rocks found on lo en are chalk limestone manganese crusts phosphate and sandstone geologic history geologic history of lo en seamount is relatively poorly known paleomagnetic data have been used to infer an age of 45 85 million years ago for seamount it was located at about 25 30 degrees southern latitude when it formed south of hotspots that are presently active in cook islands austral islands eniwetok is about 36 million years younger than lo en volcanism and first biotic phenomena a first phase of volcanic activity occurred 114 million years ago and was followed by a second episode during campanian separated by as much as 30 million years first episode has been dated at 111 6 114 0 million years ago and was contemporaneous with volcanic activity at other western pacific seamounts second episode may be responsible for cones that emerge from or are embedded in sediments that cover lo en eniwetok was active 76 9 million years ago and flexural effects from its growth may have influenced second volcanic phase at lo en potentially first episode was caused by macdonald hotspot and second by rarotonga and rurutu hotspots volcanic rocks encountered in drill cores consist of breccia and lava flows their alkalic composition implies that they may be post shield volcanics claystones indicate that weathered terrain occurred on lo en with subaerial alteration of volcanic rocks post volcanic lo en was submerged in turonian by about 112 8 1 2 million years ago long before surrounding seamounts and islands formed absence of a barrier reef would have facilitated erosion of lo en s summit it is possible that flexural loading by eniwetok pushed lo en downward and thus prevented formation of reefs on lo en during cretaceous when seamount was uplifted by a hotspot it took about 2 7 million years from end of volcanic activity until sedimentation began during albian limestones were emplaced on lo en these appear to reflect formation of reefs and a shallow carbonate bank material from which has been dredged on southern flank this platform drowned during late albian similar to many other carbonate platforms of similar age and there is no evidence of mid cretaceous platforms starting in albian cenomanian pelagic limestone was deposited directly on volcanic rocks during santonian times in light of fossil data it is likely that seamount was not overly deep at that time sediments of cretaceous paleocene age reach thicknesses of less than starting in oligocene pelagic oozes were deposited on lo en previously emplaced limestones also underwent phosphate reactions as they were exposed on seafloor and some of sediments underwent reworking foraminifera encountered on seamount in form of are eximius sp sp sp references sources category seamounts of pacific ocean category
