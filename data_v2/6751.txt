repressive cultural policies she along with several others was not allowed into formal conference being held in house of americas debate of those who were excluded and included in formal sessions was captured in a several hundred pages of emails exchanged between participants these emails exchanged by over one hundred participants are preserved in digital magazine contodos under title polemica intellectual 2007 according to sanchez what pushed her to write a blog was bad taste left at end of controversy of intellectuals in january 2007 meeting in house of americas would try to channel and institutionalize a debate that had been raising temperature of cuban emails for a couple of weeks already a select list of guests began entering che guevara room while our group of watched from outside as midnight arrived protesters were blocked from entering by custodians in order to keep them from debating and discussing their encounters with censorship and dogmatism protesters chanted desiderio desiderio hear my criteria but this had no effect while inside voice of minister of culture repeated idea that in a place under siege dissent is treason sanchez believed that debate was hijacked by institutions jailed by an academic world full of concepts and fancy words and condemned to take course of imminent conference of cuban writers and artists union in end protesters left with conviction that they couldn t wait to be allowed inside for next debate for sanchez this added a push to start what she terms this exorcism called generation y sanchez launched her blog generation y on april 9 2007 national baseball playoffs were underway and first post used baseball fever to compare what cubans are allowed to shout and display on homemade posters santiago go santiago and what they are not internet for all blog was hosted in germany on an internet domain by ag and was designed by sanchez later blog was transferred to wordpress and was eventually upgraded to allow comments by readers when blog had been active for six months sanchez expressed her reason for blogging saying that her initial inspiration had been to create an aid to help her deal with frustrations she felt with situation in cuba and of trying to go along with advice of friends who suggested she be cautious and wait rather than more noble motives she tried silence and evasion yoga tai chi going to gym all with no results she finally found a means to express these frustrations by blogging even so she admits i can both get discouraged have sudden starts i alternate between it s working to it s not worth pain alerting her readers to not be surprised if catharsis rises in tone if i become incendiary or show a streak of pessimism according to sanchez when she began blogging cubans by law were not allowed into tourist hotels but with her european appearance and ability to speak german she routinely managed to get past gatekeepers to work on her blog due to difficulties in accessing internet her access speed is determined by speed of bus that connects to la vibora at and g each post depends on a countless chain of events that normally don t go well from my isolated pc to a flash memory and then to public space of a or a hotel for this without detailing all complications elevator does not work gatekeeper asks me to show my passport to sit at computer or there are frustrations to sign on plus slow speeds imposed by proxies filters and huffington post blog in november 2008 sanchez was invited to post her blog entries on huffington post and she began writing occasional posts that described life in cuba sanchez says she has strived to maintain a respectful tone and she asks that those who leave comments on her blog do so as well in an interview with journalist ted henken

thumb upright fidel castro quoted sanchez s blog in prologue of book fidel bolivia y algo mas on march 26 2008 sanchez announced to her readers that recent problems accessing her blog appeared to be a deliberate action on part of government censors to block access to her blog and other blogs on desdecuba com website while debate swirled back and forth on web about whether site was actually blocked sanchez stated that generation y could not be accessed in cuba for past several years debate about whether this was a year long plus fluke or some glitch in software seemed to be resolved about a year after site became unavailable comments made by a cuban state security agent in an interview published on march 19 2009 in digital magazine kaos en la red where agent miguel stated i know state security officials who literally prophesied that blocking blog generation y within country would in a short time cause launching of madame sanchez into stardom of manipulative media campaign against cuba regardless of these prophesies they did it and now they re paying price sanchez was well known by this time and attempt to censor her by sudden government shutdown of her blog attracted more international attention than ever on april 2 2008 washington post devoted a long column to her just one of hundreds of articles and blog posts appearing around world on june 23 2008 cuba s daily newspaper granma published a lengthy prologue written by fidel castro to book fidel bolivia y algo mas which had been re issued fifteen years after its initial publication in a prologue to this new edition of a book commemorating his visit to bolivia in 1993 fidel castro took opportunity to quote a long excerpt from sanchez s blog and although he did not mention her name expressed his disappointment that there are young persons in cuba today who think as she does castro describes sanchez s statements as a generalization used as a slogan sanchez responded to castro s comments by saying in her blog that she would allow her husband journalist reinaldo escobar to respond to castro s statements because she felt it best to leave fighting at macho man male level and instead continue with her womanly labor of weaving together frayed tapestry of their society sanchez s husband responded with escobar went on to enumerate a list of names he says are terrible and undeserving recipients who were awarded order of jose marti by castro including names such as leonid brezhnev nicolae ceausescu gustav husak and robert mugabe among others blogging blind since her blog was blocked from public internet sites in cuba sanchez has relied on cuban friends abroad to post her texts for her which she sends to them by email along with accompanying photographs in a 2009 interview with ted henken published in poder360 sanchez commented on being a blind blogger by saying that cuban government filtered desdecuba com website from internet including access from hotels in order to prevent sanchez from updating her site to combat this sanchez developed what she terms a citizen network consisting of people outside cuba who help distribute her posts as of january 2009 generation y all languages was getting about 14 million hits a month on spanish language site each entry receives hundreds if not thousands of comments 14ymedio on 21 may 2014 sanchez launched 14ymedio first

has been described as a talented writer growing cuban blogosphere given challenges of blogging in cuba number of blogs on desdecuba site grew quickly eight months after she started generation y she was joined on desdecuba website by her husband reinaldo escobar s blog desde aqui from here in december 2007 in january three more desdecuba blogs were launched sin evasion without evasion el blog de dimas blog of dimas and fragments in march 2008 potro salvaje wild pony was launched joined by la beehive in may 2008 when cuban government blocked access to sanchez s blog from island it also blocked access to desdecuba website where these other blogs were housed other bloggers faced same challenges sanchez had in maintaining their blogs and also needed to find ways around censorship either relying on friends with access inside cuba from their government offices using complex and time consuming workarounds to find back doors into their blogs or reaching out to friends and strangers abroad who volunteered to help and who posted email blog entries they would never be able to see with their blogs targeted to cuban readers on island discouragement was compounded by knowing that even if they could post their readers could not read posts this limitation was circumvented by making copies of blogs on cds either from computers on island with access to website or sent from friends abroad although this method of disseminating blogs was slow and delayed and readers could not comment directly on website it was quite effective and continues to this day march 2009 sanchez said to a known venezuelan blogger that visited her in havana in any case we are trying to educate others so blogging would become in cuba a permanent feature a means of democratizing citizen expression as in free world on january 28 sanchez launched voces cubanas this citizen journalism project seeks to provide a multimedia platform to independent bloggers in cuba to express realities and hardships of everyday life there during an interview published by global voices sanchez said this was a website where all those who want to express ideas put their projects online can do so an article in el nuevo
