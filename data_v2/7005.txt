council and his mother beatrice ellen was daughter of an army colonel p 180 ismay began his education in britain at charterhouse school and his parents hoped that after completing his education there he would attend cambridge and enter civil service ismay p 3 ismay however had a sneaking desire to be a cavalry soldier and after doing poorly on his final examinations at charterhouse he was not eligible to attend cambridge as a result he entered royal military college sandhurst in 1904 ismay would later write sandhurst never meant nearly so much to me as charterhouse had but he enjoyed his time at school and studied alongside many men who went on to become important military officers including lord gort edgar ludlow hewitt and cyril newall ismay p 4 indian army after completing course at sandhurst ismay was placed fourth overall in its examinations and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in indian army ismay was then attached to gloucestershire regiment of british army in ambala where he served a one year mandatory apprenticeship after leaving regiment ismay did not immediately find a place in indian cavalry so he spent nine months floating among positions with various british and indian units ismay p 5 wingate p 4 in 1907 ismay found a permanent position in indian cavalry joining 21st prince albert victor s own cavalry lewin p 438 based at risalpur ismay thoroughly enjoyed his time with regiment describing it as blissful ismay p 9 in 1908 he saw his first action with regiment when it was sent into afghanistan pursuing mohmand raiders who had taken several hindu women as hostages ismay pp 12 13 immediately after ismay s regiment returned from action he was hospitalised in peshawar due to heat stroke but he recovered quickly and along with rest of his regiment received india general service medal ismay pp 14 15 in 1910 after a reorganisation of indian army ismay s regiment moved from risalpur to jhelum further from frontier shortly thereafter ismay was appointed adjutant of his regiment a position which he held for four years during which time he also read voraciously and developed a great admiration for winston churchill whom he sought to emulate ismay pp 16 17 wingate p 7 somaliland in early 1914 just before ismay s appointment as adjutant was set to expire he met c a l howard another british officer serving in india who told him about an opportunity to serve with king s african rifles in british somaliland ismay decided that this was just sort of job that he wanted and applied immediately ismay p 18 due to his reputation as a thorough and dependable officer of sound judgement ismay was appointed second in command of somaliland camel corps a cavalry unit led by thomas cubitt beachey p 106 thumb left medal card showing ismay s entitlement to british war medal ismay left india for somaliland in late july 1914 and arrived on 9 august shortly after outbreak of first world war in europe ismay p 19 wingate p 9 like other officers in somaliland ismay was unhappy at being left out of great war ismay p 24 and repeatedly asked for a transfer to european front ismay pp 35 36 in end however ismay s superiors decided that he was so indispensable that despite his longing for action in europe he was retained in somaliland until 1920 in somaliland camel corps and other british soldiers were ordered to subdue an uprising by mohammed abdullah hassan known by british as mad mullah who had been fighting against them for more than twenty years ismay s commander thomas cubitt was determined to end rebellion forcefully and quickly so on 17 november 1914 he launched a major assault against hassan s fortress at shimber berris ismay pp 24 25 in attack ismay fought closely alongside adrian carton de wiart later an important british officer in both world wars beachey p 109 not long after attack on shimber berris however camel corps received orders from london forbidding all offensive operations in somaliland due to misfortunes of army elsewhere ismay p 28 as a result of this order british operations were limited for duration of first world war and ismay s unit undertook no further major offensives ismay pp 28 29 despite limited british activity a few operations combined with effort of local forces led to a drastic weakening of hassan s forces by 1918 beachey p 124 thus after armistice ending first world war government sent major general arthur hoskins to take control of forces in somaliland and defeat hassan conclusively in battle ismay p 29 after hoskins arrived his initial plan for dealing with hassan focussed on use of newly formed royal air force so ismay and camel corps were consigned to a minor role hoskins s plans however were found overscaled and far too costly so they were shelved throughout most of 1918 and 1919 beachey pp 124 125 in october 1919 plans for hoskins s operation were finally approved beachey p 130 and on 21 january 1920 attack against hassan commenced beachey p 133 after several days of bombing ismay was ordered to lead an assault by camel corps against hassan s fortress at jid ali beachey p 136 on ismay s forces first attempted attack and were repulsed by strong resistance that night however hassan and his forces fled jid ali to take refuge in countryside ismay p 31 ismay was assigned to track down and capture hassan but he had no idea of where he was and was forced to begin a large search ismay p 32 wingate p 10 ismay pursued hassan for nearly two weeks and managed to capture many members of his family and people close to him including seven of his sons ismay p 34 nonetheless hassan himself managed to evade ismay and on effort to capture him was called off beachey p 142 though hassan was never captured his power was broken and he died in december 1920 of influenza beachey p 153 for his service in effort against hassan ismay received distinguished service order and was twice mentioned in despatches sir m hankey s successors interwar years in

service in india while on medical leave ismay met laura kathleen clegg with whom he quickly fell in love two were engaged only three weeks after meeting wingate pp 14 15 after four months however

april ismay returned to london on leave and married clegg with whom he eventually had three daughters ismay remained in london until february 1922 when he entered staff college at quetta ismay p 39 ismay excelled at staff college and its commandant called him one of two best if not best of students who have passed through my hands wingate pp 16 17 in his final thesis at staff college ismay correctly predicted that next european war would be a total war but he incorrectly predicted that cavalry would continue to play a role in future warfare after staff college ismay became deputy assistant quartermaster general of indian army lord ismay ex churchill aide leader in nato is dead at 78 in that position he worked closely with claude auchinleck beginning a long standing personal and professional relationship between two ismay p 40 wingate p 17 ismay found that his work as deputy assistant quartermaster general was a valuable experience but did not enjoy it ismay p 41 service in england thumb right maurice hankey secretary of committee of imperial defence in 1924 air vice marshal philip game suggested to ismay that he apply for a seat at raf staff college andover although

departmental action ismay was responsible for seeing that all plans and preparations made by government departments or sub committees of cid to meet eventuality of war were incorporated under appropriate headings in a document known as war book ismay pp 55 56 this task ended up consuming most of ismay s time as assistant secretary and gave him exceptional insight into ways of whitehall while serving as assistant secretary ismay made important friends and gained backing of hankey by whom he was greatly valued largely through hankey s influence ismay was nominated as a companion of order of bath in civil division roskill volume 1 p 531 wingate p 23 an honour which he received in 1931 lewin p 439 lord willingdon and war office in december 1930 after five years ismay left his

dill who would later serve as chief of imperial general staff wingate p 29 committee of imperial defence in 1936 maurice hankey became determined to bring ismay in as his deputy and eventual successor at cid roskill volume 3 p 205 hoping that appointment would strengthen organization of cid and enhance its influence hankey offered ismay position of deputy secretary naylor p 243 although appointment meant that ismay would probably never command troops again he viewed it as an important opportunity and accepted with scarcely a moment s hesitation a week thereafter ismay received a letter offering him command of a cavalry brigade in india but declined solidifying his choice to remain a staff officer ismay p 70 as deputy secretary of committee of imperial defence ismay had broad responsibilities and was concerned with every aspect of planning and preparation for a war which seemed imminent ismay p 77 ismay dealt extensively with a variety of matters and focussed much of his attention on preparation of anti aircraft p 80 and co ordination among military services ismay p 84 as crisis in europe escalated however hankey announced his intention to retire in june 1938 ismay p 89 hankey hoped that one person preferably ismay would inherit all of positions he had occupied including secretary of cid clerk of privy council and secretary to cabinet but prime minister neville chamberlain decided that positions should be split and assigned to different people naylor p 261 in end ismay was named only to position of secretary of committee of imperial defence effective 1 august 1938 ismay

while chamberlain was at munich conference attempting to resolve crisis ismay ordered digging of trenches in london as protection against air attacks should war occur ismay p 91 wingate p 38 ismay later said that he thought britain should have gone to war at munich instead of waiting but said nothing at time colville p 165 as it became increasingly clear that war was inevitable in 1939 ismay also prepared for a smooth simple and practically instantaneous transition from committee of imperial defence to war cabinet or whatever other wartime authority government might choose advice on defence imperial committee in peace and war second world war with outbreak of second world war cid was immediately absorbed into war cabinet as ismay had planned naylor p 268 in midst of turmoil ismay

including decision to try to stop german advance in belgium but kept his doubts to himself ismay p 104 chiefs of staff committee in april 1940 winston churchill took control of military co ordination committee charged with overseeing all of military services he selected ismay as his chief staff officer which also gave ismay additional responsibility of serving on chiefs of staff committee while serving under churchill had been a life long dream for ismay he was initially sceptical about duties of his new position which seemed unclear and poorly defined ismay p 113 thumb left winston churchill with chiefs of staff including ismay standing on right on 10 may after beginning of battle of france chamberlain resigned and churchill became both prime minister and minister of defence ismay p 115 wingate p 44 ismay who later called churchill greatest war prime minister in our history was thrilled by this development and continued to act as churchill s chief staff officer and military adviser ismay p 117 according to churchill two developed a close personal and official connection that was preserved unbroken and throughout war churchill 1948 p 645 as part of this relationship not long after churchill became prime minister he arranged for ismay to be appointed knight commander of order of bath in june 1940 knighthoods for services from very moment he became

minister of defence continued to serve as secretary of imperial defence chiefs of staff committee prime minister in united states and became deputy secretary of war cabinet general ismay promoted

role ismay handled nearly all military messages from churchill to service chiefs churchill 1949 p 22 ismay also gave churchill advice on military matters and often begged him to be reasonable gilbert p 662 when he contemplated foolish actions believing that churchill s greatest fault was his impetuous nature and impatience with opposition when chiefs of staff found churchill s demands unfeasible ismay took role of converting prime minister to their viewpoint colville p 163 allied conferences as churchill s chief military adviser ismay frequently attended wartime conferences and meetings of allies and accompanied other british leaders such as foreign minister anthony eden on their travels ismay s travel to conferences began in 1941 when he went with lord beaverbrook to first moscow

trip to united states shortly after their return us general dwight d eisenhower arrived in britain to command american forces he established close relations with ismay who liked him greatly and assisted him in co ordinating with both british forces and cabinet ismay pp 259 260 eisenhower thought highly of ismay remembering him for his stalwart support and noting he was one of those men whose great ability condemned him throughout war to a staff position consequently his name may be forgotten but contributions he made to winning of war were equal to those of many whose names became household words eisenhower dwight p 487 not long after eisenhower arrived on 16 august 1942 ismay was promoted to rank of lieutenant general around same time his good relations with americans were

p 293 at conference ismay first met american admiral william d leahy who is often described as his american counterpart two developed a friendly relationship and leahy wrote in his memoirs general sir

basil liddell hart a noted strategist and historian had somehow discovered secret plans for normandy landings this development had potential to compromise entire operation so ismay personally interviewed liddell hart who claimed to have simply worked it all out for himself without any access to secret information evans after their interview ismay directed matter to mi5 who never found evidence of wrongdoing although it is suspected that liddell hart may in fact have received information from military planners other subjects of security service enquiries thumb left ismay with sir
