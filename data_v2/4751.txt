thomas francis bayard october 29 1828 september 28 1898 was an american lawyer politician and diplomat from wilmington delaware a democrat he served three terms as united states senator from delaware and made three unsuccessful bids for democratic nomination for president of united states in 1885 president grover cleveland appointed him secretary of state after four years in private life he returned to diplomatic arena as ambassador to united kingdom born in delaware to a prominent family bayard learned politics from his father james a bayard jr who also served in senate in 1869 delaware legislature elected bayard to senate upon his father s retirement a peace democrat during civil war bayard spent his early years in senate in opposition to republican policies especially reconstruction of defeated confederacy his conservatism extended to financial matters as he became known as a staunch supporter of gold standard and an opponent of greenbacks and silver coinage which he believed would cause inflation bayard s conservative politics made him popular in south and with eastern financial interests but never popular enough to obtain democratic nomination for president which he attempted to win in 1876 1880 and 1884 in 1885 president cleveland appointed bayard secretary of state bayard worked with cleveland to promote american trade in pacific while avoiding acquisition of colonies at a time when many americans clamored for them he sought increased cooperation with great britain working to resolve disputes over fishing and seal hunting rights in waters around canada united states border as ambassador bayard continued to strive for anglo american friendship this brought him into conflict with his successor at state department richard olney when olney and cleveland demanded more aggressive diplomatic overtures than bayard wished in venezuelan crisis of 1895 his term at american embassy ended in 1897 and he died following year early life and family bayard was born in wilmington delaware in 1828 second son of james a bayard jr and anne nee francis bayard family was prominent in delaware as bayard s father would be elected to united states senate in 1851 among bayard s ancestors were his grandfather james a bayard also a senator and great grandfather richard bassett who served as senator from and governor of delaware several other relatives served in high office including bayard s uncle richard h bayard another delaware senator and his great great uncle nicholas bayard who was mayor of new york city on his mother s side bayard descended from philadelphia lawyer and financier tench francis jr bayard was educated in private academies in wilmington and then in flushing new york when his father moved to new york city for business reasons baynard s father returned to delaware in 1843 but he remained in new york working as a clerk in mercantile firm of his brother in law august schermerhorn in 1846 his father secured him a job in a banking firm in philadelphia and he worked there for next two years bayard was unsatisfied with his progress at firm and returned to wilmington to read law at his father s office bayard was admitted to bar in 1851 year his father was elected to united states senate thomas took on greater responsibilities in family law office and rose quickly in legal profession in 1853 after election of democratic president franklin pierce bayard was appointed united states attorney for delaware he spent only a year in position before moving to philadelphia to open a practice with his friend william shippen a partnership that lasted until shippen s death in 1858 while in philadelphia bayard met louise lee whom he married in october 1856 marriage produced twelve children civil war and reconstruction thumb left bayard in about 1870 bayard s return to wilmington in 1858 brought greater involvement in political scene james bayard was a delegate to 1860 democratic national convention and thomas attended with him elder bayard supported robert m t hunter of virginia for nomination when convention deadlocked and southern democrats split from main party james bayard adhered to regular democrats but told thomas that he thought nominee stephen a douglas of illinois was untrustworthy subsequent election of republican abraham lincoln and secession of seven states of deep south led both bayards to fear for future of union and elder bayard to propose a convention of all states to resolve their differences in meantime as four more southern states seceded james bayard encouraged his son to help organize an independent militia unit delaware guard thomas bayard was commissioned as its first lieutenant in 1860 delaware occupied an unusual position in free state slave state divide nominally a slave state delaware s slave population had been in steep decline for decades and represented just 1 6 of state s people opinion on secession was mixed in delaware but bayards were peace democrats and leaned to southern perspective they blamed war on abolitionist republicans and believed that secession while unwise should not be suppressed with military force thomas bayard spoke at a public meeting in dover in june 1861 saying that with this secession or revolution or rebellion or by whatever name it may be called state of delaware has naught to do even after civil war s first battles erupted in virginia bayard continued to hope for peace by early 1862 delaware guard came under suspicion of southern sympathies and major general henry du pont commander of state militia ordered it disarmed when bayard refused to comply he was briefly arrested before being released on parole bayard s father was reelected to senate in 1862 but resigned shortly thereafter in protest of new oath of office which demanded that senators swear they had never borne arms against united states nor given aid and encouragement to its enemies bayard and his father continued in private law practice through war both were pleased with democrats peace platform in 1864 but disappointed in choice of nominee major general george b mcclellan a war democrat in 1866 thomas bayard successfully represented four south carolinians in habeas corpus cases against military following year senator george r riddle died and legislature elected james bayard to fill remainder of term which ended in 1869 bayard became more politically active speaking at a public meeting in september 1867 against constitutional proposals for ending racial discrimination in voting rights following year he condemned impeachment proceedings against president andrew johnson who had succeeded to presidency in 1865 after lincoln s assassination and had threatened republican congress s plans for reconstruction of southern states both bayards attended 1868 democratic national convention and although they were unenthusiastic about nominee horatio seymour supported unsuccessful ticket that year united states senator reaction to reconstruction bayard s father retired from senate when his term ended in 1869 and legislature elected his son to seat with little opposition bayard entered a senate in which his fellow democrats were greatly outnumbered by republicans new president ulysses s grant was also a republican in reconstruction era bayard took up cause of defeated south speaking against continued military rule of conquered states and advocating a return to civilian and conservative government he protested requirement that readmitted southern states ratify fourteenth amendment which guaranteed equal protection of laws to all americans bayard also inveighed against continued presence of federal troops in south he spoke against each of three enforcement acts which increased federal government s power to protect black southerners civil and political rights in face of rising violence by ku klux klan and other groups although his protests were to little effect bayard continued to voice opposition to majority party s plans for reconstructing south in 1871 he was named to a joint committee sent by congress to investigate conditions in south committee like congress had a republican majority and their report detailed many of klan s outrages against newly freed slaves bayard dissented questioning veracity of witnesses testimony and stating that there were few incidents of lawlessness and that south was generally at peace majority disagreed and their findings were basis for third enforcement act later that year as more democrats returned to senate and as republican goals shifted elsewhere bayard s ideas gained some traction but were still largely in vain in 1873 senate passed a resolution he introduced that demanded that grant disclose how much government money was being expended in enforcing reconstruction laws in south and to whom it was paid president ignored resolution next year bayard opposed a republican bill authorizing federal supervision of upcoming election in louisiana attacking republican administration there as corrupt he was unsuccessful and election was supervised by federal troops he spoke forcefully against proposed civil rights act of 1875 which was to be last such act for nearly a century again he was unsuccessful and bill which guaranteed equal treatment in public accommodations regardless of race passed congress and became law although ultimately unsuccessful bayard s actions endeared him to his conservative constituents and he was elected to another six year term in 1874 specie resumption thumb 250px a cartoon from april 9 1870 issue of harper s weekly anticipates resumption of government payments in precious metal coins brother jonathan was a personification of united states before uncle sam from start of his congressional career bayard was an advocate of hard money i e a dollar backed by gold during civil war congress had authorized a new form of currency redeemable not in specie gold or silver coin but in 6 government bonds these united states notes popularly known as greenbacks had helped to finance war when government s gold supply did not keep pace with expanding costs of maintaining armies when crisis had passed many in congress including bayard wanted to return nation s currency to a gold standard as soon as possible process of retiring greenbacks had already begun when bayard was elected but stopped when many congressmen thought fiscal contraction too severe and likely to be harmful to economy in 1869 congress passed public credit act of 1869 which required that government pay its bond holders in gold not greenbacks bayard thought bill not strong enough since it did not require removing greenbacks from circulation and he voted against it in 1873 a business depression known as panic of 1873 increased pressure for retaining greenbacks as some in congress believed that inflating currency would ease economic problems grant s treasury secretary william adams richardson reissued 26 million of redeemed greenbacks reversing administration s previous policy of removing them from circulation this ignited a four month debate in senate over whether and when government should return to backing all of its currency with gold including remaining greenbacks majority including bayard favored resumption but in wording resolution that passed senate republican john sherman of ohio left vague exact timing bayard feared it would be put off indefinitely sherman bill also proposed to remove greenbacks from circulation by exchanging them for bonds payable in gold in response bayard proposed an amendment limiting amount of debt government could incur when amendment was rejected bayard voted against bill known as specie payment resumption act believing that it was likely to cause inflation election of 1876 bayard s popularity with his party had grown during his time in senate and by 1875 he was seen as a contender for presidency his advocacy of hard money had won him friends in some of northern cities and his stance against reconstruction made him popular throughout south competing for those same factions of democratic party was new york governor samuel j tilden who had gained national fame for fighting political corruption of william m tweed s tammany hall machine in new york city other contenders included governor thomas a hendricks of indiana and major general winfield scott hancock tilden s wealth and national renown helped gather delegates to his cause and in june 1876 he entered convention with 404 1 2 votes bayard placed fifth with 33 tilden was nominated on second ballot thumb left bayard served on electoral commission that decided disputed 1876 presidential election displeased with result bayard nonetheless supported democratic nominee against governor rutherford b hayes of ohio republican candidate speaking to large crowds in cities across north and midwest on election day vote was close but appeared to favor a tilden victory three days later tilden looked to have won 184 electoral votes one short of a majority while hayes appeared to have 166 votes with votes of florida louisiana and south carolina still in doubt each party sent their people to observe vote in disputed states abram hewitt chairman of democratic national committee asked bayard to travel to louisiana along with several others but bayard refused to go counts of disputed ballots were inconclusive with each state producing two sets of returns one signed by democratic officials other by republicans each claiming victory for their man there was debate about which person or house of congress was authorized to decide between competing slates of electors with republican senate and democratic house each claiming priority by january 1877 with question still unresolved congress and president grant agreed to submit matter to a bipartisan electoral commission which would be authorized to determine fate of disputed electoral votes bayard supported idea and visited tilden in new york to convince him that it was only alternative to stalemate and possible renewed civil war bill passed with bayard s vote and provided for a commission of five representatives five senators and five supreme court justices to ensure partisan balance there would be seven democrats and seven republicans fifteenth member was to be a supreme court justice chosen by other four on commission themselves two republicans and two democrats justice david davis an independent respected by both parties was expected to be their choice bayard was among seven democrats chosen davis upset careful planning by accepting election to senate by state of illinois and refusing to serve on commission remaining supreme court justices were all republicans and with addition of justice joseph p bradley to place intended for davis commission had an 8 7 republican majority commission met and considered all of disputed ballots awarding each to hayes by an 8 7 party line vote bayard and his fellow democrats were outraged and democratic majority in house threatened to filibuster to prevent results from being accepted as march 4 inauguration day approached leaders of both parties met at wormley s hotel in washington to negotiate a compromise republicans promised that in exchange for democratic acquiescence in committee s decision hayes would order federal troops to withdraw from south and accept election of democratic governments in remaining unredeemed states there democrats agreed and filibuster ended tilden later blamed bayard among others for his role in creating electoral commission but bayard defended his position believing that only alternative to result was civil war gold standard thumb bayard was a strong supporter of gold backed currency in 1873 congress had passed a coinage act that regulated which coins were legal tender list of legal coins duplicated that of previous coinage act leaving off only silver dollar and three smaller coins rationale in treasury report accompanying draft bill was that to mint a gold dollar and a silver dollar with different intrinsic values was problematic as silver dollar did not circulate and gold did it made sense to drop unused coin bill passed easily with bayard s support but quickly thereafter became unpopular opponents of bill would later call this omission crime of 73 and would mean it literally circulating tales of bribery of congressmen by foreign agents over next few years pressure to reintroduce silver coinage grew and cut across party lines in 1877 republican senator stanley matthews of ohio introduced a resolution to pay national debt in silver instead of gold bayard joined several republicans in speaking and voting against measure calling it folly but it passed senate 42 to 20 meanwhile democrat richard p bland of missouri furthered silver cause from house proposing a free silver bill that would require united states to buy as much silver as miners could sell government and strike it into coins a system that would increase money supply and aid debtors in short silver miners would sell government metal worth fifty to seventy cents and receive back a silver dollar william b allison a pro silver republican from iowa offered an amendment in senate requiring purchase of two to four million dollars per month of silver but not allowing private deposit of silver at mints thus seignorage or difference between face value of coin and worth of metal contained within it accrued to government s credit not private citizens bayard saw whole effort as path to inflation and economic ruin again he spoke against bill but like matthews resolution bland allison act passed both houses of congress in 1878 president hayes shared bayard s fear of inflation and vetoed bill but congress mustered two thirds vote necessary to overturn veto and it became law clashes with hayes elections of 1878 returned control of both houses of congress to democrats for first time since before civil war new democratic majority passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed enforcement acts those acts passed during reconstruction made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race and allowed use of federal troops to supervise elections bayard supported effort which passed both houses and sent to president hayes was determined to preserve law to protect black voters and he vetoed appropriation bayard spoke in favor of bill believing time had come to end military s involvement in southern politics democrats did not have enough votes to override veto but they passed a new bill with same rider hayes vetoed this as well and process was repeated three times more finally hayes signed an appropriation without rider but congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals who were vital to enforcement of force acts election laws remained in effect but funds to enforce them were cut off bayard also clashed with hayes on issue of chinese immigration in 1868 senate had ratified burlingame treaty with china allowing an unrestricted flow of chinese immigrants into country as economy soured after panic of 1873 chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen s wages during great railroad strike of 1877 anti chinese riots broke out in san francisco and a third party workingman s party was formed with an emphasis on stopping chinese immigration bayard favored some restriction on chinese immigration and voted in favor of a chinese exclusion act in 1879 which passed both houses that year hayes vetoed bill believing that united states should not abrogate treaties without negotiation veto drew praise among eastern liberals but hayes was bitterly denounced in west after veto assistant secretary of state frederick w seward suggested that both countries work together to reduce immigration congress passed a new law to that effect chinese exclusion act in 1882 bayard supported this new act which became law with president chester a arthur s signature that year election of 1880 thumb 1880 democratic national convention in cincinnati s music hall as election of 1880 drew near bayard was again regarded as a likely candidate hayes had pledged himself to a one term presidency which meant republicans would not have advantage of incumbency on democratic side tilden was regarded as natural choice as many democrats were still convinced he had been robbed of office in 1876 tilden s supporters saw bayard as a rival and sought to smear him by suggesting he had colluded with republicans to defeat tilden in 1876 meanwhile in house tilden supporter clarkson nott potter of new york began an investigation into 1876 election hoping that evidence of republican malfeasance would harm that party s candidate in 1880 in fact potter committee s investigation had opposite effect uncovering telegrams from tilden s nephew william tilden pelton that offered bribes to southern republicans in disputed states to help tilden claim their votes telegrams doomed tilden s hopes for nomination and boosted bayard s chance among erstwhile tilden supporters as tilden s star began to fade many democrats looked to bayard he remained popular in eastern cities for his conservatism and hard money beliefs but many in south including senator augustus hill garland of arkansas advised bayard to embrace silver to help halt defections of southern and western democrats to new greenback party bayard declined to do so he was also reluctant to strike a deal with john kelly of new york whose tammany faction of democratic party was currently at odds with tilden machine there after party rift caused defeat of democratic governor in new york s 1879 election many tilden adherents began to think their candidate could not win his home state and drifted to bayard among others tilden s supporters attempted to weaken bayard in february 1880 by publishing speech he gave in dover in 1861 in which he said that united states should acquiesce in southern secession at same time bayard s uncompromising stance on money question pushed some democrats to support major general winfield scott hancock who had not been identified with either extreme in gold silver debate and had a military record that appealed to northerners leading up to convention in cincinnati tilden remained ambiguous about his intentions george gray delaware s attorney general placed bayard s name in nomination calling senator a veteran covered in scars of many a hard fought battle where principles of constitutional liberty have been at stake bayard is a statesman who will need no introduction to american people when convention took its first ballot on june 23 bayard placed second with 153 1 2 votes trailing only hancock who had 171 on second ballot delegates broke for hancock and he was nominated southern delegates whom bayard thought would be most loyal to him were among first to desert him convention nominated william hayden english of indiana a bayard supporter and hard money man for vice president and then closed bayard s supporters were disappointed but he supported ticket as usual in interest of party unity hancock and english fought to a near draw in popular vote but lost electoral vote to james a garfield and chester a arthur by 214 to 155 budget surplus and civil service reform delaware legislature re elected bayard to senate for a third term in 1881 without serious opposition senate in 47th congress was evenly divided between republicans and democrats with new vice president arthur holding tie breaking vote after spending special session of march 1881 in an intra republican party fight over confirmation of garfield s cabinet nominees senate went into recess until october by that time garfield had been assassinated and arthur was president when senate reconvened democrats held majority briefly and bayard was elected president pro tempore on october 10 republicans regained majority three days later as republican latecomers arrived and were sworn in and david davis took over office among issues confronting senate was surplus of government funds with high revenue held over from wartime taxes federal government had collected more than it spent since 1866 by 1882 surplus reached 145 million opinions varied on how to balance budget democrats wished to lower tariffs in order to reduce revenues and cost of imported goods while republicans believed that high tariffs ensured high wages in manufacturing and mining they preferred government spend more on internal improvements and pensions for civil war soldiers while reducing excise taxes bayard did not oppose some veterans pensions but worried that pensions would require continued high tariffs which he opposed he supported movement for a commission to examine tariff and suggest improvements but opposed resulting tariff of 1883 which reduced tariffs by an average of 1 47 congressional republicans also sought to deplete surplus through a rivers and harbors act that increased spending on internal improvements bayard opposed bill and was gratified when arthur vetoed it against his own party s wishes bayard and arthur also agreed on need for civil service reform garfield s assassination by a deranged office seeker amplified public demand for civil service reform leaders of both parties including bayard realized that they could attract votes of reformers by turning against spoils system and by 1882 a bipartisan effort began in favor of reform in 1880 democratic senator george h pendleton of ohio introduced legislation that required selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an examination but bill did not pass after 1882 congressional elections in which democrats campaigned successfully on reform issue pendleton bill was proposed again and again bayard supported it saying that offices of this government are created for public service and not for private use of incumbents senate approved bill 38 5 and house soon concurred by a vote of 155 47 arthur signed pendleton civil service reform act into law on january 16 1883 election of 1884 thumb both republicans and democrats held their conventions at chicago s interstate industrial exposition hall in 1884 despite his rebukes at democratic national conventions in 1876 and 1880 bayard was again considered among leading candidates for nomination in 1884 tilden again was ambiguous about his willingness to run but by 1883 new york s new governor grover cleveland began to surpass tilden as a likely candidate after tilden definitively bowed out in june 1884 many of his former supporters began to flock to bayard many democrats were concerned with cleveland s ability to carry his home state after he like tilden before him became embroiled in a feud with tammany hall wing of party at same time tammany democrats became more friendly to bayard by time democrats had assembled in chicago on july 8 1884 to begin their convention republicans had already picked their nominee james g blaine of maine blaine s nomination turned many reform minded republicans known as mugwumps away from their party bayard and cleveland seen as honest politicians were democrats most favored by renegade republican faction bayard was optimistic at start of convention but results of first ballot ran heavily against him 170 votes to cleveland s 392 reason was same as in 1880 as congressman robert s stevens of new york said i believe if he were president his administration would be one in which every american citizen would take pride i believe he is a patriot but it would be a suicidal attempt to nominate him his 1861 dover speech would be sent into every household in north voting next day demonstrated point as cleveland was nominated on second ballot resulting campaign between cleveland and blaine focused more on scandal and mudslinging than issues of day in end cleveland eked out a narrow victory carrying new york was crucial for democrat a shift of just 550 votes in that state would have given election to blaine instead cleveland carried his home state and a democrat was elected president for first time since 1856 cleveland recognized bayard s status in party hierarchy by offering him top spot in his cabinet secretary of state bayard did not think himself an expert in foreign affairs and enjoyed sixteen years he had spent in senate even so he accepted post and joined administration secretary of state samoa and hawaii thumb bayard enforced neutrality in samoa in face of german encroachment among first foreign policy challenges bayard and cleveland faced was that concerning american influence in samoan islands united states great britain and germany all had treaties with samoan government that guaranteed their right to trade and establish naval bases there in 1880s german chancellor otto von bismarck began to increase german influence in samoa and attempted to replace samoan king malietoa laupepa with tamasese a claimant to throne who favored german suzerainty bayard and cleveland opposed any change that would undermine samoan independence as did british government bayard filed a note of protest with german government and three powers agreed to meet for a conference in washington in june 1887 but they failed to achieve any agreement shortly thereafter tamasese s unpopularity led another claimant mata afa iosefo to start a rebellion that led to samoan civil war when tamasese s german guards were killed bismarck considered it an attack on germany and sent warships to samoa cleveland dispatched three american warships trenton and vandalia in response and a british warship joined them as threat of war grew bismarck backed down and agreed to another conference in 1889 two weeks later a hurricane struck harbor and all of german and american warships were damaged or sunk as tempers cooled parties met in conference in berlin by that time cleveland had been defeated for re election and james g blaine took bayard s place as secretary of state three powers agreed to a tripartite protectorate of samoa with malietoa laupepa restored as king that situation prevailed until 1899 when renewed civil war led to a second convention partitioning islands between germany and united states in kingdom of hawaii bayard and cleveland pursued a similar goal of maintaining hawaiian kingdom s independence while expanding access for american trade as a senator bayard had voted for free trade with hawaii but treaty was allowed to lapse in 1884 as secretary of state following year bayard hoped to again have free trade with hawaii and also endorsed idea of establishing an american naval base there although he preferred midway atoll to eventual location pearl harbor a treaty to that effect passed senate in 1887 by a 43 11 vote as in samoa administration sought to curb foreign influence encouraging hawaiian government to reject a loan from britain that would have required pledging future government revenues toward its repayment relations with britain left thumb upright portrait of bayard as secretary of state despite their agreement on samoa much of bayard s term of office was taken up in settling disputes with great britain largest of these concerned canadian fisheries off atlantic coasts of canada and newfoundland rights of american fisherman in canadian waters had been disputed since american independence but most recent disagreement stemmed from congress s decision in 1885 to abrogate part of 1871 treaty that governed situation under that treaty american fishermen had right to fish in canadian waters in return fishermen from canada and newfoundland had right to export fish to united states duty free protectionists in congress thought arrangement hurt american fisherman and convinced their colleagues to repeal it in response canadian authorities fell back on an interpretation of earlier treaty of 1818 and began to seize american vessels in 1887 lame duck 49th congress then passed fisheries retaliation act which empowered president to bar canadian ships from american ports if he thought canadians were treating american fishermen unjustly cleveland signed bill but did not enforce it and hoped he and bayard would be able to find a diplomatic solution to escalating trade war britain agreed to negotiate and a six member commission convened in washington in june 1887 bayard led american delegation joined by james burrill angell president of university of michigan and william lebaron putnam a maine lawyer and international law scholar joseph chamberlain a leading statesman in british parliament led their delegation which also included lionel sackville west british ambassador to united states and charles tupper a future prime minister of canada by february 1888 commission agreed on a new treaty which would create a mixed commission to determine which bays were open to american fishermen americans could purchase provisions and bait in canada if they purchased a license but if canadian fisherman were allowed to sell their catch in united states duty free then americans licenses to fish in canada would be free bayard believed that treaty if observed honorably and honestly will prevent future friction between two nations senate controlled by republicans disagreed and rejected treaty by a 27 30 vote aware of risk that treaty might be rejected bayard and chamberlain agreed on a two year working agreement allowing americans to continue their fishing in canadian waters by paying a fee this arrangement was renewed every two years until 1912 when a permanent solution was found a similar dispute with britain arose in pacific over rights of canadians to hunt seals in waters off pribilof islands a part of alaska while only americans had right to take seals on islands right to hunt in waters around them was less well defined and americans believed foreign sealers were depleting herd too quickly by hunting off shore bayard and cleveland believed waters around islands to be exclusively american but when cleveland ordered seizure of canadian ships there bayard tried to convince him to search for a diplomatic solution instead situation remained unresolved when administration left office in 1889 and remained so until north pacific fur seal convention of 1911 relations with britain were also impaired when sackville west intervened in 1888 election a republican posing as a british immigrant to united states asked sackville west whether voting for cleveland or his republican opponent benjamin harrison would best serve british interests sackville west wrote that cleveland was better for britain republicans published letter in october 1888 hoping to diminish cleveland s popularity among irish americans cleveland s cabinet discussed matter and instructed bayard to inform ambassador his services would no longer be required in washington bayard attempted to limit electoral damage and gave a speech in baltimore condemning republicans for scheming to portray cleveland as a british tool cleveland was defeated for re election following month in a close election return to private life bayard s term as secretary of state ended in march 1889 after cleveland s defeat and he returned to wilmington to resume his law practice he lived in very comfortable circumstances there with a fortune estimated at 300 000 although his income from law practice was modest his wife having died in 1886 bayard remarried in 1889 to mary willing clymer granddaughter and namesake of philadelphia socialite mary willing clymer bayard remained involved with democratic politics and stayed informed on foreign affairs when cleveland was re elected in 1892 many assumed bayard would resume his position in cabinet instead cleveland selected judge walter q gresham of indiana for state department and appointed bayard ambassador to great britain first american envoy to britain to hold that rank his predecessors had been envoys bayard accepted appointment which senate quickly confirmed ambassador to great britain thumb bayard as depicted in vanity fair in 1894 while ambassador to britain on june 12 1893 lord british foreign secretary received bayard in london bayard began his tenure as ambassador with an instinctive feeling of friendship for england and a desire for peace and cooperation between two nations that desire was quickly impaired when cleveland took side of venezuela when that nation insisted on taking a boundary dispute between it and british guiana to international arbitration exact boundary had been in dispute for decades but britain had consistently denied any arbitration except over a small portion of line venezuela wished entire boundary included in any arbitration bayard spent mid 1894 in united states conferring with gresham tension in venezuelan boundary dispute continued to escalate while british disagreements with nicaragua also threatened to involve united states britain had once ruled caribbean coast of nicaragua mosquito coast but had abandoned it in 1860 nicaragua had annexed area while guaranteeing inhabitants miskito people a degree of autonomy when nicaragua expanded their control of area in 1894 miskito chief robert henry clarence protested with support of british ambassador bayard agreed with cleveland and gresham that british were not attempting to reestablish their colony but nicaraguans and many anglophobic americans saw a more sinister motive including a possible british controlled canal through nicaragua returning to england bayard met with new foreign secretary lord kimberley to emphasize nicaragua s right to govern area tension over nicaragua soon abated but may 1895 death of secretary gresham who like bayard had favored cooperation with british led to increased disagreement over venezuela issue cleveland appointed richard olney to take over state department and olney soon proved more confrontational than his predecessor olney s opinion soon adopted by cleveland was that monroe doctrine not only prohibited new european colonies but also declared an american national interest in any matter of substance within hemisphere olney drafted a long dispatch on history of problem declaring that to day united states is practically sovereign on this continent and its fiat is law upon subjects to which it confines its interposition bayard delivered note to british prime minister lord salisbury who was also serving as foreign secretary on august 7 1895 olney s note was met with vehement disagreement and delay but when tempers cooled british agreed to arbitration later that year bayard disagreed with bellicose tone of message which he attributed to an effort to satisfy among radical republicans and foolish irishmen olney for his part thought bayard soft note and asked cleveland to remove bayard from office which cleveland declined house of representatives agreed with olney and passed a resolution of censure against bayard in december 1895 britain and venezuela formally agreed to arbitration in february 1897 one month before cleveland administration came to an end panel s final judgement delivered in 1899 awarded britain almost all of disputed territory death and legacy bayard remained in london until arrival of his successor john hay in april 1897 he returned to wilmington that may and visited ex president cleveland at his home in princeton following month remaining friendly with him despite their differences on venezuela question bayard s health had begun to decline in england and he was often ill after his return to united states he died on september 28 1898 while visiting his daughter mabel bayard warren in dedham massachusetts bayard was buried in old swedes episcopal church cemetery at wilmington he was survived by his second wife and seven of his twelve children including thomas f bayard jr who would serve in united states senate from 1922 to 1929 thirteen years after his death 1911 encyclopaedia britannica said of bayard that his tall dignified person unfailing courtesy and polished if somewhat deliberate eloquence made him a man of mark in all best circles he was considered indeed by many americans to have become too partial to english ways and for expression of some criticisms regarded as unfavorable to his own countrymen house of representatives went so far as to pass a vote of censure on him value of bayard s diplomacy was however fully recognized in united kingdom where he worthily upheld traditions of a famous line of american ministers in 1929 dictionary of american biography described bayard as a senator as being remembered rather for his opposition to republican policies than for constructive legislation of successful solution of great problems and said that he had convictions of an earlier day and was
