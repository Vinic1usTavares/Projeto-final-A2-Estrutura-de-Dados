braunschweig class battleships were a group of five pre dreadnought battleships of german kaiserliche marine imperial navy built in early 1900s they were first class of battleships authorized under second naval law a major naval expansion program class comprised five ships and and they were an improvement over preceding braunschweigs mounted a more powerful armament of and guns compared to and guns of wittelsbachs less than two years after first members of class entered service ships were rendered obsolescent by british all big gun battleship which curtailed their careers during their early careers five ships served in ii battle squadron with preussen its flagship fleet was occupied primarily with routine peacetime training and foreign visits in 1912 braunschweig was placed in reserve and she was joined following year by elsass lothringen and hessen were slated to be decommissioned in 1914 but outbreak of world war i in july prevented this and they remained in service with high seas fleet they and preussen took part in fleet operations in first two years of war while braunschweig and elsass went to baltic with iv battle squadron where they eventually saw combat with during battle of gulf of riga in august 1915 hessen took part in battle of jutland in may 1916 and saw limited combat with british battlecruisers late in battle all five of ships were withdrawn from service starting in 1916 thereafter being used in subsidiary roles including as barracks and training ships after war five braunschweigs were among vessels that new reichsmarine was permitted to retain by treaty of versailles lothringen and preussen were converted into parent ships for minesweepers to clear minefields in north sea that had been laid during war but other three were modernized in early 1920s and served with fleet into 1930s braunschweig and elsass were eventually stricken from register in 1931 and along with lothringen and elsass were thereafter broken up hessen remained in service until late 1934 when she was decommissioned and converted into a radio controlled target ship a role she filled through world war ii ceded as a war prize to soviet union she was commissioned as tsel and used as a target until 1960 when she was scrapped design with passage of second naval law under direction of vizeadmiral vadm vice admiral alfred von tirpitz in 1900 funding was allocated for a new class of battleships to succeed ships authorized under 1898 naval law previous law had called for a total strength of nineteen battleships by 1 april 1904 which was reached with wittelsbach class but new law increased projected battle fleet to a total of thirty eight braunschweig class was first group of battleships built under this new plan and they marked a significant advance in combat power over earlier german battleships thumb left lithograph of of note arrangement of main battery guns atop secondary battery discussions between design department of reichsmarineamt imperial navy office and other elements of naval command on new class had begun in 1899 before law had been passed and before work on wittelsbachs had even begun most pressing issue to be settled was caliber of main battery wittelsbach class ships were armed with guns far smaller than standard in most other navies which was caliber 24 cm guns were however largest weapons for which krupp supplier of naval artillery to kaiserliche marine imperial navy had developed quick firing technology german naval command typically favored high rates of fire rather than heavy shells on principal that a flurry of shells would wreck guns and superstructure of enemy battleships faster than powerful but slow firing guns but by time design work on braunschweig class began krupp had developed a quick firing gun and so naval command decided to adopt it for new ships with decision made to mount 28 cm gun next issue was arrangement of guns previous designs had carried 24 cm guns in superstructure directly above casemates for secondary battery guns but designers believed greater muzzle blast effects from 28 cm guns would make those casemates unworkable two solutions were proposed both of which involved lowering main battery turrets to upper deck level first involved placing all of secondary guns in an armored battery at main deck level these guns would have been in individual pivot mounts in a series of casemates clustered amidships second option arranged guns in a mix of turrets on upper deck and in a smaller battery in main deck design staff ultimately settled on second option with four guns in turrets and eight in casemate battery at same time as many countries navies improved armor protection of their battleships they were also increasing caliber of their secondary batteries to counter heavier armor such as american s that had a heavy secondary battery of and guns german design staff followed both trends by increasing secondary battery for braunschweig design from to guns and armor layout was improved compared to wittelsbachs primary changes being increasing height of belt armor to prevent it from being submerged at full load and increasing thickness of armor protecting secondary battery casemates design staff considered increasing anti torpedo boat guns from to but decided against change because increased weight would have necessitated reducing number of guns heavier shells would have also reduced rate of fire british battleship armed with ten 12 inch guns was commissioned in december 1906 less than two years after first braunschweig class ships entered service dreadnoughts revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of german navy obsolete including braunschweigs also 17 cm guns proved to be something of a disappointment in service since larger shells were significantly heavier and thus harder to load manually which reduced their rate of fire general characteristics and machinery thumb line drawing of braunschweig class showing arrangement of ships armament and armor scheme left braunschweig class ships were long at waterline and overall ships had a beam of and a draft of beam was constrained by logistical considerations as it was widest that could be accommodated by locks at entrance to kaiserliche werft imperial shipyard in wilhelmshaven ships had thirteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 60 percent of length of hull ships displaced at their designed weight and at a full load ships were fitted with a pair of heavy military masts that carried searchlights steering was controlled with a single rudder ships were described as good sea boats but were prone to heavy pitching ships were responsive and had a tight turning radius at low speed but at hard rudder of 12 degrees ships lost up to 70 percent speed ships had a crew of 35 officers and 708 men normally and when serving as a squadron flagship they had an additional 13 officers and 66 men ships carried a number of smaller boats aboard including two picket boats two launches a pinnace later removed two cutters two yawls and two dinghies boats were handled by two large goose necked cranes located on either side of rear funnel ships of braunschweig class were propelled by three shaft triple expansion steam engines that were rated at triple expansion engines were powered by eight marine type boilers and six cylindrical boilers all of which burned coal these were trunked into three funnels amidships three funnels were adopted because in earlier vessels two funnel arrangement tended to obstruct views from bridge and by splitting smoke into three funnels instead of two funnels could be thinner and thus less obtrusive at some point after 1915 oil firing capability was added to supplement coal fired boilers two outer propellers were three bladed and in diameter while center screw was four bladed and in diameter ships top speed was rated at during trials however engines produced between and a top speed between ships of class could steam at a cruising speed of with exception of hessen hessen suffered from unstable steering which increased fuel consumption and shortened her operational range to at first two ships braunschweig and elsass had four generators that produced 230 kw 74 v while three following ships hessen preussen and lothringen had four turbo generators that provided 260 kw 110 v armament and armor thumb profile drawing of 28 cm sk l 40 gun in naval mounting their main armament was increased from previous designs but was still weaker than contemporary foreign battleships german navy had a tendency to emphasize rapidity of fire rather than weight of shell and smaller guns could generally be fired faster than larger ones main armament comprised four 28 cm sk l 40 quick firing guns in hydraulically operated twin turrets turrets were placed on centerline one forward and one aft drl c 01 turrets allowed guns to depress to 4 degrees and elevate to 30 degrees which enabled a maximum range of guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of ships carried a total of 340 shells 85 per gun secondary battery consisted of fourteen 17 cm sk l 40 quick firing guns four of which were mounted in single turrets amidships with remaining ten in casemates around superstructure guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of these guns were chosen as they used largest shell that could be reasonably handled without machinery turret mounted guns could be elevated to 30 degrees for a maximum range of while casemated guns could only elevate to 22 degrees and had a correspondingly lower range of these guns had a total of 1 820 shells for 130 rounds per gun to transit kiel canal three central 17 cm casemated guns on each side had to be withdrawn into their housings as they were unable to train fully flush with sides of ships with guns fully emplaced ships would have been too wide to fit in canal ships also had fourteen 8 8 cm sk l 35 quick firing guns in casemates along length of ship guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of and could be elevated to 25 degrees for a maximum range of they were also armed with six torpedo tubes with a total of 16 torpedoes one tube was in bow two were on each broadside and final tube was in stern ships were protected with krupp armor main armored belt was thick in central portion of ship where it protected ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces deck armor was thick on horizontal its edges sloped down to connect to lower edge of belt to protect from shells that passed over belt thickness of slopes ranged from fore and aft and amidships where upper belt armor afforded another layer of protection above main belt upper belt of 140 mm steel extended between fore and aft main gun turrets another strake of armor that was 140 mm thick protected casemate guns at main deck level casemate guns themselves received gun shields main battery turrets had 250 mm sides and thick roofs while secondary turrets had thick sides sides of forward conning tower were thick and roof was 50 mm thick while aft conning tower received significantly less protection with 150 mm thick sides and a roof ships thumb braunschweig at

members of braunschweig and deutschland classes of ii battle squadron in north sea ships peacetime careers consisted of routine fleet training squadron and fleet training typically took place in april and may a major fleet cruise generally followed in june and july after which fleet assembled for annual fleet maneuvers in late august and september major fleet cruises typically went to norwegian waters in company with kaiser wilhelm ii s yacht though in 1908 and 1909 fleet embarked on long distance cruises out into atlantic making visits to mainland spain canary islands and azores portugal interspersed in this routine were foreign visits such as in november 1905 when braunschweig carried prince heinrich to norway for coronation of haakon vii of norway and february 1906 when preussen carried wilhelm ii to denmark for funeral of king christian ix ships were also involved in accidents in 1911 hessen collided with danish steamer and sank her and in march 1912 elsass accidentally rammed and sank merchant ship throughout this period preussen served as flagship of ii battle squadron ship s active careers were very short as a result of dreadnought revolution braunschweig and elsass were reduced to reserve in 1912 and 1913 respectively though lothringen hessen and preussen were still in active service in mid 1914 lothringen was to be reduced to reserve in july and preussen was slated to be decommissioned at end of year but july crisis that followed assassination of archduke franz ferdinand in june cancelled that plan fleet was on its summer cruise to norway during crisis and word of austro hungarian ultimatum to serbia forced ships to return home early to prepare for coming conflict world war i thumb left one of braunschweig class battleships at start of world war i braunschweig and essen were reactivated and assigned to iv battle squadron under command of vice admiral ehrhard schmidt tasked with coastal defense duties squadron conducted several sorties into baltic sea to patrol for russian warships but it saw no action ships were also used to guard mouth of elbe in north sea in first year of war braunschweig and elsass participated in early portion of battle of gulf of riga in august 1915 where they kept russian pre dreadnought at bay while a russian minefield in irben strait was cleared but russian forces put up a strong defense schmidt decided to withdraw his forces when it became apparent that mine clearing had taken too long and there was not sufficient daylight left for minelayer to lay a minefield of its own in moon sound to block northern entrance to gulf following cancellation of operation squadron saw little activity before being disbanded in december in meantime other three ships were still serving in ii battle squadron where they participated in fleet sorties conducted in first two years of war this series of operations culminated in battle of jutland on 31 may 1 june 1916 by that time only hessen was still on active service with squadron preussen was on rotation as guard ship in danish straits and had been replaced as flagship by battleship and lothringen was in poor condition and in dire need of repair hessen saw limited action at jutland coming into contact with heavy british ships once this encounter came late on 31 may when hessen and other pre dreadnoughts of ii battle squadron briefly engaged vice admiral david beatty s 1st battlecruiser squadron in doing so covering withdrawal of battered german battlecruisers under command of franz von hipper loss of pre dreadnought during battle highlighted vulnerability of older battleships and coupled with their slow speed convinced german naval command to withdraw them from front line service preussen lothringen and hessen continued as guard ships in baltic in aftermath of jutland starting in 1916 ships of braunschweig class began to be withdrawn from active service primarily because of manpower shortages elsass was reduced to a barracks ship based in kiel in july and hessen was decommissioned and disarmed in december she thereafter became a depot ship based in brunsbuttel in 1917 braunschweig was converted into a training ship and on 20 august was reduced to a barracks ship also in kiel preussen became a depot ship in wilhelmshaven also in 1917 lothringen continued her guard ship duties until september 1917 when she too was withdrawn from service thereafter being used as an engineer training ship in wilhelmshaven starting in 1916 guns removed from these ships were used by imperial army as railway guns one of these guns was captured by australian army and is preserved as amiens gun at australian war memorial in canberra australia post world war i thumb hessen as a target ship in 1946 after war all of germany s powerful dreadnoughts had either been scuttled in scapa flow or ceded to allies as war prizes so braunschweig class battleships were recommissioned into newly reorganized reichsmarine treaty of versailles specifically stated in article 181 that reichsmarine would be permitted to retain eight battleships of lothringen or deutschland types three of ships braunschweig elsass and hessen saw active duty with fleet while other two vessels preussen and lothringen were instead converted into parent ships for minesweepers since germany was required by treaty of versailles to clear extensive minefields that had been laid in north sea during war those two ships were disarmed and modified to carry minesweepers but preussen proved to be top heavy and saw little actual use lothringen remained in service until 1920 by which time minesweeping work had been completed and she was laid up in reserve braunschweig was modernized in 1919 1920 and served in reichsmarine from 1921 to 1926 at which point she was withdrawn from active duty during this period she served as flagship of marinestation der nordsee naval station of north sea and later linienschiffsdivision battleship division elsass was also rebuilt in early 1920s and thereafter saw active duty in fleet from 1924 until 25 february 1930 at which point she was removed from active service hessen returned to service in 1925 throughout 1920s and early 1930s fleet conducted a similar training routine to that of pre war period including cruises into atlantic in 1920s on 31 may 1931 braunschweig elsass and lothringen were stricken from naval register first two vessels were converted into hulks at wilhelmshaven and eventually scrapped while lothringen was simply broken up immediately hessen remained in service until late 1934 by which time new of panzerschiffe armored ships had begun to enter service hessen was thereafter converted into a target ship work involved cutting away most of superstructure removing armament and replacing old propulsion machinery with steam turbines additionally equipment to allow ship to be operated via radio control was installed conversion work lasted from 31 march 1935 to 1 april 1937 when she was recommissioned as a target she served in this capacity through 1945 during world war ii she was also occasionally used as an icebreaker to clear paths in baltic after war she was ceded to soviet union and renamed tsel soviets also used ship as a target and eventually scrapped vessel in 1960s when preussen was being dismantled in 1930s a length of her hull was retained for use as a target hulk was nicknamed sms vierkant sms rectangle and remained in use through world war ii until allied bombers attacked and sank it in april 1945 footnotes notes citations references
