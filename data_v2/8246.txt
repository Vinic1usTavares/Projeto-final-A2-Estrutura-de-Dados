jun 2014 with an introduction by paul vii consisting of a number of magic spells intended to assist a dead person s journey through duat or underworld and into afterlife and written by many priests over a period of about 1000 years book of dead which was placed in coffin or burial chamber of deceased was part of a tradition of funerary texts which includes earlier pyramid texts and coffin texts which were painted onto objects not written on papyrus some of spells included in book were drawn from these older works and date to 3rd millennium bce other spells were composed later in egyptian history dating to third intermediate period 11th to 7th centuries bce a number of spells which make up book continued to be separately inscribed on tomb walls and sarcophagi as spells from which they originated always had been there was no single or canonical book of dead surviving papyri contain a varying selection of religious and magical texts and vary considerably in their illustration some people seem to have commissioned their own copies of book of dead perhaps choosing spells they thought most vital in their own progression to afterlife book of dead was most commonly written in hieroglyphic or hieratic script on a papyrus scroll and often illustrated with vignettes depicting deceased and their journey into afterlife finest example we have of egyptian book of dead in antiquity is papyrus of ani ani was an egyptian scribe it was discovered by sir e a wallis budge in 1888 and was taken to british museum where it currently resides development right thumb part of pyramid texts a precursor of book of dead inscribed on tomb of teti book of dead developed from a tradition of funerary manuscripts dating back to egyptian old kingdom first funerary texts were pyramid texts first used in pyramid of king unas of 5th dynasty around 2400 bce faulkner p 54 these texts were written on walls of burial chambers within pyramids and were exclusively for use of pharaoh and from 6th dynasty queen pyramid texts were written in an unusual hieroglyphic style many of hieroglyphs representing humans or animals were left incomplete or drawn mutilated most likely to prevent them causing any harm to dead pharaoh taylor 2010 p 54 purpose of pyramid texts was to help dead king take his place amongst gods in particular to reunite him with his divine father ra at this period afterlife was seen as being in sky rather than underworld described in book of dead towards end of old kingdom pyramid texts ceased to be an exclusively royal privilege and were adopted by regional governors and other high ranking officials in middle kingdom a new funerary text emerged coffin texts coffin texts used a newer version of language new spells and included illustrations for first time coffin texts were most commonly written on inner surfaces of coffins though they are occasionally found on tomb walls or on papyri coffin texts were available to wealthy private individuals vastly increasing number of people who could expect to participate in afterlife a process which has been described as democratization of afterlife d auria et al p 187 book of dead first developed in thebes toward beginning of second intermediate period around 1700 bce earliest known occurrence of spells included in book of dead is from coffin of queen mentuhotep of 13th dynasty where new spells were included amongst older texts known from pyramid texts and coffin texts some of spells introduced at this time claim an older provenance for instance rubric to spell 30b states that it was discovered by prince in reign of king menkaure many hundreds of years before it is attested in archaeological record taylor 2010 p 34 by 17th dynasty book of dead had become widespread not only for members of royal family but courtiers and other officials as well at this stage spells were typically inscribed on linen shrouds wrapped around dead though occasionally they are found written on coffins or on papyrus taylor 2010 p 55 new kingdom saw book of dead develop and spread further famous spell 125 weighing of heart is first known from reign of hatshepsut and thutmose iii c 1475 bce from this period onward book of dead was typically written on a papyrus scroll and text illustrated with vignettes during 19th dynasty in particular vignettes tended to be lavish sometimes at expense of surrounding text taylor 2010 p 35 7 in third intermediate period book of dead started to appear in hieratic script as well as in traditional hieroglyphics hieratic scrolls were a cheaper version lacking illustration apart from a single vignette at beginning and were produced on smaller papyri at same time many burials used additional funerary texts for instance amduat taylor 2010 p 57 8 during 25th and 26th dynasties book of dead was updated revised and standardised spells were ordered and numbered consistently for first time this standardised version is known today as saite recension after saite 26th dynasty in late period and ptolemaic period book of dead continued to be based on saite recension though increasingly abbreviated towards end of ptolemaic period new funerary texts appeared including book of breathing and book of traversing eternity last use of book of dead was in 1st century bce though some artistic motifs drawn from it were still in use in roman times taylor 2010 p 59 60 spells thumb right mystical spell 17 from papyrus of ani vignette at top illustrates from left to right god heh as a representation of sea a gateway to realm of osiris eye of horus celestial cow mehet weret and a human head rising from a coffin guarded by four sons of horus taylor 2010 p 51 book of dead is made up of a number of individual texts and their accompanying illustrations most sub texts begin with word ro which can mean mouth speech spell utterance incantation or a chapter of a book this ambiguity reflects similarity in egyptian thought between ritual speech and magical power faulkner 1994 p 145 taylor 2010 p 29 in context of book of dead it is typically translated as either chapter or spell in this article word spell is used at present some 192 spells are known faulkner 1994 p 18 though no single manuscript contains them all they served a range of purposes some are intended to give deceased mystical knowledge in afterlife or perhaps to identify them with gods for instance spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of god atum taylor 2010 p 51 56 others are incantations to ensure different elements of dead person s being were preserved and reunited and to give deceased control over world around him still others protect deceased from various hostile forces or guide him through underworld past various obstacles famously two spells also deal with judgement of deceased in weighing of heart ritual such spells as 26 30 and sometimes spells 6 and 126 relate to heart and were inscribed on scarabs texts and images of book of dead were magical as well as religious magic was as legitimate an activity as praying to gods even when magic was aimed at controlling gods themselves faulkner 1994 p 146 indeed there was little distinction for ancient egyptians between magical and religious practice faulkner 1994 p 145 concept of magic heka was also intimately linked with spoken and written word act of speaking a ritual formula was an act of creation taylor 2010 p 30 there is a sense in which action and speech were one and same thing magical power of words extended to written word hieroglyphic script was held to have been invented by god thoth and hieroglyphs themselves were powerful written words conveyed full force of a spell this was even true when text was abbreviated or omitted as often occurred in later book of dead scrolls particularly if accompanying images were present taylor 2010 p 32 3 faulkner 1994 p 148 egyptians also believed that knowing name of something gave power over it thus book of dead equips its owner with mystical names of many of entities he would encounter in afterlife giving him power over them taylor 2010 p 30 1 thumb egyptian book of dead painted on a coffin fragment c 747 656 bce spell 79 attaching soul to body and spell 80 preventing incoherent speech spells of book of dead made use of several magical techniques which can also be seen in other areas of egyptian life a number of spells are for magical amulets which would protect deceased from harm in addition to being represented on a book of dead papyrus these spells appeared on amulets wound into wrappings of a mummy everyday magic made use of amulets in huge numbers other items in direct contact with body in tomb such as headrests were also considered to have value pinch 1994 p 104 5 a number of spells also refer to egyptian beliefs about magical healing power of saliva organization almost every book of dead was unique containing a different mixture of spells drawn from corpus of texts available for most of history of book of dead there was no defined order or structure taylor 2010 p 55 in fact until paul s 1967 pioneering study of common themes between texts egyptologists concluded there was no internal structure at all faulkner 1994 p 141 it is only from saite period 26th dynasty onwards that there is a defined order taylor p 58 books of dead from saite period tend to organize chapters into four sections chapters 1 16 deceased enters tomb and descends to underworld and body regains its powers of movement and speech chapters 17 63 explanation of mythic origin of gods and places deceased is made to live again so that he may arise reborn with morning sun chapters 64 129 deceased travels across sky in sun ark as one of blessed dead in evening deceased travels to underworld to appear before osiris chapters 130 189 having been vindicated deceased assumes power in universe as one of gods this section also includes assorted chapters on protective amulets provision of food and important places egyptian concepts of death and afterlife thumb a vignette in papyrus of ani from spell 30b spell for not letting ani s heart create opposition against him in gods domain which contains a depiction of ba of deceased spells in book of dead depict egyptian beliefs about nature of death and afterlife book of dead is a vital source of information about egyptian beliefs in this area preservation one aspect of death was disintegration of various or modes of existence taylor 2010 p 16 17 funerary rituals served to re integrate these different aspects of being mummification served to preserve and transform physical body into sah an idealised form with divine aspects taylor 2010 p 17 20 book of dead contained spells aimed at preserving body of deceased which may have been recited during process of mummification for instance spell 154 taylor 2010 p 161 heart which was regarded as aspect of being which included intelligence and memory was also protected with spells and in case anything happened to physical heart it was common to bury jewelled heart scarabs with a body to provide a replacement ka or life force remained in tomb with dead body and required sustenance from offerings of food water and incense in case priests or relatives failed to provide these offerings spell 105 ensured ka was satisfied taylor 2010 p 163 4 name of dead person which constituted their individuality and was required for their continued existence was written in many places throughout book and spell 25 ensured deceased would remember their own name taylor 2010 p 163 ba was a free ranging spirit aspect of deceased it was ba depicted as a human headed bird which could go forth by day from tomb into world spells 61 and 89 acted to preserve it taylor 2010 p 17 164 finally shut or shadow of deceased was preserved by spells 91 92 and 188 taylor 2010 p 164 if all these aspects of person could be variously preserved remembered and satiated then dead person would live on in form of an akh an akh was a blessed spirit with magical powers who would dwell among gods taylor 2010 p 17 afterlife nature of afterlife which dead person enjoyed is difficult to define because of differing traditions within ancient egyptian religion in book of dead dead were taken into presence of god osiris who was confined to subterranean duat there are also spells to enable ba or akh of dead to join ra as he travelled sky in his sun barque and help him fight off apep spells 100 2 129 131 and 133 136 taylor 2010 p 239 241 as well as joining gods book of dead also depicts dead living on in field of reeds a paradisiac likeness of real world spells 109 110 and 149 taylor 2010 p 238 240 field of reeds is depicted as a lush plentiful version of egypt of living there are fields crops oxen people and waterways deceased person is shown encountering great ennead a group of gods as well as his or her own parents while depiction of field of reeds is pleasant and plentiful it is also clear that manual labour is required for this reason burials included a number of statuettes named or later these statuettes were inscribed with a spell also included in book of dead requiring them to undertake any manual labour that might be owner s duty in afterlife taylor 2010 p 242 245 it is also clear that dead not only went to a place where gods lived but that they acquired divine characteristics themselves in many occasions deceased is mentioned as osiris name in book of dead thumb right two gate spells on top register ani and his wife face seven gates of house of osiris below they encounter ten of 21 mysterious portals of house of osiris in field of reeds all are guarded by unpleasant protectors taylor 2010 p 143 path to afterlife as laid out in book of dead was a difficult one deceased was required to pass a series of gates caverns and mounds guarded by supernatural creatures taylor 2010 p 135 these terrifying entities were armed with enormous knives and are illustrated in grotesque forms typically as human figures with heads of animals or combinations of different ferocious beasts their names for instance he who lives on snakes or he who dances in blood are equally grotesque these creatures had to be pacified by reciting appropriate spells included in book of dead once pacified they posed no further threat and could even extend their protection to dead person taylor 2010 p 136 7 another breed of supernatural creatures was who killed unrighteous on behalf of osiris book of dead equipped its owner to escape their attentions taylor 2010 p 188 as well as these supernatural entities there were also threats from natural or supernatural animals including crocodiles snakes and beetles taylor 2010 p 184 7 judgment thumb right weighing of heart ritual shown in book of dead of if all obstacles of duat could be negotiated deceased would be judged in weighing of heart ritual depicted in spell 125 deceased was led by god anubis into presence of osiris there dead person swore that he had not committed any sin from a list of 42 sins taylor 2010 p 208 reciting a text known as negative confession then dead person s heart was weighed on a pair of scales against goddess maat who embodied truth and justice maat was often represented by an ostrich feather hieroglyphic sign for her name taylor 2010 p 209 at this point there was a risk that deceased s heart would bear witness owning up to sins committed in life spell 30b guarded against this eventuality if scales balanced this meant deceased had led a good life anubis would take them to osiris and they would find their place in afterlife becoming maa meaning vindicated or true of voice taylor 2010 p 215 if heart was out of balance with maat then another fearsome beast called ammit devourer stood ready to eat it and put dead person s afterlife to an early and unpleasant end taylor 2010 p 212 this scene is remarkable not only for its vividness but as one of few parts of book of dead with any explicit moral content judgment of dead and negative confession were a representation of conventional moral code which governed egyptian society for every i have not in negative confession it is possible to read an unexpressed thou shalt not faulkner 1994 p 14 while ten commandments of jewish and christian ethics are rules of conduct laid down by a perceived divine revelation negative confession is more a divine enforcement of everyday morality taylor 2010 p 204 5 views differ among egyptologists about how far negative confession represents a moral absolute with ethical purity being necessary for progress to afterlife john taylor points out wording of spells 30b and 125 suggests a pragmatic approach to morality by preventing heart from contradicting him with any inconvenient truths it seems that deceased could enter afterlife even if their life had not been entirely pure ogden goelet says without an exemplary and moral existence there was no hope for a successful afterlife while geraldine pinch suggests that negative confession is essentially similar to spells protecting from demons and that success of weighing of heart depended on mystical knowledge of true names of judges rather than on deceased s moral behaviour pinch 1994 p 155 producing a book of dead thumb right part of book of dead of ii text is hieratic except for hieroglyphics in vignette use of red pigment and joins between papyrus sheets are also visible thumb right a close up of papyrus of ani showing cursive hieroglyphs of text a book of dead papyrus was produced to order by scribes they were commissioned by people in preparation for their own funerals or by relatives of someone recently deceased they were expensive items one source gives price of a book of dead scroll as one deben of silver taylor 2010 p 62 perhaps half annual pay of a labourer faulkner 1994 p 142 papyrus itself was evidently costly as there are many instances of its re use in everyday documents creating palimpsests in one case a book of dead was written on second hand papyrus taylor 2010 p 264 most owners of book of dead were evidently part of social elite they were initially reserved for royal family but later papyri are found in tombs of scribes priests and officials most owners were men and generally vignettes included owner s wife as well towards beginning of history of book of dead there are roughly 10 copies belonging to men for every 1 for a woman however during third intermediate period 2 were for women for every 1 for a man and women owned roughly a third of hieratic from late and ptolemaic periods taylor 2010 p 62 63 dimensions of a book of dead could vary widely longest is 40m long while some are as short as 1m they are composed of sheets of papyrus joined together individual papyri varying in width from 15 cm to 45 cm scribes working on book of dead papyri took more care over their work than those working on more mundane texts care was taken to frame text within margins and to avoid writing on joints between sheets words em heru or coming forth by day sometimes appear on reverse of outer margin perhaps acting as a label books were often prefabricated in funerary workshops with spaces being left for name of deceased to be written in later taylor 2010 p 267 for instance in papyrus of ani name ani appears at top or bottom of a column or immediately following a rubric introducing him as speaker of a block of text name appears in a different handwriting to rest of manuscript and in some places is mis spelt or omitted entirely text of a new kingdom book of dead was typically written in cursive hieroglyphs most often from left to right but also sometimes from right to left hieroglyphs were in columns which were separated by black lines a similar arrangement to that used when hieroglyphs were carved on tomb walls or monuments illustrations were put in frames above below or between columns of text largest illustrations took up a full page of papyrus taylor 2010 p 266 from 21st dynasty onward more copies of book of dead are found in hieratic script calligraphy is similar to that of other hieratic manuscripts of new kingdom text is written in horizontal lines across wide columns often column size corresponds to size of papyrus sheets of which a scroll is made up occasionally a hieratic book of dead contains captions in hieroglyphic text of a book of dead was written in both black and red ink regardless of whether it was in hieroglyphic or hieratic script most of text was in black with red ink used for titles of spells opening and closing sections of spells instructions to perform spells correctly in rituals and also for names of dangerous creatures such as demon apep taylor 2010 p 270 black ink used was based on carbon and red ink on ochre in both cases mixed with water taylor 2010 p 277 style and nature of vignettes used to illustrate a book of dead varies widely some contain lavish colour illustrations even making use of gold leaf others contain only line drawings or one simple illustration at opening taylor 2010 p 267 8 book of dead papyri were often work of several different scribes and artists whose work was literally pasted together it is usually possible to identify style of more than one scribe used on a given manuscript even when manuscript is a shorter one text and illustrations were produced by different scribes there are a number of books where text was completed but illustrations were left empty taylor 2010 p 268 thumbnail center book of dead of of amun 31 brooklyn museum discovery translation interpretation and preservation thumb right karl richard lepsius first translator of a complete book of dead manuscript existence of book of dead was known as early as middle ages well before its contents could be understood since it was found in tombs it was evidently a document of a religious nature and this led to widespread but mistaken belief that book of dead was equivalent of a bible or qur an faulkner 1994 p 210 p 288 9 in 1842 karl richard lepsius published a translation of a manuscript dated to ptolemaic era and coined name book of dead das he also introduced spell numbering system which is still in use identifying 165 different spells lepsius promoted idea of a comparative edition of book of dead drawing on all relevant manuscripts this project was undertaken by edouard starting in 1875 and completed in 1886 producing a three volume work including a selection of vignettes for every one of 186 spells he worked with more significant variations of text for every spell and commentary in 1867 samuel birch of british museum published first extensive english translation egypt s place in universal history vol 5 1867 in 1876 he published a photographic copy of papyrus of taylor 2010 p 289 92 work of e a wallis budge birch s successor at british museum is still in wide circulation including both his hieroglyphic editions and

work on book of dead has always posed technical difficulties thanks to need to copy very long hieroglyphic texts initially these were copied out by hand with assistance either of tracing paper or a camera lucida in mid 19th century hieroglyphic fonts became available and made lithographic reproduction of manuscripts more feasible in present day hieroglyphics can be rendered in desktop publishing software and this combined with digital print technology means that costs of publishing a book of dead may be considerably reduced however a very large amount of source material in museums around
