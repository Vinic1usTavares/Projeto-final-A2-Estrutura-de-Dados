better updated unofficial simpsons guide warren martyn and adrian wood wrote a terrific episode with homer so stupid it isn t true yet still saving day seeing ned flanders get it wrong is great but

that we see what an amazing amount of goods and services one can purchase in springfield with only 20 and we get a fun spoof of scouting add to that terrific rivalry moments between bart and homer and

and just when you think simpsons creators have taken parody as far as it can go they air an episode like this writers cram 22 minute episode with allusions to movie genres including disaster movies broadway musicals adventure suspense and classic teen horror adam suraf of dunkirkma net named it one of his ten favorite episodes of show he called musical sequence a classic rick porter of zap 2 it wrote in that he was not a fan of episode s second half despite presence of borgnine homer is a little too aggressively stupid for my taste he thought first part was absolutely brilliant though kurt m koenigsberger analyzed a scene from episode in his piece commodity culture and its discontents published in compilation work leaving springfield simpsons and possibility of oppositional culture edited by john alberti he commented that simpsons literary and cultural awareness extends to conventions of its own medium in this episode bart criticizes an itchy scratchy episode because itchy stakes down scratchy s appendages and props his belly to form a tent with faulty knots with homer looking on from couch lisa reminds bart that cartoons do not simply reproduce reality a point hammered on as a second homer meanders past living room window koenigsberger said that this moment and many others like it reveal a strong sense of self awareness within show an awareness especially characteristic of
