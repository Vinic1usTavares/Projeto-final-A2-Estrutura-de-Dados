lesser antillean macaw or guadeloupe macaw ara guadeloupensis is a hypothetical extinct species of macaw that is thought to have been endemic to lesser antillean island region of guadeloupe in spite of absence of conserved specimens many details about lesser antillean macaw are known from several contemporary accounts and bird is subject of some illustrations austin hobart clark described species on basis of these accounts in 1905 due to lack of physical remains and possibility that sightings were of macaws from south american mainland doubts have been raised about existence of this species a phalanx bone from island of marie galante confirmed existence of a similar sized macaw inhabiting region prior to arrival of humans and was correlated with lesser antillean macaw in 2015 later that year historical sources distinguishing between red macaws of guadeloupe and scarlet macaw a macao of mainland were identified further supporting its validity according to contemporary descriptions body of lesser antillean macaw was red and wings were red blue and yellow tail feathers were between 38 and 51 cm 15 and 20 in long apart from smaller size and all red coloration of tail feathers it resembled scarlet macaw and may therefore have been a close relative of that species bird ate poisonous manchineel was monogamous nested in trees and laid two eggs once or twice a year early writers described it as being abundant in guadeloupe but it was becoming rare by 1760 and only survived in uninhabited areas disease and hunting by humans are thought to have eradicated it shortly afterward lesser antillean macaw is one of 13 extinct macaw species that have been proposed to have lived in caribbean islands many of these species are now considered dubious because only three are known from physical remains and there are no extant endemic macaws on islands today taxonomy upright thumb left possible depiction by francois nicolas martinet from histoire naturelle 1765 alt an illustration of a macaw with red tail feathers red back and breast feathers and blue and yellow wing tips it sits on a tree branch facing right lesser antillean macaw is well documented compared to most other extinct caribbean macaws since it was mentioned and described by several contemporary writers parrots thought to be lesser antillean macaw were first mentioned by spanish historian gonzalo fernandez de oviedo y valdes in 1553 referring to a 1496 account by spanish bibliographer ferdinand columbus who mentioned chicken sized parrots which island caribs called guacamayas in guadeloupe in 1774 french naturalist comte de buffon stated that italian explorer christopher columbus had found macaws in guadeloupe french botanist jean baptiste du tertre gave first detailed descriptions in 1654 and 1667 and illustrated bird and other animals found in guadeloupe french clergyman jean baptiste labat also described bird in 1742 writers such as george edwards and john latham also mentioned presence of red and blue macaws on islands off america american zoologist austin hobart clark gave lesser antillean macaw its scientific name ara guadeloupensis in 1905 based on contemporary accounts and he also cited a 1765 color plate as possibly depicting this species he wrote that it was different in several ways from superficially similar scarlet macaw a macao as well as green winged macaw a and cuban macaw a tricolor clark suggested species might also have existed on islands of dominica and martinique based on accounts of red macaws there as well as on guadeloupe in his 1907 book extinct birds british zoologist walter rothschild instead claimed each island had its own species and that lesser antillean macaw was confined to guadeloupe in 1908 clark reclassified dominican macaw as a separate species a based on writings of thomas atwood in 1967 american ornithologist james greenway wrote that macaws reported from guadeloupe could have been imported to region from elsewhere by native population but this is difficult to prove greenway also suggested that scarlet macaw and cuban macaw formed a superspecies with lesser antillean macaw and other hypothetical extinct species suggested for jamaica and hispaniola english paleontologist julian hume proposed in 2012 that similarity between lesser antillean macaw and scarlet macaw indicates that they were close relatives and that guadeloupe species may have descended from mainland macaw a small parrot ulna found on folle anse archaeological site on marie galante an island in guadeloupe region was assigned to lesser antillean macaw by ornithologists matthew williams and david steadman in 2001 in 2008 ornithologists storrs olson and edgar maiz lopez cast doubt upon this identification and proposed that bone instead belonged to extant imperial amazon amazona imperialis size and robustness of bone was similar to ulnae of imperial amazon and though it was worn authors identified what appeared to be a notch which is also present on ulnae of genus amazona but not in genus ara subfossil remains from island of montserrat have also been suggested to belong to lesser antillean macaw species was recognized by birdlife international and iucn red list until 2013 but was not considered valid thereafter thumb left map showing marie galante bottom right within guadeloupe in 2015 a terminal phalanx bone ungual claw bone attributable to genus ara from south western marie galante was described by ecologists monica gala and arnaud lenoble it was discovered in blanchard cave during excavations in 2013 2014 in a fossil bearing deposit dating to late pleistocene epoch deposit was radiocarbon dated to about 10 690 years ago earliest evidence of human settlement in area has been dated to 5 300 years ago this confirmed that guadeloupe region once had an endemic macaw which could not have been brought there by humans all other macaw bones from lesser antillean islands have been recovered from archaeological sites and could therefore have been remains of birds brought there by amerindians size of phalanx bone matched what was described for lesser antillean macaw by contemporary writers and authors therefore correlated two they conceded that this connection could only be tentative as there were no remains of lesser antillean macaw to compare with later in 2015 lenoble reviewed overlooked historical spanish and french sources finding references to mainly red macaws consistent with lesser antillean macaw writings of french missionary raymond breton on guadeloupe from 1635 to 1654 were especially illuminating as they showed that both he and native island caribs clearly distinguished between red macaws of guadeloupe and scarlet macaws from mainland which supports idea that lesser antillean macaw represents an independent species as lesser antillean carib language had different words reserved for men and women breton gave name of bird as and lenoble furthermore concluded that supposed violet macaw named purpurascens based on accounts of blue parrots from guadeloupe was based on misidentified references to also extinct guadeloupe amazon amazona violacea and therefore never existed

frog as many as 13 now extinct species of macaw have variously been suggested to have lived on caribbean islands but many of these were based on old descriptions or drawings and only represent hypothetical species in addition to lesser antillean macaw only two endemic caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains cuban macaw is known from 19 museum skins and subfossils and saint croix macaw a is known only from subfossils macaws are known to have been transported between caribbean islands and from mainland south america to caribbean both in historic times by europeans and native peoples and in prehistoric times by paleoamericans parrots were important in culture of native caribbeans and were among gifts offered to christopher columbus when he reached bahamas in 1492 historical records of macaws on these islands therefore may not have represented distinct endemic species it is also possible that these macaws were escaped or feral birds that had been transported to islands from elsewhere all endemic caribbean macaws were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times identity and distribution of indigenous macaws in caribbean is only likely to be further resolved through paleontological discoveries and examination of contemporary reports and artwork description thumb left upright variety of 1765 plate alt an illustration of a macaw with orange red tail back and breast feathers and mauve blue and yellow wings it sits on a tree branch facing right lesser antillean macaw was described as having similar coloration to scarlet macaw but with shorter tail feathers between 38 and 51 cm 15 and 20 in long in contrast tail feathers of scarlet macaw are 61 cm 2 ft long and have blue tips and outer feathers are almost entirely blue in spite of tail feathers being shorter it is not certain whether lesser antillean macaw was smaller than scarlet macaw overall as relative proportions of body parts vary between macaw species tail feathers were longer than those of cuban macaw which were 30 cm 12 in long morphology of fossil phalanx bone from marie galante was most similar to second or third ungual of scarlet macaw though bone is slightly smaller at compared to du tertre described lesser antillean macaw as follows in 1654 though clark converted du tertre s tail measurement to 18 in 45 7 cm lenoble pointed out that a 17th century french foot unit was slightly larger than english equivalent and measurement should rather be converted to 19 3 in 49 cm indicating a smaller size difference between lesser antillean macaw and scarlet macaw thumb upright two scarlet macaws note longer bluer tail feathers alt two macaws sitting in a tree both have red head and upper body feathers yellow midsection feathers blue lower body and wing tip feathers and predominantly red tails with blue streaks in 1742 labat described macaw in much same way as du tertre while adding several details both authors wrote that macaws were largest parrots of guadeloupe and stressed that parrots of each caribbean island were distinct and could be differentiated both based on their morphology and their vocalizations according to hume this means that birds described could not simply have been escaped south american macaws furthermore docile and amiable nature described by du tertre and labat does not match behavior of south american macaws breton s mid 1600s accounts of macaw confirmed it as distinct from mainland scarlet macaws apart from du tertre s crude 1667 drawing and labat s 1722 derivative a few contemporary paintings depict red macaws that may be lesser antillean macaw a color plate accompanying a 1765 volume of buffon s encyclopaedia histoire naturelle no 12 in planches enluminees entitled l ara rouge shows a red macaw with entirely red tail feathers and more red on tertial and scapular feathers of wing than are present on scarlet macaw copies of plate differ in nuances used but are identical in pattern painting suggests that a specimen may have been present in europe at time swedish zoologist carl linnaeus cited plate in his 1766 description of scarlet macaw but his description does not match bird shown a 1626 painting by dutch artist roelant savery which also includes a dodo shows a red macaw that agrees with descriptions of lesser antillean macaw a second macaw in painting may be hypothetical extinct martinique macaw a but though many parrots were imported into europe at time from all over world it is impossible to determine accuracy of such paintings today behavior and

this macaw alt a spherical green and brown apple like fruit on a tree in a 1667 work du tertre gave a similar account and added that macaw only ate poisonous manchineel hippomane mancinella fruits in times of necessity he also described monogamous reproductive behavior of bird twice yearly breeding mentioned by du tertre may have actually been staggered breeding which is practiced by some tropical birds though clark suggested that lesser antillean macaw also occurred on dominica and martinique there is no evidence for this instead it probably existed on other islands close to guadeloupe fossil phalanx bone from marie galante was deposited in a time when that island and rest of guadeloupe archipelago were closer together than they are today due to lower sea levels areas were separated by three channels largest of which was wide this would not have been a hindrance to flying animals and macaws of guadeloupe islands would probably have been a single population during pleistocene extinction thumb left upright variety of 1765 plate alt an illustration of a macaw with red tail feathers red back and breast feathers and blue and yellow wing tips it sits on a tree branch facing right in 1534 german historian johann wrote that forests of guadeloupe were full of red macaws which were apparently as abundant as grasshoppers and native people of region cooked macaw s flesh together with that of humans and of other birds in 1654 du tertre stated that flesh was tough to eat and that some considered it unpalatable and even poisonous he wrote that he and other inhabitants often consumed it and that he experienced no ill effects from it he also stated that native people wore feathers decoratively on their heads and as mustaches through septum of nose he described how bird was hunted by native population du tertre wrote that macaws were prone to sickness and an outbreak of a disease along with hunting may have contributed to its demise in 1760 french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson quoted a letter by french writer m de la borde which stated that macaws had become very rare in antillean islands because they were hunted for food by then they could only be found in areas not frequented by humans and were probably extinct soon afterward parrots are often among first species to be exterminated from a given locality especially islands references external
