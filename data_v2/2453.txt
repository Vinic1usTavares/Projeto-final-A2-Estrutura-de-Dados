geastrum pectinatum is an inedible species of mushroom belonging to earthstar family of fungi although young specimens are spherical fruit body development involves outer layer of tissue splitting open like a star into 7 to 10 pointed rays that eventually bend back to point downward revealing a small broad spore sac spore sac is supported by a small radially wrinkled stalk there is a distinct conical opening peristome at top of spore sac that is up to long it is commonly known as beaked earthstar or beret earthstar in reference to shape of spore sac and its prominent protruding peristome mass of spores and surrounding cells within sac gleba is dark brown and becomes powdery in mature specimens spores are spherical measuring 4 to 6 micrometers in diameter with warts on their surfaces although uncommon geastrum pectinatum has a cosmopolitan distribution and has been collected in various locations in europe north and south america asia and africa where it grows on ground in open woods like several other earthstars crystals of calcium oxalate are found on g pectinatum and are thought to be involved in fruit body maturation taxonomy classification and naming christian hendrik persoon published first description of geastrum pectinatum in 1801 in 1860 miles joseph berkeley and moses ashley curtis described species geastrum originally named geaster based on specimens sent to them by charles wright that he obtained from bonin islands during north pacific exploring and surveying expedition japanese mycologist imai considered this identical with g pectinatum in a 1936 publication in 1959 mycologist j t palmer reported comparing original specimen collected by persoon with fresh samples of what were then thought to be distinct species g and g named by english naturalist miles joseph berkeley in 1838 and 1848 respectively and concluded three specimens were synonymous original persoon specimen was then designated as neotype in ponce de leon s classification of geastrum he placed species in subgenus geastrum section geastrum as type of subsection group pectinatum other species in this group characterized by a determinate peristome surrounded by a groove are g xerophilum and g in stanek s 1958 infrageneric concept g pectinatum is placed in section perimyceliata encompassing species whereby mycelial layer covers entire endoperidium in subsection which includes species with plicate specific epithet is derived from latin pectinatum like a comb its common names include beaked earthstar or beret earthstar samuel frederick gray called it comblike shell puff in his 1821 a natural arrangement of british plants description immature specimens diameter are roughly spherical and begin their development submerged in ground but gradually push above ground during maturation in this state outer surface is covered with mycelia which forms a soft fluffy coat that holds soil and debris to outer surface young fruit bodies often have a rounded knob or like other members of genus geastrum g pectinatum has a fruit body wall that is multilayered at maturity outer layer exoperidium splits open from top in a stellate star shaped manner into 7 9 rays that support spore sac contained within inner wall endoperidium expanded specimens are up to broad and tall rays of exoperidium bend back reflex simultaneously elevating spore sac above ground in what is known as fornicate condition this position exposes spore sac to more air currents aiding spore dispersal surface of rays often crack to reveal lighter colored areas especially along edges together with a well developed layer of mycelium rays are typically bound to fragments of earth or forest duff left thumb close up of pedicel and underside of spore sac tough and membranous endoperidium comprising spore sac purple brown in color and tall by wide is supported by a small stalk a pedicel that is 3 4 mm long by 7 10 mm wide and which has a grooved sulcate apophysis or swelling this ring shaped swelling is made of remnants from a tissue called pseudoparenchymatous layer when fresh pseudoparenchymatous layer is whitish in color thick and fleshy it dries to become brown to dark brown while shrinking and often splitting and peeling endoperidium may be pruinose covered with fine white powder although presence of this characteristic has been noted as being somewhat variable spore sac is opened by a single apical pore atop a conical beak or peristome peristome is pectinate made of tissue that resembles teeth of a comb specific epithet is named after this characteristic peristome is long and comprises 20 32 distinct ridges mass of spores and surrounding cells within sac gleba is dark brown and becomes powdery in mature specimens internally endoperidium contains a structure called columella that is narrowly conical in shape whitish or pale brown and extends more than halfway into gleba g pectinatum has no distinguishable odor or taste like other earthstar mushrooms it is inedible and of no alimentary interest microscopic characteristics spores of g pectinatum are brown and opaque they have a roughly spherical shape and are ornamented with transparent hyaline truncate warts diameter is 4 4 5 um or 5 5 6 5 if lengths of warts is included spore bearing cells basidia are 2 or 4 spored while cystidia specialized sterile cells that occur at hymenial surface in some mushrooms are absent capillitia a mass of thread like sterile fibers dispersed among spores are light brown and 3 7 um in diameter they are tapered thick walled with a narrow interior and either smooth or slightly encrusted similar species thumb right herbarium specimen geastrum pectinatum has been mistaken for morphologically similar but smaller species g latter species lacks vertical striations on basal portions of endoperidium and does not have a pseudoparenchymatous collar around stem another similar species g has a shorter stem and is missing ridges at base of spore sac further color of its spore sac is usually brown in contrast to gray blue of g pectinatum g xerophilum also has a dusting of white powder on surface of spore sac but unlike g pectinatum consistently lacks a ring at base of pedicel furthermore in contrast to g pectinatum spores of g xerophilum are yellow and contain oil drops that are readily observable with a microscope g striatum has smaller fruit bodies than g pectinatum and a distinct collar like apophysis sunhede 1898 p 426 distribution and habitat this species has been reported to grow solitary or in groups on sandy soil or rich composted soil in both mixed and coniferous forests often beneath cedars in hawaii it is usually found growing in duff under coastal casuarina and groves of cupressus species has been noted to occur in late summer and autumn in britain and europe but fruit bodies may dry and persist for some time geastrum pectinatum has a cosmopolitan distribution it has been reported from australia and new zealand africa congo south africa central america costa rica asia northeastern china and japan and south america brazil in europe it has been reported from belgium ireland germany netherlands norway and sweden in middle east it has been recorded in israel and turkey in north america it is known from united states including hawaii canada and mexico it is in red data book documenting rare and endangered species of latvia and is considered a threatened species in poland north american sources gives its frequency of appearance as rare but stellan sunhede in his 1989 monograph on geastraceae considers it one of most common earthstar mushrooms of northern europe sunhede 1898 p 294 calcium oxalate crystals calcium oxalate is a common crystalline compound found in many fungi including earthstars presence of calcium oxalate crystals apparent as a whitish powder on surface of spore sac has been verified for g pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy calcium oxalate crystals occur in tetragonal form known as a study on related species geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for characteristic opening dehiscence of outer peridial layers formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches layers of outer walls pushing apart inner and outer layers of peridium references cited literature external links botany cz geastrum pectinatum pers in czech
