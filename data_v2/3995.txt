call race tour de jersey he approached representatives of casinos in atlantic city for sponsorship and trump offered to be race s primary sponsor and packer s business partner in venture it was packer who suggested tour de trump name speaking at time of start of first tour de trump in may 1989 trump himself stated that when name was initially stated i practically fell out of my seat i said are you kidding i will get killed in media if i use that name you absolutely have to be kidding however trump reportedly changed his mind within 20 seconds and was convinced by commercial value of name trump s lawyers subsequently sent a cease and desist letter to organizers of a bike race held in aspen colorado called tour de rump letter stated you are using name and mark tour de rump in connection with an inaugural cycling event your use of that name and mark is likely to cause confusion and constitutes trademark infringement unfair competition and false designation of origin all in violation of

lawyers and tour de rump went ahead total prize money on offer for first event in 1989 was us 250 000 including 50 000 for winner of general classification this together with race s place in

july 1996 dupont announced that it was ending its sponsorship of race according to a brand manager for company over past six years tour dupont has been an excellent vehicle for promoting our products however we need to focus more on strategic markets in other parts of world where a sustained annual program versus a two week event can better leverage dupont brand equity for profitable growth race organizer mike plant explained that i talked to them a couple of months ago and they had to make a hard decision they don t have hundreds of millions of dollars to put into worldwide advertising they put a ton of money into this event and they built up a valuable franchise but like motorola corporations change way they do business plant reported that polling had showed that public recognition of event had grown significantly but also that awareness of who sponsored it had declined historian eric reed notes that a dupont marketing executive characterized initial sponsorship as a bargain and that company claimed that american press clippings generated by event weighed dupont executives also reported that they valued global media exposure as worth close to us 70 million reed quotes a dupont marketing executive as stating in 40 years in media relations i have never seen such concentrated sustained and positive media coverage however reed argues that despite this initial enthusiasm tour dupont s chronic weaknesses hamstrung event s growth citing its pro am status which prevented professional riders from being able to win world ranking points in event he also states that despite having an estimated worldwide television audience of 200 million american fan enthusiasm and roadside spectator interest in event failed to spike significantly dupont s withdrawal also came months after john dupont heir to du pont family fortune had been arrested for murder of olympic wrestler dave schultz at time of announcement of dupont s discontinuation of sponsorship mike plant reported that a 1997 event was tentatively scheduled for may 1 11 and that he had been in discussions with ten companies about potential title sponsorship of race past winners legacy organizers packer and
