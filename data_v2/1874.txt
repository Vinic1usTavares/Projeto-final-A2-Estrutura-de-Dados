producer paul lieberstein wrote stress relief stress relief was directed by jeffrey blitz and written by paul lieberstein who also plays toby flenderson on show episode originally aired on nbc in united states on february 1 2009 immediately after broadcast of super bowl xliii nbc decided to air office after super bowl rather than another show due to positive feedback series received from short promo commercials it aired during 2008 summer olympics some criticized decision to place an episode of office an already established nbc series after super bowl instead of a new show and suggested it meant network lacked any exceptional new material in writing script for episode lieberstein said he sought to appeal to newcomers to series and attract them to show without alienating regular viewers we wanted to do a stand alone comedy episode that could bring people in lieberstein said script drew less attention to long standing story arcs which new viewers would not understand lieberstein said it almost had an air of a pilot in a way where we had to reintroduce everything we wanted it to be extremely funny and extremely funny up front office creator greg daniels said he felt episode had to focus on physical comedy and easily accessible set pieces daniels said i looked at all shows that followed super bowl in years past and i feel that a comedy would be a good choice in current climate people want to laugh so we re trying our best to supply some laughs actor rainn wilson said of episode it s a great opportunity for people to revisit world of office and hopefully get into our style of comedy two parts of stress relief ran an hour long including commercials compared to typical half hour length of most office episodes since end of second season series had begun occasionally showing longer episodes which they dubbed super sized on special occasions unlike other episodes of office stress relief included an extended main title sequence that included names and images of entire supporting cast of series in order to afford them recognition in anticipation of high post super bowl viewership opening scene in which characters frantically scramble to escape dunder mifflin office due to what they believe is a fire took about a day and a half to shoot it took much longer than average 45 minutes of shooting time for a scene of that length due to amount of stunt work involved due to pressure of following super bowl actress jenna fischer said i don t think we ve ever worked so hard on an episode in history of our show office actor and writer b j novak who did not appear in stress relief said of episode it s awesome after this airs people are going to refer to super bowl as pre office football spectacular in anticipation of particularly high viewership due to super bowl nbc officials encouraged office producers to feature celebrity guest appearances in episode jack black jessica alba and cloris leachman all made guest appearances in stress relief as a result however they do not interact with cast and characters of office but rather appear separately in a bootleg film called mrs albert hannaday which characters watch within episode greg daniels said this was done because it helps keep show grounded and less like i love lucy lieberstein also said casting decision made sense because if we re just casting some salesman that comes into office and it s jack black it s hard to believe that stress relief marked black s fourth television appearance in five years he previously appeared in fox sitcom cracking up in 2004 comedy central series naked trucker and t bones show in 2004 and fox animated comedy series simpsons in 2007 steve carell said of leachman s performance she is that extra seasoning that extra spice to pot that makes for a delicious comedy gumbo cultural references just before dwight starts his fire simulation he said his co workers previously failed to listen because he made a presentation on computer program microsoft powerpoint of which he said powerpoint is boring michael refers to barack obama first african american president of united states to stanley while he is suffering a heart attack by shouting stanley barack is president you are black stanley a deleted scene further addresses obama s election with michael praising choice and darryl with darryl half jokingly telling caucasian office workers what will change for them they no longer have to pretend to like jazz and morgan freeman won t get any more acting work because he s more for you guys michael calls an employee from red cross an international humanitarian movement to conduct a lesson about cpr instructor suggests they pump heart to tune of stayin alive a disco song by pop band bee gees but michael mixes song up with i will survive by gloria gaynor at end of lesson dwight cuts face off cpr dummy and places it on his face in manner of hannibal lecter a fictional cannibalistic serial killer who cut face off a man and wore it as a mask in 1991 thriller film silence of lambs watching mrs albert hannaday andy says cloris leachman character was originally supposed to be played by much younger actress nicole kidman and last

office episode and called fire opening scene not only best office pre credits sequence ever but an all time sitcom classic sepinwall said stress relief was accessible to newcomers and regular viewers and displayed both comedic and human sides of characters he said only drawback of episode was mrs albert hannaday subplot which he felt was an unnecessary gimmick added solely to accommodate guest

everybody which he called a very satisfying ending to roast saga he called black leachman romance creepy and hilarious but described jim and pam romance subplot as weak link of episode david krone of los angeles daily news said although he had mixed feelings about fifth season so far he found stress relief to be one of season s best efforts krone specifically praised jim and pam subplot and dwight s character adding it s a pretty perfect way to unwind or if your team lost to become reanimated after super bowl rick ingebritson of palm beach post said episode was funny from start to finish particularly praising dwight schrute s role and michael scott roast however ingebritson said he was disgusted by leachman nude scene from mrs albert hannaday will leitch of new york magazine said episode was funny but curiously unfocused like two half hour episodes awkwardly spliced together he praised black leachman film trouble dwight kept getting in and jim and pam subplot which he called a rare pam jim plot point that worked however he called michael roast yet another michael wanting to be loved and still be boss subplot that takes over second half not all reviews were positive entertainment weekly writer whitney pastorek said episode started strong with fire scare scene but tapered off into a disjointed plot that she felt would not win new viewers she said many jokes went too long and lost momentum but nevertheless wrote a lot of episode s humor was engaging and smart lorenzo perez of news observer said pam subplot was overworked and lacked impact and dwight character was over top proving office writers clearly have no idea how to rein in dwight schrute perez also expressed doubt show would attract a new audience because it ran too late into night following super bowl however perez said he enjoyed black leachman cameos terry morrow of knoxville news sentinel said this particular visit to office doesn t pop like most episodes morrow praised black leachman film but said to be upstaged by a b plot one not involving show s main characters at all is a bit of a misdirection show doesn t need in a post super bowl time slot usa today critic robert bianco said plot was extremely thin and black and leachman cameos were humorless and grotesque bianco wrote unfortunately in an hour you get at most a handful of funny moments so if you want funny from a comedy look
