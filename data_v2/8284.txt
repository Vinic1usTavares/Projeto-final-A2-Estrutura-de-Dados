this ratings high would be surpassed by one angry veronica reviews episode received positive reviews rowan kaiser writing for a v club gave a glowing review saying that it had all components that a season premiere should have after praising many aspects of episode reviewer wrote what ties it all together though is a storytelling form that indicates complete confidence from show about what its viewers can deal with it s half present day half flashback but two different halves combined with veronica s voiceover combine to present information in pleasantly deceptive fashion price peterson of tv com also gave a positive review writing in his episode verdict that it s frankly amazing how much information this episode packed into 42 minutes while still feeling breezy and funny episode also ended with that breathtakingly horrifying ending a multiple death shocker that served to remind me just how murder lite season 1 was television without pity gave episode a b alan sepinwall wrote that season premiere was a little heavy on exposition while also commenting that same could be said about pilot episode sepinwall went on to state i m really enjoying all new storylines and characters cynthia fuchs of popmatters gave a positive review noting various new storylines and how characters especially veronica handled this new set of events like most adolescents veronica understands and anticipates this mix even if she doesn t always deal with it in most effective way even if you don t want to pick sides you re bound to be assessed as having done so and once you re labeled 09er or not you can either spend your time fighting rumors or finding alternative measures veronica so precociously and brilliantly aware of alternatives makes this familiar process seem worth pondering one
