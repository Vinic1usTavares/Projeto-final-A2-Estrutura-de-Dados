entertainment weekly ken tucker called episode at once cool looking heart tugging and pretty simple especially when compared to previous episodes like white tulip writing for a v club noel murray graded episode with an a explaining i can t really find anything to complain about here direction was effectively moody and snappy performances were sharp and case was cool murray praised subtle characteristics of parallel universe action scenes and use of split screens to visually show milo s predictions mtv s josh wigler believed that episode demonstrated how mystery of week format can still be compelling by taking everything familiar and applying a stark new layer of paint andrew hanson of los angeles times wrote third season of fringe continues to get better with each episode most importantly it has momentum it s moving forward with a distinct destination and even though i know fringe is heading somewhere i have no idea where that might be or what s going to happen when we get there boy if you re not watching fringe you re missing out sfscope contributor sarah stegall thought episode was similar to flowers for algernon but was skeptical of premise that milo could predict every event before they happened she criticized decision to make milo coldly calculating writing this is but another version of tired cliche of stoic intellectual intelligent person who has no heart or emotions why are we so afraid of smart people it always annoys me when science fiction writers of all people diss their own audience with idea that intellectuals are dangerous stegall was pleased to have first standalone episode of season explaining that it was first where she could relax and enjoy tying together of a standalone with a mythology theme was absolutely brilliant fearnet contributor alyse wax enjoyed episode but also thought idea that drugs could turn someone into a cartoonish evil genius is pretty farfetched many critics praised eklund and his character with one calling milo spindly intense and nicely chilling in a january 2011 article futon critic rated plateau twenty first best television episode of 2010 out of a list of fifty a v club ranked fringe 15th
