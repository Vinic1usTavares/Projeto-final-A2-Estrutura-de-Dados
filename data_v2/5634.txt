of a kind functions as a sequel of sorts to fifth season episode unusual suspects concluding a minor story arc featuring lone gunmen and susanne modeski woman who led to creation of trio hurwitz and knowles p 167 at time of filming for three of a kind david duchovny who portrays fox mulder was unavailable for filming because he was preparing his directing debut unnatural only david duchovny s voice appears in episode during a scene in which lone gunmen electronically synthesize it to convince scully to travel to las vegas to compensate for this loss co executive producers vince gilligan and john shiban decided to write an episode based around lone gunmen writers wanted to bring back several characters and unresolved plot lines mostly notably disappearance of susanne modeski who had last appeared in season five s unusual suspects gilligan explained i d been thinking a lot about what happened to susanne modeski what happened to her after she drove off with x in that mysterious car at end of unusual suspects gilligan and shiban soon formulated a plot that revolved around lone gunmen in las vegas las vegas just seemed a really good place to put these guys according to gilligan he explained first of all because idea of them running through a casino is instantly hilarious but other thing is that las vegas is in some ways most watched city in world meisler p 250 entire sub plot featuring susanne modeski caused a minor continuity error that had to be retconned bruce harwood actor who portrayed byers originally wore a wedding ring when he first portrayed character noting i d worn my wedding ring during first part of series so i imagined a married life for byers during filming of unusual suspects an episode that would largely feature byers feeling a romantic connection to susanne harwood removed his wedding ring deducing that in 1989 when episode took place byers had not been married yet however three of a kind which takes place in 1999 features byers once again romantically drawn to susanne harwood explained and then producers brought back character suzanne modeski back in season six and that was supposed to be in present so i had to redo my back story i said byers had been divorced filming despite worries about going over budget fox allowed production crew of x files to film on location in las vegas making city one of few to effectively play itself in series however only two days were allotted for las vegas and majority of episode was filmed in california at century plaza and park hyatt hotels in fact gillian anderson herself never had to leave los angeles location manager ilt jones noted that x files crew s desire to film on location at various hotels in las vegas caused a bidding war we went down this list of forty or fifty hotels known to be film friendly at first reaction was sort of lukewarm then all of a sudden someone realized that this was x files for heavens sake seen by i can t tell you how many millions then this huge bidding war broke out eventually monte carlo resort and casino was selected for shooting hotel gave x files crew permission to film anywhere in hotel during day hours as well as full access to hotel s illuminated message board in exchange for a special billing in credits denoting production assistance provided by and inclusion of shots featuring hotel s name in episode meisler p 251 broadcast and

gotten into scully tonight when scully hits vegas you ll see a side of her you ve never seen before episode received mostly mixed reviews from critics with many noting that episode served as a stop gap robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to x files millennium lone gunmen rated three of a kind two and a half stars out of five calling episode likeable and good natured and utterly redundant this passes forty five minutes pleasantly enough but you ll be hard pushed to remember them afterwards shearman and pearson p 185 paula vitaris from cinefantastique gave episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two and a half stars out of four vitaris noted that episode did an adequate job but all in all this is a filler episode more substitutes than real thing tom kessenich in his book examination an unauthorized look at seasons 6 9 of x files wrote that three of a kind took premise of lone gunmen and ran with it offering up a quasi entertaining effort that indulges trio s paranoia banishes mulder from sight and offers up a very flirtatious dana scully it was all cute and harmless kinda like lone gunmen themselves kessenich p 64 zack handlen of a v club awarded episode a b and called it second part of a story which didn t really need one but also noted that laid back let s just hang out and have some fun vibe of episode made entry very very easy to watch furthermore he praised scene wherein scully is drugged calling it hilarious and glorious footnotes bibliography external links category 1999 american television
