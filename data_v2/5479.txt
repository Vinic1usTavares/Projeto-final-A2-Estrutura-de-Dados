extractable power available from wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources axel kleidon of max planck institute in germany carried out a top down calculation on how much wind energy there is starting with incoming solar radiation that drives winds by creating temperature differences in atmosphere he concluded that somewhere between 18 tw and 68 tw could be extracted cristina archer and mark z jacobson presented a bottom up estimate which unlike kleidon s are based on actual measurements of wind speeds and found that there is 1700 tw of wind power at an altitude of 100 metres over land and sea of this between 72 and 170 tw could be extracted in a practical and cost competitive manner they later estimated 80 tw however research at harvard university estimates

stability induction generators which were often used for wind power projects in 1980s and 1990s require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances so extensive modelling of dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults in particular induction generators cannot support system voltage during faults unlike steam or hydro turbine driven synchronous generators induction generators aren t used in current turbines instead most turbines use variable speed

cheap power will lead to increased rates a 2005 energy law gave energy department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on but after an attempt to use this authority senate

because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards these are important issues that need to be solved as when transmission

generator relative to turbine s swept area a small generator would be cheaper and achieve a higher capacity factor but would produce less electric power and thus less profit in high winds conversely a large generator would cost more but generate little extra power and depending on type may stall out at low wind speed thus an optimum capacity factor of around 40 50 would be aimed for a 2008 study

could require an increase in already existing energy demand management load shedding storage solutions or system interconnection with hvdc cables fluctuations in load and allowance for failure of large fossil fuel generating units requires operating reserve capacity which can be increased to compensate for variability of wind generation wind power is variable and during low wind periods it

sources such as wind power is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which when scheduled to be operating may be able to deliver their nameplate capacity around 95 of time

following power around clock and throughout year entirely from renewable sources predictability wind power forecasting methods are used but predictability of any particular wind farm is low for short term operation for any particular generator there is an 80 chance that wind output will change less than 10 in an hour and a 40 chance that it will change 10 or more in 5 hours however studies by graham sinden 2009 suggest that in practice variations in thousands of wind turbines spread out over several different sites and wind regimes are smoothed as distance between sites increases correlation between wind speeds measured at those sites decreases thus while output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas average power output becomes less variable and more predictable wind power hardly ever suffers major technical failures since failures of individual wind turbines have hardly any effect on overall power so that distributed wind power is reliable and predictable whereas conventional generators while far less variable can suffer major unpredictable outages energy storage thumb right sir adam beck generating complex at niagara falls canada includes a large pumped storage hydroelectricity reservoir during hours of low electrical demand excess electrical grid power is used to pump water up into reservoir which then provides an extra 174 mw of electric power during periods of peak demand typically conventional hydroelectricity complements wind power very well when wind is blowing strongly nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water when wind drops they can provided they have generation capacity rapidly increase production to compensate this gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water alternatively where a suitable head of water is not available pumped storage hydroelectricity or other forms of grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high wind periods and release it when needed type of storage needed depends on wind penetration level low penetration requires daily storage and high penetration requires both short and long term storage as long as a month or more stored energy increases economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset cost and losses of storage for example in uk 1 7 gw dinorwig pumped storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks and allows base load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently although pumped storage power systems are only about 75 efficient and have high installation costs their low running costs and ability to reduce required electrical base load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs in particular geographic regions peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power in u s states of california and texas for example hot days in summer may have low wind speed and high electrical demand due to use of air conditioning some utilities subsidize purchase of geothermal heat pumps by their customers to reduce electric power demand during summer months by making air conditioning up to 70 more efficient widespread adoption of this technology would better match electric power demand to wind availability in areas with hot summers and low summer winds a possible future option may be to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an hvdc super grid in u s it is estimated that to upgrade transmission system to take in planned or potential renewables would cost at least usd 60

credit can be applied instead of receiving ptc another tax benefit is accelerated depreciation many american states also provide incentives such as exemption from property tax mandated purchases and additional markets for green credits energy improvement and extension act of 2008 contains extensions of credits for wind including countries such as canada and germany also provide incentives for wind turbine construction such as tax credits or minimum purchase prices for wind generation with assured grid access sometimes referred to as feed in tariffs these feed in tariffs are typically set well above average electric power prices in december 2013 u s senator lamar alexander and other republican senators argued that wind energy production tax credit should be allowed to expire at end of 2013 and it expired 1 january 2014 for new installations secondary market forces also provide incentives for businesses to use wind generated power even if there is a premium price for electricity for example socially responsible manufacturers pay utility companies a premium that goes to subsidize and build new wind power infrastructure companies use wind generated power and in return they can claim that they are undertaking strong green efforts in us organization green e monitors business compliance with these renewable energy credits turbine prices have fallen significantly in recent years due to tougher competitive conditions such as increased use of energy auctions and elimination of subsidies in many markets for example vestas a wind turbine manufacturer whose largest onshore
