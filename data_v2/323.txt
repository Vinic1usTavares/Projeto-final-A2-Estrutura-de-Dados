richard wright began improvising new material in sessions at remodelled britannia row studios they recruited bassist guy pratt who had joined them on their momentary lapse of reason tour according to mason pratt s playing influenced mood of music without legal problems that had dogged production of their 1987 album a momentary lapse of reason gilmour was at ease if he felt band were making progress he would record them on a two track dat recorder at one point gilmour surreptitiously recorded wright playing capturing material that formed basis for three pieces of music after about two weeks band had around 65 pieces of music with engineer andy jackson and co producer bob ezrin production moved to gilmour s houseboat and recording studio astoria band voted on each track and whittled material down to about 27 pieces eliminating some tracks and merging others they arrived at about 11 songs song selection was based upon a system of points whereby all three members would award marks out of ten to each candidate song a system skewed by wright awarding his songs ten points each and others none wright having been fired by bassist roger waters in 1970s was not contractually a full member of band which upset him wright reflected it came very close to a point where i wasn t going to do album because i didn t feel that what we d agreed was fair wright received his first songwriting credits on any pink floyd album since 1975 s wish you were here gilmour s fiancee author polly samson also received songwriting credits initially her role was limited to providing encouragement for gilmour but she helped him write high hopes a song about gilmour s childhood in cambridge she co wrote a further six songs which did not sit well with ezrin in an interview for mojo magazine gilmour said that samson s contributions had ruffled management s feathers but ezrin later reflected that her presence had been inspirational for gilmour and that she pulled whole album together she also helped gilmour who following his divorce had developed a cocaine addiction keyboardist jon carin percussionist gary wallis and backing vocalists including sam brown and momentary lapse tour singer durga mcbroom were brought in before recording began band moved to olympic studios and recorded most of tracks over space of a week after a summer break they returned to astoria to record more backing tracks ezrin worked on drum sounds and pink floyd collaborator michael kamen provided string arrangements which were recorded at abbey road studio two by steve mclaughlin dick parry played saxophone on his first pink floyd album for almost 20 years on wearing inside out and chris thomas created final mix between september and december recording and mixing sessions were held at metropolis studios in chiswick and creek recording studios in london in september pink floyd performed at a celebrity charity concert at cowdray house in midhurst album was mastered at mastering lab in los angeles by doug sax and james guthrie jackson edited unused material from division bell sessions described by mason as ambient music into an hour long composition tentatively titled big spliff return of parts of something making of endless river by daryl easlea prog october 2014 pp 38 45 but pink floyd decided not to release it some of big spliff was used to create band s next album endless river 2014 instrumentation with aid of gilmour s guitar technician phil taylor carin located some of pink floyd s older keyboards from storage including a farfisa organ sounds sampled from these instruments were used on take it back and marooned carin was joined on keyboards by ezrin durga mcbroom supplied backing vocals alongside sam brown carol kenyon jackie sheridan and rebecca leigh white what do you want from me is influenced by chicago blues and poles apart contains folksy overtones gilmour s improvised guitar solos on marooned used a whammy pedal to pitch shift guitar notes over an octave on take it back he used a gibson j 200 guitar through a zoom effects unit played with an ebow an electronic device which produces sounds similar to a bow themes division bell deals with themes of communication and idea that talking can solve many problems in studio radio host suggested that album offered very real possibility of transcending it all through shivering moments of grace songs such as poles apart and lost for words have been interpreted by fans and critics as references to estrangement between pink floyd and former band member roger waters who left in 1985 however gilmour denied this and said people can invent and relate to a song in their personal ways but it s a little late at this point for us to be conjuring roger up title refers to division bell rung in british parliament to announce a vote drummer nick mason said it s about people making choices or produced a few years after collapse of eastern bloc a great day for freedom juxtaposes general euphoria of fall of berlin wall with subsequent wars and ethnic cleansing particularly in yugoslavia audio samples of stephen hawking originally recorded for a bt television advertisement were used in keep talking liner notes from echoes gilmour was so moved by hawking s sentiment in advert that he contacted advertising company for permission to use recordings mason said it felt politically incorrect to take ideas from advertising but it seemed a very relevant piece at end of album gilmour s stepson charlie is heard hanging up telephone receiver on pink floyd manager steve o rourke who had pleaded to be allowed to appear on a pink floyd album title and packaging to avoid competing against other album releases as had happened with a momentary lapse pink floyd set a deadline of april

number of tickets sold at over 5 3 million and gross income at about 100 million a live album pulse and a concert video also named pulse were released in june 1995 critical reception tom sinclair of entertainment weekly wrote that avarice is only conceivable explanation for this glib vacuous cipher of an album which is notable primarily for its stomach turning merger of progressive rock pomposity and new age noodling rolling stone tom graves criticised gilmour s performance stating that his guitar solos had settled into rambling indistinct asides that are as forgettable as they used to be indelible only on what do you want from me does gilmour sound like he cares roger waters who left pink floyd in 80s dismissed division bell as just rubbish nonsense from beginning to end album won grammy for best rock instrumental performance on marooned division bell was nominated for 1995 brit award for best album by a british artist but lost to blur s parklife in uncut s 2011 pink floyd ultimate music guide graeme thomson wrote that division bell might just be dark horse of floyd canon opening triptych of songs is a hugely impressive return to something very close to eternal essence
