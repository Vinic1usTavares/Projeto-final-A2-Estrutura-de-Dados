engadget agreed that apple fulfilled most of promises stated on its website such as better battery performance two times graphics performance and two times faster david pogue of new york times considered 4 inch retina display a nice but not life changing change and praised lightning connector for its size sturdiness and reversibility while noting its lack of support for older accessories

carried on in iphone 5s and iphone se was regarded as long been golden child of apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general while succeeding iphone 6 6s design was less critically acclaimed as it felt a little bit wrong as though you were holding a slick 650 bar of soap wired described iphone 5 as elegance rooted in way aluminum and glass work together it felt streamlined yet substantial which is different from iphone 6 which feels substantial in size alone plus unlike ubiquitous rounded corners of 6 iphone 5 didn t really look like anything else on market at time however iphone 5 s design was not suited to scaling up in contrast to iphone 6 6s which could better accommodate growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned 6 6s plus models

5 consumer reports found that purple haze effect occurred on several other manufacturers phones including samsung galaxy s iii and motorola droid maxx and that it was not less pronounced on iphone 4s report concluded that digital cameras in general including higher end can all suffer from lens flare in which a purple tinted effect was not uncommon problems thumb example of an iphone 5 with chipped coating there were anecdotal claims of iphone 5 s coating chipping off exposing bright aluminium underneath apple executive s response to email correspondence from an affected customer summarized that it was normal for aluminum to scratch term a reference to which affected iphone 4 was applied by various sources such as cnet yahoo news and all things digital to describe scuffing issue some users

billion at an annual rate shortly after announcement of iphone 5 and preceding launch apple s stock price rose to a record 705 07 but within three months fell to 507 48 according to analysis of eric apple s stock decline and resulting losses were not result of any issue with new maps application but disappointed investors he points to initial hardware sales of only five million compared to projections up to twice that as primary cause since release of iphone 5 discounts on previous generation iphones have enabled apple to maintain a market lead in united states and japan but iphone
