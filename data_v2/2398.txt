to sark was treated by her father as if she were a boy she was lame due to unequal leg length but that did not prevent him from insisting on teaching her to shoot sail and climb cliffs he never

france and united kingdom she learned standard french and local dialect of norman language first marriage at age of 15 collings fell in love with dudley beaumont a british painter who could neither

chickens upon her accession new dame immediately reasserted her feudal rights and even noted they always give me and oldest chickens some islanders complained about sark being last remnant of feudalism in europe but dame maintained that agriculture had to be encouraged to make island more self sufficient she used island s unique feudal system to draw tourists and refused to allow anything to deter them by ruining its peacefulness she thus banned motor vehicles and holiday camps but chief pleas refused to pass an ordinance that would forbid selling alcohol to anyone known to get drunk like her eldest son francis heir apparent to seigneurship she was fascinated by film production while appointment with venus was being shot on sark in 1951 dame even deigned to allow a car ashore ostensibly believing that a land rover was some sort of senior boy scout in autumn 1929 dame was on her way to a holiday in united states when she met robert hathaway an american born former army aviator on 5 november following her return from united states and a twelve day long courtship they married at st marylebone parish church robert was not aware that marriage made him jure uxoris

meetings as seigneur she accompanied him to give advice lecture tours in united states aided by her second husband s connections were part of her efforts to promote tourism and bring more revenue to island second world war hathaway s tenure as seigneur was interrupted by german occupation of channel islands in second world war from 3 july 1940 until 8 may 1945 while some inhabitants of other channel islands were evacuated hathaway declared that she would not leave her island and prevailed upon all native born islanders to remain as well hathaway appears to have believed that germans would either never come to island or that their stay would be brief most of her tenants bitterly resented her for decision to remain on sark during ensuing five years of occupation but thanked her after war when they saw how total evacuation destroyed neighbouring island of alderney dame had her senior official meet german officers at harbour and escort them to her residence where her maid announced them as if they were guests thumb left proclamation of liberation of channel islands hathaway was much respected by islanders as well as by germans whose language she spoke perfectly for leadership she gave during this period and british home secretary herbert morrison observed that she remained almost wholly mistress of situation throughout occupation hathaway was on friendly terms with eugen furst zu oettingen wallerstein german commander stationed in guernsey as indicated by their warm correspondence she wrote of him as a charming man and noted that they had many friends in common many other german officers in charge of channel islands were also of noble extraction and hathaway exploited their stiff german formality by making it clear that she expected to be treated with rigid etiquette to which they were accustomed in their own country she insisted that officers come to her rather than other way around and expected them to bow kiss her hand and bow again before she allowed them to take a seat using her influence with prince of oettingen wallerstein she was able to get german army physician stationed in sark to treat her sick tenants when germans ordered that all sarkese be instructed in german dame offered a room in her residence as a classroom for children of island hathaway s eldest son francis and his wife mary were killed during liverpool blitz his son michael became first in line to inherit island her husband was deported to ilag vii in laufen in bavaria in february 1943 where he remained for rest of war he did not sign any document delegating his seigneurial authority which meant that legality of ordinances issued by hathaway during this period was at best questionable she refused to sign orders issued by germans arguing that they were simply not hers to sign she was insulted by an order that prohibited sexual relations between her tenants and german troops on grounds of venereal disease outbreak since order implied that sarkese women consorted with germans on other hand it appears that she did not voice objection to a series of antisemitic orders that had been previously issued and which concerned her czech jewish friend annie islanders suffered shortage of food in last months of occupation hathaway organised a raid on german grain stocks and saved many families from starvation with her secret potato hoard sark was liberated on 10 may 1945 three british officers arrived and explaining that no british troops were available asked dame to take command of 275 men belonging to defeated german garrison she made sure garrison cleared up island of land mines she was however so concerned about legal status of decisions she had issued during war that she sailed to guernsey to validate them as soon as island was liberated her experience of german occupation inspired william douglas home s play dame of sark hathaway s manner of receiving germans has been described as both impressive and overly cordial postwar years thumb harbour regarded by hathaway as a great success photographed in 1968 following war hathaway continued to promote sark s tourist trade and advocated building a new harbour in 1949 she and her husband welcomed princess elizabeth duchess of edinburgh later queen elizabeth ii and duke of edinburgh who opened new harbour same year hathaway became officer of order of british empire sibyl and robert hathaway s happy marriage ended with his death in 1954 six years after death of her eldest child bridget hathaway a widow once again regained her complete authority over island in 1957 queen elizabeth ii and duke of edinburgh returned to sark this was first time a reigning monarch had ever come to island hathaway rendered homage to queen on that occasion first time that ceremony was

hathaway was made dame commander of order of british empire at buckingham palace she then jokingly referred to herself as a double dame however soon after her quatercentenary her daughter douce briscoe died in 1967 having struggled with alcoholism for a long time in 1969 hathaway became increasingly worried by royal commission on constitution s intrusion into her affairs at same time she had a sharp dispute with chief pleas claiming that its members violated laws they themselves had passed and that their misconduct threatened to make her tourism campaign futile she shocked islanders by announcing her intention to resign charter of island back to crown in somewhat same way as hereditary le mesurier family did in alderney and to recommend that government be taken over by guernsey threat was effective regulations were suddenly enforced much more strictly by beginning of next year hathaway retracted her announcement having been persuaded by an enormous number of letters and requests death cyril beaumont died in 1973 becoming fifth child dame sibyl outlived early next year 90 year old gave her approval for stage presentation of william douglas home s play dame of sark
