insistence on establishing arab command over army and his influence with hussein led latter to dismiss glubb pasha and appoint abu nuwar in his place however abu nuwar s ardent support for pan arabist policies of egyptian president gamal abdel nasser contributed to jordan s increasing isolation from uk and us which were major sources of foreign aid to jordan at same time existing dissatisfaction

principal accounts emerged regarding events at zarqa with royalist version holding that incident was an abortive coup by abu nuwar against hussein and dissident version asserting that it was a staged

jordan which was formed out of transjordan and west bank as a result of 1948 war israeli gains during war had caused an upswing in anti colonialist and arab nationalist militancy among numerous officers in arab armies who blamed their political and military leadership for israeli victories they considered old guard incompetent corrupt and beholden to colonial powers among these incensed officers was abu nuwar although he was not a founder of free officers a baathist affiliated underground organization of anti british jordanian officers he joined group after being invited in 1950 following his return to jordan abu nuwar became a vociferous critic of british aid to jordan viewing it as a form of dependency on jordan s former colonial ruler and of glubb pasha influential british officer in charge of arab legion who was derided by arab nationalists as a symbol of lingering british colonialism in jordan shlaim pp 64 65 when abdullah i was assassinated in 1951 glubb and prime minister tawfik abu al huda s government discussed preventing abdullah s son and heir apparent emir talal a sympathizer of free officers from being enthroned talal had been checked into a mental institution in switzerland but many free officers believed british were fabricating talal s mental illness to keep him out of jordan in response abu nuwar sought to install talal on throne by force and to that end he appealed for support from free officers and sent awni hannun a jordanian military doctor to bring talal to jordan massad 2001 pp 170 171 however hannun was forbidden from meeting talal due to visitation restrictions and was dismissed by glubb for alleged incitement against british interests nonetheless talal was enthroned and abu nuwar subsequently urged him to dismiss glubb

nuwar was keen to gain hussein s favor and disseminate to him arab nationalist ideas calling for an end to british influence in jordanian military shlaim 2007 p 65 hussein was enthused by abu nuwar and after his enthronement in may 1953 hussein attempted to have abu nuwar return to jordan despite glubb s reservations in august hussein visited london where he invited abu nuwar and other like minded officers including free officer shahir abu shahut to meet with him massad 2001 pp 172 173 there abu shahut informed abu nuwar of free officers plans to arab legion i e remove force s british leadership including glubb afterward abu nuwar informed hussein at a party celebrating his enthronement that he was a leading member of free officers though he was not and communicated group s desire to assert arab command over arab legion an aim to which hussein was receptive hussein was impressed by abu nuwar who vocally condemned british presence in jordan during party which earned abu nuwar cheers by jordanian officers aide de camp after hussein returned to amman he continued to press for abu nuwar s return to jordan but glubb consistently stalled efforts to reassign abu nuwar later in 1953 hussein sent abu nuwar to confer with strongman of egypt gamal abdel nasser who had recently toppled his country s pro british monarchy massad 2001 p 173 in 1954 abu nuwar was briefly brought to amman for consultations with hussein hussein ultimately bypassed glubb and had abu nuwar permanently reassigned to jordan in november 1955 abu nuwar arrived amid growing anti british upheaval massad 2001 pp 174 175 in a meeting between glubb and abu nuwar glubb made clear his displeasure with hussein s decision and threatened shorten his abu nuwar s life if he incited against british interests in country after being informed of meeting hussein appointed abu nuwar as his senior aide de camp adc abu nuwar was also promoted to lieutenant colonel as adc abu nuwar was a major influence over then 20 year old hussein and was constantly at his side advising hussein to dismiss glubb and sever ties with british shlaim 2007 p 101 hussein was also influenced by other arab nationalist officers and personalities including his cousin zaid ibn shaker and increasingly anti imperialist and arab nationalist political atmosphere in country shlaim 2007 pp 101 102 as a sign of his increasing nationalism and as a means to quiet political opposition to his rule hussein decided to dismiss glubb anderson 2005 pp 167 168 he coordinated with abu nuwar and other free officers to ensure that his impending dismissal of glubb would not result in a revolt by latter s supporters within arab legion anderson 2005 p 167 thus on 28 february 1956 abu nuwar was instructed to ready his troops and he subsequently posted free officers at amman airport major army base at zarqa and in vicinity of glubb pasha s amman residence after abu nuwar s positions were confirmed to him hussein conferred with his cabinet and dismissed glubb on 1 march glubb complied with order and departed jordan following day hussein then promoted abu nuwar to major colonel and appointed major general radi annab to glubb s former position as chief of staff of arab legion shlaim 2007 p 107 which was concurrently renamed jordanian armed forces chief of staff thumb right abu nuwar shaking hands with egyptian president gamal abdel nasser right in egypt 1956 abu nuwar was an advocate of nasser s pan arabist policies on 24 may abu nuwar was appointed as chairman of joint chiefs of staff following annab s retirement glubb s dismissal was met with great enthusiasm among jordan s inhabitants and arab nationalists in and outside of country shlaim 2007 pp 106 107 anderson 2005 p 168 however abu nuwar s ascendancy as head of army was resented by its veteran bedouin units he was generally regarded as a competent staff officer but did not have experience as a commander pearson 2010 p 95 as part of his efforts to modernize army he mandated that education was a prerequisite for advancement an act which disproportionately affected bedouin officers many of whom lacked formal education massad 2001 pp 186 187 as a result of abu nuwar s measure several senior bedouin officers were retired or reassigned to non command posts to counterbalance opposition to him within army s ranks abu nuwar established fourth infantry brigade which mostly consisted of palestinians who he believed would form an integral part of his power base within military abu nuwar s appointment also contributed to increasing deterioration of ties between jordan and british government as chief of staff abu nuwar embraced many of pan arabist and anti imperialist ideas of nasser who became president of egypt in 1956 pappe 1994 pp 68 69 abu nuwar communicated his support for nasser and arab nationalist ba ath party which was active in syria and jordan during a meeting with lebanese president and nasser opponent camille chamoun in 1956 pappe 1994 p 172 an american embassy official in jordan remarked that during a discussion with abu nuwar latter out nasser he was regarded as an ultranationalist by central intelligence agency cia according to historian ivan pearson american diplomatic and intelligence views were colored by negative perceptions of abu nuwar in israel and abu nuwar s role in dismissal of prime minister samir al rifai in may rifai was seen by israelis as a counterbalance to hussein s arab nationalist advisers and abu nuwar maneuvered to sideline rifai soon after glubb s dismissal abu nuwar was a major opponent of iraq s hashemite rulers relatives of hussein and that country s pro british prime minister nuri al said abu nuwar s opposition was driven by suspicions that iraqis sought to oust him from his military post while king abd al ilah and al said mutually regarded abu nuwar with suspicion abu nuwar s influence with hussein was likely a major reason jordan resisted iraqi attempts to merge two hashemite ruled countries suez crisis thumb right abu nowar as chief of staff walking between hussein and syrian president shukri al quwatli in late 1956 in late 1956 parliamentary elections in jordan resulted in major victories for arab nationalist and other left leaning parties hussein subsequently appointed suleiman nabulsi an arab nationalist socialist and one of leading pro nasser mp elects as prime minister in october pearson 2010 p 97 roughly coinciding with nabulsi s appointment british french and israelis launched a tripartite invasion of suez canal and sinai peninsula of egypt mainly in response to nasser s nationalization of suez canal company among other reasons hussein declared a state of emergency and his opposition against invasion and agreed to egyptian chief of staff abdel hakim amer s request for jordanian military intervention shlaim 2007 p 119 to that end hussein instructed abu nuwar to immediately execute amer s order to launch operation beisan which entailed a jordanian syrian armored invasion of israeli coastal plain which was seen as israel s most vulnerable region due to short length between coast and jordanian held west bank however abu nuwar viewed operation as far too risky for jordanian army and advised hussein to await syria s adherence to plan egypt syria and jordan had formed a defense pact days before israeli occupation of sinai on 29 october pearson 2010 p 98 nabulsi also hesitated to abide by hussein s orders prompting a meeting of hussein abu nuwar and jordanian cabinet to assess situation shlaim 2007 pp 119 120 according to then public works minister anwar al khatib s recollections abu nuwar argued that his troops would quickly lose control of hebron and nablus regions to israel but would defend jerusalem to last man and last drop of blood shlaim 2007 p 120 hussein s eagerness to aid egypt was tempered by abu nuwar s assessment but he only relented in his attempted intervention after nasser communicated to hussein appreciation of his genuine support and a warning not to risk losing jordanian army to far stronger israeli military shlaim 2007 pp 120 121 later in his life abu nuwar had stated that he had been ready to give israelis a very rough time in 1956 but only dissuaded hussein when nasser counseled king against intervention after which abu nuwar told hussein that attacking israel while egyptians had withdrawn from sinai would be suicide shlaim 2007 p 122 during suez crisis hussein requested that syria saudi arabia and iraq send troops to jordan as a precautionary measure to prevent a potential invasion of country by tripartite allies prime minister al said was reticent to put iraqi troops under abu nuwar s command and suggested that abu nuwar be dismissed as a prerequisite to any deployment of troops to jordan pearson 2010 p 99 this did not occur but iraqis nonetheless sent troops to jordan however their deployment was opposed by nabulsi on grounds that iraq was a member of baghdad pact an alliance of middle eastern countries with uk that was condemned by arab nationalists as a british led attempt to stifle pan arab unity instead of egyptian jordanian syrian saudi alliance known as amman pact despite hussein s protestations nabulsi using his prerogative as head of government succeeded in forcing iraqis withdrawal by end of november support for pan arab unity on 19 january 1957 jordan signed arab solidarity agreement asa with saudi arabia egypt and syria which entailed those countries financial assistance to replace annual british aid to jordan that ended with abrogation of anglo jordanian treaty in november 1956 treaty was officially and mutually abrogated in march 1957 pearson 2010 p 102 anderson 2005 p 179 however implementation of asa was hindered by egypt and syria s inability or unwillingness to subsidize jordanian army whose budget rivaled that of their own armies pearson 2010 pp 102 103 furthermore by then abu nuwar was steadily losing hussein s confidence due to dissatisfaction with abu nuwar among army brass and negative effects that his anti western hostility was having on relations with jordan s principal western allies uk and us hussein viewed latter two as much needed alternatives of financial support to jordan in lieu of his disappointment with asa pearson 2010 p 103 meanwhile serious divisions emerged in jordanian state over reactions to eisenhower doctrine pearson 2010 pp 104 105 which ostensibly aimed to stem soviet expansion in middle east but was viewed by arab nationalists as a neo colonialist ploy to control region nabulsi and foreign minister abdullah rimawi a baathist led camp opposing doctrine as a threat to arab sovereignty and as means to control region s oil assets and support israel while hussein publicly embraced doctrine as a preventive measure against growing communist influence in country prior to these disagreements nabulsi had been clamping down on communist literature and influence in press communists were generally opposed by arab nationalists whilst attempting to establish diplomatic relations with soviet union ussr without hussein s knowledge to that end he dispatched abu nuwar to moscow in february 1957 to serve as an initial contact with soviets later nabulsi publicly declared his intention to establish relations with ussr and pursue a political union with egypt and syria and requested from hussein a confirmation of his dismissal of several royalist officials hussein responded by forcing nabulsi to resign on 10 april 1957 anderson 2005 p 182 alleged coup attempt and resignation thumb right king hussein addressing jordanian troops as chief of staff abu nuwar observes sometime in 1956 amid political chaos in jordan and two days before nabulsi s resignation an army unit from first armoured brigade commanded by captain rashid engaged in a maneuver named operation hashem in honor of hashemite royal family at major intersections of amman move raised hussein s suspicions and prompted him to order abu nuwar to withdraw unit which he did anderson 2005 pp 182 183 hussein believed move was a presage to an impending coup anderson 2005 p 183 abu nuwar sought to allay hussein s concerns and told him it was a routine exercise executed numerous times in preceding years to monitor traffic into and out of city shlaim 2007 p 132 while rashid later claimed it was part of a broader contingency plan to move troops to west bank in event of an israeli invasion according to pearson rashid s maneuver was meant to intimidate hussein pearson 2010 p 105 while historian betty anderson has speculated that officers could have been testing waters to see what they could achieve militarily whatever actual reason for maneuver it heightened hussein s suspicions of a coup by abu nuwar and arab nationalists and it prompted warnings from veteran royalist officials namely bahjat al talhouni and sharif naser that such a coup was impending on 13 april rioting broke out at army barracks in zarqa which contained largest concentration of troops in country between mostly non bedouin units loyal to abu nuwar and bedouin dominated units loyal to hussein two main accounts emerged regarding this incident known as zarqa uprising among other names with one account having been advanced by hussein and western and other by political dissidents and many in jordanian and arab press pearson 2010 p 106 pearson has said incident is steeped in mystery and persistent controversy and anderson likewise has written that questions abound about whether this coup attempt originated with military led by abu nuwar and free officers or with king and americans who wanted an excuse to remove arab nationalist movement from jordan s political scene according to hussein s account of events abu nuwar and free officers had planned for bedouin dominated first infantry regiment in zarqa to participate in a training exercise in desert without ammunition to render it unavailable for hussein to use against a planned anti government demonstration scheduled to be held by nabulsi on 14 april hussein was still wary of nabulsi due to an alleged intercept of a message from nasser imploring nabulsi to resist his dismissal from premiership dann 1989 p 59 shlaim 2007 p 135 hussein was informed of free officers alleged plot by sharif naser and bedouin officers from zarqa on evening of 13 april incident coincided with a delivery by abu nuwar of an ultimatum to prime minister said al mufti nabulsi s successor warning hussein to appoint a government reflecting will of elected parliament or face an army revolt al mufti apparently broke down emotionally in hussein s presence prompting latter to inquire from abu nuwar about ultimatum to which abu nuwar professed his surprise hussein then brought abu nuwar along with him to inspect scene at zarqa where hussein was told by loyalist officers from zarqa that rumors of his death had provoked heavy clashes between his loyalists and those of abu nuwar and that only physical presence of hussein would put an end to fighting moreover hussein was told that rashid and ma an abu nuwar a distant cousin of abu nuwar had been ordered to amman to besiege royal palace and arrest hussein both accounts agree that during fighting in al zarqa numerous free officers were rounded up and arrested by loyalist bedouin officers both accounts also agree that as hussein made his way into zarqa he was cheered on by loyalist soldiers and he intervened in middle of clashes at his own risk and was emotionally embraced by his supporters who chanted death to abu nuwar and all traitors abu nuwar remained in car fearful for his life by hussein s loyalist troops and he then apparently begged hussein to protect him and allow him to return to amman which hussein agreed to by nightfall abu nuwar persuaded hussein to allow him to leave country and on morning of 14 march he officially resigned and departed for damascus syria with his family major general ali al hiyari abu nuwar s chief rival in jordanian army pearson 2010 p 107 was appointed as abu nuwar s replacement but on 20 april dann 1989 p 60 he defected to syria al hiyari claimed that prior to incident at zarqa and shortly after forced resignation of al nabulsi s cabinet palace officials had canvassed army general staff to inquire about officers opinions regarding a change in direction of new government away from pan arabist policies of egypt and syria accordingly when abu nuwar and free officers voiced their refusal to use army against popular will in country palace officials laid out plans to royalist officers including al hiyari for a false flag operation at zarqa al hiyari s account was widely reported throughout jordan and arab world and despite dismissal of account by palace officials it led to further public skepticism toward official version of events regarding alleged coup plot abu nuwar consistently denied any betrayal of hussein and claimed he was a fall man victim of political intrigue in kingdom in which his rivals sought to discredit him shlaim 2007 pp 135 136 at a press conference in damascus massad 2001 p 196 he stated that entire incident was an overreaction by hussein to sensational and false reports of a coup plot and that incident was likely a preemptive coup by hussein and old guard supported or engineered by us intelligence against main proponents of pan arab unity in jordan pearson 2010 pp 106 107 rashid and ma an abu nuwar likewise strongly denied any kind of coup plot on their end according to pearson accounts of free officers and al hiyari were lent further credence by lack of evidence in military trials against alleged conspirators who were arrested light sentences that they were given and eventual rehabilitation of alleged conspirators including abu nuwar who were later reassigned to high ranking posts in state and military later career on 22 april abu nuwar issued a radio statement from cairo based voice of arabs radio station denouncing hussein pearson 2010 p 109 in coordination with abu nuwar following day a patriotic congress composed of hussein s opposition was held in nablus in west bank demanding major palace officials be dismissed expulsion of american ambassador and military attache rejection of eisenhower doctrine federal unity with egypt and syria and reinstatement of dismissed army officers including abu nuwar as a result of congress hussein put nablus jerusalem and amman under military curfew dissolved political parties imposed press censorship dismissed municipal councils in west bank in favor of military governors disbanded palestinian dominated army units arrested al nabulsi who had since been made foreign minister and dismissed cabinet of prime minister fakhri al khalidi yitzhak 2012 p 125 pearson 2010 p 110 although he eventually relaxed some of these measures namely military curfews and severe press censorship hussein s moves significantly curtailed constitutional democracy that existed in jordan in mid 1950s on 26 september 1957 abu nuwar rimawi and al hiyari were sentenced to 15 years imprisonment in absentia dann 1989 p 185 anderson 2005 p 186 during his exile from jordan abu nuwar initially resided in damascus along with other jordanian dissidents including al hiyari and rimawi pearson 2010 p 114 however in 1958 abu nuwar moved to egypt following that country s union with syria forming united arab republic uar under nasser s presidency syria seceded in 1961 anderson 2005 p 202 thenceforth abu nuwar lived much of remainder of his exile in cairo in 1958 under aegis of uar and with assistance from head of syrian intelligence abd al hamid al jordanian dissidents in exile formed jordanian revolutionary council it consisted of jordanian left leaning politicians and dissident army officers including abu nuwar al hiyari and abdullah al tal a friend of abu nuwar who had been exiled by hussein before him group attempted to recruit a university students in jordan to

politicians dismissed by hussein and organized assassination attempts against leading royalist politicians including al rifai talhouni and hazza al majali yitzhak 2012 p 126 there were disputes between al tal and abu nuwar over leadership of group in april 1963 abu nuwar declared a government in exile in name of jordanian republic and disseminated propaganda through his own radio station following year or in 1965 abu nuwar returned to jordan after being pardoned by hussein as part of a broader reconciliation with exiled dissidents in a bid to co opt opposition to his rule yitzhak 2012
