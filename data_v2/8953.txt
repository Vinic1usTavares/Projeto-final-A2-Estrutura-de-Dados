style with pixies writing songs that covered a variety of genres and topics and his new found method of recording was closer to later albums than that of frank black and trompe le monde both frank

emusic service they claim it is first album ever made legally available for commercial download critical reception to album was mixed with some writers noting thompson s seemingly deliberate turn away from quirkiness of pixies and his early solo work for a self consciously straightforward approach and disappointingly straightforward punk pop musical style present on album he would continue to eschew multi track recording for live to two track technique for all subsequent releases under group name live to two track recording precludes use of overdubs to correct errors or add texture all takes are recorded continuously and mixing is done on fly on later albums he incorporated more musicians into sessions to allow for more varied instrumental textures explaining his rationale behind method he commented workman left catholics in 1998 to pursue session and sideman work rich gilbert was added to band to replace him frank black and catholics released pistolero in 1999 and dog in sand

was instrumental in creating sound of pixies over course of his career thompson s musical style has grown to encompass a large number of genres however he is considered to produce rock or alternative rock compositions whereas songs such as here comes your man doolittle velvety devil s workshop and headache teenager of year expose a more light rock side others such as something against you surfer rosa and thalassocracy teenager of year hint to a more heavy rock influence in his material a strong country music influence is also increasingly evident in his style most notably in his nashville albums honeycomb and fast man raider man thompson has said that he acquired his vocal style as a teenager when a thai neighbor asked him to sing oh darling by beatles from their album abbey road and to scream it like you hate that bitch frank ganz 2005 p 6 thompson s powerful screams were a signature of pixies albums along with band s typical song structure of quietly paced verses followed by thundering chorus lines and repetitive guitar staccato influences thompson has drawn influence from a number of musical genres as a teenager he mostly listened to 1960s folk and religious music including christian singer songwriter larry norman for playing on his junior high baseball team he was given leon russell s 1970 debut album which he says influenced some of his vocalizing later in high school and in college he discovered punk music black flag along with bands from other genres such as new wave band cars and obscure angst while in boston in 1984 before starting pixies he listened to husker du s zen arcade spotlight kid by captain beefheart and i m sick of you an iggy pop bootleg thompson was also greatly influenced by beatles self titled 1968 release with regards to experimental nature of his compositions thompson s lyrics have also featured references to bible especially in his career with pixies most notably in incestuous tale of nimrod in nimrod s son stories of uriah and bathsheba in dead samson in gouge away and references to tower of babel in songs such as build high and old black dawning he cited surrealist films eraserhead and un chien andalou as mentioned in debaser as major influences on his work with pixies however surrealism was less of an influence in his solo career he commented on these influences which he paid tribute to most in pixies doolittle saying he didn t have patience to sit around reading surrealist novels but found it easier to watch 20 minute films sisario 2006 p 29 songwriting and lyrics during his stay in puerto rico thompson acquired a fairly fluent although informal and at times incorrect use of spanish which he has continued throughout his career several early pixies songs including isla de encanta and vamos reference his experiences in san juan and lyrics are often heavily seasoned with island s slang island s influence in his work is most notable in song isla de encanta named after island s motto isla del encanto other pixies songs drawn from his experiences there include vamos come on pilgrim oh my golly where is my mind surfer rosa crackity jones doolittle and b side bailey s walk several of his songs contain spanish lyrics most notably in pixies first album come on pilgrim and a spanish translation of evil hearted you by yardbirds francis black lyrics evil hearted you corazon de diablo from his later works with pixies onwards his use of spanish drifted westward reflecting places and aspects of state of california and its culture thompson s lyrics are noted for their obscure references to off beat topics such as outer space ufos and three stooges last of these being subject of two reelers a song from teenager of year lyrics with a focus on science fiction were particularly prominent on later pixies records as well as his early solo albums with catholics his lyrics have tended towards historical topics for example song st francis dam disaster from dog in sand details catastrophic collapse of st francis dam near los angeles in march 1928 and all my ghosts ep featured an account of humboldt county massacre of indians in 1860 near eureka california television appearances and videos thompson has appeared on a range of television shows solo and as part of pixies ranging from 120 minutes and late show in united states to word in uk as part of pixies he was reluctant to film music videos for singles elektra records peter lubin commented that to get videos out of them was a major undertaking and it only got worse over time citing fact that thompson refused to lip sync

more professional he became more willing to take part in them los angeles is an example video features thompson riding across a desert on a hovercraft they might be giants john who directed los angeles video later commented on change in black s attitude to music videos thompson has released few music videos since leaving 4ad one being a low budget video in germany for dog in sand s robert
