preceding season two episodes new york times rebecca called it best of season to that point in terms of old school glee and indeed both lisa respers france of cnn and jarett wieselman of new york post found it a reminder of why they originally loved show raymund flandez of wall street journal summarized this was a return to that honeymoon feeling when glee first surprised scandalized and satisfied you tv guide damian holbrook and houston chronicle bobby hankinson appreciated lack of gimmicks former explained no britney numbers no forced guest stars no reasons to check out it s amazing how satisfying a show can be when characters we invested in a year ago get to do something more than set dress a stunt james poniewozik of time labelled it easily strongest character episode so far this season while atlantic kevin fallon opined that series finally achieved correct tonal balance of comedy and drama his colleague meghan brown provided one of few dissenting reviews she called it a lazy nonsensical episode which contributed to a building sophomore slump mtv s aly semigran found it lackluster after grilled cheesus and although anthony benigno of daily news deemed it an improvement on previous episode he concluded that it was not one of season s best several themes ran through reviews one of which was lack of focus on adult characters ign s robert canning who rated duets 8 5 10 signifying a great episode felt that this contributed to its success as it allowed for small but interesting character development to take place even with some of minor characters emily vanderwerff of a v club was surprised that she did not miss presence of cheerleading coach sue sylvester but hankinson semigran and rolling stone erica futterman all lamented her absence gay centered storylines also attracted much commentary christie keith of lesbian and bisexual media website afterellen com suggested that duets was queerest episode of any series that s ever been on television entertainment weekly tim stack wrote that kurt stole show in terms of pure emotional power and called him most important character on television right now usa today ann oldenburg questioned whether glee had gone too far by depicting a physical relationship between santana and brittany several reviewers appreciated resultant development of brittany s character poniewozik enjoyed exploration of her basic loneliness e online s jenna mullins was pleased to see more than her usual and one liners and wieselman called it a wonderful moment when she and artie broke up which led to depiction of real feelings in brittany for first time canning found brittany and artie s coupling uneven and preferred her with santana as their development made them uniquely interesting and a blast to watch vanderwerff conversely deemed brittany s pairing with artie one of most resonant things show s ever done storylines that involved rachel received mixed commentary both poniewozik and stack appreciated pairing of rachel and kurt former called them probably strongest pairing of episode due to similarities in their characterization and latter lauded rachel s line i know you re lonely but you re not alone as an incredibly powerful statement coming in midst of all these gay youth suicides which further illuminates relevance and importance of a show like glee fallon said that episode added some flavor to relationship between rachel and finn which was in danger of going stale and berk noted that duets was first time he had ever been marginally compelled by a storyline which involved pair benigno was far less favorable he called rachel a lunatic and a self absorbed crazy woman who will do anything short of black ops assassination to secure nationals trophy sam and quinn s burgeoning relationship met with a fairly positive response canning would have preferred for them to become friends first and benigno deemed their sexual tension unrealistic based on sam s success at charming quinn in na vi fictional language of avatar however while berk declared himself fully exhausted with flimsy cheerleader quarterback paradigm sam s na vi and matthew mcconaughey impression led him to concede that they are cute together stack and mullins shared this sentiment and vanderwerff called their flirtation exceptionally well handled music and performances thumb upright left in duets mike chang harry shum jr pictured gives his first featured vocal performance in a musical number episode s musical performances deemed among most varied and terrific in show s history by vanderwerff were also generally well received futterman found it refreshing for main characters to receive equal performance time although poniewozik opined that some numbers were included based on itunes sales potential rather than how well they served plot holbrook was pleased that songs drove story instead of drowning out characters and both hankinson and dave itzkoff of new york times welcomed contextually appropriate song selection opinions were divided over best performance both futterman and vanderwerff felt that mercedes and santana should have won duet competition with their performance of river deep mountain high former called it one of series best duets and latter further praised it as potentially best musical number show s ever done from a pure performance standpoint wieselman wrote that it was best song of episode and that he didn t want it to ever end however hankinson highlighted its lack of emotional punch and semigran deemed it her least favorite performance she and benigno named sing as their favorite routine though benigno gave it only a b grade as its appeal hinged on mike s dancing rather than his vocal performance berk gave it four stars out of five his highest rating of episode tied with river deep mountain high though flandez and hankinson also commented positively on song former thought that tina s sung interjections became annoying and latter called it far from best of evening burns chose lucky as most impressive number of evening and respers france called it most adorable semigran and los angeles times amy reiter agreed that it was cute and flandez praised its charm and simplicity stack and benigno gave it an a stack eagerly anticipated more duets between quinn and sam and benigno called it absolutely fantastic with particular praise for agron who he opined is often overlooked though futterman also noted its charm she did not think it was a worthy winner of duets competition berk gave it just two stars out of five as he found it kind of boring mash up of happy days are here again and get happy was widely acclaimed respers france reiter and hankinson named it musical highlight of episode fallon and stack went further and hailed it as a highlight of entire series poniewozik commented that number was so appropriate that had it not existed glee probably would have had to invent it wieselman suggested that colfer and michele redefined show stopper with their performance and itzkoff lauded it as a powerful reminder of why it s worth sticking with glee through what has quickly proved a polarizing season of remaining songs rachel and finn s performance of don t go breaking my heart attracted praise for monteith s vocals which stack and yahr commented sounded better than ever le jazz hot received a split response burns wrote that kurt pulled it off flawlessly and fallon called performance far more moving and rousing than any of songs in grilled cheesus stack and benigno both graded it b latter deemed it very good but not transcendent reiter felt that costumes and choreography overpowered emotion of piece and futterman found number too self indulgent and reminiscent of previous performances like rose s turn berk rated it two stars out of five and commented i get idea and execution is commendable but it still kind of sucked rachel and finn s deliberately offensive version of with you i m born again received a c and c from benigno and stack respectively both conceded that it was acceptable vocally but as stack acknowledged point of this song was to hate it and i gotta say glee you played me like a fiddle in december 2012 tv guide named their rendition one of glee worst performances regardless of being a send up respers france found number oddly endearing chart history all six of cover versions released
