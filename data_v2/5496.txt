led by robert falcon scott and had various scientific and geographical objectives scott wished to continue scientific work that he had begun when leading discovery expedition to antarctic in 1901 1904 he also wanted to be first to reach geographic south pole he and four companions attained pole on 17 january 1912 where they found that norwegian team led by roald amundsen had preceded them by 34 days scott s entire party died on return journey from pole some of their bodies journals and photographs were found by a search party eight months later expedition named after its supply ship was a private venture financed by public contributions augmented by a government grant it had further backing from admiralty which released experienced seamen to expedition and from royal geographical society expedition s team of scientists carried out a comprehensive scientific programme while other parties explored victoria land and western mountains an attempted landing and exploration of king edward vii land was unsuccessful a journey to cape crozier in june and july 1911 was first extended sledging journey in depths of antarctic winter for many years after his death scott s status as tragic hero was unchallenged and few questions were asked about causes of disaster which overcame his polar party in final quarter of 20th century expedition came under closer scrutiny and more critical views were expressed about its organization and management degree of scott s personal culpability and more recently culpability of certain expedition members remains controversial thumb

preparations background after discovery s return from antarctic in 1904 scott eventually resumed his naval career but continued to nurse ambitions of returning south with conquest of pole as his specific target discovery expedition had made a significant contribution to antarctic scientific and geographical knowledge but in terms of penetration southward had reached only 82deg 17 and had not traversed great ice barrier in 1909 scott received news that ernest shackleton s nimrod expedition had narrowly failed to reach pole starting from a base close to scott s discovery anchorage in mcmurdo sound shackleton had crossed great ice barrier discovered beardmore glacier route to polar plateau and had struck out for pole he had been forced to turn for home at 88deg 23 s less than 100 geographical miles 112 statute miles 180 km from his objective scott had claimed prescriptive rights to mcmurdo sound area describing it as his own field of work and shackleton s use of area as a base was in breach of an undertaking he gave scott not to do so this soured relations between two explorers and increased scott s determination to surpass shackleton s achievements as he made his preparations for a further expedition scott was aware of other polar ventures being planned a japanese expedition was being planned australasian antarctic expedition under douglas mawson was to leave in 1911 but would be working in a different sector of continent meanwhile roald amundsen a potential rival had announced plans for an arctic voyage personnel right thumb alt man with receding hairline

captain from 6th dragoons oates independently wealthy volunteered his services to expedition and paid ps1 000 2009 value approximately ps75 000 into its funds admiralty also provided a largely naval lower deck including antarctic veterans edgar evans tom crean and william lashly other seamen in shore party included patrick keohane and robert forde thomas clissold cook and frederick hooper domestic steward two russians dimitri gerov dog driver and anton groom also landed to head his scientific programme scott appointed edward wilson as chief scientist wilson was scott s closest confidant among party on discovery expedition he had accompanied scott on farthest south march to 80degs as well as being a qualified medical doctor and a distinguished research zoologist he was also a talented illustrator his scientific team which scott s biographer david crane considered as impressive a group of scientists as had ever been on a polar expedition included some who would enjoy later careers of distinction george simpson meteorologist charles wright canadian physicist and geologists frank debenham and raymond priestley t griffith taylor senior of geologists biologists edward w nelson and dennis g lillie and assistant zoologist apsley cherry garrard completed team cherry garrard had no scientific training but was a protege of wilson s he had like oates contributed ps1 000 to funds after first being turned down by scott he allowed his contribution to stand which impressed scott sufficiently for him to reverse his decision scott s biographer david crane describes cherry garrard as future interpreter historian and conscience of expedition herbert ponting was expedition s photographer whose pictures would leave a vivid visual record on advice of fridtjof nansen scott recruited a young norwegian ski expert tryggve gran thumb tabloid medical chest for scott s antarctic expedition 1910 transport scott had decided on a mixed transport strategy relying on contributions from dogs motor sledges and ponies he appointed cecil meares to take charge of dog teams and recruited shackleton s former motor specialist bernard day to run motor sledges oates would be in charge of ponies but as he could not join expedition until may 1910 scott instructed meares who knew nothing of horses to buy them with unfortunate consequences for their quality and performance a polarised motor car had been unsuccessfully tried in antarctic by shackleton on his 1907 1909 expedition while his pioneering use of ponies had transported him as far as foot of beardmore glacier scott believed that ponies had served shackleton well and he thought he could resolve motor traction problem by developing a tracked snow motor forerunner of snowcat and of tank scott always intended to rely on man hauling for polar plateau believing it impossible to ascend beardmore glacier with motors or with animals motors and animals would be used to haul loads only across barrier enabling men to preserve their strength for later glacier and plateau stages in practice motor sledges proved only briefly useful and ponies performance was affected by their age and poor condition as to dogs while scott s experiences on discovery had made him dubious of their reliability his writings show that he recognised their effectiveness in right hands as expedition developed he became increasingly impressed with their capabilities finance thumb alt advertisement showing two men in heavy clothing on deck of a ship with icy mountains in background men are pouring drinks from a jug slogan reads oxo in antarctic oxo food company was one of many commercial sponsors of expedition unlike discovery expedition where fundraising was handled jointly by royal society and royal geographical society terra nova expedition was organised as a private venture without significant institutional support scott estimated total cost at ps40 000 at 2009 values half of which was eventually met by a government grant balance was raised by public subscription and loans expedition was further assisted by free supply of a range of provisions and equipment from sympathetic commercial firms fund raising task was largely carried out by scott and was a considerable drain on his time and energy continuing in south africa australia and new zealand after terra nova had sailed from british waters by far largest single cost was purchase of ship terra nova for ps12 500 terra nova had been in antarctica before as part of second discovery relief operation scott wanted to sail her as a naval vessel under white ensign to enable this he obtained membership of royal yacht squadron for ps100 he was thus able to impose naval discipline on expedition and as a registered yacht of squadron terra nova became exempt from board of trade regulations which might otherwise have deemed her unfit to sail objectives thumbnail upright grotto in an iceberg 5 january 1911 scott defined objects of expedition in his initial public appeal main objective of this expedition is to reach south pole and to secure for british empire honour of this achievement there were other objectives both scientific and geographical scientific work was considered by chief scientist wilson as main work of expedition no one can say that it will have only been a pole hunt we want scientific work to make bagging of pole merely an item in results edward wilson letter quoted in wilson hoped to continue investigations begun during discovery expedition of penguin colony at cape crozier and to fulfil a programme of geological magnetic and meteorology studies on an unprecedented scale there were further plans to explore king edward vii land a venture described by campbell who was to lead it as thing of whole expedition and victoria land first season 1910 1911 voyage out terra nova sailed from cardiff wales on 15 june 1910 scott detained by expedition business sailed later on a faster passenger liner and joined ship in south africa in melbourne australia he left ship to continue fund raising while terra nova proceeded to new zealand waiting for scott in melbourne was a telegram from amundsen informing scott that norwegian was proceeding south telegram was first indication to scott that he was in a race when asked by press for a reaction scott replied that his plans would not change and that he would not sacrifice expedition s scientific goals to win race to pole in his diary he wrote that amundsen had a fair chance of success and perhaps deserved his luck if he got through scott rejoined ship in new zealand where additional supplies were taken aboard including 34 dogs 19 siberian ponies and three motorised sledges terra nova heavily overladen finally left port chalmers on 29 november during first days of december ship was struck by a heavy storm at one point with ship taking heavy seas and pumps having failed crew had to bail her out with buckets storm resulted in loss of two ponies a dog of

around cape crozier at eastern point of island huxley l ed pp 81 85 before proceeding to mcmurdo sound to its west where both discovery and nimrod had previously landed after scott had considered various possible wintering spots he chose a cape remembered from discovery days as about north of scott s 1902 base at hut point scott hoped that this location which he renamed cape evans after his second in command would be free of ice in short antarctic summer enabling ship to come and go as seas to south froze over expedition would have ready access over ice to hut point and barrier at cape evans shore parties disembarked with ponies dogs three motorised sledges one of which was lost during unloading and bulk of party s stores scott was astonished at strength of ponies as they transferred stores and materials from ship to shore a prefabricated accommodation hut measuring was erected and made habitable by 18 january amundsen s camp scott s programme included a plan to explore and carry out scientific work in king edward vii land to east of barrier a party under campbell was organised for this purpose with option of exploring victoria land to north west if king edward vii land proved inaccessible on 26 january campbell s party left in ship and headed east after several failed attempts to land his party on king edward vii land shore campbell exercised his option to sail to victoria land on its return westward along barrier edge terra nova encountered amundsen s expedition camped in bay of whales an inlet in barrier amundsen was courteous and hospitable willing for campbell to camp nearby and offering him help with his dogs campbell politely declined and returned with his party to cape evans to report this development scott received news on 22 february during first depot laying expedition according to cherry garrard first reaction of scott and his party was an urge to rush over to bay of whales and have it out with amundsen scott recorded event calmly in his journal one thing only fixes itself in my mind proper as well as wiser course is for us to proceed exactly as though this had not happened to go forward and do our best for honour of our country without fear or panic depot laying thumb alt wooden structure with door and two small windows to left is an open lean to in background are partly snow covered mountains scott s

journey which would begin following spring final depot would be largest and would be known as one ton depot work was to be carried out by 12 men eight fittest ponies and two dog teams ice conditions prevented use of motor sledges journey started on 27 january in a state of hurry bordering on panic according to cherry garrard progress was slower than expected and ponies performance was adversely affected because oates was opposed to using norwegian snowshoes and had left them behind at cape evans on 4 february party established corner camp from hut point when a blizzard held them up for three days a few days later after march had resumed scott sent three weakest ponies home two died en route as depot laying party approached 80deg scott became concerned that remaining ponies would not make it back to base unless party turned north immediately against advice of oates who wanted to go forward killing ponies for meat as they collapsed scott decided to lay one ton depot at s more than short of its intended location scott returned to safety camp with dogs after risking his own life to rescue a dog team that had fallen into a crevasse wilson thought it an insane risk when slower pony party arrived one of animals was in very poor condition and died shortly afterwards later as surviving ponies were crossing sea ice near hut point ice broke up despite a determined rescue attempt three more ponies died of eight ponies that had begun depot laying journey only two returned home winter quarters on 23 april sun set for duration of winter months and party settled into cape evans hut under scott s naval regime hut was divided by a wall made of packing cases so that officers and men lived largely separate existences scientists being deemed officers for this purpose everybody was kept busy scientific work continued observations and measurements were taken equipment was overhauled and adapted for future journeys surviving ponies needed daily exercise and dogs required regular attention scott spent much time calculating sledging rations and weights for forthcoming polar march routine included regular lectures on a wide range of subjects ponting on japan wilson on sketching oates on horse management and geologist frank debenham on volcanoes to ensure that physical fitness was maintained there were frequent games of football in half light outside hut scott recorded that atkinson is by far best player but hooper p o evans and crean are also quite good south polar times which had been produced by shackleton during discovery expedition was resurrected under cherry

1911 1912 northern party spent 1911 winter in their hut their exploration plans for summer of 1911 1912 could not be fully carried out partly because of condition of sea ice and also because they were unable to discover a route into interior terra nova returned from new zealand on 1912 and transferred party to vicinity of evans cove a location approximately south of cape adare and northwest of cape evans they were to be picked up on after completion of further geological work but due to heavy pack ice ship was unable to reach them group with meagre rations which they had to supplement by fish and seal meat were forced to spend winter months of 1912 in a snow cave which they excavated on inexpressible island here they suffered severe privations frostbite hunger and dysentery with extreme winds and low temperatures and discomfort of a blubber stove in confined quarters on 17 april 1912 a party under edward atkinson in command at cape evans during absence of polar party went to relieve campbell s party but were beaten back by weather northern party survived winter in their icy chamber and set out for base camp on 1912 despite their physical weakness whole party managed to reach cape evans on after a perilous journey which included a crossing of difficult drygalski ice tongue geological and other specimens collected by northern party were retrieved from cape adare and evans cove by terra nova in january 1913 western geological parties first geological expedition january march 1911 objective of this journey was geological exploration of coastal area west of mcmurdo sound in a region between mcmurdo dry valleys and koettlitz glacier this work was undertaken by a party consisting of griffith taylor debenham wright and edgar evans they landed from terra nova on at butter point opposite cape evans on victoria land shore on party established its main depot in ferrar glacier region and then conducted explorations and survey work in dry valley and taylor glacier areas

was reached on headquarters were established at a site christened geology point and a stone hut was built during following weeks exploration and surveying work took place on mackay glacier and a range of features to north of glacier were identified and named party was due to be picked up by terra nova on 1912 but ship could not reach them party waited until before trekking southward and were rescued from ice when they were finally spotted from ship on geological specimens from both western mountains expeditions were retrieved by terra nova in january 1913 winter journey to cape crozier this journey was conceived by wilson he had suggested need for it in zoology section of discovery expedition s scientific reports and was anxious to follow up this earlier research journey s scientific purpose was to secure emperor penguin eggs from rookery near cape crozier at an early embryo stage so that particular points in development of bird could be worked out this required a trip in depths of winter to obtain eggs in an appropriately early stage of incubation a secondary purpose was to experiment with food rations and equipment in advance of coming summer s polar journey scott approved and a party consisting of wilson bowers and cherry garrard set out on 1911 thumb in foreground facing left a bird with black head and white body standing erect with wings spread in background a companion bird faces right two emperor penguins travelling during antarctic winter had not been previously tried scott wrote that it was a bold venture but right men have gone to attempt it cherry

cold as anyone would want to endure in darkness and iced up clothes wrote cherry garrard often daily distance travelled was little more than a single mile after reaching cape crozier on 15 july party built an igloo from snow blocks stone and a sheet of wood they had brought for roof they were then able to visit penguin colony and collect several emperor penguin eggs subsequently their igloo shelter was almost destroyed in a blizzard with force 11 winds storm also carried away tent upon which their survival would depend during their return journey but fortunately this was recovered half a mile away group set out on return journey to cape evans arriving there on three eggs that survived journey went first to natural history museum in south kensington and thereafter were subject of a report from dr stewart at university of edinburgh eggs failed to support wilson s theories cherry garrard afterwards described this as worst journey in world and used this as title of book that he wrote in 1922 as a record of entire terra nova expedition scott called winter journey a very wonderful performance and was highly satisfied with experiments in rations and equipment we are as near perfection as experience can direct thumb upright 1 2 alt chart of scott s polar journey showing successive barrier glacier and polar plateau stages supply depots are indicated by flag symbols map of

journey on 13 september 1911 scott revealed his plans for south pole march sixteen men would set out using two remaining motor sledges ponies and dogs for barrier stage of journey which would bring them to beardmore glacier at this point dogs would return to base and ponies would be shot for food thereafter twelve men in three groups would ascend glacier and begin crossing of polar plateau using man hauling only one of these groups would carry on to pole supporting groups would be sent back at specified latitudes composition of final polar group would be decided by scott during journey for return journey scott ordered that dogs teams set off again from base camp to replenish depots and meet polar party between latitude 82 and 82 30 on 1 march to assist party home motor party lt evans day lashly and hooper started from cape evans on with two motor sledges their objective being to haul loads to latitude 80deg 30 s and wait there for others by both motor sledges had failed after little more than of travel so party man hauled of supplies for remaining reaching their assigned latitude two weeks later scott s main party which had left cape evans on with dogs and ponies caught up with them on scott s initial plan was that dogs would return to base at this stage because of slower than expected progress scott decided to take dogs on further day and hooper were dispatched to cape evans with a message to this effect for simpson who had been left in charge there on expedition had reached gateway name given by shackleton to route from barrier on to beardmore glacier at this point a blizzard struck forcing men to camp until and to break into rations intended for glacier journey when blizzard lifted remaining ponies were shot as planned and their meat deposited as food for return parties on meares and dimitri turned back with dogs carrying a message back to base that things were not as rosy as they might be but we keep our spirits up and say luck must turn party began ascent of beardmore and on reached beginning of polar plateau where they laid upper glacier depot there was still no hint from scott as to who would be in final polar party on at latitude 85deg 20 s scott sent back atkinson cherry garrard wright and keohane scott reminded atkinson to take two dog teams south in event of meares having to return home as seemed likely to assist polar party on its return journey following march remaining eight men continued south in better conditions which enabled them to make up some of time lost on barrier by they had caught up with shackleton s 1908 1909 timetable on 1912 at latitude 87deg 32 s scott made his decision on composition of polar party five men scott wilson oates bowers and edgar evans would go forward while lt evans lashly and crean would

furthest south 88deg 23 s on seven days later about from their goal amundsen s black flag was spotted and party knew that they had been forestalled they reached pole next day 1912 pole yes but under very different circumstances from those expected great god this is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without reward of priority well it is something to have got here scott still hoped to race amundsen to telegraph in australia now for a desperate struggle to get news through first i wonder if we can do it words to get news through first were omitted for scott s published diary on 18 january 1912 they discovered amundsen s tent some supplies a letter to king haakon vii of norway which amundsen politely asked scott to deliver and a note stating that amundsen

of his party particularly of edgar evans who was suffering from severe frostbite and was scott records a good deal run down condition of oates s feet became an increasing anxiety as group approached summit of beardmore glacier and prepared for descent to barrier on they began their descent and had serious difficulty locating a depot in a brief spell of good weather scott ordered a half day s rest

failing to heal he was badly frostbitten and is thought to have injured his head after several falls on ice he is absolutely changed from his normal self reliant self wrote scott near bottom of glacier he collapsed and died on thumb right grave of southern party on barrier stage of homeward march scott reached 82 30degs meeting point for dog teams three days ahead of schedule noting in his diary for 27 february 1912 we are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs where and when etc it is a critical position we may find ourselves in safety at next depot but there is a horrid element of doubt party then met with three ultimately critical difficulties non appearance of dog teams an unexpected large drop in temperature and a shortage of fuel in depots low temperatures caused poor surfaces which scott likened to pulling over desert sand he described surface as coated with a thin layer of woolly crystals formed by radiation no doubt these are too firmly fixed to be removed by wind and cause impossible friction on sledge runners low temperatures were accompanied by an absence of wind something scott had expected to assist them on their northern journey party were further slowed down by frostbite in oates left foot daily marches were now down to less than five miles which was insufficient given lack of oil furthermore by march 10 it became evident dog teams were not coming dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed meares dog driver had a bad trip home i suppose in a farewell letter to sir edgar speyer dated march 16 scott wondered whether he had overshot meeting point and fought growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by dog teams we very nearly came through and it s a pity to have missed it but lately i have felt that we have overshot our mark no one is to blame and i hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support on same day oates who now with hands as well as feet pretty well useless voluntarily left tent and walked to his death scott wrote that oates last words were i am just going outside and may be some time oates sacrifice increased team s speed but it was too late to save them especially since scott s right toes were now becoming frostbitten scott wilson and bowers struggled on to a point south of one ton depot but were halted on by a fierce blizzard although each day they attempted to advance they were unable to do so scott s last diary entry dated 1912 presumed date of their deaths ends with these words attempts to relieve polar party 1912 orders concerning dogs before setting out on south pole journey scott had made arrangements intended to help polar party home with use of dogs meares who was expected to have returned to cape evans by 19 december had been instructed that in late december or early january he should transport to one ton depot five xs rations xs extra summit ration food for four men for one week 3 cases of biscuit 5 gallons of oil and as much dog food as you can conveniently carry if this mission could not be carried out by dogs then at all hazard a man hauling team was to carry xs rations to depot meares had been further instructed that in about first week in february depending on news received from returning units he should set out with dogs with a view to meeting returning polar party between latitudes 82deg or 82deg30 on about 1 march objective of these orders was to hasten party back to cape evans before terra nova left so that news of polar conquest could be carried immediately to new zealand scott placed greater emphasis on former journey than on latter whilst object of your third journey is important that of second is vital substance of these orders was reiterated to atkinson when he left scott at top of beardmore glacier on 22 december 1911 huntford 1979 and subsequent authors state that scott gave new orders to lt evans when he turned for home with last support party this is disputed by karen may 2013 several events occurred to obscure and ultimately frustrate this order fact that meares had turned back from polar march much later than originally planned meant that he did not return to cape evans until 5 january huntford suggests he resigned at this point because he was disgusted with scott s expedition fiennes in contrast quotes from a letter by cherry garrard in 1938 that meares had been ready at cape evans to resupply one ton depot as ordered when he had seen ship arrive in bay and so stayed at base ship turned out to be a mirage and real ship did not arrive until mid february r fiennes captain scott p 361 according to fiennes meares was preoccupied with his late father s estate and was anxious to leave on ship as soon as he could three of xs rations required for one ton depot had been man hauled there by a party which left cape evans on 26 december but neither meares nor anyone else transported missing rations or dog food to one ton depot atkinson s aborted journey to meet scott when atkinson arrived back at cape evans from beardmore glacier at end of january he was senior officer present and thus in command of base camp a role to which he was not accustomed terra nova arrived from her winter mooring in new zealand on 9 february and instead of setting off for scott scott orders had specified about first week of february i should like you to start evans 1949 187 188 atkinson used shore party for arduous task of unloading ship a mistake cherry garrard thought since these men might be required to sledge again belatedly on 13 february atkinson set out with dimitri gerov and dog teams for scheduled meeting with scott on barrier reaching hut point 13 miles south before being delayed by bad weather http www gutenberg org cache epub html chapter xvii paragraph 4 during final returning party s journey lt evans had become seriously ill with scurvy after one ton depot he was unable to march and was carried on sledge by crean and lashly to a point south of hut point at that point he appeared likely to die on crean walked on alone to reach hut point covering 35 miles of difficult terrain in only 18 hours where he found atkinson and dimitri with their dogs pausing in their journey to meet scott atkinson diverted his attention to rescue of evans whom he brought to hut point barely alive on from that point atkinson s priority was to bring evans to safety of ship cherry garrard s journey to one ton depot with atkinson thus occupied an alternative arrangement to pick up scott was necessary disregarding meares who was not available for work most qualified person available to meet scott s party was physicist wright an experienced traveller and navigator but chief scientist simpson insisted wright s scientific work be given priority atkinson therefore chose cherry garrard lt evans wrote later that he thought scott would have approved decision to keep wright at base camp whereas wright later stated it always worries me i should have had that job a raeside 2009 return to antarctica john wiley ontario p246 cherry garrard would be accompanied by dimitri in his 1922 book worst journey cherry garrard recalled controversial verbal orders given by atkinson he was to travel to one ton depot as fast as possible where he was to leave food for returning polar party if scott had not arrived before him cherry garrard should decide what to do atkinson also emphasised that this was not a rescue party and added that scott had given instructions that dogs were not to be risked in view of sledging plans for next season in standard edition of his book cherry omitted any mention of scott s request to be picked up at 82deg or 82deg30 on 1 march but after atkinson s and lady scott s deaths in 1929 and 1947 respectively in a postscript to his privately published 1948 edition this postscript is excluded from subsequent editions cherry acknowledged existence of scott s order and provided reasons why atkinson and later he himself failed to comply cherry garrard in 1948 stated that atkinson was too exhausted at beginning of february to set off to meet scott and that lack of dog food at one ton depot made a timely start impractical karen may of scott polar research institute goes further by suggesting that instruction about saving dogs for following season was atkinson s own invention cherry garrard left hut point with dimitri and two dog teams on arriving at one ton on and depositing extra rations scott was not there with supplies for themselves and dogs for 24 days they had about eight days time before having to return to hut point alternative to waiting was moving southwards for another four days any travel beyond that in absence of dog food depot would mean killing dogs for dog food as they went along thus breaching atkinson s not to be risked order cherry garrard argued that weather was too poor for further travel with daytime temperatures as low as and that he might miss scott if leaving depot and thus decided to wait for scott on in worsening weather with his own supplies dwindling cherry garrard turned for home meanwhile scott s team were fighting for their lives less than away atkinson would later write i am satisfied that no other officer of expedition could have done better cherry garrard was troubled for rest of his life by thoughts that he might have taken other actions that could have saved polar party atkinson s final relief effort when cherry garrard returned from one ton depot without scott s party anxieties rose atkinson now in charge at cape evans as senior naval officer present decided to make another attempt to reach polar party when weather permitted and on set out with keohane man hauling a sledge containing 18 days provisions in very low temperatures 40 degf 40 degc they had reached corner camp by when in atkinson s view weather cold and time of year made further progress south impossible atkinson recorded in my own mind i was morally certain that polar party had perished search party october 1912 remaining expedition members still at cape evans waited through winter continuing their scientific work in spring atkinson had to consider whether efforts should first be directed to rescue of campbell s party or to establishing if possible fate of polar party a meeting of whole group decided that they should first search for signs of scott party set out on accompanied by a team of mules that had been landed from terra nova during its resupply visit previous summer on party found tent containing frozen bodies of scott wilson and bowers south of one ton depot atkinson read relevant portions of scott s diaries and nature of disaster was revealed after diaries personal effects and records had been collected tent was collapsed over bodies and a cairn of snow erected topped by a cross fashioned from gran s skis party searched further south for oates s body but found only his sleeping bag on they raised a cairn near to where they believed he had died on returning to hut point on 25 november search party found that campbell s northern party had rescued itself and had returned safely to base early in morning of 10 february 1913 dr edward atkinson and lieutenant harry pennell rowed into new zealand port of oamaru from where they sent a coded message back to expedition s new zealand agent joseph kinsey informing him of fate of scott and his party atkinson and pennell then boarded a train to meet terra nova in lyttelton near christchurch aftermath as campbell was now senior naval officer of expedition he assumed command for its final weeks until arrival of terra nova on 1913 before final departure a large wooden cross was erected on slopes of observation hill overlooking hut point inscribed with five names of dead and a quotation from tennyson s ulysses to strive to seek to find and not to yield thumb upright left alt flat topped hill with snow on lower slopes and sea in foreground and a solitary bird in flight observation hill overlooking hut point where terra nova memorial cross was erected in january 1913 loss of scott and his party overshadowed all else in british public s mind including amundsen s feat in being first at pole for many years image of scott as a tragic hero beyond reproach remained almost unchallenged for although there were rifts among some who were close to expedition including relatives of those who died this disharmony was not public there was no real change in public perceptions until 1970s by which time nearly all those directly concerned with expedition were dead controversy was ignited with publication of roland huntford s book scott and amundsen 1979 re published and televised in 1985 as last place on earth huntford was critical of scott s supposedly authoritarian leadership style and of his poor judgment of men and blamed him for a series of organisational failures that led to death of everyone in polar party scott s personal standing suffered from these attacks efforts to restore his reputation have included account by ranulph fiennes a direct rebuttal of huntford s version susan solomon s scientific analysis of weather conditions that ultimately defeated scott david cranes s 2005 biography of scott and karen may s new analysis of scott s disobeyed orders specifying that dog teams transport his returning party swiftly back to base camp in comparing achievements of scott and amundsen most polar historians generally accept that amundsen s skills with ski and dogs his general familiarity with ice conditions and his clear focus on a non scientific expedition gave him considerable advantages in race for pole scott s verdict on disaster that overtook his party written when he was close to death lists initial loss of pony transport weather conditions a shortage of fuel in our depots for which i cannot account and sickening of evans and oates but ultimately scott concludes that our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather on barrier in day at night presumably with regard to failed rendezvous with dog teams requested for 1 march 1912 scott furthermore wrote no one is to blame and i hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we have lacked support cherry garrard whom atkinson placed in charge of dog teams which started late failed to meet scott and turned for home observes that whole business simply bristles with ifs an accumulation of decisions and circumstances that might have fallen differently ultimately led to catastrophe but we were as wise as anyone can be before event thirty one years later after suffering irreversible damage while carrying supplies to base stations in greenland terra nova was set on fire and later sunk by gunfire off southern coast of greenland on 13 september 1943 at 60deg 15 15 n 45deg 55 45 w its submerged remains were found in 2012 scientific legacy scientific contributions of expedition were long overshadowed by deaths of scott and his party however 12 scientists who participated largest antarctic scientific team of its time made notable discoveries in zoology botany geology glaciology and meteorology terra nova returned to england with over 2 100 plants animals and fossils over 400 of which were new to science discoveries of fossil plant which also occur in australia new zealand africa india which supported not only that climate of antarctica once was warm enough to support trees but that antarctica itself was united to other landmasses before expedition glaciers had only been studied in europe meteorological data collected was longest unbroken weather record in early twentieth century providing baselines for current assessments of climate change in 1920 former terra nova scientists frank debenham a geographer
