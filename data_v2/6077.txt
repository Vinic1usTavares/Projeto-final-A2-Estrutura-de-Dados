something that i really believed in and that i really felt strong about concept of rhythm nation emerged as jackson was a tv watcher we would watch bet mtv then switched over to cnn and there d always

slant magazine noted that producers loosened their rigid backbeats in acquiescence with new jack s standard three on one swing as noted in song critical reception jon pareles of new york times considered that despite its platitudinous message song has stark edges and angles sputnikmusic s zachary powell commented that state of world keeps upbeat motion that rhythm nation begins but with more of a socially conscious twist it shares with preceding track a groovy beat and danceability but takes it to another direction lyrically and shows caring side of janet jackson dennis hunt of los angeles times commented positively saying that move to social commentary was a rocky decision however he felt that state of world was not interesting enough musically to carry messages on book michael jackson a life in music a life in music by writer geoff brown focusing on jackson s brother michael he noted that like her brother she can focus on problems as shown on song but she offers no solutions to them new rolling stone album guide commented that heartfelt pleas for racial unity and cloudy musings on state of world don t obscure pulsating beat of other songs from album jonathan van meter from spin was critical of song saying that state of world rhythm nation and knowledge formed a spike lee esque trilogy made even less convincing by a tiresome house music back beat and that
