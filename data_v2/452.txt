saint gaudens double eagle is a twenty dollar gold coin or double eagle produced by united states mint from 1907 to 1933 coin is named after its designer sculptor augustus saint gaudens who designed obverse and reverse it is considered by many to be most beautiful of u s coins in 1904 president theodore roosevelt sought to beautify american coinage and proposed saint gaudens as an artist capable of task although sculptor had poor experiences with mint and its chief engraver charles e barber saint gaudens accepted roosevelt s call work was subject to considerable delays due to saint gaudens s declining health and difficulties because of high relief of his design saint gaudens died in 1907 after designing eagle and double eagle but before designs were finalized for production after several versions of design for double eagle proved too difficult to strike barber modified saint gaudens s design lowering relief so coin could be struck with only one blow when coins were finally released they proved controversial as they lacked words in god we trust and congress intervened to require motto s use coin was minted primarily for use in international trade until 1933 1933 double eagle is among most valuable of u s coins with sole example currently known to be in private hands selling in 2002 for 7 590 020 background double eagle or twenty dollar gold piece was first issued in 1850 its congressional authorization was a response to increasing amount of gold available as result of california gold rush resulting liberty head double eagle designed by mint engraver james longacre was struck for remainder of 19th century though design was modified several times double eagle due to its very high face value equivalent to several hundred dollars today did not widely circulate but was coin most often used for large international transactions in which settlement was to be in gold in west where gold or silver coins were preferred to paper money use of which was illegal in california in aftermath of gold rush coins saw some circulation thumb upright left saint gaudens s rejected reverse design for world columbian exposition medal sculptor augustus saint gaudens s first association with mint was in 1891 when he served on a committee judging entries for new silver coinage mint had offered only a small prize to winner and all invited artists including st gaudens himself refused to submit entries competition was open to public and judging committee which consisted of saint gaudens mint engraver charles e barber and commercial engraver henry mitchell found no entry suitable this came as no surprise to saint gaudens who told mint director edward o leech that there were only four men in world capable of such work of whom three were in france and saint gaudens was fourth barber who had been chief engraver since 1879 felt that saint gaudens overstated case and there was only one man capable of such coinage work barber himself leech responded to failed competition by directing barber to prepare new designs for dime quarter dollar and half dollar resulting in barber coinage an issue which attracted considerable public dissatisfaction in 1892 saint gaudens was asked to design official medal of world columbian exposition in chicago it would be presented to exhibitors obverse of saint gaudens s design showing columbus coming ashore was noncontroversial his reverse which featured a torch bearing naked youth carrying wreaths to crown victors was attacked by censoring postal agent anthony comstock as obscene exposition directors hastily withdrew reverse design and replaced it with one created by barber which according to numismatic historian walter breen was notable only for banality a furious saint gaudens swore to have nothing more to do with mint or its employees and for next decade refused all commissions which might involve him with that bureau inception thumb upright an early concept for reverse of double eagle by saint gaudens design was adapted for eagle on december 27 1904 president theodore roosevelt a personal friend of saint gaudens wrote to his secretary of treasury leslie mortier shaw i think state of our coinage is artistically of atrocious hideousness would it be possible without asking permission of congress to employ a man like saint gaudens to give us a coinage which would have some beauty roosevelt had mint director george e roberts write to saint gaudens who replied i am extremely interested in matter of new designs of coinage it will i assure you give me great pleasure to assist in procuring of good work roosevelt caused mint to engage saint gaudens to redesign some of coins which could be changed without need for congressional approval cent and four gold coins no u s coin had ever been designed by anyone other than a mint employee in november 1905 roosevelt wrote to saint gaudens to enquire how gold coinage was progressing president mentioned that he had been looking at gold coins of ancient greece and that most beautiful ones were in high relief roosevelt suggested that new designs could be in high relief with a high rim to protect them saint gaudens replied agreeing with roosevelt and proposing a design for double eagle some kind of a possibly winged figure of liberty striding forward as if on a mountaintop holding aloft on one arm a shield bearing stars and stripes with word liberty marked across field in other hand perhaps a flaming torch drapery of liberty s dress would be flowing in breeze my idea is to make it a living thing and typical of progress thumb left early model for reverse of double eagle displaying date in roman numerals on january 2 1906 saint gaudens wrote to shaw enquiring whether a high relief was practical on coins struck at mint shaw did not immediately reply but instead met with roosevelt who wrote that there was no objection to have coins many of which would be stored in bank vaults and not circulated as artistic as greeks could desire roosevelt secured shaw s support for redesign although as president wrote to saint gaudens of course he thinks i am a crack brained lunatic on subject shaw wrote to sculptor on reproducing a copy of a letter from roberts which warned judgement of authority of all countries is that modern coins must be of low relief but as president disagreed with roberts s view saint gaudens could go ahead with a high relief design numismatic historian roger w burdette commented this is also one of those times when compelling egos of artist and president might have paid greater attention to director roberts comments by continuing with design in a relief that was not saint gaudens lost his best chance to explore limits of artistry on circulation coinage saint gaudens wrote to roosevelt later in january whatever i produce cannot be worse than now displayed on our coins however saint gaudens foresaw resistance from barber who has been in that institution since foundation of government and will be found standing in its ruins in sculptor wrote to roosevelt that he had sent an assistant to washington to obtain technical details of redesign but if you succeed in getting best of polite mr barber or others in charge you will have done a greater work than putting through panama canal nevertheless i will stick at it even unto death in may 1906 saint gaudens wrote to secretary shaw asking if there was any objection to having date in roman numerals shaw replied while we are making coins for people of united states i think we should confine ourselves to english language i have reminded our architects that i will dismiss first one who puts a v on a public building where a u is intended however roosevelt overruled shaw and sculptor proceeded with use of roman numerals thumb side of 1907 high relief double eagle showing edge lettering and surface detail saint gaudens had intended a flying eagle design for cent but developed it for twenty dollar piece after learning that by law an eagle was not to appear on cent saint gaudens s health worsened through 1906 as cancer which would kill him forced him to have his assistant henry hering deal with many of details of work saint gaudens had models for coins made in paris rather than at mint in order to bypass any obstruction by mint it was not until that roosevelt was finally given coin sized models of saint gaudens s work by hering and roosevelt wrote to ailing sculptor i have instructed director of mint that these dies are to be reproduced just as quickly as possible and just as they are it is simply splendid i suppose i shall be impeached for it by congress but i shall regard that as a very cheap payment obverse of saint gaudens s final design shows a female figure of liberty who also represents victory saint gaudens based his design on female figure he had designed in creating new york city s monument to general william tecumseh sherman but sculptor s ultimate inspiration was nike of samothrace figure for sherman monument was modeled by henrietta anderson one of artist s favorite subjects on coin liberty holds a torch in one hand representing enlightenment an olive branch in other a symbol of peace she strides across a rocky outcrop behind her are united states capitol and rays of sun figure is surrounded by 46 stars one for each of states in 1907 reverse is a side view of a flying eagle seen slightly from below with a rising sun and its rays behind it complementing obverse design edge bears lettering e pluribus unum saint gaudens felt he could not place a third line of text on reverse without unbalancing composition and obverse lacked room for motto so it was placed on edge from design to coin mint engraver barber had closely followed progress of proposed recoinage and wrote to acting mint director robert preston on 1906 saint gaudens talks so much about experiments it may be to him but to us it is no experiment as we are just as certain that relief of his eagle will never coin as we are certain that sun will rise each morning and only object in all this trouble and waste of money is to convince those who will be convinced in no other way i think our friend saint gaudens is playing a game but our willingness nay more our desire to let work tell its own story has rather called his hand and he is not prepared to show it and therefore is sparing for wind or time in response to barber s letter preston wrote to saint gaudens there are no presses anywhere in mints or in use among silversmiths which can bring up your proposed relief at a single stroke when models were brought to mint barber examined and rejected them it was only after considerable discussion that he agreed to experiment at that time mint was intensely busy generating designs for new coinage for cuba and philippines and barber was reluctant to waste time on what he considered an experimental piece which would never be coined for circulation experimental dies were made from plaster model approximately 24 pieces were struck as patterns even though mint used a medal press set for maximum pressure it still took up to nine strokes of press to fully bring out design these patterns are today known as ultra high relief or extra high relief pieces and only about 20 are known one sold in a 2005 auction for 2 990 000 on 1907 president wrote saint gaudens it has proved hitherto impossible to strike them by one blow which is necessary under conditions of making coins of present day on 1907 saint gaudens replied i am grieved that striking of die did not bring better results evidently it is no trifling matter to make greek art conform with modern numismatics thumb left saint gaudens s 1902 statue of victory part of sherman monument in new york city was used for design of liberty on obverse of double eagle a second set of dies was produced with relief reduced somewhat but still proved too high relief for practical coining requiring three strokes of press to fully bring out design saint gaudens had produced models for these dies under misapprehension that first pieces had been struck on a production press rather than on mint s only medal press and therefore only slight adjustment need be made when saint gaudens died on 1907 hering was working on a third model uncertain where to find hering roosevelt ordered new secretary of treasury george cortelyou to have mint finalize design and put coin in circulation by barber was recalled from his vacation in ocean grove new jersey to comply with president s order barber wrote philadelphia mint superintendent john landis on that what roosevelt wanted was impossible he had no dies nor any clear idea of how saint gaudens had planned to reduce relief mint chief engraver alleged that he could take no action with respect to double eagle on hering finally appeared at mint with a new set of models which barber again quickly rejected barber wrote to preston upon examination it was found that relief of models was so great that it would be a waste of time to make reductions for coinage as it would be quite impossible to coin when dies are made instead barber began work on his own low relief version of saint gaudens s design in august 1907 roosevelt nominated san francisco mint superintendent frank leach as director of mint he took office on 1907 in his memoirs leach recalled his initial interview with roosevelt on question of double eagles before i had become familiar with my surroundings president sent for me in interview that followed he told me what he wanted and what failures and his disappointments had been and proceeded to advise me as to what i should do to accomplish purpose determined upon in way of new coinage in this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had all this was delivered in his usual vigorous way emphasizing many points by hammering on desk with his fist thumb high relief version of 1907 saint gaudens double eagle on november 18 impatient roosevelt directed that second set of dies be used to strike coins directly ordering mint to begin new issue even if it takes you all day to strike one piece over 12 000 of these high relief pieces were struck and were released into circulation in 1907 and 1908 barber wrote of high relief pieces to landis mr hart has put mill into operation and i send you two pieces showing result these are not selected as all coins now made are same as these two which gives me alarm as they are so well made that i fear president may demand continuance of this particular coin barber completed work on his version of design with a greatly lowered relief and new coin went into production on a large scale basis a total of 361 667 of revised design were produced by mint in 1907 low relief coins were released into circulation at end of barber s modifications were denounced both by sculptor s family and by hering among other alterations barber changed roman numeral for date to arabic numeral 1907 in spite of modifications according to r s yeoman in his a guide book of united states coins many consider saint gaudens double eagles most beautiful of u s coins in his book discussing redesigns of u s coins between 1905 and 1908 burdette casts blame on all parties for delays in new coin responsibility for most of delays in producing new coinage must fall on saint gaudens studio for failing to deliver models in a timely manner mint failed in its responsibility to clearly communicate to president and artist its limitations and technical requirements for large scale coinage president roosevelt likewise must bear responsibility for constantly confusing project with conflicting or incomplete communication to artist and mint bureau despite difficulties with design roosevelt was very pleased with new double eagle mint director leach recalled that when i laid upon his desk a sample of beautifully executed double eagles of saint gaudens design he was most enthusiastic in his expressions of pleasure and satisfaction i certainly believed him when he declared he was delighted he warmly congratulated me on my success and was most complimentary in his comments in president wrote to his friend dr william sturgis bigelow i am very much pleased that you like that coin i shall have all kinds of trouble over it but i do feel what you say is true that is that it is best coin that has been struck for two thousand years and that no matter what is its temporary fate it will serve as a model for future coin makers and that eventually difficulties in connection with making such coins will be surmounted production thumb right die trial struck as mint prepared to place in god we trust on coins roosevelt had specifically requested saint gaudens not to put in god we trust on new coin feeling that motto s presence on coins was a debasement of god s name as coins might be spent to further criminal activities saint gaudens was quite willing to omit motto as he felt words detracted from design elements there was a public outcry about omission of motto and what breen describes as an outraged and furious congress ordered motto to appear barber duly modified coin to include motto taking opportunity to make several minor changes to design which according to breen do not improve coin in 1912 two more stars were added to obverse to reflect admission of new mexico and arizona to union existing stars were not adjusted in position two new ones were placed on outcropping at lower right only major variety of series occurred in 1909 an overdate in which an 8 shows under final nine in date this most likely happened when a 1908 die was struck by a 1909 dated hub creating overdate perhaps half of 161 282 double eagles struck at philadelphia that year display overdate in 1916 minting of double eagles ceased as bullion prices were rising because of world war i which also caused an influx of american gold coins from europe holders of gold coin such as banks refused to pay them out at par value and they vanished from circulation in aftermath of war international demand for coin was restored many europeans distrusted their local currencies and desired double eagles to hold coin was struck in large numbers once coinage was resumed in 1920 but it was now almost exclusively a coin of international trade or was held by banks as backing for gold certificates coin itself rarely circulated in united states onset of depression in 1929 did not halt minting of double eagles but coins were for most part held in treasury vaults and few were released many of great rarities of saint gaudens series stem from its final years despite a mintage of almost 1 8 million pieces of 1929 double eagle it is estimated that fewer than 2 000 exist today with all rest melted by government in late 1930s end of series 1933 double eagle thumb 1933 double eagle smithsonian specimen according to numismatic historian roger burdette first 1933 double eagles were struck on march 2 1933 on 1933 25 000 new double eagles were delivered to mint cashier harry powell and by longstanding mint custom were available for paying out on however newly inaugurated president franklin roosevelt had ordered treasury not to pay out any gold and ordered that banks holding gold transmit it to their federal reserve bank numismatists and coin dealers were still allowed to possess and deal in gold coins all others required a special license double eagle continued to be struck until may on 1933 acting secretary of treasury henry morgenthau ordered americans to turn in all gold coins and gold certificates with limited exceptions receiving paper money in payment millions of gold coins were melted down by treasury in following years two 1933 double eagles were sent by mint to smithsonian institution for national coin collection where they remain today prominent coin dealer and numismatic writer q david bowers suggests that despite ban on paying out gold examples of 1933 double eagle could have been obtained legally from mint cashier powell in an exchange for earlier double eagles bowers also notes that secretary of treasury william woodin was a numismatist who in addition to collecting coins had written books on subject dealer william nagy later recalled visiting secretary woodin and being shown five 1933 double eagles with secretary stating that he had several more by early 1940s between eight and ten specimens were known two of them were sold by texas dealer b max mehl in 1944 a journalist enquired of mint regarding 1933 double eagles mint officials could find no record of any issuance of coins and decided those in private hands must have been obtained illegally over next few years secret service seized a number of specimens which were subsequently melted one piece however wound up in hands of king farouk of egypt who even obtained a u s export license for coin what became of farouk specimen after his death is unclear but coin resurfaced in late 1990s when brought to new york for sale to a prospective buyer it was seized by u s authorities after litigation a compromise was reached to allow coin to be auctioned with proceeds to be divided equally between government and private owners in 2002 this coin sold at auction by sotheby s for 7 590 020 purchase price included 20 paid to federal government to monetize a coin it contended had never been officially released in 2004 10 specimens of 1933 double eagle were submitted to mint for authentication by heirs of a philadelphia jeweler who may have been involved in obtaining them from mint in 1933 mint authenticated them and refused to give them back heirs brought suit against government in 2006 and a federal judge ordered government to file a forfeiture action regarding coins government brought such a suit in 2009 it was tried in united states district court for eastern district of pennsylvania beginning on july 7 2011 on july 21 2011 a jury decided that coins had been properly seized by federal government judge d davis confirmed that jury verdict on august 29 2012 on april 17 2015 a panel of united states court of appeals for third circuit ruled that government had failed to file its forfeiture action in a timely manner and that heirs were entitled to coins that ruling was vacated by full court on july 28 2015 and case set for further argument on august 1 2016 full third circuit ruled in favor of government upholding jury verdict heirs on november 4 of that year asked supreme court to review

was not used yielding its place to sculptor miley busiek s depiction of a family of eagles in 1907 mint had experimented by striking about two dozen pieces of same weight as double eagle bearing saint gaudens s design but which had a smaller thicker planchet these checker pieces were destroyed except two placed in mint s coin collection when it was discovered that consent of congress was needed to change diameter of any coin in 2009 mint struck a similar piece in 999 gold using saint gaudens s original ultra high relief design for both sides of coin though modified to a 50 star obverse these
