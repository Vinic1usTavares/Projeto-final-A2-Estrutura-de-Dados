english invasion of scotland of august 1400 was first military campaign undertaken by henry iv of england after deposing previous king his cousin richard ii henry iv urgently wanted to defend anglo scottish border and to overcome his predecessor s legacy of failed military campaigns a large army was assembled slowly and marched into scotland not only was no pitched battle ever attempted but king did not try and besiege scotland s capital edinburgh henry s army left at end of summer after only a brief stay mostly camped near leith near edinburgh where it could maintain contact with its supply fleet campaign ultimately accomplished little except to further deplete king s coffers and is historically notable only for being last one led by an english king on scottish soil background thumb right henry iv of england painted 1597 1618 war with scotland had started under edward i cross border raids and fighting had been norm in anglo scottish relations since 1370s generally in form of scottish incursions over border and english attempts to repel them 1399 revolution which eventually deposed richard ii created further opportunity for scotland to regain land between river tweed and solway firth as historian chris given wilson has put it england s confusion was scotland s opportunity and in may 1399 wark castle was destroyed by a scottish raid invasion then started being planned almost as soon as henry took throne at least one historian has noted a tradition by then of newly crowned kings of england launching military campaigns at beginning of their reigns edward iii had done so same year his reign commenced richard ii immediately on reaching his majority and henry v would do so within three years these campaigns have been summarised as enforcing royal will and testing loyalty towards a newly established regime as well as for established strategic goals although it has been suggested that henry hoped to maintain peaceful relations with scots elements among english nobility were not averse to a pre emptive strike either in particular percys earl of northumberland and his son henry percy called hotspur who were wardens of east and west march saw a scottish war as an opportunity for their own dynastic aggrandisement indeed some contemporaries believed that invasion was actually instigated by them king was forced to deny it in person to sitting parliament in november 1399 a l brown has suggested that this indicates personal interest king felt in affair that this was in fact his own personal plan and that it meant a lot to him and that it had met with criticism he pledged to fulfil this vow before god at almost same time henry had received a letter from scottish king in which henry was referred to as duke of lancaster rather than king of england this it has been suggested fuelled his martial enthusiasm towards scotland perhaps even more persuasive to henry than wishes of his northern nobility were visible divisions within scottish nobility george dunbar earl of march had felt that he had been betrayed by then regent of scotland robert stewart duke of albany over proposed marriage of dunbar s daughter to david stewart earl of carrick heir to scottish throne and albany s nephew this marriage never came to pass however carrick married mary douglas daughter of dunbar s rival on march earl of douglas dunbar in his outraged honour appealed to henry iv for assistance already known as one of finest soldiers of his age and until now an implacable enemy of england dunbar travelled to london and pledged allegiance to henry iv when henry invaded scotland he was accompanied by dunbar dunbar was not only an example of divisions within scottish nobility but one of scotland s own greatest military commanders campaign thumb left arms of george dunbar earl of march although henry had announced his plans at november 1399 parliament he did not attempt a winter campaign but continued to hold quasi negotiations in which he must have felt scots were profoundly irritating at same time it appears that house of commons was not keen on forthcoming war and since extravagance had been a major complaint against henry s predecessor henry was probably constrained in requesting a subsidy at this point parliament was clearly still opposed to a scottish war and may eve have believed a possible french invasion imperative issue in june 1400 king his duchy of lancaster retainers to muster at york and they in turn brought their personal feudal retinues at this point with invasion being obvious to all scots attempted to re open negotiations although scottish ambassadors arrived at york to meet king around 26 june they returned to scotland within two weeks although army was summoned to assemble at york on 24 june it did not approach scotland until mid august this was due to gradual arrival of army supplies in some cases with much delay king s own tents for example were not despatched from westminster until halfway through july brown suggests that henry was well aware of delays these preparations would cause campaign at some point before army left for scotland muster was met by constable of england henry percy earl of northumberland and earl marshal ralph neville earl of westmorland individual leaders of each retinue present were then paid a lump sum to later distribute in wages to their troops men at arms received one shilling a day archers half that but captains and leaders do not appear to have been paid at a higher rate army left york on 25 july and reached newcastle upon tyne four days later it was plagued by shortages of supplies particularly food of which more had had to be requested before even leaving york as campaign progressed bad weather exacerbated problem of food shortages and brown has speculated that this was an important consideration in short duration of expedition it has been estimated that henry s army was around 13 000 men a j border bloodshed east lothian 2000 75 ref of which 800 men at arms and 2000 archers came directly from royal household this was one of largest raised in late medieval england brown notes that whilst it was smaller than massive army assembled in 1345 that would fight battle of crecy it was larger than most that were mustered for french service english fleet also patrolled east coast of scotland in order to besiege scottish trade and to resupply army when required at least three convoys were sent from london and humber first of which delivered 100 tonnes of flour and ten tonnes of sea salt to henry s army in scotland henry crossed border in mid august given wilson has noted care henry took not to ravage or pillage countryside on their march through berwickshire and lothian this was in marked contrast to previous expeditions and given wilson compares it specifically to devastation in last such campaign by richard ii in 1385 this he puts this down to presence in english army of earl of dunbar whose lands they were brown has suggested king envisaged a punitive expedition with either a confrontation or such a chevauchee that scots would be eager to negotiate in event they offered no resistance as english army marched through haddington however henry s army never progressed further than leith there army could keep in physical contact with supporting fleet henry took a personal interest in his convoys at one point even verbally instructing that two scottish fishermen fishing in firth of forth were to be paid ps2 for their unspecified assistance however henry never besieged edinburgh castle where duke of was ensconced by now brown says henry s campaign had been reduced to a war of words by 29 august english army had returned to other side of border aftermath john sadler has described this expedition as like so many of its predecessors fail ing to yield any significant results neither forcing scots onto a battlefield nor making any major territorial gains brown too has described campaign as utterly futile sadler has ascribed scottish success in part to their reliance on a fabian strategy to wear out english whilst avoiding direct confrontation henry s lacklustre campaign was condemned by contemporary observers with welsh chronicler adam of usk saying that scots did more damage to english than had been done to them likewise scotichronicon suggested that nothing worthy of remembrance was done by their enemies king had been desperately short of money in february before campaign had begun by time it was over he was left even shorter campaign had cost at least ps10 000 but had yielded nothing in booty or ransom henry still needed to pay his army s wages merchant sailors wages alone were ps500 and with crown now a few thousand pounds further in debt a parliament was summoned for york before either finances or parliament had been resolved glyndwr rising which continued for rest of henry s reign had begun in wales henry iv s campaign into scotland in june 1400 was to be
