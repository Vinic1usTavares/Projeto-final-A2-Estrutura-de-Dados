stones greg tate noted that while all previous chili peppers projects have been highly spirited californication dares to be spiritual and another critic billboard s paul verna mentioned that album brought out group s softer melodic side as opposed to their previous six albums background in 1984 red hot chili peppers started off as a funk punk band driven by kiedis s exuberant rapping and flea s manic slap bass sanneh 2002 guitarist john frusciante who had joined in 1988 at age of 18 left band in middle of a 1992 tour that promoted their critically acclaimed album blood sugar sex magik kiedis and sloman 2004 p 295 it took over a year for band to find a new guitarist with whom to record officially dave navarro formerly of jane s addiction was invited to join chili peppers after arik marshall who had finished remaining tour dates for blood sugar sex magik was fired kiedis and sloman 2004 p 307 navarro influenced band s ensuing album one hot minute by incorporating various elements of heavy metal and psychedelic rock which was something for which chili peppers had not previously been notable compared to blood sugar sex magik one hot minute was a commercial disappointment selling only half of what blood sugar sex magik had originally sold kiedis and sloman 2004 pp 344 358 401 navarro and band parted ways in early 1998 clearing way for s eventual return kiedis and sloman 2004 pp 361 377 in years following his departure from chili peppers frusciante had developed a vicious addiction to both heroin and cocaine that left him in poverty and near death friends convinced him to enter drug rehabilitation in january 1998 in april 1998 following frusciante s three month completion bassist flea visited his former bandmate and openly invited him to re join band an invitation frusciante readily accepted within week reunited for first time in six years foursome gathered to play and jump started newly reunited red hot chili peppers kiedis and sloman 2004 pp 389 400 through a number of lineup changes red hot chili peppers had released multiple compilation or greatest hits albums prior to frusciante s return frusciante pushed for group to change their funk punk sound and become more of a mellow progressive rock act for californication red hot chili peppers britannica academic encyclopaedia britannica inc 16 apr 2012 writing and composition much of album was written in band members homes in summer of 1998 kiedis and frusciante often spent days together discussing song creation guitar riffs and lyrical content bass and percussion aspects of record were constructed through jam sessions and individual work of flea and drummer chad smith kiedis and sloman 2004 pp 401 406 most of material and lyrics throughout songs in album came from personal and professional turmoil that different members of band went through were currently going through at time this resulted in sensitive approach that one might not expect from a band whose followers are skate punks and fraternity boys anthony kiedis s main point behind this album was to tell tales of wandering souls who ve lost their way searching for american dream in california californication s lyrics were derived from anthony kiedis ideas outlooks and perceptions of life and its meaning porcelain resulted from kiedis s meeting with a young mother at ymca who was attempting to battle her alcohol addiction while living with her infant daughter kiedis and sloman 2004 p 404 kiedis also had a love interest in logan a fashion designer whom kiedis met while she was working in new york city kiedis involvement with logan influenced his multiple examinations of love throughout californication in songs such as porcelain and this velvet glove sarcasm was a concept that kiedis had dealt with in past and he ultimately crafted a song around it he was inspired by former bandmate dave navarro whom he considered to be king of sarcasm kiedis and sloman 2004 p 409 frusciante approached guitar line present in scar tissue as an attempt to use two notes that are played far apart but produce a cool rhythm blackett matt september 1999 return of prodigal son guitar player he had explored this technique on his first solo album 1994 s niandra lades and usually just a t shirt frusciante considers scar tissue to be a very simple example of technique but i think it s a style that sounds like me guitarist made use of slide guitar playing for solos in song song emit which is summer time spelled backwards was inspired by anthony s brief relationship with melanie c of spice girls get on top a song which contains significant use of a wah pedal was formed after a jam session conducted shortly after frusciante had listened to public enemy i came up with rhythm to song on way to rehearsal just tapping it out with my foot understated guitar solo played in middle of song was originally intended to be more noticeable according to frusciante who was playing screaming guitar solos he changed his thought process after listening to steve howe s guitar solo on yes siberian band sounded really big and they re playing really fast and then this clean guitar solo comes out over on top it s really beautiful like it s on its own sort of shelf for get on top i wanted to play something that contrasted between solo and background savior a song found towards end of album features heavy effects most notably an electro harmonix micro synth with 16 second delay frusciante notes that sound is directly inspired by eric clapton s playing in cream if you listen to actual notes they re like a clapton solo they just don t sound like it because of effects hit around world which harkens back to chili peppers funk influenced sound was constructed by frusciante at his home rhythm and beat however are intricate this required him to play song with rest of band rather than alone for them to understand it bass lick was composed in maybe 15 minutes according to frusciante flea is best bass player in world his sense of timing and way he thinks is so crazy title track of album was among most difficult for band to complete frusciante felt compelled to write an appropriate guitar ensemble that would appropriately complement poignant lyrical content but encountered difficulty kiedis and sloman 2004 p 407 song was barely making progress and would have been scrapped had it not been for kiedis urgency to include it on album frusciante completed final riff two days before recording after drawing inspiration from cure s soundtrack song to carnage visors title track was intended to represent californian lifestyles and more specifically fake nature which is associated with much of hollywood it references kurt cobain of nirvana and uses considerable imagery to capture evocative nature of california record was a change of style for chili peppers especially compared to their previous album one hot minute which combined various elements of heavy metal and psychedelic rock although californication still contains some funk rock songs such as around world get on top i like dirt purple stain and right on time it leaned towards more melodic riffs for example scar tissue and otherside and focused on songs with implemented structure rather than jams outtakes album featured a few outtakes that didn t appear on studio album gong li and instrumental 1 were released on scar tissue single instrumental teatro jam was released on around world single while how strong was featured on otherside single instrumental 2 was released on a bonus disc for album in 2006 itunes

different guitar mixes how strong promotion and release rick rubin had produced their two previous albums however chili peppers decided to look for other producers for californication kiedis and sloman 2004 p 420 and unsuccessfully approached david bowie chili peppers remained with rubin rubin had in past granted chili peppers creative freedom on their recording material this was something they thought necessary for album to be unique and could only occur with his return kiedis and sloman 2004 pp 230 232 320 321 344 424 recording took place at cello studios in los angeles in early 1999
