fraser as team rocket grunt tanner as team rocket grunt taylor james as team rocket grunt derek cheng as team rocket grunt development and production produced as a side project by kial natale dylan innes and lee majdoub concept originated in december 2008 from desire to produce a live action version of a series with natale wishing to focus on grand theft auto and majdoub suggesting a film based upon dragon ball z after another member of group suggested pokemon as a possibility they focused on that concept instead kial quickly wrote a script for short film while majdoub and executive film producer innes contributed additional material to flesh it out originally intended to be a film in vein of collegehumor s parody productions more scenes were added and visual effects improved due to kial s love for series and his desire for film to be more and more planning of film took four months while filming and production took a year and a half varying crew sizes were used for four different filming periods with majority of filming occurring within one weekend majdoub noted he was surprised at number of people that came forth for auditions that were not actors but fans of series film s tone was inspired by a discussion with editor nicholas porteous about a review of ang lee s film hulk in which a producer theorized that film was seen as a commercial failure because it wasn t dark and gritty like batman begins natale found idea that begins succeeded solely due to its tone insulting to its director christopher nolan and joked with majdoub on popularity of dark series reboots pondering what series would be good for a live action adaptation settling on pokemon due to its undertones of animal rights abuse majdoub wanted to approach film from a completely mature standpoint displeased with current trend of video game to film adaptations they wished to see how far we could take it without being absolutely ridiculous a variety of locations were worked in to give completed project a proper trailer feel title pokemon apokelypse was chosen as nod to apocalypse now due to similarity of shooting ratios with only ten percent of footage actually used though several scenes were shot to add more content to film others using dialogue and one liners from anime series were purposefully shot in longer scenes then cropped down in order to ensure lines did not feel forced and to give a sense that here is a world beyond what is shown in trailer though originally intended to be shown at anime evolution convention in vancouver canada crew ran into technical difficulties at a friend s suggestion film was instead revealed through viral emails on september 14 2010 with sender named professor oak attaching a small thirty second part of film and presenting it as a small part recorded from a secret movie trailer screening satisfied that teaser had sparked interest full film was released on september 20 natale stated that he was impressed by people that had scrutinized preview to determine whether or not it was genuine when asked if they had any plans to produce a full movie majdoub stated that he would like to consider prospects if they could receive assistance with cgi aspects of film however any further production would be up to natale natale in turn added that while he was grateful for positive reviews he had no intention to do further films based on pokemon franchise critical reception initial reaction reaction to film s preview segment was mixed kotaku heavily praised effects undertone and music stating that staff loved it though lamented that an official film of this kind would join a long line of ill advised live action adaptations game informer called it absurd stating that while it was a possible proof of concept film it was more likely completely fake and adding it looks goofy as hell and are sure to get a couple chuckles out of it if nothing else comicsalliance called it somewhere in middle of presenting a better take on franchise and a reminder that some intellectual properties got things right or inherently wrong first time though called effect surprisingly competent and it both generally fun and funny crave online heavily criticized film calling story formulaic and production values threadbare and further adding that they dreaded idea of it inspiring an actual live action film on series in light of capcom s street fighter legend of chun li post release in contrast full film has been well received by media gamesradar praised idea of film stating that if produced it would be best movie since piranha 3d and calling it good enough for grown ups in a further discussion via their pokemon monday cast three editors involved praised film as very well done while one editor stated disdain for appearance of various pokemon in film they agreed that in any live action adaptation creatures would always look weird and that for a film with a lack of budget they were done very well they also praised attention of detail and praised david quast s portrayal of giovanni as well as presentation of recurring anime villains jessie james and meowth editor carolyn gudmundson added that she was uncomfortable with grittiness of production though praised it for presenting out inherent problem of concept behind games and its similarity to dog fighting escapist shared similar sentiments calling film amazing and stating their desire to see mock trailer expanded into a full film despite it being contrary to nintendo s vision of series why can t anything this cool ever come through official channels joystiq commented that it was long long overdue and called completed results delightful questioning why such a project had not been properly attempted years prior kotaku added that while leaked segment hid flaws in film s effects it hurt film by hiding hammy charm of completed project though game informer criticized original segment they heavily praised full film describing it as what franchise could look like if peter jackson martin scorsese and jerry bruckheimer all teamed up topless robot stated that while original preview had nearly sabotaged final production s appeal they called it awesome and described it as taking pokemon battles to its inevitable cock fighting end cinemablend stated that while content was out of place with nintendo s presentation of series they found finished product still pretty cool further praising effects and approach taken towards material references see also pokemon detective pikachu first official live action pokemon film which is based on a spin off video
