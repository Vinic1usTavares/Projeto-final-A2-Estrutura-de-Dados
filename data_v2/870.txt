hemilepistus reaumuri is a species of woodlouse that lives in and around deserts of north africa and middle east driest habitat conquered by any species of crustacean it reaches a length of and a width of up to and has seven pairs of legs which hold its body unusually high off ground species was described in after french campaign in egypt and syria of 1798 1801 but was first formally named by henri milne edwards in 1840 as porcellio reaumuri it reached its current scientific name in 1930 after former subgenus hemilepistus was raised to rank of genus h reaumuri occurs at great population densities and fills an important niche in desert ecosystem it feeds on plant leaves obtains most of its water from moisture in air and sand and is in turn an important prey item for scorpion scorpio maurus h reaumuri is only able to survive in such arid conditions because it has developed parental care of its offspring adults dig burrows which are inhabited by family groups which are recognised using pheromones burrows are deep and woodlice retreat to relatively cool and moist conditions of burrow when surface conditions are unfavourable territorial limit of each colony is marked with a faecal embankment description thumb left h reaumuri at a burrow entrance alt a woodlouse stands on soil surface looking into a narrow burrow entrance trunk of a small shrub can be seen rising near burrow entrance hemilepistus reaumuri is approximately long and wide in common with other woodlice it has seven pairs of legs and a pair of conspicuous antennae it is classified in family trachelipodidae within that family it is placed in genus hemilepistus because of presence of tubercles only on head and nearby parts of thorax h reaumuri differs from other desert woodlice in a number of respects it is crepuscular while other species are nocturnal apart from at highest temperatures it is also positively phototactic is attracted to sunlight while other species are negatively phototactic move away from bright light compared to other woodlice h reaumuri walks in an unusual manner with its body held high off ground distribution hemilepistus reaumuri is found in steppes semideserts and deserts of north africa and middle east and occasionally on margins of salt lakes this has been described as driest habitat conquered by any species of crustacean h reaumuri is most closely associated with loess soils in sahara desert and negev desert although its range extends from eastern algeria to western syria ecology thumb left scorpio maurus is a major predator of hemilepistus reaumuri alt a grey brown scorpion stands on a rock in combative posture its orange tinted claws are opened wide and its barbed tail is raised hemilepistus reaumuri is an important part of desert ecosystem it has been found at population densities of up to 480 000 individuals per hectare which is equivalent to a biomass of 19 2 kg ha in comparison desert mammals are estimated to have a combined biomass of 39 9 kg ha main predator of h reaumuri is scorpion scorpio maurus and it may compose up to 70 of scorpion s diet it appears to be vulnerable to attack only on surface no predators are known to attack h reaumuri in its burrows hemilepistus reaumuri can only escape heat of desert by constructing a burrow which is time consuming and energetically costly one parent must therefore guard burrow while other forages for food h reaumuri can spend up to ten months of year returning to surface to forage which is far longer than species which do not dig burrows such as armadillidium vulgare or armadillo although they will forage at temperatures as high as these woodlice retreat to their burrow when temperature is too high they are also unable to tolerate air with a relative humidity below 6 which often occurs at depths of up to in desert soil in hottest months and burrows are therefore dug at least deep burrows are vertical with a single entrance in diameter and there may be up to 20 burrows per square metre nearly 2 per square foot in favourable areas if a foraging woodlouse cannot find burrow entrance on its return it employs a complex and efficient strategy to find it again it begins with a spirally widening search and develops into a more meandering approach longer it is unable to find burrow thumb right mist rolls over edge of hagadol in negev desert water vapour is an important source of water for hemilepistus reaumuri alt clouds tumble over cliff edges that surround a patch of desert a few small shrubs sprout from dry earth hemilepistus reaumuri has a significantly higher biomass than other herbivores in negev desert making it an important part of herbivore omnivore food chains they spend day provisioning their burrows with leaf material from surface of desert sometimes resting under stones or in crevices of rocks their faeces accumulates on surface and forms a faecal embankment similar to a levee which demarcates extent of home territory of colony in burrow plants artemisia herba alba and scoparium are most abundant bushes in negev desert and seem to make up most of diet of h reaumuri bulk of water intake of hemilepistus reaumuri is by taking up water vapour from saturated air and by eating damp sand water loss is minimised by rectal epithelium which absorbs water ensuring that faeces is drier than food animal consumed evaporation of water through permeable exoskeleton may however provide a valuable cooling effect life cycle hemilepistus reaumuri is only species of hemilepistus to have developed parental care of its offspring and it is only because of this development that species can survive in desert it is monogamous and unusually both parents tend young colonies are quiescent during winter and young individuals emerge in february and march to establish new burrows sheltered sites below bushes are chosen although larger males will often try to pair with a female who has already established a burrow sometimes ousting her male partner anatomy of h reaumuri is not specialised for digging and excavation is a slow process taking place only in early spring first are dug by a single woodlouse which then stops to guard new burrow eventually it will allow one other woodlouse of opposite sex to enter and they then engage in a ritual which often lasts for hours before copulating female bears 50 100 live young typically in may young remain in burrow for 10 20 days being provided with food by their parents on leaving burrow they are wary of other families and adults may catch other adults offspring and feed them to their own but do not normally attack their own children members of each social group recognise each other using pheromones each pair only produces one brood and life of an individual of h reaumuri is typically around 15 months long considerably shorter than 2 4 year lifespans of woodlice from more mesic habitats such as armadillidium vulgare porcellio scaber or muscorum taxonomic history hemilepistus reaumuri was illustrated in volume 21 of researched during napoleon s campaign in egypt and syria of 1798 1801 and dedicated to rene antoine ferchault de reaumur section on crustacea was begun by marie jules cesar savigny but finished by jean victoire audouin after savigny s health deteriorated species was not given a formal scientific name however until henri milne edwards did so in 1840 calling it porcellio reaumuri although initially placed in genus porcellio it was later moved by g h a lund in 1879 to his new subgenus hemilepistus which was raised from a subgenus of porcellio to rank of genus by karl wilhelm verhoeff in 1930 several species names that were previously thought to be synonyms of h reaumuri have been re examined and found to refer to a species in a different family now known as porcellio notes references external links description de l egypte category trachelipodidae category crustaceans described
