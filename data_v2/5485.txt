expressing that doctor s fondness for jelly babies growing frustrated by humans distrust of him doctor asks both amy and cleaves gangers to refer to him as john smith this is an alias doctor has used on several occasions beginning with wheel in space 1968 production writing matthew graham was originally scheduled to write a single episode for previous series but withdrew because he did not have enough time to finish script showrunner steven moffat e mailed him asking for him to write for next series and graham agreed when two met moffat said he would like episodes to lead into mid series finale and that it should deal with avatars that rebel after graham had finished his script moffat had idea of what would need to happen at end of almost people to lead into next episode and gave graham premise for cliffhanger which graham loved with almost people graham avoided creating similar situations that had happened in rebel flesh he originally intended on setting almost people in a different location to throw everybody but decided that would be unnecessary graham found writing for two doctors easy as matt smith s doctor had a constant internal dialogue and was always finishing his own sentences he wanted each character to be different and did not want all of them to become evil and doctor would help them discover their humanity graham wanted jennifer to be antagonist as he liked idea of quietest character becoming most evil original script explained that she has a perfect memory and so her ganger was able to remember every terrible thing that had happened to flesh hickman p 81 several other sequences were cut from final version of almost people in original script doctor quizzes flesh doctor about events of mind of evil 1971 and mentions former companions jo grant sarah jane smith romana rose tyler martha jones and donna noble hickman p 80 there was also a montage of happy memories of doctor s life stored in flesh doctor which included flashbacks of previous episodes and serials of show as well as events that had not transpired onscreen also cut was tardis providing doctor with another sonic screwdriver after he had given it to flesh doctor in a similar fashion to eleventh hour hickman p 116 cliffhanger resolves several plot threads that had been seeded throughout previous episodes of series according to executive producer beth willis amy pond ganger has been acting in place of original amy pond since beginning of series amy claimed she was pregnant in impossible astronaut but denied this in following episode since then doctor has performed several inconclusive pregnancy tests on amy eye patch lady who was later revealed to be named madame kovarian in episode a good man goes to war previously made brief appearances in day of moon curse of black spot and rebel flesh gillan discussed labour scene with her mother and tried to make it really horrific filming and effects thumb right 200px jennifer s monster was inspired by this drawing from alice s adventures in wonderland read through for rebel flesh and almost people took place on 12 november 2010 it was then filmed through november and january 2011 cold temperatures at time were a challenge and caused discomfort crew were concerned that cast particularly three lead actors would fall ill as their costumes were not designed for such weather conditions even so cast remained healthy scenes outside and inside monastery were filmed at caerphilly castle other production problems included director hurting himself and being snowed in crypt where acid container was held was filmed in same set that had been previously used as oval office in impossible astronaut day of moon actors each played their respective gangers with prosthetics applied to their faces for when duplicates faces reverted to original material of flesh for scenes in which both character and their respective ganger was in same shot a double for each of actors was used most of shots showed either character or their ganger speaking over their counterpart s shoulder as only backs of doubles head were made to look similar to actors smith had a voice double and a body double former would read other doctor s lines on set episode also marked first time smith wore prosthetic make up hickman p 77 unique contortions of gangers were achieved through computer generated imagery done by mill hickman p 76 it was originally planned that jennifer would eat buzzer but mill decided only shadows of action would be shown on wall all of this was cut from final episode with exception of jennifer s elongated mouth as she advanced towards him pile of discarded jennifer gangers was originally intended to just be a pile of bodies but it was decided that would be too grim instead life sized dolls were used and computer generated flesh was painted on it giving it a more melted look monster jennifer transforms into at end was created with cgi and a photo of pop singer madonna was used as reference as in image here arms were really sinewy white and fleshy graham wanted creature to have a real face and an alien body he was inspired by a drawing in alice s adventures in wonderland that depicted alice with a long neck sarah smart was filmed in front of a greenscreen maneuvering like monster which was used as reference broadcast and reception almost people was first broadcast in united kingdom on bbc one on 28 may 2011 in united states bbc america delayed broadcast of this episode until 4 june one week later than it was aired in uk due to expected low numbers of tv viewers during memorial day weekend in uk overnight figures showed that almost people was watched by five million viewers on first broadcast final consolidated figures rose to 6 72 million sixth highest viewing figure of a programme on bbc one for that week it is lowest figure for doctor who sixth series episode received an appreciation index of 86 considered excellent critical reception dan martin of guardian thought that it feels a bit uneven though it s worth saying that it s one of those where everything makes more sense on second viewing he also felt that cliffhanger may have overshadowed episode itself however he went on to describe gangers as memorable and an exercise in moral dilemmas he later rated it ninth best episode of series though finale was not included in list gavin fuller of daily telegraph described it as a taut claustrophobic sci fi thriller and as an impressive episode with its neatly realised psychological and body horror both martin and fuller were less generous of jennifer s monster transformation martin commented this dark thoughtful story is restored to camp running for your life around some corridors and fuller called it something of a pity neela debnath of independent particularly praised smith stating that he excels in his acting managing to be reassuring and threatening hilarious and sinister all within same few scenes however though she praised cliffhanger she thought it eclipsed episode radio times writer patrick mulkern thought that there were points of logic which might be questioned but they were minor points to wrestle with in a largely polished production keith phipps reviewing for a v club gave episode a b and called it a pretty good follow up ign s matt rated almost people 8 out of 10 noting that as a traditional two parter matthew graham wrote a tight and coherent but not entirely scintillating script that managed to flesh out themes of morality and humanity with a couple of interesting touches though he called cliffhanger a perfectly pitched wtf moment he too believed that it detracts from episode as a whole richard edwards of sfx was more critical of episode giving it three out of five stars he stated he did not feel any genuine threat and considered gangers to be uninteresting and predictable however he did praise smith s performance and cliffhanger digital spy listed cliffhanger among five best of doctor who since its revival in 2005 explaining it changes everything you thought you knew about latest series and it s damn creepy references bibliography external links category 2011 british
