thumb upright 1 5 alt a group of divers seen from below two are holding onto anchor cable as an aid to depth control during a decompression stop divers using anchor cable as an aid to depth control during a decompression stop practice of decompression by divers comprises planning and monitoring of profile indicated by algorithms or tables of chosen decompression model to allow asymptomatic and harmless release of excess inert gases dissolved in tissues as a result of breathing at ambient pressures greater than surface atmospheric pressure equipment available and appropriate to circumstances of dive and procedures authorized for equipment and profile to be used there is a large range of options in all of these aspects decompression may be continuous or staged where ascent is interrupted by stops at regular depth intervals but entire ascent is part of decompression and ascent rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas what is commonly known as no decompression diving or more accurately no stop decompression relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation staged decompression may include deep stops depending on theoretical model used for calculating ascent schedule omission of decompression theoretically required for a dive profile exposes diver to significantly higher risk of symptomatic decompression sickness and in severe cases serious injury or death risk is related to severity of exposure and level of supersaturation of tissues in diver procedures for emergency management of omitted decompression and symptomatic decompression sickness have been published these procedures are generally effective but vary in effectiveness from case to case procedures used for decompression depend on mode of diving available equipment site and environment and actual dive profile standardized procedures have been developed which provide an acceptable level of risk in circumstances for which they are appropriate different sets of procedures are used by commercial military scientific and recreational divers though there is considerable overlap where similar equipment is used and some concepts are common to all decompression procedures decompression decompression in context of diving derives from reduction in ambient pressure experienced by diver during ascent at end of a dive or hyperbaric exposure and refers to both reduction in pressure and process of allowing dissolved inert gases to be eliminated from tissues during this reduction in pressure when a diver descends in water column ambient pressure rises breathing gas is supplied at same pressure as surrounding water and some of this gas dissolves into diver s blood and other fluids inert gas continues to be taken up until gas dissolved in diver is in a state of equilibrium with breathing gas in diver s lungs see saturation diving or diver moves up in water column and reduces ambient pressure of breathing gas until inert gases dissolved in tissues are at a higher concentration than equilibrium state and start diffusing out again dissolved inert gases such as nitrogen or helium can form bubbles in blood and tissues of diver if partial pressures of dissolved gases in diver gets too high above ambient pressure these bubbles and products of injury caused by bubbles can cause damage to tissues known as decompression sickness or bends immediate goal of controlled decompression is to avoid development of symptoms of bubble formation in tissues of diver and long term goal is to also avoid complications due to sub clinical decompression injury a diver who exceeds no decompression limit for a decompression algorithm or table has a theoretical tissue gas loading which is considered likely to cause symptomatic bubble formation unless ascent follows a decompression schedule is said to have a decompression obligation common procedures descent bottom time and ascent are sectors common to all dives and hyperbaric exposures descent rate descent rate is generally allowed for in decompression planning by assuming a maximum descent rate specified in instructions for use of tables but it is not critical descent slower than nominal rate reduces useful bottom time but has no other adverse effect descent faster than specified maximum will expose diver to greater ingassing rate earlier in dive and bottom time must be reduced accordingly in case of real time monitoring by dive computer descent rate is not specified as consequences are automatically accounted for by programmed algorithm bottom time bottom time is time spent at depth before starting ascent bottom time used for decompression planning may be defined differently depending on tables or algorithm used it may include descent time but not in all cases it is important to check how bottom time is defined for tables before they are used for example tables using buhlmann s algorithm define bottom time as elapsed time between leaving surface and start of final ascent at 10 metres per minute and if ascent rate is slower then excess of ascent time to first required decompression stop needs to be considered part of bottom time for tables to remain safe ascent rate ascent is an important part of process of decompression as this is time when reduction of ambient pressure occurs and it is of critical importance to safe decompression that ascent rate is compatible with safe elimination of inert gas from diver s tissues ascent rate must be limited to prevent supersaturation of tissues to extent that unacceptable bubble development occurs this is usually done by specifying a maximum ascent rate compatible with decompression model chosen this will be specified in decompression tables or user manual for decompression software or personal decompression computer instructions will usually include contingency procedures for deviation from specified rate both for delays and exceeding recommended rate failure to comply with these specifications will generally increase risk of decompression sickness typically maximum ascent rates are in order of per minute for dives deeper than some dive computers have variable maximum ascent rates depending on depth ascent rates slower than recommended standard for algorithm will generally be treated by a computer as part of a multilevel dive profile and decompression requirement adjusted accordingly faster ascent rates will elicit a warning and additional decompression stop time to compensate monitoring decompression status decompression status of diver must be known before starting ascent so that an appropriate decompression schedule can be followed to avoid an excessive risk of decompression sickness scuba divers are responsible for monitoring their own decompression status as they are only ones to have access to necessary information surface supplied divers depth and elapsed time can be monitored by surface team and responsibility for keeping track of diver s decompression status is generally part of supervisor s job supervisor will generally assess decompression status based on dive tables maximum depth and elapsed bottom time of dive though multi level calculations are possible depth is measured at gas panel by which can be done at any time without distracting diver from their activity instrument does not record a depth profile and requires intermittent action by panel operator to measure and record current depth elapsed dive time and bottom time are easily monitored using a stopwatch worksheets for monitoring dive profile are available and include space for listing ascent profile including decompression stop depths time of arrival and stop time if repetitive dives are involved residual nitrogen status is also calculated and recorded and used to determine decompression schedule a surface supplied diver may also carry a bottom timer or decompression computer to provide an accurate record of actual dive profile and computer output may be taken into account when deciding on ascent profile dive profile recorded by a dive computer would be valuable evidence in event of an accident investigation scuba divers can monitor decompression status by using maximum depth and elapsed time in same way and can use those to either select from a previously compiled set of surfacing schedules or identify recommended profile from a waterproof dive table taken along on dive it is possible to calculate a decompression schedule for a multilevel dive using this system but possibility of error is significant due to skill and attention required and table format which can be misread under task loading or in poor visibility current trend is towards use of dive computers to calculate decompression obligation in real time using depth and time data automatically input into processing unit and continuously displayed on output screen dive computers have become quite reliable but can fail in service for a variety of reasons and it is prudent to have a backup system available to estimate a reasonable safe ascent if computer fails this can be a backup computer a written schedule with watch and depth gauge or dive buddy s computer if they have a reasonably similar dive profile if only no stop diving is done and diver makes sure that no stop limit is not exceeded a computer failure can be managed at acceptable risk by starting an immediate direct ascent to surface at an appropriate ascent rate no decompression dives a no decompression or no stop dive is a dive that needs no decompression stops during ascent according to chosen algorithm or tables and relies on a controlled ascent rate for elimination of excess inert gases in effect diver is doing continuous decompression during ascent safety stop as a precaution against any unnoticed dive computer malfunction diver error or physiological predisposition to decompression sickness many divers do an extra safety stop in addition to those prescribed by their dive computer or tables a safety stop is typically 1 to 5 minutes at they are usually done during no stop dives and may be added to obligatory decompression on staged dives many dive computers indicate a recommended safety stop as standard procedure for dives beyond specific limits of depth and time goldman decompression model predicts a significant risk reduction following a safety stop on a low risk dive no decompression limit no decompression limit ndl or no stop time is time interval that a diver may theoretically spend at a given depth without having to perform any decompression stops ndl helps divers plan dives so that they can stay at a given depth for given time and then ascend without stopping while still avoiding an unacceptable risk of decompression sickness ndl is a theoretical time obtained by calculating inert gas uptake and release in body using a model such as buhlmann decompression algorithm although science of calculating these limits has been refined over last century there is still much that is unknown about how inert gases enter and leave human body in addition every individual s body is unique and may absorb and release inert gases at different rates for this reason dive tables typically have a degree of safety built into their recommendations divers can and do suffer decompression sickness while remaining inside though incidence is very low each ndl for a range of depths is printed on dive tables in a grid that can be used to plan dives there are many different tables available as well as software programs and calculators which will calculate no decompression limits most personal decompression computers dive computers will indicate a remaining no decompression limit at current depth during a dive displayed interval is continuously revised to take into account changes of depth as well as elapsed time continuous decompression continuous decompression is decompression without stops instead of a fairly rapid ascent rate to first stop followed by a period at static depth during stop ascent is slower but without officially stopping in theory this is optimum decompression profile in practice this is very difficult to do manually and it may be necessary to stop ascent occasionally to get back on schedule but these stops are not part of schedule they are corrections for example usn treatment table 5 referring to treatment in a decompression chamber for type 1 decompression sickness states descent rate 20 ft min ascent rate not to exceed 1 ft min do not compensate for slower ascent rates compensate for faster rates by halting ascent to further complicate practice ascent rate may vary with depth and is typically faster at greater depth and reduces as depth gets shallower in practice a continuous decompression profile may be approximated by ascent in steps as small as chamber pressure gauge will resolve and timed to follow theoretical profile as closely as conveniently practicable for example usn treatment table 7 which may be used if decompression sickness has reoccurred during initial treatment in compression chamber states decompress with stops every 2 feet for times shown in profile below profile shows an ascent rate of 2 fsw every 40 min from 60 fsw feet of sea water to 40 fsw followed by 2 ft every hour from 40 fsw to 20 fsw and 2 ft every two hours from 20 fsw to 4 fsw staged decompression thumb technical diver at a decompression stop 400px thumb decompression which follows procedure of relatively fast ascent interrupted by periods at constant depth is known as staged decompression ascent rate and depth and duration of stops are integral parts of decompression process advantage of staged decompression is that it is far easier to monitor and control than continuous decompression decompression stops a decompression stop is period a diver must spend at a relatively shallow constant depth during ascent after a dive to safely eliminate absorbed inert gases from body tissues to avoid decompression sickness practice of making decompression stops is called staged decompression as opposed to continuous decompression diver identifies requirement for decompression stops and if they are needed depths and durations of stops by using decompression tables software planning tools or a dive computer ascent is made at recommended rate until diver reaches depth of first stop diver then maintains specified stop depth for specified period before ascending to next stop depth at recommended rate and follows same procedure again this is repeated until all required decompression has been completed and diver reaches surface once on surface diver will continue to eliminate inert gas until concentrations have returned to normal surface saturation which can take several hours and is considered in some models to be effectively complete after 12 hours and by others to take up to or even more than 24 hours depth and duration of each stop is calculated to reduce inert gas excess in most critical tissues to a concentration which will allow further ascent without unacceptable risk consequently if there is not much dissolved gas stops will be shorter and shallower than if there is a high concentration length of stops is also strongly influenced by which tissue compartments are assessed as highly saturated high concentrations in slow tissues will indicate longer stops than similar concentrations in fast tissues shorter and shallower decompression dives may only need one single short shallow decompression stop for example 5 minutes at longer and deeper dives often need a series of decompression stops each stop being longer but shallower than previous stop deep stops a deep stop was originally an extra stop introduced by divers during ascent at a greater depth than deepest stop required by their computer algorithm or tables this practice is based on empirical observations by technical divers such as richard pyle who found that they were less fatigued if they made some additional stops for short periods at depths considerably deeper than those calculated with currently published decompression algorithms more recently computer algorithms that are claimed to use deep stops have become available but these algorithms and practice of deep stops have not been adequately validated deep stops are likely to be made at depths where ingassing continues for some slow tissues so addition of deep stops of any kind can only be included in dive profile when decompression schedule has been computed to include them so that such ingassing of slower tissues can be taken into account nevertheless deep stops may be added on a dive that relies on a personal dive computer with real time computation as pdc will track effect of stop on its decompression schedule deep stops are otherwise similar to any other staged decompression but are unlikely to use a dedicated decompression gas as they are usually not more than two to three minutes long a study by divers alert network in 2004 suggests that addition of a deep c 15 m as well as a shallow c 6 m safety stop to a theoretically no stop ascent will significantly reduce decompression stress indicated by doppler detected bubble pddb levels authors associate this with gas exchange in fast tissues such as spinal cord and consider that an additional deep safety stop may reduce risk of spinal cord decompression sickness in recreational diving a follow up study found that optimum duration for deep safety stop under experimental conditions was 2 5 minutes with a shallow safety stop of 3 to 5 minutes longer safety stops at either depth did not further reduce pddb in contrast experimental work comparing effect of deep stops observed a significant decrease in vascular bubbles following a deep stop after longer shallower dives and an increase in bubble formation after deep stop on shorter deeper dives which is not predicted by existing bubble model a controlled comparative study by navy experimental diving unit in ocean simulation facility wet pot comparing thalmann algorithm with a deep stop profile suggests that deep stops schedule had a greater risk of dcs than matched same total stop time conventional schedule proposed explanation was that slower gas washout or continued gas uptake offset benefits of reduced bubble growth at deep stops profile determined intermediate stops are intermediate stops at a depth above depth at which leading compartment for decompression calculation switches from to offgassing and below depth of first obligatory decompression stop or surface on a no decompression dive ambient pressure at that depth is low enough to ensure that tissues are mostly offgassing inert gas although under a very small pressure gradient this combination is expected to inhibit bubble growth leading compartment is generally not fastest compartment except in very short dives for which this model does not require an intermediate stop 8 compartment buhlmann based zh l8 adt mb decompression model in galileo dive computer processes dive profile and suggests an intermediate 2 minute stop that is a function of tissue nitrogen loading at that time taking into account accumulated nitrogen from previous dives within logic of model at least three compartments are offgassing at prescribed depth 5 and 10 minute half time compartments under a relatively high pressure gradient therefore for decompression dives existing obligation is not increased during stop a pdis is not a mandatory stop nor is it considered a substitute for more important shallow safety stop on a no stop dive switching breathing gas mix during ascent will influence depth of stop pdis concept was introduced by sergio angelini decompression schedule a decompression schedule is a specified ascent rate and series of increasingly shallower decompression stops often for increasing amounts of time that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from their body during ascent to surface to reduce risk of decompression sickness in a decompression dive decompression phase may make up a large part of time spent underwater in many cases it is longer than actual time spent at depth depth and duration of each stop is dependent on many factors primarily profile of depth and time of dive but also breathing gas mix interval since previous dive and altitude of dive site diver obtains depth and duration of each stop from a dive computer decompression tables or dive planning computer software a technical scuba diver will typically prepare more than one decompression schedule to plan for contingencies such as going deeper than planned or spending longer at depth than planned recreational divers often rely on a personal dive computer to allow them to avoid obligatory decompression while allowing considerable flexibility of dive profile a surface supplied diver will normally have a diving supervisor at control point who monitors dive profile and can adjust schedule to suit any contingencies as they occur missed stops a diver missing a required decompression stop increases risk of developing decompression sickness risk is related to depth and duration of missed stops usual causes for missing stops are not having enough breathing gas to complete stops or accidentally losing control of buoyancy an aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults there are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops diving suit failure in cold water may force diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit duration of stops diver is willing to carry out a procedure for dealing with omitted decompression stops is described in us navy diving manual in principle procedure allows a diver who is not yet presenting symptoms of decompression sickness to go back down and complete omitted decompression with some extra added to deal with bubbles which are assumed to have formed during period where decompression ceiling was violated divers who become symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for decompression sickness and do not attempt omitted decompression procedure as risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances if a decompression chamber is available omitted decompression may be managed by chamber recompression to an appropriate pressure and decompression following either a surface decompression schedule or a treatment table if diver develops symptoms in chamber treatment can be started without further delay accelerated decompression decompression can be accelerated by use of breathing gases during ascent with lowered inert gas fractions as a result of increased oxygen fraction this will result in a greater diffusion gradient for a given ambient pressure and consequently accelerated decompression for a relatively low risk of bubble formation nitrox mixtures and oxygen are most commonly used gases for this purpose but oxygen rich trimix blends can also be used after a trimix dive and oxygen rich heliox blends after a heliox dive and these may reduce risk of isobaric counterdiffusion complications and mitchell showed that when a switch is made to a gas with a different proportion of inert gas components it is possible for an inert component previously absent or present as a lower fraction to in gas faster than other inert components are eliminated inert gas counterdiffusion sometimes resulting in raising total tissue tension of inert gases in a tissue to exceed ambient pressure sufficiently to cause bubble formation even if ambient pressure has not been reduced at time of gas switch they conclude that breathing gas switches should be scheduled deep or shallow to avoid period of maximum supersaturation resulting from decompression oxygen decompression use of pure oxygen for accelerated decompression is limited by oxygen toxicity in open circuit scuba upper limit for oxygen partial pressure is generally accepted as 1 6 bar equivalent to a depth of 6 msw metres of sea water but in water and surface decompression at higher partial pressures is routinely used in surface supplied diving operation both by military and civilian contractors as consequences of cns oxygen toxicity are considerably reduced when diver has a secure breathing gas supply us navy tables revision 6 start in water oxygen decompression at 30 fsw 9 msw equivalent to a partial pressure of 1 9 bar and chamber oxygen decompression at 50 fsw 15 msw equivalent to 2 5 bar repetitive dives any dive which is started while tissues retain residual inert gas in excess of surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive this means that decompression required for dive is influenced by diver s decompression history allowance must be made for inert gas of tissues which will result in them containing more dissolved gas than would have been case if diver had fully equilibrated before dive diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading surface interval surface interval si or surface interval time sit is time spent by a diver at surface pressure after a dive during which inert gas which was still present at end of dive is further eliminated from tissues this continues until tissues are at equilibrium with surface pressures this may take several hours in case of us navy 1956 air tables it is considered complete after 12 hours us navy 2008 air tables specify up to 16 hours for normal exposure but other algorithms may require more than 24 hours to assume full equilibrium residual nitrogen time for planned depth of repetitive dive a bottom time can be calculated using relevant algorithm which will provide an equivalent gas loading to residual gas after surface interval this is called residual nitrogen time rnt when gas is nitrogen rnt is added to planned actual bottom time abt to give an equivalent total bottom time which is used to derive appropriate decompression schedule for planned dive equivalent residual times can be derived for other inert gases these calculations are done automatically in personal diving computers based on diver s recent diving history which is reason why personal diving computers should not be shared by divers and why a diver should not switch computers without a sufficient surface interval more than 24 hours in most cases up to 4 days depending on tissue model and recent diving history of user residual inert gas can be computed for all modeled tissues but repetitive group designations in decompression tables are generally based on only one tissue considered by table designers to be most limiting tissue for likely applications in case of us navy air tables 1956 this is 120 minute tissue while buhlmann tables use 80 minute tissue diving at altitude atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude and this has an effect on absolute pressure of diving environment most important effect is that diver must decompress to a lower surface pressure and this requires longer decompression for same dive profile a second effect is that a diver ascending to altitude will be decompressing en route and will have residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to local pressures this means that diver should consider any dive done before equilibration as a repetitive dive even if it is first dive in several days us navy diving manual provides repetitive group designations for listed altitude changes these will change over time with surface interval according to relevant table altitude corrections cross corrections are described in us navy diving manual this procedure is based on assumption that decompression model will produce equivalent predictions for same pressure ratio sea level equivalent depth sled for planned dive depth which is always deeper than actual dive at altitude is calculated in inverse proportion to ratio of surface pressure at dive site to sea level atmospheric pressure sea level equivalent depth actual depth at altitude x pressure at sea level pressure at altitude decompression stop depths are also corrected using ratio of surface pressures and will produce actual stop depths which are shallower than sea level stop depths stop depth at altitude stop depth at sea level x pressure at altitude pressure at sea level these values can be used with standard open circuit decompression tables but are not applicable with constant oxygen partial pressure as provided by closed circuit rebreathers tables are used with sea level equivalent depth and stops are done at altitude stop depth decompression algorithms can be adjusted to compensate for altitude this was first done by buhlmann for deriving altitude corrected tables and is now common on diving computers where an altitude setting can be selected by user flying and ascent to altitude after diving exposure to reduced atmospheric pressure during period after a dive when residual gas levels have not yet stabilized at atmospheric saturation levels can incur a risk of decompression sickness rules for safe ascent are based on extension of decompression model calculations to desired altitude but are generally simplified to a few fixed periods for a range of exposures for extreme case of an exceptional exposure dive us navy requires a surface interval of 48 hours before ascent to altitude a surface interval of 24 hours for a heliox decompression dive and 12 hours for heliox no decompression dive are also specified more detailed surface interval requirements based on highest repetitive group designator obtained in preceding 24 hour period are given on us navy diving manual table 9 6 both for ascents to specified altitudes and for commercial flights in aircraft nominally pressurized to 8000 ft first dan flying after diving workshop in 1989 consensus guidelines recommended wait for 12 hours before flying after up to two hours of no stop diving within previous 48 hours wait for 24 hours before flying after multi day unlimited no stop diving wait for 24 48 hours before flying after dives that required decompression stops do not fly with dcs symptoms unless necessary to obtain hyperbaric treatment dan later proposed a simpler 24 hour wait after any and all recreational diving but there were objections on grounds that such a long delay would result in lost business for island diving resorts and risks of dcs when flying after diving were too low to warrant this blanket restraint dan flying after diving workshop of 2002 made following recommendations for flying after recreational diving a 12 hour surface interval for individuals who took part in a resort or introductory scuba experience an 18 hour surface interval for certified divers who make an unlimited number of no decompression air or nitrox dives over multiple days and substantially longer than 18 hours for technical divers who make decompression dives or used helium breathing mixes as no specific evidence concerning decompression or helium diving was available these recommendations apply to flying at an altitude greater than or cabin pressure less than an altitude equivalent of 2 000 feet 610 meters nasa astronauts train underwater to simulate weightlessness and occasionally need to fly afterwards at cabin altitudes not exceeding 10 000 feet 3 000 meters training dives use 46 nitrox and can exceed six hours at a maximum depth of 40 12 for a maximum equivalent air depth ead of 24 fsw 7 msw nasa guidelines for eads of 20 50 fsw 6 15 msw with maximum dive durations of 100 400 minutes allow either air or oxygen to be breathed in preflight surface intervals oxygen breathing during surface intervals reduces time to fly by a factor of seven to nine times compared with air a study by another military organization special operations command also indicated that preflight oxygen might be an effective means for reducing dcs risk some places for example altiplano in peru and bolivia or plateau around asmara where airport is in eritrea and some mountain passes are many thousand feet above sea level and travelling to such places after diving at lower altitude should be treated as flying at equivalent altitude after diving technical diving technical diving includes profiles that are relatively short and deep and which are inefficient in terms of decompression time for a given bottom time they also often lie outside range of profiles with validated decompression schedules and tend to use algorithms developed for other types of diving often extrapolated to depths for which no formal testing has been done often modifications are made to produce shorter or safer decompression schedules but evidence relevant to these modifications is often difficult to locate when it exists widespread belief that bubble algorithms and other modifications which produce deeper stops are more efficient than dissolved phase models is not borne out by formal experimental data which suggest that incidence of decompression symptoms may be higher for same duration schedules using deeper stops due to greater saturation of slower tissues over deeper profile specialised decompression procedures gas switching it appears that gas switching from mixtures based on helium to nitrox during ascent does not accelerate decompression in comparison with dives using only helium diluent but there is some evidence that type of symptoms displayed is skewed towards neurological in heliox only dives there is also some evidence that heliox to nitrox switches are implicated in inner ear decompression sickness symptoms which occur during decompression suggested strategies to minimise risk of vestibular dcs is to ensure adequate initial decompression and to make switch to nitrox at a relatively shallow depth less than 30 m while using highest acceptably safe oxygen fraction during decompression at switch deep technical diving usually involves use of several gas mixtures during course of dive there will be a mixture known as bottom gas which is optimised for limiting inert gas narcosis and oxygen toxicity during deep sector of dive this is generally mixture which is needed in largest amount for open circuit diving as consumption rate will be greatest at maximum depth oxygen fraction of bottom gas suitable for a dive deeper than about will not have sufficient oxygen to reliably support consciousness at surface so a travel gas must be carried to start dive and get down to depth at which bottom gas is appropriate there is generally a large overlap of depths where either gas can be used and choice of point at which switch will be made depends on considerations of cumulative toxicity narcosis and gas consumption logistics specific to planned dive profile during ascent there will be a depth at which diver must switch to a gas with a higher oxygen fraction which will also accelerate decompression if travel gas is suitable it can be used for decompression too additional oxygen rich decompression gas mixtures may be selected to optimise decompression times at shallower depths these will usually be selected as soon as partial pressure of oxygen is acceptable to minimise required decompression and there may be more than one such mixture depending on planned decompression schedule shallowest stops may be done breathing pure oxygen during prolonged decompression at high oxygen partial pressures it may be advisable to take what is known as air breaks where diver switches back to a low oxygen fraction gas usually bottom gas or travel gas for a short period usually about 5 minutes to reduce risk of developing oxygen toxicity symptoms before continuing with high oxygen fraction accelerated decompression these multiple gas switches require diver to select and use correct demand valve and cylinder for each switch an error of selection could compromise decompression or result in a loss of consciousness due to oxygen toxicity diver is faced with a problem of optimising for gas volume carried number of different gases carried depths at which switches can be made bottom time decompression time gases available for emergency use and at which depths they become available both for themself and other members of team while using available cylinders and remaining able to manage cylinders during dive this problem can be simplified if staging cylinders is possible this is practice of leaving a cylinder at a point on return route where it can be picked up and used possibly depositing previously used cylinder which will be retrieved later or having a support diver supply additional gas these strategies rely on diver being reliably able to get to staged gas supply staged cylinders are usually clipped off to distance line or shotline to make them easier to find management of multiple cylinders when multiple cylinders containing different gas mixtures are carried diver must ensure that correct gas is breathed for depth and decompression management breathing a gas with inappropriate oxygen partial pressure risks loss of consciousness and compromising decompression plan when switching diver must be certain of composition of new gas and make correct adjustments to decompression computer settings various systems have been used to identify gas demand valve and source cylinder one in general use and found by experience to be reliable is to clearly label cylinder with maximum operating depth of contents as this is most critical information carry demand valve on cylinder and leave cylinder valve closed when cylinder is not in use this allows diver to visually identify mix as suitable for current depth select demand valve at cylinder and confirm that it is demand valve from that cylinder by opening cylinder valve to release gas after mix is confirmed diver will switch over computer to select current gas so that decompression computation can remain correct it is not unusual for deep technical dives to require four gas mixtures aside from bottom gas which is generally carried in back mounted cylinders there is a convention to carry most oxygen rich additional gases on right side and lower oxygen gases on left side this practice reduces chances of confusion at depth and in poor visibility and saves a little time when looking for correct gas several models of technical dive computer can be set before dive with gas mixtures to be used and will indicate which one of them is most suitable for current depth surface decompression thumb alt view through viewing port of a large decompression chamber showing two divers relaxing while they decompress on oxygen using built in breathing system masks fitted inside chamber divers breathing oxygen in chamber after a dive surface decompression is a procedure in which some or all of staged decompression obligation is done in a decompression chamber instead of in water this reduces time that diver spends in water exposed to environmental hazards such as cold water or currents which will enhance diver safety decompression in chamber is more controlled in a more comfortable environment and oxygen can be used at greater partial pressure as there is no risk of drowning and a lower risk of oxygen toxicity convulsions a further operational advantage is that once divers are in chamber new divers can be supplied from diving panel and operations can continue with less delay a typical surface decompression procedure is described in us navy diving manual if there is no in water 40 ft stop required diver is surfaced directly otherwise all required decompression up to and including 40 ft 12 m stop is completed in water diver is then surfaced and pressurised in a chamber to 50 fsw 15 msw within 5 minutes of leaving 40 ft depth in water if this surface interval from 40 ft in water to 50 fsw in chamber exceeds 5 minutes a penalty is incurred as this indicates a higher risk of dcs symptoms developing so longer decompression is required in case where diver is successfully within nominal interval he will be decompressed according to schedule in air decompression tables for surface decompression preferably on oxygen which is used from 50 fsw 15 msw a partial pressure of 2 5 bar duration of 50 fsw stop is 15 minutes for revision 6 tables chamber is then decompressed to 40 fsw 12 msw for next stage of up to 4 periods on oxygen a stop may also be done at 30 fsw 9 msw for further periods on oxygen according to schedule air breaks of 5 minutes are taken at end of each 30 minutes of oxygen breathing surface decompression procedures have been described as semi controlled accidents data collected in north sea have shown that overall incidence of decompression sickness for in water and surface decompression is similar but surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type ii neurological dcs than in water decompression a possible explanation is that during final stage of ascent bubbles are produced that are stopped in lung capillaries during recompression of diver in deck chamber diameter of some of these bubbles is reduced sufficiently that they pass through pulmonary capillaries and reach systemic circulation on arterial side later lodging in systemic capillaries and causing neurological symptoms same scenario was proposed for type ii dcs recorded after sawtooth profile diving or multiple repetitive diving dry bell decompression dry or closed diving bells are pressure vessels for human occupation which can be deployed from surface to transport divers to underwater workplace at pressures greater than ambient they are equalized to ambient pressure at depth where divers will get out and back in after dive and are then re sealed for transport back to surface which also generally takes place with controlled internal pressure greater than ambient during and or after recovery from depth divers may be decompressed in same way as if they were in a decompression chamber so in effect dry bell is a mobile decompression chamber another option used in saturation diving is to decompress to storage pressure pressure in habitat part of saturation spread and then transfer divers to saturation habitat under pressure transfer under pressure tup where they will stay until next shift or until decompressed at end of saturation period saturation decompression thumb part of a saturation system once all tissue compartments have reached saturation for a given pressure and breathing mixture continued exposure will not increase gas loading of tissues from this point onwards required decompression remains same if divers work and live at pressure for a long period and are decompressed only at end of period risks associated with decompression are limited to this single exposure this principle has led to practice of saturation diving and as there is only one decompression and it is done in relative safety and comfort of a saturation habitat decompression is done on a very conservative profile minimising risk of bubble formation growth and consequent injury to tissues a consequence of these procedures is that saturation divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in slowest tissues whereas bounce divers are more likely to develop bubbles in faster tissues decompression from a saturation dive is a slow process rate of decompression typically ranges between 3 and 6 fsw 0 9 and 1 8 msw per hour us navy heliox saturation decompression table depth range ascent rate 1600 to 200 fsw 6 fsw per hour 200 to 100 fsw 5 fsw per to 50 fsw per to 0 fsw per hour us navy heliox saturation decompression rates require a partial pressure of oxygen to be maintained at between 0 44 and 0 48 atm when possible but not to exceed 23 by volume to restrict risk of fire for practicality decompression is done in increments of 1 fsw at a rate not exceeding 1 fsw per minute followed by a stop with average complying with table ascent rate decompression is done for 16 hours in 24 with remaining 8 hours split into two rest periods a further adaptation generally made to schedule is to stop at 4 fsw for time that it would theoretically take to complete decompression at specified rate i e 80 minutes and then complete decompression to surface at 1 fsw per minute this is done to avoid possibility of losing door seal at a low pressure differential and losing last hour or so of slow decompression norwegian saturation decompression tables are similar but specifically do not allow decompression to start with an upward excursion partial pressure of oxygen is maintained between 0 4 and 0 5 bar and a rest stop of 6 hours is specified each night starting at midnight thumb upright 4 graphic representation of u 100 2009

procedure for treating decompression sickness by recompressing diver thus reducing bubble size and allowing gas bubbles to re dissolve then decompressing slowly enough to avoid further formation or growth of bubbles or eliminating inert gases by breathing oxygen under pressure therapeutic decompression on air recompression on atmospheric air was shown to be an effective treatment for minor dcs symptoms by keays in 1909 historically therapeutic decompression was done by recompressing diver to depth of relief of pain or a bit deeper maintaining that pressure for a while so that bubbles could be re dissolved and performing a slow decompression back to surface pressure later air tables were standardised to specific depths followed by slow decompression this procedure has been superseded almost entirely by hyperbaric oxygen treatment hyperbaric oxygen therapy thumb upright 2 alt graphic format of us navy treatment table 6 showing time at depth and breathing gases to be used during each interval and descent and ascent rates us navy treatment table 6 evidence of effectiveness of recompression therapy utilizing oxygen was first shown by yarbrough and behnke 1939 and has since become standard of care for treatment of dcs a typical hyperbaric oxygen treatment schedule is us navy table 6 which provides for a standard treatment of 3 to 5 periods of 20 minutes of oxygen breathing at 60 fsw followed by 2 to 4 periods of 60 minutes at 30 fsw 9 msw before surfacing air breaks are taken between oxygen breathing to reduce risk of oxygen toxicity in water recompression thumb upright 2 alt graphic format of royal australian navy in water recompression table showing time at depth and breathing gases to be used during each interval and descent and ascent rates there are several published iwr tables this one is from royal australian navy if a chamber is not available for recompression within a reasonable period a riskier alternative is in water recompression at dive site in water recompression iwr is emergency treatment of decompression sickness dcs by sending diver back underwater to allow gas bubbles in tissues which are causing symptoms to resolve it is a risky procedure that should only be used when it is not practicable to travel to nearest recompression chamber in time to save victim s life procedure is high risk as a diver suffering from dcs may become paralysed unconscious or stop breathing whilst under water any one of these events may result in diver drowning or further injury to diver during a subsequent rescue to surface these risks can be mitigated to some extent by using a helmet or full face mask with voice communications on diver and suspending diver from surface so that depth is positively controlled and by having an in water standby diver attend diver undergoing treatment at all times principle behind in water recompression treatment is same as that behind treatment of dcs in a recompression chamber although in water recompression is regarded as risky and to be avoided there is increasing evidence that technical divers who surface and demonstrate mild dcs symptoms may often get back into water and breathe pure oxygen at a depth for a period to seek to alleviate symptoms this trend is noted in paragraph 3 6 5 of dan s 2008 accident report report also notes that whilst reported incidents showed very little success w e must recognize that these calls were mostly because attempted iwr failed in case iwr were successful diver would not have called to report event thus we do not know how often iwr may have been used successfully historically in water recompression was usual method of treating decompression sickness in remote areas procedures were often informal and based on operator experience and used air as breathing gas as it was all that was available divers generally used standard diving gear which was relatively safe for this procedure as diver was at low risk of drowning if he lost consciousness decompression equipment there are several types of equipment used to help divers carry out decompression some are used to plan and monitor decompression and some mark underwater position of diver and act as a buoyancy control aid and position reference in low visibility or currents decompression may be shortened or accelerated by breathing an oxygen rich deco gas such as a nitrox with 50 or more oxygen high partial pressure of oxygen in such decompression mixes create effect of oxygen window this decompression gas is often carried by scuba divers in side slung cylinders cave divers who can only return by a single route will often leave decompression gas cylinders attached to guideline at points where they will be used surface supplied divers will have composition of breathing gas controlled at gas panel divers with long decompression obligations may be decompressed inside gas filled chambers in water or at surface planning and monitoring decompression thumb alt decompression tables condensed and printed on two sides of a plastic card padi nitrox tables are laid out in what has become a common format for no stop recreational tables equipment for planning and monitoring decompression includes decompression tables surface computer software and personal decompression computers there is a wide range of choice a decompression algorithm is used to calculate decompression stops needed for a particular dive profile to reduce risk of decompression sickness occurring after surfacing at end of a dive algorithm can be used to generate decompression schedules for a particular dive profile decompression tables for more general use or be implemented in dive computer software depending on algorithm chosen range of no decompression limits at a given depth on same gas can vary considerably it is not possible to discriminate between right and wrong options but it is considered correct to say that risk of developing dcs is greater for longer exposures and less for shorter exposures for a given depth dive tables or decompression tables are tabulated data often in form of printed cards or booklets that allow divers to determine a decompression schedule for a given dive profile and breathing gas in some cases they may also specify an altitude range choice of tables for professional diving use is generally made by organization employing divers and for recreational training it is usually prescribed by certifying agency but for recreational purposes diver is generally free to make use of any of range of published tables and for that matter to modify them to suit himself or herself decompression software is available for personal computers to model decompression requirements of user specified dive profiles with different gas mixtures using a choice of decompression algorithms schedules generated by decompression software represent a diver s specific dive plan and breathing gas mixtures it is usual to generate a schedule for planned profile and for most likely contingency profiles a personal dive computer is a small computer designed to be worn by a diver during a dive with a pressure sensor and an electronic timer mounted in a waterproof and pressure resistant housing which has been programmed to model inert gas loading of diver s tissues in real time during a dive a display allows diver to see critical data during dive including maximum and current depth duration of dive and decompression data including remaining no decompression limit calculated in real time for diver throughout dive dive computer keeps track of residual gas loading for each tissue used in algorithm dive computers also provide a measure of safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned most dive computers will provide necessary decompression information for acceptably safe ascent in event that no decompression limits are exceeded use of computers to manage recreational dive decompression is becoming standard and their use is also common in occupational scientific diving their value in surface supplied commercial diving is more restricted but they can usefully serve as a dive profile recorder controlling depth and ascent rate thumb diver deploying a surface marker buoy dsmb thumb left surface supplied diver on diving stage a critical aspect of successful decompression is that depth and ascent rate of diver must be monitored and sufficiently accurately controlled practical in water decompression requires a reasonable tolerance for variation in depth and rate of ascent but unless decompression is being monitored in real time by a decompression computer any deviations from nominal profile will affect risk several items of equipment are used to assist in facilitating accurate adherence to planned profile by allowing diver to more easily control depth and ascent rate or to transfer this control to specialist personnel at surface a shot line is a rope between a float at surface and a sufficiently heavy weight holding rope approximately vertical shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support weight of all divers that are likely to be using it at same time recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy at their own risk shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from bottom by over inflation of buoyancy compensator or dry suit but not sufficient to sink float if slack on line is all taken up various configurations of shot line are used to control amount of slack diver ascends along shotline and may use it purely as a visual reference or can hold on to it to positively control depth or can climb up it hand over hand a may be used to fasten a diver to a shotline during a decompression stop a decompression trapeze or decompression bar is a device used in recreational diving and technical diving to make decompression stops more comfortable and more secure and provide divers surface cover with a visual reference for divers position it consists of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at depth of intended decompression stops by buoys bars are of sufficient weight and buoys of sufficient buoyancy that trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if divers experience buoyancy control problems a decompression trapeze can be tethered to a shotline or to dive boat or allowed to drift with divers it is effective for keeping divers together during long stops a surface marker buoy with a reel and line is often used by a dive leader to allow boat to monitor progress of dive group this can provide operator with a positive control of depth by remaining slightly negative and using buoyancy of float to support this slight over weighting this allows line to be kept under slight tension which reduces risk of entanglement reel or spool used to store and roll up line usually has slightly negative buoyancy so that if released it will hang down and not float away a delayed or deployable surface marker buoy dsmb is a soft inflatable tube which is attached to a reel or spool line at one end and is inflated by diver under water and released to float to surface deploying line as it ascends this provides information to surface that diver is about to ascend and where he is this equipment is commonly used by recreational and technical divers and requires a certain level of skill to operate safely they are mostly used to signal boat that diver has started ascent or to indicate a problem in technical diving a diving stage sometimes known as basket or diver launch and recovery system lars is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into water lowered to workplace or bottom and then hoisted up again to return diver to surface and lift him out of water this equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment a diving stage allows surface team to conveniently manage a diver s decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at correct depth for decompression stops and allows divers to rest during ascent it also allows divers to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted out of water and returned to deck or quayside a wet bell or open bell is similar to a diving stage in concept but has an air space open to water at bottom in which divers or at least their heads can shelter during ascent and descent providing gases to accelerate decompression thumb rebreather diver with bailout and decompression cylinders reducing partial pressure of inert gas component of breathing mixture will accelerate decompression as concentration gradient will be greater for a given depth this is usually achieved by increasing partial pressure of oxygen in breathing gas as substituting a different inert gas may have counter diffusion complications due to differing rates of diffusion which can lead to a net gain in total dissolved gas tension in a tissue this can lead to bubble formation and growth with decompression sickness as a consequence partial pressure of oxygen is usually limited to 1 6 bar during in water decompression for scuba divers but can be up to 1 9 bar in water and 2 2 bar in chamber when using us navy tables for surface decompression stage cylinders are cylinders which are stored by scuba divers along return route containing decompression and emergency gas this is only practicable where return route is known and marked by a guideline similar cylinders are carried by divers when route back is not secure they are commonly mounted as sling cylinders clipped to d rings at sides of diver s harness divers must avoid breathing oxygen enriched deco gas at excessive depths because of high risk of oxygen toxicity to prevent this happening cylinders containing oxygen rich gases must always be positively identifiable one way of doing this is by marking them with their maximum operating depth as clearly as possible surface supplied divers may be supplied with a gas mixture suitable for accelerated decompression by connecting a supply to surface gas panel and providing it through umbilical to divers this allows accelerated decompression usually on oxygen which can be used to a maximum depth of 30 ft 9 m surface supplied heliox bounce divers will be provided with mixtures suitable for their current depth and mixture may be changed several times during descent and ascent from great depths closed circuit rebreathers are usually controlled to provide a fairly constant partial pressure of oxygen during dive set point and may be reset to a richer mix for decompression effect is to keep partial pressure of inert gases as low as safely practicable throughout dive this minimizes absorption of inert gas in first place and accelerates elimination of inert gases during ascent surface decompression thumb a basic deck decompression chamber specialised equipment is available to decompress a diver out of water this is almost exclusively used with surface supplied diving equipment deck decompression chambers are used for surface decompression described in a previous section most deck decompression chambers are fitted with built in breathing systems bibs which supply an alternative breathing gas to occupants usually oxygen and discharge exhaled gas outside chamber so chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard and require frequent flushing with chamber gas usually air left thumb personnel transfer capsule a dry bell may be used for bounce dives to great depths and then used as decompression chamber during ascent and later on board support vessel in this case it is not always necessary to transfer into a deck chamber as bell is quite capable of performing this function though it would be relatively cramped as a bell is usually as small as conveniently possible to minimize weight for deployment a saturation system or saturation spread typically comprises a living chamber transfer chamber and submersible decompression chamber which is commonly referred to in commercial diving as diving bell and in military diving as personnel transfer capsule ptc personnel transfer capsule or sdc submersible decompression chamber diving bell is elevator or lift that transfers divers from system to work site and back at completion of work or a mission saturation diving team is decompressed gradually back to atmospheric pressure by slow venting of system pressure at rates of about of to per day schedules vary thus process involves only one ascent thereby mitigating time consuming and comparatively risky process of multiple decompressions normally associated with multiple non saturation bounce diving operations a hyperbaric lifeboat or hyperbaric rescue unit may be provided for emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system this would be used if platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking and allows divers under saturation to get clear of immediate danger crew would normally start decompression as soon as possible after launching risk management risk management for decompression sickness involves following decompression schedules of known and acceptable risk providing mitigation in event of a hit diving term indicating symptomatic decompression sickness and reducing risk to an acceptable level by following recommended practice and avoiding deprecated practice to extent considered appropriate by responsible person and divers involved risk of decompression sickness for algorithms in common use is not always accurately known human testing under controlled conditions with end condition of symptomatic decompression sickness is no longer frequently carried out for ethical reasons a considerable amount of self experimentation is done by technical divers but conditions are generally not optimally recorded and there are usually several unknowns and no control group several practices are recommended to reduce risk based on theoretical arguments but value of many of these practices in reducing risk is uncertain particularly in combinations vast majority of professional and recreational diving is done under low risk conditions and without recognised symptoms but in spite of this there are occasionally unexplained incidences of decompression sickness earlier tendency to blame diver for not properly following procedures has been shown to not only be counterproductive but sometimes factually wrong and it is now generally recognised that there is statistically a small but real risk of symptomatic decompression sickness for even highly conservative profiles this acceptance by diving community that sometimes one is simply unlucky encourages more divers to report borderline cases and statistics gathered may provide more complete and precise indications of risk as they are analysed recommended practices practices for which there is some evidence or theoretical model suggesting that they may reduce risk of decompression sickness extended decompression providing that depth is shallow enough that effectively no further inert gas tissue loading will occur more decompression time will reduce risk of decompression sickness but with diminishing returns in practice this can be facilitated by using two decompression computers one is set at least conservative setting acceptable to diver and is used to indicate minimum acceptable decompression and time to surface other is set at a conservatism which diver considers adequate and low risk decompression will normally be done following conservative setting but if circumstances suggest getting out of water sooner less conservative computer will show when risk is at least acceptably low rehydration rest mild exercise during decompression sufficient exercise to stimulate circulation and maintain body temperature is thought to accelerate inert gas washout therefore reducing risk of decompression sickness for a given decompression schedule core temperature recovery surface oxygen breathing use of oxygen or nitrox as a post dive breathing mixture is recommended in cases where incomplete decompression or short periods of omitted decompression have occurred or at any time when there is doubt that decompression was sufficient low exertion during ingassing stage of dive this reduces circulation during ingassing so it will take longer for perfusion limited tissues to reach any specific inert gas loading consequently tissue loading at end of dive will be lower than if diver worked hard this is obviously not always possible and may be logistically undesirable when there is a job to be done decompression algorithms assume and are tested at a high level of exertion so indicated decompression should be acceptably safe even when exertion is fairly intense less exertion will reduce risk by an unknown amount deprecated practices practices considered to either increase risk of developing decompression sickness after diving or for which there is theoretical risk but insufficient data hot tubs showers or saunas after diving exposing diver to a hot external environment immediately after diving will alter decompression stress net result may be good or bad depending on inert gas load and heat stress a chilled or diver can restore impaired circulation to extremities if inert gas load is low this may improve rate of gas elimination but larger inert gas loads might be pushed to point of bubble formation or growth due to temperature effects on solubility which of these effect will predominate is unpredictable and may even vary in same diver in a given instance warming of tissues precedes increase in blood flow so bubbles may become problematic before circulation can remove gas this risk is not amenable to numerical analysis and there are many variables risk is likely to reduce with passage of time lower gas loading and higher initial temperatures of extremities flying or ascent to altitude soon after diving this is known to increase risk as it is in effect further decompression there are specific recommendations to manage risk in such cases in most cases they are equivalent to a long decompression stop on air at sea level ambient pressure before ascending to a higher altitude to ensure that controlling tissues are sufficiently desaturated several rules of thumb have been recommended over years these include waiting until one reaches a specific repetitive group and simple surface intervals based on recent diving history heavy exercise following diving risk is thought to be associated with an increased pulmonary shunt that allows venous blood and bubbles to bypass lungs allowing bubbles into arterial system consumption of alcohol before and after diving alcohol can increase dehydration and heat loss both considered risk factors for decompression sickness use of some drugs diving after scuba or surface supplied diving bubble formation is more likely after significant decompression stress and risk increases with residual inert gas load so deeper freediving and more intense exercise will have a greater associated risk diving after long flights long distance flying tends to leave traveller tired and somewhat dehydrated which is thought to be a factor predisposing to dcs due to less efficient inert gas elimination statistics are insufficient to show cause and effect but about a third of decompression sickness incidents reported annually from caribbean occur after first day s dives diving during pregnancy change in risk of decompression sickness during pregnancy is unknown and it is considered unethical to conduct experiments with an endpoint of symptomatic decompression sickness in pregnant women so data is unlikely to accumulate sufficiently to allow risk to be assessed realistically precautionary principle suggests that risk should be avoided by not diving when pregnant a history of diving during early stages of pregnancy is not considered likely to have adverse effects on fetus but recommendations are to avoid it diving while medically unfit to dive saw tooth dive profile in a saw tooth profile diver ascends and descends a number of times during dive each ascent and descent increases risk of decompression sickness if there are any bubbles already in diver s tissues scottish diving medicine reducing risk of dci increase in risk depends on ascent rate magnitude and duration of upwards excursion saturation levels of tissues and to some extent time spent after returning to depth accurate assessment of increase of risk is not currently 2016 possible teaching of decompression practice basic decompression theory and use of decompression tables is part of theory component of training for commercial divers and dive planning based on decompression tables and practice and field management of decompression is a significant part of work of diving supervisor recreational divers are trained in theory and practice of decompression to extent that certifying agency specifies in training standard for each certification this may vary from a rudimentary overview sufficient to allow diver to avoid decompression obligation for entry level divers to competence in use of several decompression algorithms by way of personal dive computers decompression software and tables for advanced technical divers detailed understanding of decompression theory is not generally required of either commercial or recreational divers practice of decompression techniques is another matter altogether recreational divers are expected not to do decompression dives by most certification organizations though and bsac allow for short decompression dives in some levels of recreational divers technical commercial military and scientific divers may all be expected to do decompression dives in normal course of their sport or occupation and are specifically trained in appropriate procedures and equipment relevant to their level of certification a significant part of practical and theoretical training for these divers is on practice of safe and effective decompression procedures and selection and use of appropriate equipment see also references sources further reading section 2 chapters 13 24 pages 181 350 external links dive tables from
