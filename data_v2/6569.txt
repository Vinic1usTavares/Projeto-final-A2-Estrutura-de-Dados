svalbard treaty specifies that no fortifications and naval bases may be built on svalbard nor can archipelago be used for warlike purposes ulfstein 1995 343 preparatory work of treaty and later state practice has been to enforce that no military activity is carried out on archipelago however treaty as such does not ban for instance construction of air 1995 350 or military installations not regarded as defense works ulfstein 1995 353 there is scholarly consensus that article 9 is unclear but that a military presence should only be established when there is an attack or threat of attack on svalbard ulfstein 1995 354 norway can clearly not use svalbard to make a threat of war ulfstein 1995 359 but retains right to self defense against an attack on svalbard ulfstein 1995 360 however

carries out surveillance there were many protests during cold war from soviet union against norwegian activity on island including purely civil arrangements soviet union issued many memorandums protesting such installations as satellite ground stations and airports and even filming of orion s belt skagen 2005 15 on grounds that it could be a cover for or had potential for being used for military activities sovereignty norway was prior to 1920 extremely active in gaining international support for norwegian sovereignty but following treaty norwegian interest in archipelago dwindled from start of cold war norwegian politicians wanted to avoid bringing islands into superpower politics tamnes 1992 5 this resulted in a policy of avoiding agitating soviet union which again resulted in norwegian authorities actively working against both norwegian and foreign activities on svalbard which could raise tensions compared to mainland relations which were dominated by deterring through nato membership norwegian policy on svalbard was related to calming soviet union similarly while a foreign presence was encouraged on mainland it was strongly discouraged on svalbard tamnes 1992 6 thumb upright map of delimitation border nearly all norwegian activity during cold war resulted in a protest from soviet union which claimed without basis in treaty that archipelago was a demilitarized zone soviet union would protest against any foreign and most new norwegian activity on grounds that it violated article 9 even if it was not remotely related to military activity fear of such a reaction led norway to disallow practically all foreign and innovative use of archipelago norway essentially had a non policy managing svalbard with a defensive and inconsequential reaction every time activity was proposed tamnes 1992 7 norway established a fisheries protection area surrounding svalbard on 15 june 1977 which strictly regulates fisheries but on a non discriminatory basis

soviet union later russia disagreed regarding border between two counties exclusive economic zones in barents sea norway claimed internationally recognized equidistance principle should apply while russia claimed that unilateral meridian line be used issue was resolved with a compromise in 2010 non discrimination treaty ensures that all citizens and companies from signatory countries receive equal rights of access and residence norway may not discriminate based on nationality rights to fish hunt and conduct mining trade industry and maritime activity however these activities may be limited by non discriminatory legislation thus norway is permitted to place regulations and prohibitions on basis of other objective criteria or ban certain activities altogether or in certain geographic areas non discrimination clause also does not ban nationality discrimination elsewhere than in economic activity specifically research and scientific activities do not fall under non discrimination clause a central part of non discrimination policy is mining code of 7 august 1925 ulfstein 1995 137 it is uncertain if code is internationally binding or if it can be amended unilaterally by norway ulfstein 1995 138 specifically commissioner issues licenses to search for minerals and state owned and other owner s land and to register claims to maintain a claim owner must work 1 500 man hours per five years and pay an annual fee of 6 000 norwegian krone however ministry of trade and industry may grant exceptions from work obligation under specific conditions treaty only allows taxation to extent that it covers cost of administrating archipelago and covering services provided to residents tax rate is therefore significantly lower than in metropolitan norway
