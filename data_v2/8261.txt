perfect match for him and in same episode he has liz listed as his emergency contact in an april 2010 esquire interview fey said that one of plots that 30 rock will never do is have liz and jack get together let me put internet at ease liz and jack will never be together alec baldwin was asked if two characters will ever hook up he responded i sincerely doubt it and i think show is better off that way once they cross that line all tension goes out of those relationships and i think lesson we learned about both those characters is that they are married to their jobs and they are married to their work cultural references dr spaceman tells tracy that he is dating squeaky fromme and says that she is a handful fromme is a member of manson family and was sentenced to life imprisonment for

to 8 30 p m timeslot for show s fifth season in november 2010 it was announced that program would move from 8 30 to 10 00 timeslot network moved 30 rock to 10 00 time in order to make room for return of comedy show parks and recreation and debut of new comedy perfect couples many questioned whether or not it was a good decision to move show to 10 00 as it is a low rated show according to nielsen media research mrs donaghy was watched by 5 338 million households in its original american broadcast according to new york magazine staff were most worried about how 30 rock and community another program that airs on nbc s thursday lineup would do in new time change but said that both shows did great episode earned a 2 7 rating 7 share in 18 49 demographic this means that it was seen by 2 7 percent of all 18 to 49 year olds and 7 percent of all 18 to 49 year olds watching television at time of broadcast mrs donaghy was up nearly 30 percent against previous episode christmas attack zone that aired at 8 30 p m on december 9 2010 reviews a v clubs zack handlen noted that jack and liz being married plot was strong enough to carry episode overall as watching liz drive jack crazy is almost always entertaining handlen did not enjoy other two stories from episode citing that jenna and danny s had some good lines and that it was good to see these two characters play off each other but this really needed to get a lot crazier or else have some sort of character development and that third plot was only worth towards opening credits to angie s reality show this was hilarious but everything else was like watching echoes of old gags there wasn t a lot of connective tissue to hold any of this together so it came across as haphazard juli weiner of vanity fair wrote that this was a fine episode about marriage and mistranslation weiner however opined that portrayal of angie jordan here played by sherri shepherd was less than ideal alan sepinwall from hitfix wrote that show is having a strong season with its fifth season but wrote that this episode was not a particularly strong one nonetheless writers can almost always rely on jack liz relationship for both heart and comedy it was first part of episode that made me consistently laugh and it also worked because i like jack and liz and like that show remains committed to a complete lack of romantic tension between them tv guides matt roush was glad that chris parnell returned as his 30 rock character in this episode ian mcdonald of zap2it wrote that jeffrey character made one of best in jokes of episode recapping and misinterpreting liz and jack s will they won t they chemistry kicker though was we re meant to realize that liz and jack are perfect for each other in a completely platonic way mcdonald was positive about jane krakowski and cheyenne jackson s subplot saying it was nice to see them share a story and that their characters have great toxic chemistry bob sassone of tv squad said that ending in which jeffrey character summarized jack and liz s friendship was a perfect summation of heart of 30 rock itself ign contributor matt fowler commented that jenna and danny story felt weak but that angie getting her own show more than made up for it fowler gave episode an 8 out of 10 rating brad sanders of indiana daily student commented that mrs donaghy had a solid comeback while entertainment weeklys breia brissey was glad that show returned strength of mrs donaghy was that however silly all of illogical circumstances of show can be explained with a bit of reason reported caitlin smith of atlantic smith said her favorite scene was when jack and liz have a sit down meeting with jeffrey and h e s counseling newly married couple to avoid bringing their personal relationship into work and reads off a lengthy checklist of things to avoid meredith blake from los angeles times explained that reason series is having a strong season is due to it returning to basics with jack and liz friendship somehow liz and jack are such a perfect if unexpected pair that this theme manages not to wear thin their accidental marriage was almost inevitable logical end to which writers could stretch relationship it does make you wonder what writers can possibly do next but i have faith new york magazine s willa paskin enjoyed tina fey s impression of edith bouvier beale during her press conference elliott hammer of collegian wrote that angie s tagline for her reality show i m angie and i think elegance and attitude are same thing was brilliant dan forcella of tv fanatic commented that t here were moments when i laughed but that mrs donaghy did not come together to make a great episode he noted that jack and liz discovering that they were married didn t bring much new to table jack and liz arguing like this is standard for 30 rock and i got bored of their story rather quickly further in his recap forcella said that ending scene with jeffrey explaining all of things jack and liz have done together as close friends was almost as if they expected us to predict one of them was going to think it was something more than a friendship and then flip it on audience kelsea of new york post noted that when it was revealed that jack accidentally married liz that it fell a little flat reasoning i mean jack accidentally married liz this scene could have reached so many levels of insanity but instead they settled for jonathan s maulik pancholy piercing squeal before moving onto rest of show johnny firecloud of craveonline did not enjoy jenna danny and kenneth plot explaining that it unfolded very strangely and eventually saps a good deal of energy out of show it s a dead end sub plot that s simply useless firecloud gave this episode a 7 out of 10 rating references
