court of rajendra chola i in gangaikondacholapuram during his youth kulottunga participated in many wars serving alongside both rajendra chola i and his successors rajadhiraja i rajendra chola ii and virarajendra chola during this period he engaged in northern campaigns of empire in and around sakkarakottam and vayiragaram where he secured several victories and proved his mettle in warfare sakkarakottam area is identified with present day bastar kalahandi district koraput region which together formed chakrakota province back in medieval times according to kalingattuparani it was around this time that mannar that is king of kings suddenly died and empire was thrown into a state of anarchy until abhaya that is kulottunga returned and restored order teki chellur and pithapuram grants of kulottunga s sons dated in 17th 21st and 23rd years of king s reign state that in absence of king s father rajaraja narendra kulottunga was first crowned as lord of vengi where he obtained great fame as per plates king was later crowned in chola rajya a position said to be not less exalted than devendra indra these events are narrated as a flashback story in chellur grant wherein kulottunga explains to his son prince vira chola that he left vengi to his kulottunga s paternal uncle vijayaditya as he kulottunga desired chola kingdom other sources like vikramankadevacharita a work on western chalukya vikramaditya vi by his court poet bilhana and vikraman solan ula a work on kulottunga s son and successor vikrama chola by poet ottakoothar corroborate these events more or less and both works agree that there was a king between virarajendra chola and kulottunga this king has been identified with adhirajendra and it is after death of this chola king that kingdom was thrown into a state of anarchy according to vikramankadevacharita kulottunga got dislodged from vengi due to some confusion in chola kingdom after death of virarajendra chola even during time of virarajendra chola vikramaditya vi and eastern ganga king rajaraja devendravarman both supported vijayaditya paternal uncle of kulottunga in his claim to vengi kingdom kulottunga is then said to have marched south to chola capital bilhana goes on to state that his patron vikramaditya vi tried stopping kulottunga from ascending chola throne by instead installing adhirajendra vikramaditya s brother in law as king however this arrangement was short lived and kulottunga eventually succeeded in capturing throne historian nilakanta sastri argues against theories proposed by fleet and other similar historians about a hostile invasion of chola empire by kulottunga in sastri s words work vikramankadevacarita does not contain remotest suggestion that kulottunga put his rivals out of way by secret murder or even by open fighting kulottunga s own inscriptions also speak of lack of leadership in chola country at time of his ascension and in his records king claims that he rightfully inherited excellent crown of cholas king s epigraphs poetically claim that he ascended throne to prevent goddess lakshmi of southern region from becoming common property an allusion to illegitimate claims to throne and meddling of affairs by kings of rival kingdoms and to remove loneliness of goddess of chola country adorned by river an allusion to power vacuum in empire thus it was under these circumstances that kulottunga ascended chola throne in 1070 ad and established himself by soon overcoming threats to chola empire according to sastri kulottunga was in his teens or barely into his twenties when he ascended throne military campaigns sakkarakottam when kulottunga was still a prince he participated in many of northern campaigns of his predecessor virarajendra chola in fifth year of his reign virarajendra chola dispatched his army to kalinga and beyond it to sakkarakottam these expeditions appear to have been led by kulottunga who in his inscriptions claims that while he was still heir apparent he overcame treachery of his enemies and by strength of his arm and sword captured herds of elephants at vayiragaram conquered sakkarakottam and graciously took tribute from king of dhara vayiragaram is identified with a few miles off bastar in chanda district and sakkarakottam is area in and around bastar kalahandi koraput region which was called as chakrakota mandala in medieval times dhara is king dharavarsha who was ruler of sakkarakottam during this period treachery that kulottunga speaks of is an allusion to internal politics of empire and schemes of his rivals who sought to deny him his rightful inheritance according to sastri in spite of these setbacks kulottunga was successful in carving out a small principality for himself north of vengi for kulottunga claims that he gently raised goddess of earth residing in land of rising sun and placed her under shade of his parasol just like god vishnu who in his varaha avatar lifted earth western chalukya conflicts western chalukya chola rivalry goes back to beginning of 10th century western chalukyas waged many wars with chola emperors and on each occasion wars ended with cholas chasing their rivals chalukyas out of battlefield occupying their capital with death of their generals or feudatories and levying tribute tailapa ii and his son who were opponents of raja raja chola i and rajendra chola i ended up being defeated at and at respectively jayasimha was defeated in ahavamalla someshwara i suffered defeats many a time at hands of rajadhiraja chola and lost his brother in battle with rajendra chola ii thumb 210px kudala sangama site of many a battle between cholas and chalukyas during period of virarajendra chola after rajadhiraja chola i and rajendra chola ii their brother virarajendra chola defeated ahavamalla someshwara i on not less than five occasions virarajendra chola also put to flight latter s two sons vikkalan vikramaditya vi and singanan jayasimha iii multiple times in battles of kudala sangama virarajendra chola also defeated eldest son of ahavamalla someshwara i and crown prince someshwara ii in kampili and spoiled his coronation ceremony ahavamalla someshwara i seems to have died in reign of virarajendra chola as there is no mention of him in kulottunga s records this is evident from a record of virarajendra chola who in his fifth year states that unable to bear disgrace of his earlier defeats ahavamalla someshwara i wrote a letter to chola calling for war but in end never showed up and instead fled and plunged himself into ocean this is conceded in bilhana s a work on life of vikramaditya vi who claims that ahavamalla someshwara i died around this time by committing ritual suicide by drowning himself in tungabhadra upon his father s death vikramaditya vi approached virarajendra and sued for peace and chola agreed as he saw in him an ally to counter and nullify crown prince someshvara ii accordingly chola offered his daughter s hand in marriage bestowed upon him seven and a half lakh country and made him vallabha chalukyan king vikramaditya readily accepted deal for he had his own plans to overthrow his elder brother which he would eventually accomplish and then usurp throne there was also another contender vijayaditya on whom virarajendra had bestowed vengi towards end of his reign some historians identify this vijayaditya with eastern chalukyan prince and half brother of rajaraja narendra while others like venkayya suggest that this person was yet another younger brother of vikramaditya vi that this vijayaditya was an ally of vikramaditya vi is evident from an inscription of rajadhiraja chola i so at end of virarajendra s reign kulottunga found himself facing vikkalan vikramaditya vi latter s younger brother singanan jayasimha their elder brother someshwara ii and their younger brother or ally vijayaditya it was clear from time kulottunga ascended throne that a confrontation with western chalukyas was imminent as vikramaditya vi could never accept union of chola and vengi kingdoms under same ruler let alone kulottunga s accession for it simply meant an enemy too powerful kulottunga knew this from very beginning and accordingly made preparations for showdown in 1075 76 ad war began with incursion of chalukyan forces into chola territories and two armies met in kolar district what followed was chola counter attack popularly known as nangili episode in ensuing battle chalukyan army was completely routed and chased by chola forces from rocky roads of nangili all way to tungabhadra via vikramaditya is said to have retreated hastily and fled leaving behind corpses of his dead elephants along way kulottunga captured a thousand elephants at navilai and conquered two provinces province of western ganga dynasty and singanam as a direct result of this war navilai has been identified with navale nadu in mysore district and singanam referred to region of jayasimha younger brother of vikramaditya vi word konkana desam country of konkan is substituted for word singanam in some of records kulottunga in his records claims that at end of this war he broke pride of vikramaditya vi and that vikkalan vikramaditya vi and singanan jayasimha had nowhere to retreat except to plunge into western ocean some other records of kulottunga state that vikramaditya vi fled back to his own dominion north of tungabhadra his pride broken and that he vikramaditya vi was happy to be there as chalukya did not go to war with chola for a long time this is conceded by bilhana in vikramankadevacarita wherein he states that after these initial wars there was a long period of peace about half a century between two kingdoms towards end of kulottunga s reign vikramaditya vi occupied vengi for a short while when vikrama chola left south for latter s coronation vikrama chola re acquired these territories a few years after his ascension southern campaigns thumb map of pearl fishery coast on southeast portion of indian peninsula once he finished dealing with vikramaditya vi kulottunga turned his attention to south and first took up cause of bringing old region of pandyas into his fold pandya country never reconciled to chola overlordship and its rulers were a constant source of trouble for chola emperors pandyas made use of confusion in chola country during accession of kulottunga and tried once again to reassert their independence back in days of rajendra chola i pandya country was ruled over by chola pandya viceroys but by time of kulottunga this system had ceased to exist and five pandyan princes from old line rose against king kulottunga could not take this situation lightly as loss of pandya territories meant a serious threat to existence of chola kingdom itself as soon as chalukyan war ended kulottunga

kantalur salai and quilon by 1083 ad kulottunga had successfully subjugated southern regions as far as pandya country annexed pearl fishery coast ancient podiyil mountains in present day tirunelveli and fixed his southern boundary at kottar he did away with old system of appointing chola pandya viceroys and instead built multiple cantonments as far south as kottar near kanyakumari and heavily garrisoned strategically important locations of southern dominions these units were in charge of protecting his interests and collecting tribute but did not interfere with internal administration of conquered territories a responsibility which he left to native chiefs and feudatories his inscriptions belonging to this period are found in cholapuram kanyakumari and kottar vengi vengi kingdom was a bone of contention between cholas western chalukyas of kalyani and eastern gangas from times of rajaraja chola i it was a site for proxy war during times of virarajendra chola who managed to wrest control of it from western chalukyas and bestowed it on vijayaditya paternal uncle of kulottunga it is unclear as to why kulottunga was overlooked in accession of vengi as he would have been rightful heir on other hand it is of interest to note that vijayaditya had briefly sided with rajaraja devendravarman of eastern gangas so virarajendra chola agreed to bestow vengi kingdom on kulottunga s paternal uncle vijayaditya to avoid fighting wars on two fronts that is to avoid engaging both western chalukyas and eastern gangas in any case kulottunga was generous enough to let his paternal uncle usurper vijayaditya to rule over vengi even after he ascended chola throne during this period in 1073 ad vengi kingdom was invaded by kalachuri king of however this was merely a raid in search of riches rather than an invasion for territorial gains and intruders were repulsed by vijayaditya after death of vijayaditya in 1077 kulottunga brought vengi province directly under his control and appointed his sons to rule over it rajaraja chodaganga eldest son of kulottunga was first appointed as viceroy but as per inscriptions prince did not feel at home and returned to chola dominions in south within a year according to teki plates of rajaraja chodaganga vengi province under him lay between in nellore district in south and mahendragiri in ganjam district in north rajaraja chodaganga was followed by his brother vira chola who ruled for six years until 1084 chellur plates of vira chola state that he was crowned in city of jagannatha jagannatha nagari two princes once again governed vengi province alternately for a period of five years and four years respectively they were then followed by their brother vikrama chola who ruled over region until he was made heir apparent in 1118 ad according to pithapuram pillar inscription of dated 1202 ad vengi province became devoid of a ruler and fell into a state of anarchy when vikrama chola left for chola dominions in south towards end of kulottunga s reign vikramaditya vi used this opportunity to occupy vengi during this period however this invasion was short lived and vikrama chola recaptured province and annexed it to chola

monument title mouth of godavari geometry type point coordinates 82 16 type feature properties marker symbol monument title mouth of mahanadi geometry type point coordinates 86 20 kingdom of kalinga was not a single region but rather three distinct countries called utkala or odra north and north eastern parts of odisha kosala or dakshina kosala south west odisha and chhattisgarh and kalinga proper this region comprised whole of present day odisha and northern part of andhra pradesh these three regions together were referred to as kalinga kingdom bordered northern part of vengi and therefore it was only natural for different rulers of kalinga to try and expand into eastern chalukya territory or in case of kulottunga northern eastern part of chola dominions during 11th century kalinga kingdom was ruled by eastern ganga dynasty who invariably became involved in vengi and thereby indirectly in chola politics records of kulottunga contain descriptions of two kalinga wars first war seems to have occurred before 1096 ad as kulottunga first claims to have conquered kalinga in a record dated in 26th year of his reign from brief nature of description regarding first war this expedition seems to have occurred during kulottunga s youth king himself is said to have left throne crossed vengi in north and set fire to kalinga after destroying a number of chiefs first kalinga war seems to have been brought about by kalinga s aggression against vengi war resulted in annexation of southern part of kalinga to chola kingdom this is evident from teki plates of kulottunga s son rajaraja chodaganga whose dominions included region up to mahendragiri in ganjam district in north second invasion took place a few years later sometime before 33rd year of king s reign and is subject of kalingattuparani this expedition was led by his general karunakara tondaiman who defeated kalinga ruler anantavarman chodaganga of eastern ganga dynasty anantavarman was son of rajaraja devendravarman and chola princess described as daughter of rajendra chola identification of anantavarman s maternal grandfather is a controversial topic some historians like sastri identify this rajendra chola with virarajendra chola while others like identify this king as kulottunga according to poem kalingattuparani this relationship did not stop kulottunga from invading kalinga and causing anantavarman to flee chola army is said to have returned with vast booty from this campaign this fact is also borne out by an inscription of king from bhimesvara temple in it is dated in 33rd year of king s reign and states that an officer of king titled variously as and reduced whole of kalinga to ashes destroyed ganga devendravarman in battle with aid of kosala army and planted a pillar of victory in odra frontier so as to raise aloft fame of his king kulottunga chola this chief is none other than karunakara tondaiman as he is said to be from tirunaraiyur nadu and lord of as in poem his personal name is given as and is said to be son of of in tirunaraiyur nadu he is described as a sad vaishnava good vaishnavite and is said to have built a vishnu temple made of black stone in according to poem reason for second war was a response to default of kalinga in its payment of annual tributes to kulottunga by anantavarman another view by some historians like venkayya is that kulottunga took up expedition in order to help his relative anantavarman against north kalinga rebels yet another view is that devendravarman belonged to a collateral line of eastern ganga dynasty and had opposed accession of kulottunga s relative there is an inscription of kulottunga from bhimesvara temple in godavari district that describes a gift by son of so it would seem that latter was a vassal or at least in friendly terms with kulottunga for sometime eelam sri lanka thumb polonnaruwa inscription tamil and sanskrit according to mahavamsa cholas were driven out of lanka in 15th year of vijayabahu which coincides with accession date of kulottunga therefore it would seem that sinhalese king took opportunity to attack chola forces in island nation at a time when kingdom under kulottunga was dealing with multiple revolts and attacks in mainland in 1070 ad vijayabahu attacked chola forces from his enclave in rohana district and defeated them he sent two armies one from via and other via well known route along ganga these armies defeated chola forces or what was left of them and captured anuradhapura and polonnaruwa after his victory over cholas vijayabahu got himself anointed in anuradhapura a few months later he moved to polonnaruwa renamed it as made it his capital and declared himself king of island nation unlike epigraphs of his predecessors like rajaraja chola i rajendra chola i and rajadhiraja chola i that describe details of their expeditions to island nation kulottunga s inscriptions are generally silent in regards to lanka or with regards to any campaigns or wars against sinhalese rulers according to sastri kulottunga was content with keeping chola empire from disintegrating on mainland and was not that affected with loss of island nation it is of interest to note that vijayabahu married daughter of jagatipala a former ruler of rohana after she escaped from cholas and returned to island kingdom jagatipala was originally a prince of ayodhya who had migrated to lanka and become ruler of rohana he was slain on battlefield during lankan expeditions of kulottunga s predecessor rajadhiraja chola i when sinhalese kingdom lost four crowns in quick succession at that time this princess along with her aunt or mother was taken captive by chola forces these events are described in great detail in mahavamsa and in an inscription of rajadhiraja chola i overseas contacts thumb right srivijaya empire around 8th century kulottunga maintained overseas contacts with kingdoms of sri vijaya china and khmer empire renaming of famous harbor of in andhra pradesh as also indicates his interest in trade with foreign countries across bay of bengal in 1077 ad king chola ti hua kialo sent an embassy to chinese court for promoting trade sastri identifies this chola ruler with kulottunga this trading venture seems to have ended profitably for cholas and they returned with over 81 000 strings of copper cash and many more valuables khmer king suryavarman ii builder of famous angkor wat sent a mission to chola dynasty and presented a precious stone to kulottunga in 1114 ad a history of india hermann kulke dietmar rothermund p 125 according to burmese accounts ruler of pagan burma met with chola royal family by sending an ambassador to chola emperor in an inscription in pagan he even claims to have converted chola to buddhism through a personal letter written on gold foils there is also evidence to suggest that kulottunga in his youth 1063 ad was in sri vijaya restoring order and maintaining chola influence in that area virarajendra chola states in his inscription dated in 7th year of his reign that he conquered kadaram and gave it back to its king who came and worshiped his feet these expeditions were led by kulottunga to help sailendra king who had sought help of virarajendra chola an inscription of canton mentions ti hua kialo as ruler of sri vijaya according to historians this ruler is same as chola ruler ti hua kialo identified with kulottunga mentioned in song annals and who sent an embassy to china according to tan song editor of sri vijayan inscription of canton kulottunga stayed in kadaram after naval expedition of 1067 ad and reinstalled its king before returning to south india and ascending throne trade relations and cultural contacts established during reigns of rajaraja chola i and rajendra chola i were actively maintained by kulottunga and his successors in 1089 ad ruler of sri vijaya sent two ambassadors to kulottunga s court requesting him to renew old grants to buddhist monastery chulamani vihara in nagapattinam that was built during period of rajaraja chola i extent of empire chola kingdom remained formidable under kulottunga in his 45th regnal year c 1115 ad except for loose hold over lanka rest of empire remained intact boundary between cholas and western chalukyas was as always tungabhadra river hold over vengi was quite firm and kosala south west kalinga and some parts of kalinga proper including capital modern in ganjam district was under chola rule port quilon on malabar coast was recovered by prince vikrama chola sometime between c 1102 and c 1118 ad towards end of kulottunga s reign when his son vikrama chola viceroy of vengi left south for latter s coronation northern half of vengi kingdom seems to have slipped from his hands and gone to western chalukyan empire under vikramaditya vi according to some historians during this period kulottunga also lost province of gangavadi province of western gangas to hoysala vishnuvardhana latter seems to have attacked and defeated chola viceroy controller of kongu and kannada country administration thumb ruins of ancient city of gangaikondacholapuram kulottunga s capital was gangaikondacholapuram kanchi was next in importance and had a palace and an abhisheka mandapam royal bathing hall from where king issued many of his charters king s inscriptions speak of a highly organized form of fiscal and local administration he carried out a massive land survey which formed basis for taxation he promoted free trade by abolishing tolls or transit duties and came to be known as that is one who abolished tolls kulottunga did away with old system of appointing chola pandya viceroys in southern territories king instead built military cantonments that were in charge of protecting his interests and collecting tribute but did not interfere with internal administration of conquered territories a responsibility which he left to native chiefs and feudatories kulottunga was ably assisted in his campaigns and internal administration by his officials some of whom were karunakara tondaiman described as minister and warrior of abhaya who distinguished himself in campaigns in west against kongas gangas and brahmin kannan of great fortress possibly bana also called who is said to be dexterous in use of his beautiful bow in battle general alias kon who distinguished himself in pandya wars king

political stability of chola power in vengi region social and cultural life in medieval andhra by m krishna kumari p 11 in appreciation of his services emperor conferred on gonka i lordship over 6000 villages on southern bank of krishna river personal life kulottunga s chief queen was dinachintamani others being and tyagavalli copper plate grants state that kulottunga married daughter of of solar race and had by her seven sons according to some historians she is identical with dinachintamani she seems to have died sometime before thirtieth year of kulottunga thyagavalli took place of chief queen upon dinachintamani s demise poem kalingattupparani mentions tyagavalli together with also known as it also states that thyagavalli enjoyed equal authority with king another queen called is also mentioned in inscriptions she was instrumental in renewing grant of in favour of buddhist chulamani vihara at nagapattinam he also seems to have married a pallava princess called mahadevi epigraphs mention three of his sons rajaraja chodaganga vira chola and vikrama chola of which rajaraja was eldest religious attitude empire under kulottunga was secular in nature and king encouraged both saivism and vaishnavism king and his family members continued to make endowments to nataraja temple in chidambaram he was tolerant towards other religions like buddhism and renewed grants made to chulamani buddhist monastery at nagapattinam a history of india by hermann kulke dietmar rothermund p 125 historians dispute identification of chola persecutor of vaishnavite acharya ramanuja with kulottunga one of reasons for this disagreement is because ramanuja is said to have returned to chola kingdom from hoysala vishnuvardhana s court after an exile of 12 years upon chola king s death whereas kulottunga ruled for 52 years some scholars are of opinion that kulottunga was secular through his early and middle years and persecuted vaishnavites towards end of his reign succumbing to saivite pressure there is reason to believe that king encouraged vaishnavism during later years as his records mention him giving gifts to vishnu shrines for example he visited temple in kanchipuram with his two queens and and made benefactions in 40th year of his reign art and architecture thumb right melakadambur karakkoil kulottunga was a patron of arts and architecture poet laureate jayamkondar is said to have adorned his court composition of famous poem kalingattuparani is attributed to him some scholars consider poet to be a contemporary of kulottunga i and ramavataram is said to have been composed during his rule others place him during reign of kulottunga chola ii or iii likewise a few believe that ottakoothar author of three ulas namely kulothunga cholan ula vikraman chola ula and rajaraja cholan ula lived during his reign while others place him during reign of his successors viz vikrama chola kulottunga ii and rajaraja chola ii construction of shiva temple in melakadambur is attributed to reign of kulottunga chola i it is called as karakkoil and is perhaps earliest shrine built in shape of a chariot with wheels and drawn by spirited horses temple contains an inscription of king dated in 43rd year of his reign corresponding to 1113 ad during his time kulottunga now called was a site of intense religious activity streets in city are laid out like madurai square shape hence it is called as siru small madurai kulottunga constructed two temples in siru madurai one called temple for lord siva and other a vishnu shrine called lord perumal temple or perumal temple kulottunga was also on friendly terms with kings of central india who had lord surya for their tutelary deity later inspired by his visits to kingdom kulottunga built several temples dedicated to sun god especially temples at pudukkottai and nagapattinam inscriptions kulottunga s inscriptions mostly begin with introduction pugal madu or pugal former gives details about his conquest over cheras pandyas and vikramaditya vi while latter is even more detailed and includes details of his early life viz his heroics in and and how he came about to wear excellent crown of jewels of chola country an inscription from kanchi beginning with introduction pugal madu mentions his birth star as pusya another inscription of king from temple in chingleput district mentions resale of some lands that were bought in second year of virarajendra chola in his early years king styled himself as rajakesarivarman alias rajendracholadeva we have an inscription of king from kolar dated in second year
