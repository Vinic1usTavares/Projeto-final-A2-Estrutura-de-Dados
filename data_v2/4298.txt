battle of north borneo took place during second world war between allied and japanese forces part of wider borneo campaign of pacific war it was fought between 10 june and 15 august 1945 in north borneo later known as sabah battle involved a series of amphibious landings by australian forces on various points on mainland around brunei bay and upon islands situated around bay japanese opposition to landings was sporadic initially although as campaign progressed a number of considerable clashes occurred and both sides suffered significant casualties although major combat was largely restricted to labuan and around beaufort on mainland while allied conventional operations focused largely on coastal areas around brunei bay guerrilla forces consisting of dayak tribesmen and small numbers of allied personnel from services reconnaissance department fought an unconventional campaign in interior allies were successful in seizing control of region nevertheless many of strategic gains that possession of north borneo provided were ultimately negated by sudden conclusion of war in august 1945 background strategic situation and planning codenamed operation oboe six battle was part of second phase of allied operations to capture island of borneo north borneo had been occupied by troops from imperial japanese army since early 1942 following japanese invasion of borneo prior to this area had been a british territorial possession following its occupation area s oil resources had been exploited for japanese war effort island s population had also been subjected to harsh occupation policies this had led to a revolt at jesselton in late 1943 which was suppressed by japanese with heavy civilian casualties first stage of allied campaign in borneo had begun in may 1945 when a brigade sized force had been put ashore on tarakan on north eastern side of borneo operation in north borneo was planned by general douglas macarthur s south west pacific area command designed with three phases preparatory bombardment forced landings and an advance objective of allied operation was to establish an advanced fleet base for british pacific fleet in brunei bay which offered allies a deep water port to enable subsequent naval operations further objectives included capturing vast oil and rubber supplies available in area and re establishing british civil administration it was also intended that labuan would be secured to control entrance to brunei bay and would be developed as an airbase in planning phase of operation allied high commands differed in their opinions about necessity of securing brunei with british chiefs of staff committee believing it would take too long to develop area for it to be developed for it to be used in operations they were also concerned that it would divert british pacific fleet from main theatre of operations off japan and instead favoured establishing a fleet base in philippines united states joint chiefs of staff however approved operation believing that it could support future operations in south east asia 300px thumb right a map showing movements of main australian infantry units in north borneo in preparation for landings commencing in march allied services reconnaissance department also known as special operations australia began operation agas in north borneo and operation semut in sarawak these were clandestine operations to gather information and organise local dayak tribesmen to carry out guerrilla operations following main landings ultimately five allied parties would be inserted into borneo as part of operation agas while four were deployed under semut preliminary aerial bombardment of northern borneo by australian and us aircraft began on 3 may before being concentrated on main landing areas on 5 june meanwhile minesweepers began to clear sea lines of communication for large allied naval task force that was assigned to support operation this force was designated as task force 78 1 and consisted of australian and us warships under command of rear admiral forrest b royal initially allies planned to launch operations in north borneo in late may but shipping shortages delayed moving assault troops to their staging base on morotai island and resulted in operation being delayed until early june opposing forces a total of 29 000 30 000 men were committed by allies to secure north borneo with majority of ground forces being provided by australian 9th division under command of major general george wootten 9th division consisted of three brigades 20th 24th and 26th brigades however at time of north borneo operations 26th was engaged at tarakan having been detached from division in may 1945 so only two brigades were allocated to operations in north borneo part of all volunteer second australian imperial force 9th division was a veteran formation having previously served in north africa middle east and new guinea prior to borneo campaign division had been resting and reorganising on atherton tablelands in queensland division had experienced a high turn over in personnel following its service in huon peninsula campaign as soldiers were medically discharged or transferred to other units in addition to australian ground troops naval support was provided by united states navy and royal australian navy and aerial support from united states army air force s thirteenth air force united states marine corps and elements of royal australian air force s 1st tactical air force two united states army units 727th amphibian tractor battalion who manned lvts and 593rd engineer boat and shore regiment s boat battalion were also attached to australians meanwhile allied intelligence estimated that there were approximately 31 000 japanese troops on borneo with about 8 800 of these in north borneo japanese thirty seventh army led by lieutenant general masao baba was tasked with defending area and was headquartered in jesselton main japanese units in vicinity included elements of 56th independent mixed brigade consisting of six battalions 366th to 371st along with another independent battalion this brigade was commanded by major general taijiro akashi it had been raised in japan during second half of 1944 and arrived in borneo late that year as area s garrison troops were reorganised for defence against future allied landings by mid 1945 brigade had been heavily depleted by its overland movement from north eastern part of borneo prior to allied landings and was at around half strength its troops were largely inexperienced lightly equipped and were suffering from poor morale japanese air power in region had been heavily depleted and except in java and sumatra was ineffective although there were small numbers of aircraft at keningau and kuching battle labuan thumb left australian troops from 24th brigade landing on labuan on 10 june 1945 two main landings were undertaken by australians in north borneo on 10 june after concentrating at morotai island in may where complex landing rehearsals were undertaken assault force consisting of 85 ships mainly from us navy departed in early june preceded by minesweepers and survey vessels as well as naval attack group first landing was made when troops from two battalions of brigadier selwyn porter s 24th brigade 2 28th and 2 43rd battalions landed on labuan island with a squadron of matilda tanks from 2 9th armoured regiment 24th brigade s third battalion 2 32nd battalion was placed in divisional reserve for initial landing attack was preceded by a heavy naval bombardment from cruisers mortar and rocket ships and attacks by eight liberator heavy bomber squadrons which used anti personnel bombs to target japanese troops around intended beachheads with this support main allied landings were largely unopposed as japanese defenders had withdrawn from beaches on peninsula and muara island had been abandoned completely at labuan australian troops came ashore near victoria and supported by a heavy artillery and naval gunfire support two battalions drove towards airfield light opposition was overcome and town and airfield were secured late on first day after minor clashes with japanese outposts and troops fighting amongst aircraft dispersal bays meanwhile 2 11th commando squadron provided flank support to west despite initial progress fighting on labuan intensified during this time as japanese defenders retreated inland to a heavily fortified position known as pocket and attempted to hold australians along dense jungle ridges and thick swamps 2 12th commando squadron was brought ashore from divisional reserve on 12 june and was given task of clearing outlying areas of resistance that had been bypassed during initial advance on island by 14 june australians had secured island apart from those japanese contained within pocket despite considerable artillery and armoured support a company level attack by 2 28th battalion was turned back on 14 june and as a result further preparatory fires were called upon to soften up japanese defences at this stage of war australian commanders were under strict orders to limit their casualties and avoid unnecessary risks utilising fire support where possible to reduce japanese defences prior to attacking commencing on 17 june an intense three day naval and aerial bombardment was laid down in an effort to reduce japanese defences meanwhile 100 japanese attacked australian brigade s maintenance area and airfield before australians launch a renewed attack on 21 june at this time two companies of infantry from 2 28th battalion assaulted japanese position supported by indirect fire support from sea and air and direct fire support from tanks and flamethrowers australians overwhelmed japanese defenders and cleared remaining resistance from labuan after battle 180 japanese dead were counted bringing total killed during fighting on labuan to 389 against this australians suffered 34 killed and 93 wounded thumb right troops from 2 13th battalion patrolling around miri august 1945 brunei and muara island second allied landing that took place on 10 june consisted of two battalions of brigadier victor windeyer s 20th brigade 2 15th and 2 17th battalions landing at muara island and on mainland peninsula north of brooketon supported by a second squadron of matildas from 2 9th armoured regiment 20th brigade s third battalion 2 13th was held back in brigade reserve meanwhile in interior dayak tribesmen supported by allied operatives commenced their guerrilla campaign on 9 june lightly armed and with only limited training these guerrillas sought to harass withdrawing japanese while avoiding decisive engagement in this role they met with some success but were in some cases forced to withdraw in face of heavy opposition troops that had landed near brooketon on mainland advanced on brunei which was captured on 13 june by 2 17th battalion after several minor section and platoon level actions over several days 2 15th which had earlier secured muara island secured limbang on 18 june advancing by landing craft up river in south west of brunei bay two 20th brigade battalions were now joined by 2 13th battalion which had conducted an unopposed landing at lutong on 20 june supported by spitfire and kittyhawk fighters operating from labuan before continuing their advance down south western coast and then overland passing through miri and seria on their way towards kuching at seria australians found 37 oil wells ablaze having been deliberately lit by japanese defenders as they withdrew and engineers from 2 3rd field company were called up to put out fires a task which took over three months to complete kuala belait was reached on 24 june having secured its objectives 20th brigade then began patrolling operations using landing craft to move quickly along various rivers and streams that punctuated coastline initial priority of japanese troops on mainland was to withdraw inland as a result only minor clashes occurred against japanese rearguards which were generally poorly equipped and inexperienced resistance and aggressiveness amongst these rearguard elements stiffened as australians moved beyond miri generally guerrilla forces in interior carried out their operations separately from conventional forces that focused mainly upon coastal areas however some co ordinated action was achieved during campaign during july guerrillas assigned to operation semut captured marudi on river as part of efforts to disrupt japanese withdrawal from miri a strong japanese counter attack retook village from lightly armed semut operatives after which guerrillas linked up with conventional australian infantry from 2 17th battalion to capture it once again on 15 july during course of their involvement in campaign 20th brigade s casualties were relatively light suffering only 40 casualties throughout late june and into august raaf aircraft including mosquitos and attacked japanese targets throughout north borneo including barges shipping barracks and airfields sinking an 800 ton vessel near tabuan river and destroying several japanese aircraft on ground wirraways were also used to provide tactical reconnaissance and other fighters flew close air support sorties weston another landing was made by allied forces on 16 june on mainland at weston in north eastern part of brunei bay 2 32nd battalion which had previously been held back as divisional reserve forced its way ashore near padas bay after taking weston patrols were sent out to beaufort which was inland due to lack of roads and indefensible nature of railway track that led to town it was decided to advance along klias river while a secondary force moved along padas river as a part of this phase of operation minor landings were made at mempakul on 19 june and at sabang on 23 june by elements of 2 43rd battalion and 2 11th commando squadron was captured same day by 2 43rd while 2 32nd advanced further along padas river and two battalions married up following this reinforcements in form of two companies from 2 28th battalion were transferred from labuan to take over rear area security while plans were made for main attack on beaufort thumb left troops from australian 2 32nd battalion land at weston aboard us crewed landing vehicles allies assessed that beaufort which lay on main japanese avenue of withdrawal was held by between 800 and 1 000 japanese troops seeking to keep key egress routes open on 27 june australians attacked town 2 43rd battalion was assigned task of main assault while 2 32nd battalion was tasked with flank protection despite being hamstrung by torrential downpours and unforgiving terrain 2 32nd battalion secured south bank of padas river while one company from 2 43rd was sent to take town and another marched to flanks to take up ambush positions along route that japanese were expected to withdraw along 2 28th battalion secured lines of communication north of river resistance from japanese defenders was not co ordinated and as a result australians had secured their objectives by nightfall throughout night however japanese launched six counterattacks which eventually broke down into hand to hand combat during course of these actions one company became isolated and next morning 28 june another was sent to aid it by attacking japanese force from rear fighting its way through numerous japanese positions throughout afternoon company reached its objective in early evening and launched its assault killing at least 100 japanese defenders it was during course of this action that private tom starcevich of 2 43rd battalion performed deeds for which he was later awarded victoria cross by 29 june japanese began to withdraw from beaufort in small groups elsewhere on 1 july australian 7th division carried out final stage of allied operation to secure borneo landing at balikpapan on south east coast in north borneo allied forces observed a brief pause while reinforcements arrived 2 3rd anti tank regiment being used as infantry rather than anti tank role for which it was intended arrived at weston on 3 july where it relieved 2 28th battalion which then moved on to beaufort on 6 july australian advance was resumed due to strategic situation it was decided to undertake a slow and cautious advance using indirect fire to limit casualties by 12 july 2 32nd battalion occupied papar and from there patrols were dispatched to north and along banks of river as offensive operations came to an end aftermath following capture of papar australians ceased offensive actions on borneo and situation remained largely static until a ceasefire came into effect in mid august in early august 1945 two atomic bombs were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki and on 15 august japanese emperor hirohito effectively announced an end to hostilities with formal surrender being signed on 2 september 1945 as a result of ceasefire planned allied invasion of japan was no longer required and strategic gains provided by capture of north borneo were arguably negated this included development of brunei bay into a naval base which ultimately never occurred to some extent this has led to claims in australia that oboe operations as well as campaigns in aitape wewak region of new guinea and on bougainville and new britain had been unnecessary and had therefore resulted in needless casualties throughout course of fighting on north borneo australians lost 114 men killed or died of wounds while another 221 men were wounded against this japanese lost at least 1 234 men while 130 had been captured on top of this a further 1 800 japanese were estimated to have been killed by guerrilla forces operating in interior many of these were japanese troops who were withdrawing inland following conventional landings on coast who were ambushed by guerrillas or attacked by allied airstrikes directed by these forces these forces also occupied large areas in sarawak and southern parts of north borneo by end of hostilities thumb burning oil wells at seria after fighting was over australians began task for establishing british civil administration rebuilding infrastructure that had been damaged and providing for civilians that had been displaced in fighting this proved to be a significant undertaking with 9th division working to establish hospitals dispensaries and schools sanitation and drainage had not been provided by japanese and local population was suffering from disease and was malnourished infrastructure was re built by australian engineers while 9th division medical personnel provided medical aid directly to locals north borneo railway was also re established houses that were destroyed in pre invasion bombardment and later fighting were also rebuilt following ceasefire there were still a large number of japanese troops in north borneo by october 1945 it was estimated that there were over 21 000 japanese soldiers and civilians still in north borneo and 9th division was made responsible for organising surrender provisioning and protection of these personnel they were also tasked with liberating allied civilian internees and prisoners of war that were being held at batu lintang camp in kuching sarawak and with disarming guerrillas that had been assigned to operations agas and semut as civil administration was slowly restored in october 1945 australian demobilisation process began initially this process was slow as there were few troops able to relieve australian forces in borneo and as such only long service personnel were released for return to australia 9th division remained in north borneo performing garrison duties until january 1946 when it was relieved by 32nd indian brigade and subsequently disbanded for majority of 9th division s personnel a return to civilian life followed however as part of australia s contribution to occupation of japan a number of men from 9th division were transferred to 67th battalion which was being formed as part of 34th brigade according to australian war memorial such was relationship formed between 9th division and civilian population of north borneo that division s unit colour patch was incorporated into coat of arms of colony of british borneo following war remaining as such until 1963 when region was subsumed by
