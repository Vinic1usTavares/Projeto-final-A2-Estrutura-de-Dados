specifically for xbox 360 controller in an attempt to circumvent issues present in previous console rts ensemble was closed by microsoft before game s release but soon after robot entertainment was founded by many of ensemble s former employees this new company continued to support halo wars with updates and downloadable content halo wars received generally positive reviews reviewers lauded game

worldwide through march 2009 making it best selling console real time strategy game to date an enhanced version of game halo wars definitive edition was released for windows and xbox one in december 2016 halo wars 2 a sequel developed by 343 industries and creative assembly was released in february 2017 gameplay thumb left in halo wars special units known as leaders can turn tide of battle here prophet of regret a covenant leader calls down a cleansing ability from an orbiting ship to decimate enemy human forces alt units battle on a plain on left portion of frame are curved metallic vehicles and units of covenant on right are an assortment of human tanks angular accented with green in background are tall pine trees and a glowing alien structure halo wars is a real time strategy rts video game developed exclusively for xbox 360 console in which players command armies from a bird s eye view of battlefield game focuses on military combat but contains streamlined resource management and base construction elements it was designed with xbox 360 controller in mind for example a button is used for selecting units a single tap of button selects one unit while a double tap selects all units of same type d pad navigates to current battles and cycles through bases while right analog stick adjusts camera angle a radial menu is used for base construction halo wars features a story based military campaign game mode that can be played alone or cooperatively over xbox live service a plotless multiplayer option called skirmish mode lets players compete against human or computer controlled opponents game features two factions players can control human united nations space command unsc as captain cutter sergeant forge or professor anders and alien covenant as prophet of regret arbiter or brute chieftain each faction has different units strengths and special abilities there are three selectable leaders for each side chosen leader allows use of specific units and upgrades during play while covenant leaders appear on battlefield as units human leaders do not combat in halo wars is balanced by a rock paper scissors system in general ground vehicles are effective in combat against infantry infantry are effective against aircraft and aircraft are effective against vehicles most units have a unique special ability for example human marines throw grenades while warthog vehicle can run over enemies humans have access to their ship spirit of fire and its special abilities such as a powerful coilgun called a m a c magnetic accelerator cannon covenant units are generally weaker than their unsc counterparts but can use inexpensive and powerful defensive shield generators to add protection to their bases players establish their armies by building and expanding bases these are used to train units and to allocate resources to research of upgrades and technologies there are a limited number of potential locations for bases on each scenario or map making base fortification and defense a priority a player is defeated if all his or her bases are destroyed unless a new base is quickly established army of a player must also be destroyed to be defeated units are trained buildings upgraded and special abilities activated using resources known as supplies players can find supplies on battlefield or generate them by building supply structures at bases greater numbers of these buildings produce more supplies some structures and upgrades become available only after player achieves a certain tech level unsc can achieve multiple tech levels through construction of reactors with some actions requiring up to level four covenant builds a single temple that allows three upgrades of tech level covenant has one fewer tech level and each upgrade is more expensive destruction of a temple results in loss of all tech until temple is rebuilt each base has a limited amount of space so players must balance their resource buildings with other facilities such as those used to create military units number of units a player can deploy is limited but certain upgrades ease this limit plot setting halo wars takes place in science fictional universe of halo series during 26th century in 2525 a collective of alien races known as covenant attacked humanity declaring humans an affront to their gods forerunners game takes place in 2531 roughly 20 years before events of halo combat evolved six years after covenant invaded colony of harvest human unsc forces are still locked in battle on planet characters commander of unsc warship spirit of fire is captain james cutter gregg berger a strong leader who has earned admiration of his subordinates cutter s lack of political ambition prevents him from climbing ranks further serving under cutter is sergeant john forge nolan north a gruff marine whose devotion to men has caused him to be jailed twice for disobeying orders and engaging in disorderly conduct joining spirit of fires military expedition is professor ellen anders kim mai guest a scientist interested in ancient ruins of mysterious forerunners spirit of fire is operated with help from serina courtenay taylor a super intelligent artificial intelligence ai with a sardonic sense of humor it has been noted that she demonstrates a level of contempt for humans she assists leading covenant search for forerunner technology is a holy warrior known as arbiter david sobolov who covenant leaders prophet hierarchs have tasked with oversight of humanity s destruction prophet of regret arbiter you are unusually quiet what troubles occupy your thoughts arbiter hierarch i do not wish to be impudent but you have charged me with destruction of humanity regret a most noble cause for one with such a troubled past story spirit of fire is sent to ruined planet harvest to investigate covenant activity where cutter learns that covenant has excavated something at planet s northern pole cutter sergeant forge report forge definitely plenty of bad guys down here captain they have found something in ice cutter damn it that complicates our mission anders what have you got anders captain scans on northern polar region shows some interesting covenant activity on surface there s some kind of structure down there serina what do you think they are looking for cutter that s what we are here to find out we are to bring alpha base up to operational status and take control of that site when unsc s main outpost on harvest is captured cutter orders forge to retake it forge captain alpha is toast nothing for me to pull back to suggest you hold that backup for a while cutter we need to turn that around sergeant serina what s our status serina sir we ve got a lot of troops retreating from alpha base if sergeant forge can regroup them our numbers may be sufficient to retake base forge roger that we will round up any and all survivors and get alpha back soon after forge scouts covenant excavation and discovers that they under direction of arbiter have discovered a forerunner facility forge s troops defeat covenant forces before they can destroy installation and anders arrives she determines that facility is an interstellar map and recognizes a set of coordinates that points to human colony of arcadia cutter so all it did was point here anders in thirty seconds i had to examine artifact yes all it did was point at a second star system serina arcadia colony to be precise population a little under three million largely unexplored but apparently quite a vacation resort after repelling a covenant counterattack on forerunner facility spirit of fire travels to arcadia where covenant has begun raiding local cities and slaughtering civilians forge contacts local spartan special forces and assists with evacuation process covenant builds a giant energy shield to hide construction of a gigantic scarab super weapon and their search of forerunner ruins in area but unsc forces use experimental equipment to break through cutter so it s an energy shield that they can deploy on planet anders yes captain we can t see through it but covenant are up to something cutter agreed we need to find out what that is can we use ships cannons and take it out directly anders we may destroy whatever s under there covenant shield technology is susceptible to super heated plasma aren t we field testing some plasma based rhinos serina pillar of autumn inventory shows they have some prototypes anders it might take some time to get right power settings i ll need to be on ground to do that forge what was that blast is revealed as coming from an incomplete yet active scarab serina scarab is incomplete but its head is operational its field of fire prevents any chance of retreat or extraction you ll have to destroy it forge build up our base and army and go kill that scarab scarab is destroyed but arbiter kidnaps anders and escapes planet arbiter you will come with me anders stop forge anders get out of here anders i ll come quietly if you let him forge live forge and spartans return to spirit of fire and crew follows anders signal to an uncharted planet in another star system serina captain i m tracking her anders transponder it s heading away from planet professor s signal has gone to lightspeed headed for border forge what we have to go after her cutter serina get us underway immediately follow that signal cutter where hell are we serina serina we re in orbit around a planet in middle of actually i m still working on that sir planet s surface is infested by parasitic flood who attack and assimilate any sentient life they encounter serina well that s new and scary these organisms are interesting our database has nothing on their origins or well anything about them really at first glance they appear to be a species of virulent parasitic organisms that thrive by consuming other sentient life of sufficient biomass spirit of fire inadvertently activates a forerunner docking station and enters planet s interior flood board ship and very soon forerunner sentinels appear to cleanse flood threat and also to destroy all unsc forces in process crew discovers planet is actually hollow with a habitable interior and a miniature sun covenant s plan is to activate a dormant fleet of highly advanced forerunner starships inside planet and use them to obliterate humanity regret war with humans will require a great deal many more machines than we can currently muster arbiter i will take what we have regret and leave us defenseless no ancients will provide for us this world shall be birthplace for an invasion fleet beyond imagining enough to crush humans quickly and with ease while forerunner ships are being activated anders escapes through a teleportation device and is rescued cutter decides to destroy forerunner fleet rather than allow covenant to use it anders formulates a plan to detonate ship s faster than light drive in planet s sun as explosion would cause a supernova anders i believe this is our best hope overloaded ftl reactor will cause a chain reaction in sun cutter enough to destroy all ships here before covenant can get a chance to make anything of them anders well put simply captain our reactor will cause sun to go supernova leaving nothing here but dust serina that s weak part of this plan if you ask me we ve no way home without that reactor cutter one problem at a time serina if covenant get their hands on these ships it will mean end of war we ll take our chances here to give humanity some hope before they can prepare reactor forge and spartans are ambushed by arbiter and his elites spartans dispatch aliens and forge kills arbiter reactor is damaged during fight necessitating a manual detonation forge volunteers for suicidal task telling spartans that they will be needed in coming fight jerome 092 sir it s already overheating i ll have to separate core and align them manually when they need to blow forge son i ve a feeling before this over we ll need every last spartan in fight i can do this report back to ship jerome 092 good luck sir it s been an honor spirit of fire escapes just as forge overloads reactor destroying forerunner fleet without its faster than light drive spirit of fire is left drifting in space crew enters cryonic sleep for long term storage as cutter takes a last look at forge s empty cryonic tube if game is completed on legendary difficulty mode serina wakes cutter and tells him that something has happened development design computer game developer bungie conceived halo combat evolved as a real time strategy game in which players would tactically control units and vehicles in a three dimensional environment microsoft acquired bungie in 2000 and game became a first person shooter and killer app for xbox console bungie produced two best selling sequels halo 2 in 2004 and halo 3 in 2007 before separating from microsoft and becoming an independent company once more although bungie is free to produce new intellectual property rights to halo remain with microsoft shane kim head of microsoft game studios said during split announcement that our intent is to continue investing in halo and growing it in 2004 microsoft owned ensemble studios developers of age of empires strategy series began work on game that would become halo wars studio confirmed in april 2006 that it was working on a console based rts ceo tony goodman said we re giving rts games on console a shot we actually spent a whole year just trying to reconstruct how controls would work on an rts game without revealing title goodman described game as being shorter and more visceral than their previous projects halo wars was originally not a halo series title ensemble spent 12 to 18 months working on control scheme using age of mythology engine development team hacked an age of mythology expansion titans and used it as a prototype for control experiments ensemble found that managing age of resources units and buildings was too difficult with console s controller answer to making a pc style strategy game for a console is actually hidden in question jason pace microsoft game studio s lead producer told new zealand herald it s something we believe has held strategy games back from succeeding on console you can t effectively bring a pc style strategy game to console because fundamental game mechanic is tied to mouse and keyboard input devices it s not a question of just changing control scheme to be gamepad friendly you need to adapt underlying strategy mechanic to make sense with new input device senior designer justin rouse said that team kept controls from research they had conducted but scrapped rest in favor of build ing from floor up what we need ed basics core of a strategy game with goal of making first great strategy game on console ensemble streamlined gameplay mechanics game s single resource is produced at each base site which allows players to quickly cycle through their bases instead of micromanaging multiple resources at many locations once developers were satisfied with controls they presented their project to microsoft who suggested that it be turned into a halo game bungie was reportedly not happy about this development ensemble s founder tony goodman stated in a 2012 interview that bungie saw move as whoring out of our franchise although ensemble had to re create all of bungie s assets from scratch bungie had produced a large amount of reference material for halo film adaptation that halo wars team used for inspiration another reference point was art from halo first person shooters however as art was from a forward perspective and halo wars takes place from a bird s eye view team exaggerated shapes to make units recognizable lead designer graeme devine noted that warthog jeep is actually jumping three times as high as it does in halo and it goes four times faster than it does in halo and all these things but it looks same very different between look and accuracy to ensure artistic continuity between halo wars and previous games in series ensemble created a set of guidelines for their artists to follow for example covenant were to retain their curvy organic look while forerunner and unsc were to keep same geometry angles unsc structures and units were given a green tint with gold specular highlights covenant were textured with a repeating honeycomb pattern with small blue lights against a purple base color devine described challenge of developing halo wars as getting halo fans to play a realtime strategy game and getting realtime strategy fans to play a halo game fans of first person shooter series have very strong expectations for how a halo games looks feels and plays halo is all about heroic action to save humanity mega battles across galaxy visceral highly tuned combat and heart pounding tension pace said these themes were considered fundamental to halo experience and so ensemble tried to replicate them for halo wars early in play tests developers watched devoted halo fans play game their feedback led to development of special abilities which according to devine enhanced halo feel ensemble initially considered making flood a playable race but this idea did not progress beyond concept stage according to devine this was largely because flood would have needed to be similar to starcrafts zerg in order to maintain balance with unsc and covenant this did not match flood s role as single scariest thing in galaxy because of master chief s large role in previous games significant effort was expended on spartan units lead designer dave pottinger said design team started out just accepting and embracing fact that spartans have to be coolest unit in game if they re not it s not going to meet halo fans expectations to position spartans as in gameplay team gave them what it considered to be coolest unit ability hijacking enemy vehicles developers hoped players would become attached to individual spartans in campaign and gave each one an individual name skirmish units were left nameless character design of spartans was meant to emphasize their relative inexperience and setting of game which takes place decades before events of main trilogy devine commented on spartans look we felt because it was 20 years earlier these are much younger spartans they aren t quite as experienced as master chief and we looked a lot at combat infantry going into actual wars and typically at beginning of a war especially vietnam war if you look at infantry they re all loaded up they have all backpacks on they have all belts on every single bit of armor is there and they re carrying around lots of armor at end of war they ve lost it all and just carry what they need this is all they have so if you look at our spartans they have more pieces of armor on going into war they have more markings on there more pieces of armor they ve still got belts on they re still carrying around everything ensemble expanded halo universe during game s development in order to create enough units to give players strategic options among new units was gorgon a biped mech that used weapons called to destroy light aircraft however ensemble later realized that gorgon invalidated a rule they had established anything with two legs that walks was an infantry unit instead team added a new aircraft called vampire unsc meanwhile lacked a melee unit to match covenant s hand to hand power ensemble considered using original less advanced spartan mark i suits of armor in keeping with halo lore but once added these units were indistinguishable from spartans in appearance instead they created a lumbering mechanized unit called cyclops a nod to age of mythology time constraints prevented many elements from appearing in final game one such missing feature was a fatality system by which spartans or covenant leaders could inflict massive damage on large groups of units pottinger said that animations while interesting did not mesh with fast paced combat of halo wars and raised balance concerns other elements based on halo fiction did not work in a strategy game although more than 100 people worked on project which cost tens of millions of dollars a covenant campaign was never realized because of a lack of manpower and money announcements thumb devine demonstrates halo wars at 2008 penny arcade expo alt a man wearing a black shirt and jeans and carrying a microphone speaks to a sitting crowd in center of frame is a flatscreen television displaying halo wars gameplay halo wars was officially announced at microsoft s x06 media briefing on september 27 2006 with a pre rendered trailer created by blur studio trailer depicts a group of warthog vehicles searching for missing soldiers covenant elites ambush patrol and a battle ensues involving human and covenant vehicles and infantry trailer ends with arrival of spartan reinforcements gamespy listed trailer in its top 25

shown at e3 2007 which was later made available on xbox live marketplace this video described game s controls user interface vehicles special weapons and new units it also showed a unsc base consisting of an airbase vehicle depot missile silo and other buildings ign next generation and pc world ranked halo wars as one of most anticipated showings at e3 on september 10 2008 ensemble studios announced that it would close after halo wars completion ensemble founder tony goodman and other employees announced formation of a new studio robot entertainment shortly before game s release

19 total time 53 57 halo wars music was composed by stephen rippy composer for all of age of empires games rippy wanted to write new material while maintaining continuity by reusing iconic elements of halo trilogy s music written by martin o donnell and partner michael salvatori consultation with o donnell and salvatori finished before rippy became involved in project but composer sent a compact disc of his work to o donnell halfway through writing process before starting work on halo wars rippy listened to previous halo soundtracks and searched for useful material in discarded ensemble projects i m a big fan of both cataloging that stuff and stealing from it without remorse rippy said sometimes you don t know what you ve got until you really really need it rippy and audio lead kevin mcmullan examined o donnell s tracks to identify elements to reuse in halo wars foregoing his usual method of writing melodies before determining method of sound production rippy built melodies around synthesizer patches or drum loops he felt that scoring for science fiction was a change of pace from his previous work which was written for historical settings rippy began writing music for game in april 2007 some of plot points of halo wars revolve around discovery and i think that was my favorite idea to write to that sense of no one s seen this before he said first two tracks combined repurposed elements from past projects with his efforts to convey halo sound flollo contained musical ideas rippy had experimented with since his last project age of empires iii warchiefs bad here day was first piece in which he tried to incorporate halo sound rippy felt it important to avoid repeating too many old themes because he wanted game to have its own identity however he wanted to continue to incorporate choir and piano elements he believed to be integral to sound of previous halo games in adherence to an ensemble studios tradition tracks are often named after coined phrases and inside jokes rather than in game events by end of 2007 rippy had completed all of gameplay music including end credits battle themes and ambient world tracks in game s skirmish mode music reflects environment rather than warring factions to ensure that character of music changed depending on environment he followed self imposed rules one environment could feature guitars but not piano for instance to musically unify each world he added a short introductory piece containing common elements in contrast with skirmish mode campaign mode contains different recurring melodies for each major character and human ship spirit of fire rippy s most intensive work period was january 2008 when he began writing music for game s cinematics by this point he had been working on score for nine months rippy finished score by february 2008 and after three months all tracks were ready to be recorded although previous live orchestrations for halo games were performed by northwest sinfonia in seattle washington rippy chose orchestra of prague to record halo wars music rippy had been in prague attending recording sessions for age of empires iii asian dynasties and loved both city and sound orchestra produced lower cost of recording in eastern europe was an additional benefit march 10 15 recording sessions involved 24 vocalists and 45 instrumentalists choir and string sections were later overdubbed to enlarge sound in all roughly 65 minutes of halo wars 75 minute score were recorded in prague final touches and production took place in seattle o donnell attended one of mixing sessions rippy used wwise pipeline to create dynamic music that changes with action in game although rippy used wwise s tools only for dynamic music they made audio system setup much easier than in previous ensemble games for each battle sequence musical cue was divided into sections and mixed differently for each section when a cue is triggered an intro plays and then game randomly picks between all of those elements for as long as battle continues rippy explained once it s over an outro plays and then it s back to regular world music it was an interesting way to work and i d like to push it further if there s an opportunity in future four tracks from halo wars were included as a preview on a bonus dvd bundled with halo trilogy complete original soundtracks a december 2008 compilation of previous halo music tracks were mixed in dolby digital 5 1 channel surround sound and packaged with video of recording sessions and five long years trailer soundtrack was released on february 17 as a standalone compact disc and as a digital download aol radio secured exclusive rights to premiere soundtrack early playing a new track at beginning of every hour release pre release playable demo for

definitive edition was handled by behaviour interactive it was made available on december 20 2016 as part of ultimate edition version of halo wars 2 downloadable content after ensemble s closing robot entertainment announced that it was developing downloadable content dlc for halo wars pottinger described support as ongoing rather than a one time effort and compared it to bungie s post launch additions to halo 3 he stated that robot would also work on balance issues bug fixes and other patches first dlc package strategic options added three new multiplayer modes keepaway is similar to capture flag in it players try to capture and hold forerunner units in tug of war players earn points by fielding large armies and destroying enemy units in reinforcement players receive units as reinforcements rather than training them at bases amount of available resources and reactors determines which types of units are deployed and upgrades they can earn strategic options was released on may 19 2009 after a patch that addressed software bugs and game balance issues update garnered criticism for its small size 2 megabytes and high price 800 microsoft points pottinger responded on halo wars forums that game modes were small downloads because they are rules there is some new content but it s obviously a different type of content compared to a map robot released a second dlc package on july 21 2009 dlc dubbed historic battles contains four additional maps and four new xbox live achievements reception halo wars garnered generally positive reviews game has an average of 82 100 on aggregate web site metacritic critics were split on whether halo wars was a successful console translation of rts genre gamespy s allen rausch argued that as halo combat evolved showed that first person shooters could work on consoles halo wars is an rts on a console and it works tom price of teamxbox said that gamers have been waiting a long time for a console rts to get it right and halo wars did so reviewers for official xbox magazine credited ensemble with creating a strategy game that felt absolutely at home on console rather than a poorly shoehorned port of a pc game with clumsy controls 1up s thierry nguyen was neutral about whether it was a good rts game or halo title but called it a solid beginning towards what could be a really good console rts digital trends scott steinberg said that while not perfect halo wars made a strong case for viability of rts on consoles there s certainly potential to have pc holdouts seriously reconsidering hoisting controller peter hartlaub of san francisco chronicle offered a dismissive summation of game as a remedial game real time strategy for dummies and stated that game offered relatively little innovation when compared to other halo titles reviewers generally praised halo warss controls critics who were less experienced rts players such as darren zenko of toronto star appreciated streamlined rts experience in contrast critics such as luke anderson of gamespot said that game lacked depth necessary to attract more seasoned rts players some critics were frustrated by lack of control features specifically ability to create and manage groups of units lack of hotkeys inability to set rally points for different units and need to return to base to adjust production nguyen wrote that finesse maneuvers are more difficult to pull off than they should be brett molina of usa today said that experts would find action oversimplified but that game is an excellent choice for fans of halo universe and players new to real time strategy reviewers for gamespy g4tv and eurogamer stated that controls worked well mainly because developers omitted features to make most options quickly available for example limiting base construction to select areas made sure players could easily find their buildings reviewers considered factions balanced eurogamer s kieron gillen commented that covenant was harder to master especially because campaign served as a tutorial for unsc but no similar introduction was available for covenant however he said two sides were authentically different and each offered its own challenges to players some critics such as nick cowen of daily telegraph wished that flood was a playable faction in contrast ryan geddes of ign disliked flood and appreciated their exclusion will porter of ign uk enjoyed rock paper scissors rts mechanics but said that since game is singularly crap at indicating which units are rocks and which scissors players had to learn which units were best via trial and error an issue that was more prevalent with covenant game s plot was well received reviewers praised game s cinematics and voice acting geddes said story was good but not on par with those of bungie s halo games and that most of characters were stereotypical and somewhat unlikable critics noted that for a strategy game campaign was rather short with only 15 missions nate ralph of wired completed each in fewer than 40 minutes jon wilcox of total video games wrote there s an ebb and flow to gameplay with lengthy chapters cut with shorter punchy ones or time based missions all together creating a surprisingly compelling experience wilcox said additions of performance based medals added replay value to campaign price said that although story and mission structure of game was fairly standard levels that were rote in other rts games seemed more substantial in halo wars reviewers such as geddes wilcox and patrick kolan of ign uk said that lack of a covenant campaign was an unfortunate omission publications judged multiplayer aspect of game well wilcox noted that although multiplayer mode added nothing new to rts games at very least it s a solid experience that expands longevity of halo wars adam biessener of game informer wrote that halo wars gameplay was better against human players as campaign gimmicks and poor artificial intelligence were not an issue mirrors kevin lynch found fault with limited variety of game modes critics generally agreed that ensemble re created halo universe s aesthetic well gillen said knowledge of game universe could alleviate some issues of player ignorance regarding units actions it s not just geek thrill of seeing a scarab in action it s that you understand what scarab means on battlefield trouble he wrote we know which characters are best against tanks and which are probably best in special vehicles nguyen said that although core units meshed well inclusion of ensemble developed units gave halo wars feeling of a generic science fiction title while giving game a mixed review anderson said that authentic looking units and environments went a long way to integrating game with rest of series wilcox commented that with halo inspired menu system and rippy s score before campaign even begins message is clear this is still very much a halo game overall halo wars was judged a fitting final game for ensemble sequel
