thyroid ima artery thyroidea ima artery arteria thyroidea ima thyroid artery of neubauer or lowest thyroid artery is an artery of head and neck it is an anatomical variant that when present supplies blood to thyroid gland primarily or trachea parathyroid gland and thymus gland as thymica accessoria in rare cases it has also been reported to be a compensatory artery when one or both of inferior thyroid arteries are absent and in a few cases only source of blood to thyroid gland it varies in origin size blood supply and termination and occurs in only 3 10 of population because of variations and rarity it may lead to surgical complications structure thumb veins of thyroid gland thyroid ima artery not labeled but region of origin and route are visible 250px thyroid ima artery is an embryonic artery and it occurs because of failure of vessel to close remaining patent open artery has a variable origin it mostly arises from brachiocephalic trunk but may also originate from aortic arch right common carotid subclavian artery thyrocervical trunk transverse scapular or internal thoracic artery it ascends in front of trachea in superior mediastinum to lower part of thyroid gland it differs in size and ranges from as small as accessory thyroid arteries to size of primary thyroid vessels diameter of lumen of artery ranges from artery may be present as an accessory thyroid artery but sometimes appears to compensate for incompetence or absence of one or more main thyroid vessels since it begins from below thyroid gland and ascends upwards it is mostly associated with absence or reduced size of inferior thyroid arteries in such cases it is known as accessory inferior thyroid artery in rare cases artery has been seen to be compensating for absence of one or both superior thyroid arteries in cases where length of thyroid ima artery is shorter artery ends by supplying thymus gland and is known as thymica accessoria function when present thyroid ima s chief supply is thyroid gland though it also supplies trachea artery may extend and supply parathyroid glands an infrequently observed artery it is more frequently reported in context of enlarged parathyroid glands parathyroid adenomas artery ends by supplying thyroid gland or parathyroid glands as a single unit or as multiple branches artery is also found to be only supply of parathyroid gland in rare cases clinical significance artery is only present in approximately 3 10 of population thyroid ima artery is of surgical importance due to its relatively small size and infrequent presence it can cause complications such as severe bleeding in surgery of thorax trachea thyroid or parathyroid glands knowledge of occurrence of artery is especially important during tracheostomy and thyroidectomy because artery is smaller than other thyroid vessels and having an origin from one of bigger vessels a brisk cut while performing surgery may cause complications such as severe hemorrhage and significant blood loss artery if dissected may draw back into mediastinum and further complicate condition by causing hemorrhage and clots in thoracic cavity history thyroid ima artery was first defined by german anatomist johann e neubauer in year 1772 hence it was named thyroid artery of neubauer artery originates lower than inferior thyroid arteries so it is also known as lowest thyroid artery arteria thyroidea ima is latin name of artery other animals presence of thyroid ima artery is also observed in other higher primates artery has been reported in gorillas gibbons macaques and gray langurs variations in origin were also seen it was found to originate from aorta in thorax or carotid in neck references category thyroid category arteries of thorax category arteries of head and neck
