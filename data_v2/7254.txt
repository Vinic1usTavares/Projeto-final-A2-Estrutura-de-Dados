rook corvus frugilegus is a member of crow family in passerine order of birds it is found in eurasia its range extending from scandinavia and western europe to eastern siberia it is a large gregarious black bird distinguished from similar species by whitish featherless area on face rooks nest collectively in tops of tall trees often close to farms or villages groups of nests being known as rookeries rooks are mainly resident birds but northernmost populations may move southwards to avoid harshest winter conditions birds form flocks in winter often in company of other corvus species or jackdaws they return to their rookeries and breeding takes place in spring they forage on arable land and pasture probing ground with their strong bills and feeding largely on grubs and soil based invertebrates but also consuming cereals and other plant material historically farmers have accused birds of damaging their crops and have made efforts to drive them away or kill them like other corvids they are intelligent birds with complex behavioural traits and an ability to solve simple problems taxonomy and etymology rook was given its binomial name by swedish naturalist carl linnaeus in 1758 in his systema naturae binomial is from latin corvus means raven and frugilegus means for fruit gathering it is derived from or meaning fruit and legere meaning to pick english language common name rook is ultimately derived from bird s harsh call two subspecies are recognised c f frugilegus western rook ranges from western europe to southern russia and extreme northwest of china while c f eastern rook ranges from central siberia and northern mongolia eastwards across rest of asia collective nouns for rooks include building parliament clamour and storytelling their colonial nesting behaviour gave rise to term rookery description left thumb rook at cafe marwell zoo rook is a fairly large bird at in length with black feathers that often show a blue or bluish purple sheen in bright sunlight feathers on head neck and shoulders are particularly dense and silky legs and feet are generally black bill grey black and iris dark brown in adults a bare area of whitish skin in front of eye and around base of bill is distinctive and enables rook to be distinguished from other members of crow family this bare patch gives false impression that bill is longer than it is and head more domed feathering around legs also appears and laxer than similarly sized carrion crow only other member of its genus with which rook is likely to be confused additionally when seen in flight wings of a rook are proportionally longer and narrower than those of carrion crow juvenile plumage is black with a slight greenish gloss except for hind neck back and underparts which are brownish black juvenile is superficially similar to a young crow because it lacks bare patch at base of bill but it has a thinner beak and loses facial feathers after about six months distribution and habitat rooks are resident in british isles and much of north and central europe but vagrant to iceland and parts of scandinavia where they typically live south of 60th latitude they are found in habitats that ravens dislike choosing open agricultural areas with pasture or arable land as long as there are suitable tall trees for breeding they generally avoid forests swamps marshes heaths and moorland they are in general lowland birds with most rookeries found below but where suitable feeding habitat exists they may breed at or even higher rooks are often associated with human settlements nesting near farms villages and open towns but not in large heavily built up areas rook also occurs as an eastern species in asia where it differs in being slightly smaller on average and having a somewhat more fully feathered face in north of its range species has a tendency to move south during autumn and more southern populations are apt to range sporadically species has been introduced into new zealand with several hundred birds being released there from 1862 to 1874 although their range is very localized species is now regarded as an invasive pest and is subject of active control by many local councils this has wiped out larger breeding colonies in new zealand and remaining small groups have become more wary behaviour and ecology thumb a rook skull thumb rook is a very social bird in evenings they gather in large flocks often in thousands this is felt by some especially in cities to be disturbing rooks are highly gregarious birds and are generally seen in flocks of various sizes males and females pair bond for life and pairs stay together within flocks in evening birds often congregate at their rookery before moving off to their chosen communal roosting site flocks increase in size in autumn with different groups amalgamating and birds congregating at dusk before roosting often in very large numbers and in company of jackdaws roosting usually takes place in woodland or plantations but a small minority of birds may continue to roost at their rookery all winter and adult males may roost collectively somewhere nearby birds move off promptly in morning dispersing for distances of up to foraging mostly takes place on ground with birds striding about or occasionally hopping and probing soil with their powerful beaks flight is direct with regular wingbeats and little gliding while in purposeful flight in contrast birds may glide more extensively when wheeling about in leisure flight near rookery in autumn flocks sometimes perform spectacular aerial group flights including synchronised movements and individual antics such as dives tumbles and rolls diet and feeding examination of stomach contents show that about 60 of diet is vegetable matter and rest is of animal origin vegetable foods include cereals potatoes roots fruit acorns berries and seeds while animal part is predominantly earthworms and insect larvae which bird finds by probing ground with its strong bill it also eats beetles spiders millipedes slugs snails small mammals small birds their eggs and young and occasionally carrion in urban sites human food scraps are taken from rubbish dumps and streets usually in early hours or at dusk when it is relatively quiet like other corvids rooks will sometimes favour sites with a high level of human interaction and can often be found scavenging for food in tourist areas or pecking open garbage sacks rooks have even been trained to pick up litter in a theme park in france courtship male usually initiates courtship on ground or in a tree by bowing several times to female with drooping wings at same time cawing and fanning his tail female may respond by crouching down arching her back and quivering her wings slightly or she may take initiative by lowering her head and wings and erecting her partially spread tail over her back further similar displays are often followed by begging behaviour by female and by male presenting her with food before coition takes place on nest at this stage nearby male rooks often mob or attack mating pair and in ensuing struggle any male that finds himself on top of female will attempt to copulate with her she terminates these unwanted advances by exiting nest and perching nearby a mated pair of rooks will often fondle each other s bills and this behaviour is also sometimes seen in autumn breeding left thumb egg collection museum wiesbaden germany nesting in a rookery is always colonial usually in very tops of large trees often on remnants of previous year s nest in hilly regions rooks may nest in smaller trees or bushes and exceptionally on chimneys or church spires both sexes participate in nest building with male finding most of materials and female putting them in place nest is cup shaped and composed of sticks consolidated with earth and lined with grasses moss roots dead leaves and straw small branches and twigs are broken off trees though as many are likely to be stolen from nearby nests as are collected direct and lining material is also often taken from other nests eggs are usually three to five in number sometimes six and occasionally seven and may be laid by end of march or early april in britain but in harsher conditions of eastern europe and russia it may be early may before clutch is completed background colour is bluish green to greyish green but this is almost completely obscured by heavy of ashy grey and brown eggs average in size they are incubated for 16 18 days almost entirely by female who is fed by male after hatching male brings food to nest while female broods young after ten days she joins male in bringing food which is carried in a throat pouch young are fledged by 32nd or 33rd day but continue to be fed by parents for some time thereafter there is normally a single clutch each year but there are records of birds attempting to breed in autumn in autumn young birds of summer collect into large flocks together with unpaired birds of previous seasons often in company with jackdaws it is during this time of year that spectacular aerial displays are performed by birds species is monogamous with adults forming long term pair bonds partners often support each other in agonistic encounters and a bird may return to its partner after a quarrel where bill twining an affiliative behaviour may take place voice call is usually described as caw or kaah and is somewhat similar to that of carrion crow but less raucous it is variable in pitch and has several variants used in different situations call is given both in flight and while perched at which time bird fans its tail and bows while making each caw calls in flight are usually given singly in contrast to carrion crow s which are in groups of three or four other sounds are made around rookery a high pitched squawk a sound and a semi chirruping call solitary birds occasionally sing apparently to themselves uttering strange clicks and human like notes song has been described as a base or guttural reproduction of varied and spluttering song of starlings thumb upright in rooks have returned 1871 by alexei arrival of rooks is an early portent of coming spring intelligence although outside of captivity rooks have not shown probable tool use captive rooks have shown ability to use and understand puzzles one of most commonly tested puzzles is trap tube problem rooks learned how to pull their reward out of tube while avoiding a trap on one side in captivity when confronted with problems rooks have been documented as one of several species of birds capable of using tools as well as modifying tools to meet their needs rooks learned that if they push a stone off a ledge into a tube they will get food rooks then discovered they could find and bring a stone and carry it to tube if no stone was there already they also used sticks and wire and figured out how to bend a wire into a hook to reach an item rooks also understood notion of water levels when given stones and a tube full of water with a reward floating they not only understood that they needed to use stones but also best stone to use in one set of experiments rooks managed to knock a reward off a platform by rolling a stone down a tube toward base of platform rooks also seemed to understand idea that a heavier stone will roll more quickly and be more likely to knock platform over in this same test rooks showed they understood that they needed to pick a stone of a shape that would roll easily rooks also show ability to work together to receive a reward in order to receive a reward multiple rooks had to pull strings along lid of a box in order for it to move and them to reach reward rooks seem to have no preference regarding working as a group comparative to working singly they also seem to have a notion of gravity comparable to a six month old baby and exceeding abilities of chimpanzees although they do not use tools in wild research studies have demonstrated that rooks can do so in cognition tests where tools are required and can rival and in some circumstances outperform chimpanzees relationship with humans farmers have observed rooks in their fields and thought of them as vermin after a series of poor harvests in early 1500s introduced a vermin act in 1532 ordeyned to dystroye choughes i e jackdaws crowes and rokes to protect grain crops from their predations this act was only enforced in piecemeal fashion but passed act for preservation of grayne in 1566 that was taken up with more vigour and large numbers of birds were culled francis willughby mentions rooks in his ornithology 1678 these birds are noisome to corn and grain so that husbandmen are forced to employ children with hooting and crackers and rattles of metal and finally by throwing of stones to scare them away he also mentions scarecrows placed up and down fields and dressed up in a country habit which birds taking for countrymen dare not come near grounds where they stand it was some time before more observant naturalists like john jenner weir and thomas pennant appreciated that in consuming ground based pests rooks were doing more good than harm rookeries were often perceived as nuisances in rural britain and it was previously practice to hold rook shoots where juvenile birds known as were shot before they were able to fly these events were both very social and a source of food rook becomes inedible once mature as rook and rabbit pie was considered a great delicacy rooks have an extremely wide distribution and very large total population main threats they face are from changes in agricultural land use application of seed dressings and pesticides and persecution through shooting although total numbers of birds may be declining slightly across range this is not at so rapid a rate as to cause concern and international union for conservation of nature has assessed bird s conservation status as being of least
