observer of german army studying their military methods and attending german army manoeuvres he would later publish a translation of clausewitz his writing was sometimes controversial beginning with 1896 artillery from an infantry officer s point of view in which he argued strongly in favour of adopting indirect fire techniques from concealed locations conventional doctrine held that artillery should be used to fire directly on its targets as much from principle as from practical effect with one prominent artillerist arguing that firing from cover will destroy whole spirit of arm argument ran for two years as well as provoking debate his writing proved problematic for his career in part because of a 1907 pamphlet fire problems he was twice blocked for promotion by commander in chief india in it he had encouraged development of machine gun tactics and much heavier concentration and use of weapons an unusual position for pre war period in 1906 pilcher had also published an anonymous invasion novel writing on wall which described a german invasion of britain war he theorised was an invasion by germany followed by a rapid collapse of british forces particularly volunteers which he saw as unfit for purpose he advocated a form of conscription and a mandatory reserve system to strengthen army spectator was dismissive comparing novel unfavourably to invasion of 1910 many useful hints are given as to practical lessons but general plot entirely destroys any value it might otherwise possess and noting that suggestions were highly typical but that it was counterproductive to simply malign army and encourage country to adopt german military policies it was translated and published in germany same year as mene mene englands durch deutschland first world war at outbreak of first world war in august 1914 pilcher was on leave in england and offered his services to war office but was initially turned down as unsuitable for command by sir john french however in january

ypres for remainder of year it fought in an action at st eloi in march 1916 following which douglas haig considered relieving pilcher of his command he was not highly rated by his superior officers but in end his corps commander hew fanshawe was sacked instead pilcher was perceived by many as old fashioned and disengaged rarely visiting trenches journalist philip gibbs remarked on his courteous old fashioned dignity and gentleness of manner but concluded simply that modern warfare was too brutal for him pilcher s command was certainly slack an observer in summer of 1916 recently appointed to 17th division as a staff officer recalled finding a completely disorganised unit with no central co ordination no effective provision of laundry or comforts for front line units and described divisional staff as simply of no value 17th was deployed for battle of somme in july it was engaged on first day of somme 1 july where it supported capture of fricourt and lost 1 155 men killed or wounded following this it was involved in capture of and capture of mametz and had taken a total of 4 771 casualties by time it was relieved on 11 july many of these casualties stemmed from an unsuccessful attack on quadrangle trench support on 7 july division had captured main trench system on 5 july and pilcher ordered it to pause and prepare for a subsequent assault however he was over ruled by higher command who forced an attack next night which failed followed by a daylight attack on 7 july which pilcher strongly protested but eventually acquiesced in he ordered an attack with minimal number of men necessary assuming it would inevitably be doomed to failure and high casualties which outraged his superiors pilcher later wrote that it is very easy to sit a few miles in rear and get credit for allowing men to be killed in an undertaking foredoomed to failure but part did not appeal to me and my protests against these useless attacks were not well received following division s withdrawal pilcher was promptly sacked by his corps commander henry horne along with commander of neighbouring 38th welsh division horne considered him lacking in initiative drive and readiness while haig simply dismissed him as unequal to task of divisional command pilcher was succeeded by philip robertson on 13 july 1916 he was later appointed to command eastern reserve centre at st albans and retired from army in 1919 later life following end of war pilcher contested seat of thornbury in 1918 general election he opposed sitting liberal member athelstan rendall a coalition coupon candidate representing splinter right wing national party of conservatives opposed to coalition he was heavily defeated taking only 38 of vote in what had previously been a relatively close seat he continued a loose association with right wing politics chairing anti bolshevik national security union and joining anti socialist and protectionist british commonwealth union when british fascisti was formed in early 1920s pilcher became a member and an official of its london branch pilcher died in 1928 aged 70 of pneumonia he was survived by his second wife publications pilcher
