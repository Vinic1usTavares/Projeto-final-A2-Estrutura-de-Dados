material on 21 june 2010 album is widely acclaimed by critics and is often cited as a landmark release in industrial metal though not genre s first release streetcleaner helped define what industrial metal would become recorded in three distinct sessions and partially refined from pre godflesh demos streetcleaner is a weighty bleak album that blends heavy metal with industrial music by means of production emphasised bass distorted guitar and most importantly machine percussion unlike many metal albums guitar is employed to create screeching noise rather than discrete riffs and drums and bass are louder than is typical streetcleaner was supported by a series of concerts where godflesh played alongside napalm death and it was on north american leg of tour that band began to gain significant international traction since its release streetcleaner has received a number of accolades and has been performed in its entirety by godflesh twice once at roadburn festival a recording of which was released as a live album in 2013 many other metal bands have cited album as particularly influential including neurosis fear factory and isis and godflesh frontman justin broadrick considers it one of his landmark releases in 2017 rolling stone named streetcleaner 64th greatest metal album of all time background and recording before performing as godflesh g c green bass and paul neville guitar played together in a band known as fall of because that group formed in 1982 were less overtly heavy than what they would become as godflesh drawing musical and aesthetic influence from bands like cure future frontman justin broadrick guitar vocals and programming joined fall of because in 1984 and introduced green and neville to swans sonic youth and discharge inspired by dissonance of this music group recorded a demo called extirpate 1986 songs devastator mighty trust krusher life is easy and merciless were included on this demo first three of which would be rerecorded for streetcleaner these early versions were eventually released on a wide scale in 1999 via compilation album life is easy thumb upright right alt a photograph of model of drum machine used on streetcleaner against a

1988 renamed project godflesh they released their debut self titled ep on independent label swordfish later that year that ep though described by critics as raw and unrefined is considered one of originating industrial metal releases and proved to be foundation upon which streetcleaner would fine tune godflesh s approach to genre after underground success of godflesh band played several shows across europe and recorded a four track ep titled tiny tears before they could release ep on swordfish godflesh were acquired by earache records and digby pearson label s head urged band to shelve tracks and instead focus on putting out a complete studio album next broadrick and green agreed and began recording streetcleaner in may 1989 at soundcheck in birmingham and square dance in derby birmingham sessions saw broadrick and green recording and mixing first half of album while derby sessions which yielded tracks six through ten saw temporary reincorporation of neville into band this time as a second guitarist tiny tears was appended to end of cd versions of streetcleaner resulting in album including material from three separate sessions entirety of creative period was reinforced by an alesis hr 16 drum machine this choice was at first made out of necessity since broadrick could not play beats he wanted acoustically he described himself as not a great drummer but he came to embrace machine percussion and consider it a defining feature of godflesh loudwire called hr 16 specifically in regard to its use on streetcleaner most devastating drum machine ever employed in a retrospective interview broadrick described release as one of most alienating albums he had ever made and referred to it as band s landmark record composition and style musically streetcleaner was one of earliest albums to merge industrial and heavy metal music it accomplishes such a fusion through combining programmed repetitive drum machine loops with green s overdriven bass and broadrick s distorted guitar vocals are sparse guttural and bleak and according to peter buckley s rough guide to rock misanthropic inspired by harshness of early swans material streetcleaner has been noted for its extreme weight and crushing aggression unlike music of napalm death s 1987 album scum a release for which broadrick provided guitar shortly before starting godflesh streetcleaner is exceptionally slow and focus is placed on percussion and bass rather than vocals or traditional riffs style of guitar playing has been described as abrasive and deliberately grating and album is laden with factory sounds stiff mechanical beats and overwhelming washes of noise thematically streetcleaner dismal tone was born from broadrick s troubled upbringing and from oppressive birmingham environment about album s desolate fury he said there is a pure nihilism in there totally anti everything i couldn t come to terms with anything it was all a struggle and i just wanted to lash out at every target i possibly could streetcleaner begins with one of godflesh s most well known tracks like rats introduction of song and of album at large is a wall of feedback after brief noise introduction like rats descends into an intense scathing song with prominent percussion driving bass and piercing guitar screamed vocals which consequence of sound s andy o connor called spine chilling and some of angriest verses laid to tape are harsh and regularly noted for their punchy efficacy eduardo rivadavia of loudwire called song genre standard decibel s jonathan horsley referred to it as anthemic and revolver described it as far beyond heavy streetcleaner second track christbait rising has been cited by several critics as another high point of album and decibel named it one of godflesh s five best songs while this track does feature a riff heavy guitar breakdown in its latter segments it is still dominated by machine drumming according to broadrick song s beat was his attempt to copy a rhythmic break in microphone fiend 1988 by eric b rakim luca of chicago reader described christbait rising by writing it s one of my all time favorite songs drum machines clank and scrape by creating an eerie cyber racket while broadrick and bassist g christian green lay down impossibly heavy riffs on top broadrick s vocals guttural and processed to sound like some sort of gigantic monster make whole thing sound like something out of a nightmare pulp album s third track is entirely built around a locked repeating uncomplicated drum loop green and broadrick play over beats which completely drive track because percussion on pulp features little to no changes over its running time godflesh occasionally performed extended versions of it where they simply allowed machine to continue pulp and christbait rising were issued together as a promotional single in 1989 dream long dead is streetcleaner fourth song much of track puts squealing guitar of broadrick at forefront but significant portions of second half descend into heavy repeating percussive movements where all instruments double drums sixth track head dirt displays an unusual compositional structure with first half comprising a disjointed jagged rhythmic loop and latter half being almost entirely high pitched guitar feedback those swelling waves of noise transition into devastator and mighty trust krusher sometimes listed as two separate songs sometimes listed as one combined track first composition on streetcleaner from recording sessions with neville as a second guitarist and first rerecorded remnants of fall of because project this nine minute stretch is dark dismal and oppressive with enigmatic growled lyrics and sounds underlaid with samples of voices ned raggett of allmusic considered it along with like rats and christbait rising one of his favorite pieces on album seventh track on streetcleaner life is easy is another holdover from mid eighties fall of because demos broadrick s and neville s guitars clash and scrape against each other creating eerie cacophony before bass and drums kick in album s eighth song its title track begins with a sample of convicted serial killer henry lee lucas speaking during an interrogation streetcleaner proper is one of album s faster more aggressive songs as allmusic s stephen cook describes it pummel s listener with jackhammer percussion and ultra demonic vocals and charlie wood of clash agreed also calling drumming similar to a jackhammer locust furnace was originally designed as album s closing track song itself is characterised by drums and bass trading off with vocals and guitar and it concludes with broadrick repeatedly shouting furnace as he grows gradually tiny tears and godflesh reissue four tiny tears bonus songs title track wound dead head and suction are streetcleaner shortest pieces because they were recorded apart from album they are compositionally different more focused on propulsive hard rock riffs and beats than stark industrial sterility of streetcleaner proper broadrick employs clean singing rather than growls and tone of songs has been called ethereal noel gardner of quietus described ep as a muscular enveloping follow up and utterly worth hearing dead head a frantic song with stretched vocals even has a tone that sputnikmusic described as almost optimistic digby pearson considered tiny tears one of his favorite godflesh songs and wound would be revisited by godflesh multiple times on future releases one such future release earache s 1990 reissue of band s debut ep godflesh featured two songs entitled wounds and streetcleaner 2 both are extended songs that have been manipulated and altered something common for godflesh while streetcleaner 2 primarily builds upon and distorts streetcleaner it also features deconstructed segments of pulp it is one of godflesh s earliest tracks to experiment with ambient elements release streetcleaner was released on 19 november 1989 through earache records in united states it was released following year in december and was part of earache s first push into american market it was deemed a success while vinyl and cassette versions contained ten songs cd release

21 june bonus disc contained original unreleased mixes of songs from soundcheck sessions live recordings from 1990 rehearsals and demos of some tiny tears songs that broadrick believed revealed
