forced to remove them after protests they then won first pull against mixed swedish danish team but during second pull some of their compatriots joined in pulling rope to help tiring team a fight nearly broke out but was avoided by intervention of officials irrespective of result of this second contest it was not considered to be part of official competition but rather a private contest and
