significant opposition from aristocracy upon her ascension to full ruling powers after george s death tamar was successful in neutralizing this opposition and embarked on an energetic foreign policy aided by decline of hostile seljuq turks relying on a powerful military elite tamar was able to build on successes of her predecessors to consolidate an empire which dominated caucasus until its collapse under mongol attacks within two decades after tamar s death tamar was married twice her first union being from 1185 to 1187 to rus prince yuri whom she divorced and expelled from country defeating his subsequent coup attempts for her second husband tamar chose in 1191 alan prince david soslan by whom she had two children george and rusudan two successive monarchs on throne of georgia tamar s association with period of political and military successes and cultural achievements combined with her role as a female ruler has led to her idealization and romanticization in georgian arts and historical memory she remains an important symbol in georgian popular culture early life and ascent to throne tamar was born in circa 1160 to george iii king of georgia and his consort a daughter of king of alania while it is possible that tamar had a younger sister rusudan she is only mentioned once in all contemporary accounts of tamar s reign name tamar is of hebrew origin and like other biblical names was favored by georgian bagrationi dynasty because of their claim to be descended from david second king of israel tamar s youth coincided with a major upheaval in georgia in 1177 her father george iii was confronted by a rebellious faction of nobles rebels intended to dethrone george in favor of king s fraternal nephew demna who was considered by many to be a legitimate royal heir of his murdered father david v demna s cause was little but a pretext for nobles led by pretender s father in law high constable ivane orbeli to weaken crown george iii was able to crush revolt and embarked on a crackdown campaign on defiant aristocratic clans ivane orbeli was put to death and surviving members of his family were driven out of georgia prince demna castrated and blinded on his uncle s order did not survive mutilation and soon died in prison once rebellion was suppressed and pretender eliminated george went ahead to co opt tamar into government with him and crowned her as co ruler in 1178 by doing so king attempted to preempt any dispute after his death and legitimize his line on throne of georgia at same time he raised men from kipchaks as well as from gentry and

western georgia she inherited a relatively strong kingdom but centrifugal tendencies fostered by great nobles were far from being quelled there was considerable opposition to tamar s succession this was sparked by a reaction against repressive policies of her father and encouraged by new sovereign s other perceived weakness her sex as georgia had never previously had a female ruler a part of aristocracy questioned tamar s legitimacy while others tried to exploit her youth and supposed weakness to assert greater autonomy for themselves energetic involvement of tamar s influential aunt rusudan and catholicos patriarch michael iv was crucial for legitimizing tamar s succession to throne however young queen was forced into making significant concessions to aristocracy she had to reward catholicos patriarch michael s support by making him a chancellor thus placing him at top of both clerical and secular hierarchies tamar was also pressured into dismissing her father s appointees among them constable a georgian kipchak of ignoble birth who had helped george iii in his crackdown on defiant nobility one of few untitled of george iii to escape this fate was treasurer qutlu arslan who now led a group of nobles and wealthy citizens in a struggle to limit royal authority by creating a new council whose members would alone deliberate and decide policy this attempt at

to behold yuri proved to be an able soldier but a difficult person and he soon ran afoul of his wife strained spousal relations paralleled a factional struggle at royal court in which tamar was becoming more and more assertive of her rights as a queen regnant turning point in tamar s fortunes came with death of powerful catholicos patriarch michael whom queen replaced as a chancellor with

daughter rusudan was born 1195 and would succeed her brother as a sovereign of georgia david soslan s status of a king consort as well as his presence in art on charters and on coins was dictated by

mkhargrdzeli and other noble families she revived expansionist foreign policy of her predecessors repeated occasions of dynastic strife in georgia combined with efforts of regional successors of great seljuq empire such as eldiguzids shirvanshahs and ahlatshahs had slowed down dynamic of georgians achieved during reigns of tamar s great grandfather david iv and her father george iii however georgians became again active under tamar more prominently in second decade of her rule early in 1190s georgian government began to interfere in affairs of eldiguzids and of shirvanshahs aiding rivaling local princes and reducing shirvan to a tributary state eldiguzid atabeg abu bakr attempted to stem georgian advance but suffered a defeat at hands of david soslan at battle of and lost his

troops alexios and david tamar s relatives tamar s paternal aunt was komnenoi s grandmother on their father s side as it has been conjectured by were fugitive byzantine princes raised at georgian court according to tamar s historian aim of georgian expedition to trebizond was to punish byzantine emperor alexios iv angelos r 1203 1204 for his confiscation of a shipment of money from georgian queen to monasteries of antioch and mount athos however tamar s pontic endeavor can better be explained by her desire to take advantage of western european fourth crusade against constantinople to set up a friendly state in georgia s immediate southwestern neighborhood as well as by dynastic solidarity to dispossessed komnenoi tamar sought to make use of weakness of byzantine empire and crusaders defeat at hands of ayyubid sultan saladin in order to gain georgia s position on international stage and to assume traditional role of byzantine crown as a protector of christians of middle east christian georgian missionaries were active in north caucasus and expatriate monastic communities were scattered throughout eastern mediterranean tamar s chronicle praises her universal protection of

left 150px a fragment of early 13th century fresco of queen tamar from betania georgia s political and cultural exploits of tamar s epoch were rooted in a long and complex past tamar owed her accomplishments most immediately to reforms of her great grandfather david iv r 1089 1125 and more remotely to unifying efforts of david iii and bagrat iii who became architects of a political unity of georgian kingdoms and principalities in opening decade of 11th century tamar was able to build upon their successes by last years of tamar s reign georgian state had reached zenith of its power and prestige in middle ages tamar s realm stretched from greater caucasus crest in north to erzurum in south and from in northwest to vicinity of ganja in southeast forming a pan caucasian empire with

neighboring lands thus on coins and charters issued in her name tamar is identified as thumb a copper coin with georgian and arabic inscriptions featuring tamar s monogram 1200 queen never achieved autocratic powers and noble council continued to function however tamar s own prestige and expansion of moba a georgian version of feudalism kept more powerful dynastic princes from fragmenting kingdom this was a classical period in history of georgian feudalism attempts at transplanting feudal practices in areas where they had previously been almost unknown did not pass without resistance there was a revolt among of and dido on georgia s northeastern frontier in 1212 which was put down by ivane mkhargrzeli after three months of heavy fighting with flourishing commercial centers now under georgia s control industry and commerce brought new wealth to country and court tribute extracted from neighbors and war booty added to royal treasury giving rise to saying that peasants were like nobles nobles like princes and princes like kings culture thumb a folio from vani gospels manuscript copied at behest of queen tamar with this prosperity came an outburst of distinct georgian culture emerging from amalgam of christian secular as well as byzantine and iranian influences despite this georgians continued to identify with byzantine west rather than islamic east with georgian monarchy seeking to underscore its association with christianity and present its position as god given it was in that period that canon of georgian orthodox architecture was redesigned and a series of large scale domed cathedrals were built byzantine derived expression of royal power was modified in various ways to bolster tamar s unprecedented position as a woman ruling in her own right five extant monumental church portraits of queen are clearly modeled on byzantine imagery but also highlight specifically georgian themes and persian type ideals of female beauty despite georgia s byzantine leaning culture country s intimate trade connections with middle east is evidenced on contemporary georgian coinage whose legends were composed in georgian and arabic a series of coins minted in circa 1200 in name of queen tamar depicted a local variant of byzantine obverse and an arabic inscription on reverse proclaiming tamar as champion of messiah contemporary georgian chronicles enshrined christian morality and patristic literature continued to flourish but it had by that time lost its earlier dominant position to secular literature which was highly original even though it developed close contact with neighboring cultures trend culminated in shota rustaveli s epic poem knight in panther s skin which celebrates ideals of an age of chivalry and is revered in georgia as greatest achievement of native literature death and burial thumb left gelati monastery a unesco world heritage site is a presumptive burial place of queen tamar tamar outlived her consort david soslan

affairs with her ministers at castle near town of gori she was transported to tbilisi and then to nearby castle of where tamar died and was mourned by her subjects her remains were transferred to cathedral of and then to gelati monastery a family burial ground of georgian royal dynasty traditional scholarly opinion is that tamar died in 1213 although there are several indications that she might have died earlier in 1207 or 1210 thumb ruined cave town of vardzia in later times a number of legends emerged about tamar s place of burial one of them has it that tamar was buried in a secret niche at gelati monastery so as to prevent grave from being profaned by her enemies another version suggests that tamar s remains were reburied in a remote location possibly in holy land french knight guillaume de bois in a letter dated from early 13th century written in palestine and addressed to bishop of besancon claimed that he had heard that king of georgians was heading towards jerusalem with a huge army and had already conquered many cities of saracens he was carrying report said remains of his mother powerful queen tamar regina who had been unable to make a pilgrimage to holy land in her lifetime and had bequeathed her body to be buried near holy sepulchre in 20th century quest for tamar s grave became a subject of scholarly research as well as focus of broader public interest georgian writer grigol robakidze wrote in his 1918 essay on tamar thus far nobody knows where tamar s grave is she belongs to everyone and to no one her grave is in heart of georgian and in georgians

as a golden age began in reign itself and tamar became focus of era several medieval georgian poets including shota rustaveli claimed tamar as inspiration for their works a legend has it that rustaveli was even consumed with love for queen and ended his days in a monastery a dramatic scene from rustaveli s poem where seasoned king crowns his daughter is an allegory to george iii s co option of tamar rustaveli comments on this a lion cub is just as good be it female or male queen became a subject of several contemporary panegyrics such as s and ioane s abdul she was eulogized in chronicles most notably in two accounts centered on her reign life of tamar queen of queens and histories and eulogies of sovereigns which became primary sources of tamar s sanctification in georgian literature chroniclers exalt her as a protector of widowed and thrice blessed and place a particular emphasis on tamar s virtues as a woman beauty humility love of mercy fidelity and purity although tamar was canonized by georgian church much later she was even named as a saint in her lifetime in a bilingual greco georgian colophon attached to manuscript of vani gospels idealization of tamar was further accentuated by events that took place under her immediate successors within two decades of tamar s death khwarezmian and mongol invasions brought georgian ascendancy to an abrupt end later periods of national revival were too ephemeral to match achievements of tamar s reign all of these contributed to cult of tamar which blurred distinction between idealized queen and real personality in popular memory tamar s image has acquired a legendary and romantic facade a diverse set of folk songs poems and tales illustrate her as an ideal ruler a holy woman onto whom certain attributes of pagan deities and christian saints were sometimes projected for example in an old ossetian legend queen tamar conceives her son of a sunbeam which shines through window another myth from georgian mountains equates tamar with pagan deity of weather who controls winter similarly in highland district of tamar s image fused with a pagan goddess of healing and female fertility while tamar occasionally accompanied her army and is described as planning some campaigns she was never directly involved in fighting yet memory of military victories of her reign contributed to tamar s other popular image that of a model warrior queen it also echoed in tale of queen dinara a popular 16th century russian story about a fictional georgian queen fighting against persians tsar of all ivan terrible before seizure of kazan encouraged his army by examples of tamar s dmitrii volume 1 p 208 by describing her as most wise queen of iberia endowed with intelligence and courage of a man modern thumb left prince gagarin s reproduction of royal panel at betania depicting george iv left tamar center and george iii right flanked by warrior saints 1847 thumb left signature of tamar in 1202 much of modern perception of queen tamar was shaped under influence of 19th century romanticism and growing nationalism among georgian intellectuals of that time in russian and western literatures of 19th century image of queen tamar reflected european conceptions of orient of which georgia was perceived as a part and position and characteristics of women in it tyrolean writer jakob philipp described tamar as a caucasian fascinated by exotic caucasus russian poet mikhail lermontov wrote romantic poem tamara 1841 in which he utilized old georgian legend about a siren like mountainous princess whom poet gave name of queen tamar although lermontov s depiction of georgian queen as a destructive seductress had no apparent historical background it has been influential enough to raise issue of tamar s sexuality a question that was given some prominence by 19th century european authors knut hamsun s 1903 play dronning tamara queen tamara was less successful theatre critics saw in it a modern woman dressed in a medieval costume and read play as a commentary on new woman of 1890s russian conductor mily balakirev composed a symphony named tamara in georgian literature tamar was also romanticized but very differently from russian and western european view georgian romanticists followed a medieval tradition in tamar s portrayal as a gentle saintly woman who ruled a country permanently at war this sentiment was further inspired by rediscovery of a contemporary 13th century wall painting of tamar in then ruined betania monastery which was uncovered and restored by prince grigory gagarin in 1840s fresco became a source of numerous engravings circulating in georgia at that time and inspired poet grigol to dedicate a romantic poem to it furthermore georgian literati reacting to russian rule in georgia and suppression of national institutions contrasted tamar s era to their contemporary situation lamenting irretrievably lost past in their writings hence tamar became a personification of heyday of georgia a perception that has persisted down to present time tamar s marriage to rus prince yuri has become a subject of two resonant prose works in modern georgia dadiani s play
