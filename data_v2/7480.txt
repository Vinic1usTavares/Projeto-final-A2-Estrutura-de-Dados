on growth and form is a book by scottish mathematical biologist d arcy wentworth thompson 1860 1948 book is long 793 pages in first edition of 1917 1116 pages in second edition of 1942 book covers many topics including effects of scale on shape of animals and plants large ones necessarily being relatively thick in shape effects of surface tension in shaping soap films and similar structures such as cells logarithmic spiral as seen in mollusc shells and ruminant horns arrangement of leaves and other plant parts phyllotaxis and thompson s own method of transformations showing changes in shape of animal skulls and other structures on a cartesian grid work is widely admired by biologists anthropologists and architects among others but less often read than cited peter medawar explains this as being because it clearly pioneered use of mathematics in biology and helped to defeat mystical ideas of vitalism but that book is weakened by thompson s failure to understand role of evolution and evolutionary history in shaping living structures philip ball and michael ruse on other hand suspect that while thompson argued for physical mechanisms his rejection of natural selection bordered on vitalism overview thumb upright thompson analyses polyhedral forms of radiolaria from challenger expedition drawn by ernst haeckel 1904 d arcy wentworth thompson s most famous work on growth and form was written in dundee mostly in 1915 but publication was put off until 1917 because of delays of wartime and thompson s many late alterations to text central theme of book is that biologists of its author s day overemphasized evolution as fundamental determinant of form and structure of living organisms and roles of physical laws and mechanics at a time when vitalism was still being considered as a biological theory he advocated structuralism as an alternative to natural selection in governing form of species with smallest hint of vitalism as unseen driving force thompson had previously criticized darwinism in his paper some difficulties of darwinism on growth and form explained in detail why he believed darwinism to be an inadequate explanation for origin of new species he did not reject natural selection but regarded it as secondary to physical influences on biological form using a mass of examples thompson pointed out correlations between biological forms and mechanical phenomena he showed similarity in forms of jellyfish and forms of drops of liquid falling into viscous fluid and between internal supporting structures in hollow bones of birds and well known engineering truss designs he described phyllotaxis numerical relationships between spiral structures in plants and its relationship to fibonacci sequence perhaps most famous part of book is chapter 17 comparison of related forms where thompson explored degree to which differences in forms of related animals could be described in work inspired by german engraver albrecht durer 1471 1528 by mathematical transformations book is descriptive rather than experimental science thompson did not articulate his insights in form of hypotheses that can be tested he was aware of this saying that this book of mine has little need of preface for indeed it is all preface from beginning to end thompson 1917 prefatory note first paragraph editions first edition appeared in 1917 in a single volume of 793 pages published by cambridge university press a second edition enlarged to 1116 pages was published in two volumes in 1942 thompson wrote in preface to 1942 edition that he had written this book in wartime and its revision has employed me during another war it gave me solace and occupation when service was debarred me by my years few are left of friends who helped me write it unabridged edition is no longer in print in english but an edition of 346 pages was abridged by john tyler bonner and is widely published under same title book often in abridged edition has been reprinted more than 40 times and has been translated into chinese french german greek italian and spanish contents contents of chapters in first edition are summarized below all but chapter 11 have same titles in second edition but many are longer as indicated by page numbering of start of each chapter bonner s abridgment shortened all chapters and removed some completely again as indicated at start of each chapter s entry below 1 introductory 1st edition p1 2nd edition p1 bonner p1 thompson names progress of chemistry towards kant s goal of a mathematical science able to explain reactions by molecular mechanics and points out that zoology has been slow to look to mathematics he agrees that zoologists rightly seek for reasons in animals adaptations and reminds readers of related but far older philosophical search for teleology explanation by some aristotelian final cause his analysis of growth and form will try to show how these can be explained with ordinary physical laws 2 on magnitude thumb right models used by william froude to show that drag on a hull varies with square root of waterline length 1st p16 2nd p22 bonner p15 thompson begins by showing that an animal s surface and volume or weight increase with square and cube of its length respectively and deducing simple rules for how bodies will change with size he shows in a few short equations that speed of a fish or ship rises with square root of its length he then derives slightly more complex scaling laws for birds or aircraft in flight he shows that an organism thousands of times smaller than a bacterium is essentially impossible 3 rate of growth 1st p50 2nd bonner removed thompson points out that all changes of form are phenomena of growth he analyses growth curves for man noting rapid growth before birth and again in teens and then curves for other animals in plants growth is often in pulses as in peaks at a specific temperature and below that value roughly doubles every 10 degrees celsius tree growth varies cyclically with season less strongly in evergreens preserving a record of historic climates tadpole tails regenerate rapidly at first slowing exponentially 4 on internal form and structure of cell 1st p156 2nd p286 bonner removed thompson argues for need to study cells with physical methods as morphology alone had little explanatory value he notes that in mitosis dividing cells look like iron filings between poles of a magnet in other words like a force field 5 forms of cells thumb vorticella campanula stalked cup shaped organisms attached to a green plant 1st p201 2nd p346 bonner p49 he considers forces such as surface tension acting on cells and plateau s experiments on soap films he illustrates way a splash breaks into droplets and compares this to shapes of zoophytes hydrozoa he looks at flask like shapes of single celled organisms such as species of vorticella considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas and at hanging drop shapes of some foraminifera such as lagena he argues that cells of are similarly shaped by surface tension 6 a note on adsorption 1st 2nd bonner removed thompson notes that surface tension in living cells is reduced by substances resembling oils and soaps where concentrations of these vary locally shapes of cells are affected in green alga potassium is concentrated near growing points in cell 7 forms of tissues or cell aggregates 1st 2nd bonner p88 thompson observes that in multicellular organisms cells influence each other s shapes with triangles of forces he analyses parenchyma and cells in a frog s egg as soap films and considers symmetries bubbles meeting at points and edges he compares shapes of living and fossil corals such as and and hexagonal structure of honeycomb to such soap bubble structures 8 same continued 1st p346 2nd bonner merged with previous chapter thompson considers laws governing shapes of cells at least in simple cases such as fine hairs a cell thick in rhizoids of mosses he analyses geometry of cells in a frog s egg when it has divided into 4 8 and even 64 cells he shows that uniform growth can lead to unequal cell sizes and argues that way cells divide is driven by shape of dividing structure and not vice versa 9 on concretions spicules and skeletons thumb upright 1 2 a selection of spicules in 1st 2nd bonner p132 thompson considers skeletal structures of diatoms radiolarians foraminifera and sponges many of which contain hard spicules with geometric shapes he notes that these structures form outside living cells so that physical forces must be involved 10 a note on 1st 2nd bonner removed thompson applies use of geodetic line shortest distance between two points on surface of a solid of revolution to spiral thickening of plant cell walls and other cases 11 logarithmic spiral equiangular spiral in 2nd ed thumb halved shell of nautilus showing chambers in a logarithmic spiral 1st 2nd bonner p172 thompson observes that there are many spirals in nature from horns of ruminants to shells of molluscs other spirals are found among florets of sunflower he notes that mathematics of these are similar but biology differs he describes spiral of archimedes before moving on to logarithmic spiral which has property of never changing its shape it is equiangular and is continually self similar shells as diverse as triton and nautilus illustrated with a halved shell and a radiograph have this property different shapes are generated by sweeping out curves or arbitrary shapes by rotation and if desired also by moving downwards thompson analyses both living molluscs and fossils such as ammonites 12 spiral shells of foraminifera 1st 2nd p850 bonner merged with previous chapter thompson analyses diverse forms of minute spiral shells of foraminifera many of which are logarithmic others irregular in a manner similar to previous chapter 13 shapes of horns and of teeth or tusks with a note on torsion thumb spiral horns of male bighorn sheep ovis canadensis 1st 2nd bonner p202 thompson considers three types of horn that occur in quadrupeds keratin horn of rhinoceros paired horns of sheep or goats and bony antlers of deer in a note on torsion thompson mentions charles darwin s treatment of climbing plants which often spiral around a support noting that darwin also observed that spiralling stems were themselves twisted thompson disagrees with darwin s teleological explanation that twisting makes stems stiffer in same way as twisting of a rope thompson s view is that mechanical adhesion of climbing stem to support sets up a system of forces which act as a couple offset from centre of stem making it twist 14 on leaf arrangement or phyllotaxis thumb phyllotaxis of sunflower florets 1st 2nd bonner removed thompson analyses phyllotaxis arrangement of plant parts around an axis he notes that such parts include leaves around a stem fir cones made of scales sunflower florets forming an elaborate crisscrossing pattern of different spirals he recognises their beauty but dismisses any mystical notions instead he remarks that numbers that result from such spiral arrangements are fibonacci sequence of ratios 1 2 2 3 3 5 converging on 0 golden ratio which is 15 on shapes of eggs and of certain other hollow structures 1st 2nd bonner removed eggs are what thompson calls simple solids of revolution varying from nearly spherical eggs of owls through more typical ovoid eggs like chickens to markedly pointed eggs of cliff nesting birds like guillemot he shows that shape of egg favours its movement along oviduct a gentle pressure on trailing end sufficing to push it forwards similarly sea urchin shells have teardrop shapes such as would be taken up by a flexible bag of liquid 16 on form and mechanical efficiency thumb 300px thompson compared a dinosaur s spine to forth railway bridge right 1st 2nd bonner p221 thompson criticizes talk of adaptation by coloration in animals for presumed purposes of crypsis warning and mimicry referring readers to e b poulton s colours of animals and more sceptically to abbott thayer s concealing coloration in animal kingdom he considers mechanical engineering of bone to be a far more definite case he compares strength of bone and wood to materials such as steel and cast iron illustrates cancellous structure of bone of human femur with thin trabeculae which formed nothing more nor less than a diagram of lines of stress in loaded structure and compares femur to head of a building crane he similarly compares cantilevered backbone of a quadruped or dinosaur to girder structure of forth railway bridge 17 on theory of transformations or comparison of related forms thumb upright albrecht durer s face transforms 1528 were among thompson s inspirations 1st 2nd bonner p268 inspired by work of albrecht durer thompson explores how forms of organisms and their parts whether leaves bones of foot human faces or body shapes of copepods crabs or fish can be explained by geometrical transformations for example thumb upright 1 3 thompson illustrated transformation of into diaphana by applying a shear mapping in similar style he transforms shape of carapace of crab variously to that of by a simple shear mapping and to lupa and by stretching top or bottom of grid sideways same process changes crocodilus porosus to crocodilus americanus and terrestris relates hip bones of fossil reptiles and birds such as archaeopteryx and skulls of various fossil horses and even skulls of a horse and a rabbit a human skull is stretched into those of chimpanzee and baboon and with mode of deformation on different lines page 773 of a dog epilogue 1st 2nd bonner p326 in brief epilogue thompson writes that he will have succeeded if i have been able to shew that a certain mathematical aspect of morphology is complementary to his descriptive task and helpful nay essential to his proper study and comprehension of form more lyrically he writes that for harmony of world is made manifest in form and number and heart and soul and all poetry of natural philosophy are embodied in concept of mathematical beauty and quotes isaiah 40 12 on measuring out waters and heavens and dust of earth he ends with a paragraph praising french entomologist jean henri fabre who being of same blood and marrow with plato and pythagoras saw in number la clef de voute key to vault of universe and found in it le comment et le pourquoi des how and why of things reception contemporary j p mcm reviewing book in science in 1917 wrote that book is one of strongest documents in support of mechanistic view of life that has yet been put forth contrasting this with vitalism reviewer was interested in discussion of physical factors determining size of organisms especially interesting being consideration of conditions which may determine minimum size j w buchanan reviewing second edition in physiological zoology in 1943 described it as an imposing extension of his earlier attempt to formulate a geometry of growth and form and beautifully written but warned that reading will not be easy and that a vast store of literature has here been assembled and assimilated buchanan summarizes book and notes that chapter 17 seems to reviewer to contain essence of long and more or less leisurely thesis chapter is devoted to comparison of related forms largely by method of co ordinates fundamental differences in these forms are thus revealed and buchanan concludes that large gaps indicate that darwin s endless series of continuous variations is not substantiated but he does have some criticisms thompson should have referenced effects of hormones on growth and relation of molecular configuration and form genetics is barely mentioned and experimental embryology and regeneration despite thompson s analysis of latter are overlooked mathematics used consists of statistics and geometry while thermodynamics is largely absent edmund mayer reviewing second edition in anatomical record in 1943 noted that scope of book and general approach to problems dealt with have remained unchanged but considerable additions have been made and large parts have been recast he was impressed at extent to which thompson had kept up with developments in many sciences though he thought mentions of quantum theory and heisenberg uncertainty unwise george c williams reviewing 1942 edition and bonner s abridged edition for quarterly review of biology of which he was editor writes that book is a work widely praised but seldom used it contains neither original insights that have formed a basis for later advances nor instructive fallacies that have stimulated fruitful attack this seeming paradox is brilliantly discussed by p b medawar in pluto s republic williams then attempts a gross simplification of medawar s evaluation modern architects philip beesley and sarah bonnemaison write that thompson s book at once became a classic for its exploration of natural geometries in dynamics of growth and physical processes they note extraordinary optimism in book its vision of world as a symphony of harmonious forces and its huge range including beesley and bonnemaison observe that thompson saw form as a product of dynamic forces shaped by flows of energy and stages of growth they praise his eloquent writing and exquisite illustrations which have provided inspiration for artists and architects as well as scientists computer scientist and physicist stephen wolfram writes statistician cosma shalizi writes that book has haunted all discussion of these matters ever since shalizi states that thompson s goal is to show that biology follows inevitably from physics and to a degree also from chemistry he argues that when thompson says form of an object is a diagram of forces thompson means that we can infer from an object physical forces that act or once acted upon it shalizi calls thompson s account of physics of morphogenesis shalizi notes thompson s simplicity explaining processes of life using little that a second year physics undergrad wouldn t know thompson s anti reductionist admirers seldom put it this way he notes that thompson deliberately avoided invoking natural selection as an explanation and left history whether of species or of an individual s life out of his account he quotes thompson s a snow crystal is same today as when first snows fell adding so too basic forces acting upon organisms and comments that we have forgotten other early twentieth century scientists who scorned evolution in contrast he argues anthropologist barry bogin writes that thompson s book bogin observes that thompson originated use of transformational grids to measure growth in two dimensions but that without modern computers method was tedious to apply and was not often used even so book stimulated and lent intellectual validity to new field of growth and development research peter coates recalls that coates argues however that book goes far beyond expressing knowledge elegantly and influentially in a form that can be read for pleasure by scientists and it is in his view science writer philip ball observes that ball quotes 2nd edition s epigraph by statistician karl pearson i believe day must come when biologist will without being a mathematician not hesitate to use mathematical analysis when he requires it ball argues that thompson presents mathematical principles as a shaping agency that may supersede natural selection showing how structures of living world often echo those in inorganic nature and notes his frustration at just so explanations of morphology offered by darwinians instead ball argues thompson elaborates on how not heredity but physical forces govern biological form ball suggests that book s central motif is logarithmic spiral evidence in thompson s eyes of universality of form and reduction of many phenomena to a few principles of mathematics philosopher of biology michael ruse wrote that thompson had little time for natural selection instead thompson emphasised formal aspects of organisms trying to make a case for self organization through normal physical and chemical processes ruse notes that following aristotle thompson used as an example morphology of jellyfish which he explained entirely mechanically with physics of a heavy liquid falling through a lighter liquid avoiding natural selection as an explanation ruse is not sure whether thompson believed he was actually breaking with mechanism in other words adopting a vitalist ghost in machine view of world in ruse s opinion thompson can be interpreted as arguing that we can have completely mechanical explanations of living world with important proviso that thompson apparently felt there was no need for natural selection ruse at once adds that people like darwin and dawkins undoubtedly would disagree they would insist that influence for his revised on growth and form thompson was awarded daniel giraud elliot medal from united states national academy of sciences in 1942 on growth and form has inspired thinkers including biologists julian huxley and conrad hal waddington mathematician alan turing and anthropologist claude levi strauss book has powerfully influenced architecture and has long been a set text on architecture courses on growth and form has inspired artists including richard hamilton eduardo and ben nicholson in 2011 university of dundee was awarded a ps100 000 grant by art fund to build a collection of art inspired by his ideas and collections much of which is displayed in d arcy thompson zoology museum in dundee to celebrate centenary of on growth and form numerous events are being staged around world including new york amsterdam singapore london edinburgh
