escape from tomorrow is a 2013 american independent science fantasy horror film written and directed by randy moore in his directorial debut it tells story of an unemployed father having increasingly bizarre experiences and disturbing visions on last day of a family vacation at walt disney world resort it premiered in january at 2013 sundance film festival and was later a personal selection of roger ebert shown at his 15th annual film festival in champaign illinois film was a 2012 official selection of film festival but at time filmmakers were still working on some legal issues and asked that it not be screened film drew attention due to fact that moore had shot most of it on location at both walt disney world and disneyland without permission from walt disney company owner and operator of both parks due to disney s reputation of being protective of its intellectual property cast and crew used guerrilla filmmaking techniques to avoid attracting attention such as keeping their scripts on their iphones and shooting on handheld video cameras similar to those used by park visitors after principal photography was complete moore was so determined to keep project a secret from disney that he edited it in south korea sundance similarly declined to discuss film in detail before it was shown it was called ultimate guerrilla film rather than suppressing film as moore claimed would happen disney chose to ignore it it has been compared to work of roman polanski and david lynch however many who saw it expressed strong doubts that film would be shown to a wider audience due to legal issues involved and negative depiction of parks at time of its premiere disney stated that it was aware of film since then online supplement to disney a to z official

amy lucas as nurse zan naar as fantasy woman new wife klassen as scientist trevor mccune as valet background moore a native of lake bluff illinois frequently visited his father in orlando following his parents divorce two often spent time together at walt disney world nearby it was a special physical place and it became an emotional space he told filmmaker he added obviously i have a lot of father issues that i can t separate from that place later their relationship deteriorated he decided to pursue a career in film after attending two other film schools he graduated from full sail university in another central florida town winter park as class valedictorian he moved to southern california and began working as a story editor primarily doing uncredited rewrites in hollywood he married and started a family much like his own father he frequently took his own children to disneyland it wasn t until our first family trip together that this very visceral emotional landscape of my past that i had by now nearly all but forgotten hit me again like a bullet on family s first trip to walt disney world emotions grew stronger i t was like he was there as a ghost we were going on same rides i used to go on with him but now we re no longer talking anymore his wife a native of former soviet union who had no memories or expectations like his saw things with fresh eyes moore said she s a nurse and goes between floors at hospitals at one point she turned to me at some princess fair or something and said this is worse than working psych ward at hospital he read neal gabler s biography of walt disney and took children to disneyland more frequently i became obsessed with finding a connection he recalled later he wrote screenplay for escape from tomorrow in a month along with two others an inheritance from his grandparents provided bulk of film s budget which he put at around 650 000 triple what he had originally planned production there was nowhere else to do it moore says of his decision to use disney world as a setting and shoot at parks disney which has a reputation for aggressively protecting its intellectual property has been tolerant of visitors uploading videos of their visits to youtube and elsewhere since most of those user created videos project a positive image of parks but moore did not expect to get permission from disney to shoot there given his negative surrealistic portrayal of park instead he used guerrilla filmmaking techniques which sometimes call for using locations without getting permission escape from tomorrow is not first film made in whole or part this way at disney parks in 2010 british street artist banksy shot a scene for exit through gift shop in one of parks with his collaborator mr brainwash they managed to smuggle footage out after being detained and questioned by park security following year a viral found footage short missing in mansion filmed in haunted mansion was distributed online without interference from disney extensive pre production was necessary unique nature of film shoot dictated steps not normally taken in filmmaking such as charting position of sun weeks in advance since they could not use lighting equipment scenes were rehearsed and blocked in hotel rooms rather than actual locations we must have walked through entire movie at least eight or nine times during multiple scouting trips before we ever rolled camera moore says before principal photography cast and crew bought season passes to both disneyland and walt disney world resorts they spent ten days in florida then returned to california for two weeks at disneyland making parks depicted in film a combination of both resorts actors and crew entered parks in small groups to avoid attracting attention at one point i even made camera department shave off their facial hair and dress in tourist attire which almost provoked a mutiny says moore despite actors wearing same clothes for days on end moore told los angeles times park personnel never appeared to notice them save for one day near end of filming when disneyland security thought they were paparazzi harassing a celebrity family left thumb a canon eos 5d mark ii alt a black camera with a short lens barrel and large hand grip on left canon is visible above lens and eos 5d on right film was shot using video mode of two canon eos 5d mark ii and one canon eos 1d mark iv digital single lens reflex cameras which helped filmmakers look more like typical park visitors to compensate for their inability to control lighting film was shot in monochrome mode w e were shooting with really fast lenses wide open so our depth of field was razor thin black and white helped us enormously with focus and composition since we were doing almost everything in camera and didn t use a focus puller moore recalled it was an irreversible choice b ecause 5d doesn t shoot raw we customized settings in its monochromatic mode and couldn t go back to color even if we had wanted to moore was comfortable with result because of surrealistic dreamlike quality it created forcing viewers to see familiar sights of disney parks in a new way actors and crew used their iphones to communicate and store information such as script that way they looked like guests casually using their phones phones were also used to record sound in addition to digital recorders taped to each actor s body that were left running all day for day scenes moore felt comfortable risking only three or four takes of each scene but found he could do more at night thumb right sara left and jim right riding it s a small world alt a black and white image of a young girl on left and a middle aged man sitting on a bench with a patterned background and others doing same behind them she is looking at him while he appears to scenes involved riding on eight recognizable attractions in parks one required waiting in a long line for buzz lightyear ride at disneyland and actors rode it s a small world at least 12 times to get scene right i was surprised ride operators weren t a little more savvy moore told new york times for a scene where two characters pass on people mover moore had actors ride it for hours while he worked out timing after location filming production went back to soundstages for interiors some scenes were shot against a green screen background for second unit footage of other locations to be substituted allowing use of crane shots with photography done moore took film to south korea to edit to prevent disney from finding out he also refused to tell most of his close friends what he was doing visual effects were done by same company there that had done them for 2006 south korean monster film host post production tasks were as challenging as production itself sound editors had to listen to entire uncut tracks from recorders taped to actors bodies in order to find dialogue content proprietary to disney such as lyrics to it s a small world and footage from soarin was removed from film to avoid copyright infringement composer abel korzeniowski contributed a light airy score similar to those used in hollywood s golden age sundance moore submitted completed film to sundance film festival where many independent films seek distributors he had little hope that it would be accepted due to festival s corporate sponsors but trevor groth festival s new director of programming was blown away by escape from tomorrow and accepted it for festival s non competitive next category for films that transcend limitations of low budgets common to most independent films when 2013 festival began in park city utah secrecy about movie continued festival s website only identified setting as a theme park nan chalat noaker critic for park record recalls that festival and even film s publicist were unwilling to share further details about film but strongly urged critics to see it in her review she declined to identify setting of film by name although she dropped broad hints out of fear it would alert disney s lawyers premiere on festival s first night was not fully attended when word got out to attendees all other shows were effectively sold out reception on review aggregation website rotten tomatoes film has an approval rating of 56 based on 85 reviews with an average rating of 6 10 site s critical consensus reads conceptually audacious but only intermittently successful in execution escape from tomorrow is nonetheless visually inventive and darkly surreal on metacritic film has a score of 58 out of 100 based on 27 critics indicating mixed or average reviews before martin luther king day weekend was over escape from tomorrow was being widely discussed by festival attendees new york times and los angeles times both ran articles about film and moore much of attention focused on audacity of filmmaking movies com reported that people were already calling it ultimate guerrilla film on night of premiere drew mcweeny wrote he allowed that it was undisciplined at times rough around edges in places technically uneven and there s no sense of pacing to it at all even so he concluded there is a sort of naive charm that makes it impossible to look away other critics concurred that film had artistic merit w moore s noir tale is like being super glued to your seat while getting poked in eye chalat noaker wrote it s both fascinating and repelling stephen zeitchik of los angeles times called it one of strangest and most provocative movies this reporter has seen in eight years attending sundance film festival at indiewire eric kohn wrote that moore portrays disney world as ultimate horror show and gets point across in nearly every scene while they conceded film s audacious production made it worth their time to watch other critics found flaws movie review escape from tomorrow an decidedly un disneyfied day at theme park npr it s not a great film story has some good ideas but execution is uneven wrote peter sciretta at film while still recommending it as unlike anything you ve seen before or will see again similarly craveonline s william bibbiani wouldn t have missed it for world but qualified it by noting that film often lacked cohesion and clarity kyle smith of new york post had most negative assessment calling it more fun to discuss than to sit through while he found guerilla filmmaking aspect of it intriguing all it amounted to for him was a couple of amusingly surreal moments that could have taken place at any sufficiently large amusement park even disney hating hipsters are going to be disappointed film is a pure festival play that is more or less unless theater owners start selling weed along with popcorn a o scott of new york times and michael o sullivan of washington post each also gave a negative review for this film none of it is as scary or as funny as it should be former wrote and what starts out as a sly thumb in eye of corporate power ends up as a muddled and amateurish homage to david lynch washington post legal issues many journalists who saw film at sundance speculated that it was likely that disney would take legal action to prevent film from being shown outside festival or perhaps even during it disney s lawyers are probably climbing onto helicopters and planning a raid on park city right now wrote mcweeny critics urged others present to see it before it was too late and commented that it was questionable if those not present at festival would ever have an opportunity to see it however others noted that if disney had attempted to block film s release it was unclear on what legal grounds it could be done moore took care to avoid direct copyright infringement of songs or films played as part of attractions and intellectual property law is less clear on other aspects of film science fiction writer cory doctorow who distributed his first novel down and out in magic kingdom set in a 22nd century disney world under a creative commons license believes there s at most a possible trademark claim and i suppose that disney could y bring suit for violating park s terms of use but these are much harder cases to make than copyright columbia law school professor tim wu did not think disney would have any defensible intellectual property claim though filmmakers may have committed trespass when they broke disney world s rules and if it violated terms of entry on their tickets film itself is a different matter he wrote on new yorker s blog as commentary on social ideals of disney world it seems to clearly fall within a well recognized category of fair use and therefore probably will not be stopped by a court using copyright or trademark laws despite film s repeated use of disney s characters and iconography wu explained trademark law was not sufficient disney does not have some kind of general intellectual property right in disney world itself to make a trademark infringement case against moore he continued disney would have to convince a court that use of its protected imagery in movie could reasonably lead viewers to believe that it had a role in film s production and he did not think that was a plausible argument scene where a disney princess attempts to crush a child seems to eliminate that possibility as for copyright wu saw moore s use of disney parks as transformative as such he saw film as offering artistic commentary on cultural impact of disney and thus clearly falling under fair use wu likened it to a 1990s case brought by mattel against artist thomas forsythe after he sold some of his photographs depicting another american icon barbie being eaten by vintage appliances as a way of calling attention to toy doll s role in promoting objectification of women in american culture not only did court dismiss mattel s complaint t he judges were so annoyed by lawsuits that they awarded attorney s fees of nearly two million dollars to artist a judge has to think of first amendment when asked to ban art work in his film review sciretta raised another issue at slate aisha harris allowed that this was a possibility especially if children were filmed without their parents consent but noted law on that issue is not black and white either response by disney disney did not return reporters calls or emails for comment nor took any legal action during festival although it confirmed to cnn that it was aware of movie despite critical apprehension that film would never be shown outside festival some observers saw situation as more complex were disney to attempt to forcefully suppress film that effort could serve to draw even more attention to it a phenomenon known as streisand effect even if disney were to successfully prevent official distribution film could easily be pirated and distributed over internet in his post review smith suggested that disney prevent this by taking opposite course simply ignoring escape from tomorrow and letting attention dissipate by itself sundance review escape from tomorrow new york post michael ryan director of film festival noted that there was a precedent for film in air pirates lawsuit in which disney spent eight years in court with some underground cartoonists who had published an underground comix parody in which mickey mouse and other disney characters engaged in explicit sex and used illegal drugs among other behavior they avoided in disney s own narratives he suggested that disney buy rights and release film itself which it could easily do as its announced interest would guarantee it a monopsony on film since no other distributor would want to match disney s deep pockets or its feared legal response as a disney release escape from tomorrow would have a large potential audience of both disney enthusiasts and antagonists disney would be making money from property it already owns instead of someone else and company s apparent willingness to go in joke would take some of satiric edge off moore expressed hope that film could be shown and released even if it meant a legal battle since film s release disney has acknowledged it in another way online supplement to disney a to z official encyclopedia includes an entry for escape from tomorrow describing it as an independent surrealistic cult film surreptitiously filmed at walt disney world and disneyland according to hollywood reporter disney chose to avoid responding to film
