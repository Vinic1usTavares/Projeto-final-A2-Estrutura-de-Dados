usually signified by plus symbol is one of four basic operations of arithmetic others are subtraction multiplication and division addition of two whole numbers is total amount of those values combined for example in adjacent picture there is a combination of three apples and two apples together making a total of five apples this observation is equivalent to mathematical expression i e 3 add 2 is equal to 5 besides counting items addition can also be defined on other types of numbers such as integers real numbers and complex numbers this is part of arithmetic a branch of mathematics in algebra another area of mathematics addition can be performed on abstract objects such as vectors and matrices addition has several important properties it is commutative meaning that order does not matter and it is associative meaning that when one adds more than two numbers order in which addition is performed does not matter see summation repeated addition of is same as counting addition of does not change a number addition also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such as subtraction and multiplication performing addition is one of simplest numerical tasks addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers most basic task can be performed by infants as young as five months and even some members of other animal species in primary education students are taught to add numbers in decimal system starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems mechanical aids range from ancient abacus to modern computer where research on most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day notation and terminology right 120px thumb plus sign addition is written using plus sign between terms that is in infix notation result is expressed with an equals sign for example one plus one equals two two plus two equals four one plus two equals three see associativity below see multiplication below right thumb columnar addition numbers in column are to be added with sum written below underlined number there are also situations where addition is understood even though no symbol appears a whole number followed immediately by a fraction indicates sum of two called a mixed number devine et al p 263 for example 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 5 this notation can cause confusion since in most other contexts juxtaposition denotes multiplication instead mazur joseph enlightening symbols a short history of mathematical notation and its hidden powers princeton university press 2014 p 161 sum of a series of related numbers can be expressed through capital sigma notation which compactly denotes iteration for example numbers or objects to be added in general addition are collectively referred to as terms department of army 1961 army technical manual tm 11 684 principles and applications of mathematics for communications electronics section 5 1 s or summands w l ed 2010 britannica guide to numbers and measurement rosen publishing group p 38 this terminology carries over to summation of multiple terms this is to be distinguished from factors which are multiplied some authors call first addend augend and in fact during renaissance many authors did not consider first addend an addend at all today due to commutative property of addition augend is rarely used and both terms are generally called addends schwartzman p 19 all of above terminology derives from latin addition and add are english words derived from latin verb addere which is in turn a compound of ad to and dare to give from proto indo european root to give thus to add is to give to using suffix nd results in addend thing to be added addend is not a latin word in latin it must be further conjugated as in number to be added likewise from augere to increase one gets augend thing to be increased left thumb redrawn illustration from art of one of first english arithmetic texts in 15th century karpinski pp 56 57 reproduced on p 104 sum and summand derive from latin noun summa highest top and associated verb summare this is appropriate not only because sum of two positive numbers is greater than either but because it was common for ancient greeks and romans to add upward contrary to modern practice of adding downward so that a sum was literally higher than addends schwartzman p 212 attributes adding upwards to greeks and romans saying it was about as common as adding downwards on other hand karpinski p 103 writes that leonard of pisa introduces novelty of writing sum above addends it is unclear whether karpinski is claiming this as an original invention or simply introduction of practice to europe addere and summare date back at least to boethius if not to earlier roman writers such as vitruvius and frontinus boethius also used several other terms for addition operation later middle english terms and adding were popularized by chaucer karpinski pp 150 153 plus sign unicode u ascii 43 is an abbreviation of latin word et meaning and it appears in mathematical works dating back to at least 1489 interpretations addition is used to model many physical processes even for simple case of adding natural numbers there are many possible interpretations and even more visual representations combining sets right 200px thumb possibly most fundamental interpretation of addition lies in combining sets when two or more disjoint collections are combined into a single collection number of objects in single collection is sum of numbers of objects in original collections this interpretation is easy to visualize with little danger of ambiguity it is also useful in higher mathematics for rigorous definition it inspires see natural numbers below however it is not obvious how one should extend this version of addition to include fractional numbers or negative numbers see viro 2001 for an example of sophistication involved in adding with sets of fractional cardinality one possible fix is to consider collections of objects that can be easily divided such as pies or still better segmented rods adding it up p 73 compares adding measuring rods to adding sets of cats for example inches can be subdivided into parts which are hard to tell from wholes except that they are shorter whereas it is painful to cats to divide them into parts and it seriously changes their nature rather than just combining collections of segments rods can be joined end to end which illustrates another conception of addition adding not rods but lengths of rods extending a length right frame a number line visualization of algebraic addition 2 4 6 a translation by 2 followed by a translation by 4 is same as a translation by 6 right frame a number line visualization of unary addition 2 4 6 a translation by 4 is equivalent to four translations by 1 a second interpretation of addition comes from extending an initial length by a given length when an original length is extended by a given amount final length is sum of original length and length of extension mosley f 2001 using number lines with 5 8 year olds nelson thornes p 8 sum a b can be interpreted as a binary operation that combines a and b in an algebraic sense or it can be interpreted as addition of b more units to a under latter interpretation parts of a sum play asymmetric roles and operation is viewed as applying unary operation b to a li y g 2014 mathematics curriculum in school education springer p 204 instead of calling both a and b addends it is more appropriate to call a augend in this case since a plays a passive role unary view is also useful when discussing subtraction because each unary addition operation has an inverse unary subtraction operation and vice versa properties commutativity right thumb 4 2 2 4 with blocks addition is commutative one can change order of terms in a sum and result is same symbolically if a and b are any two numbers then a b b a fact that addition is commutative is known as commutative law of addition some other binary operations are commutative such as multiplication but many others are not such as subtraction and division associativity left 100px thumb 2 1 3 2 1 3 with segmented rods addition is associative when adding three or more numbers order of operations does not matter as an example should expression a b c be defined to mean a b c or a b c given that addition is associative choice of definition is irrelevant for any three numbers a b and c it is true that for example when addition is used together with other operations order of operations becomes important in standard order of operations addition is a lower priority than exponentiation nth roots multiplication and division but is given equal priority to subtraction identity element right 70px thumb 5 0 5 with bags of dots when adding zero to any number quantity does not change zero is identity element for addition also known as additive identity in symbols for any a a 0 0 a a this law was first identified in brahmagupta s in 628 ad although he wrote it as three separate laws depending on whether a is negative positive or zero itself and he used words rather than algebraic symbols later indian mathematicians refined concept around year 830 mahavira wrote zero becomes same as what is added to it corresponding to unary statement in 12th century bhaskara wrote in addition of cipher or subtraction of it quantity positive or negative remains same corresponding to unary statement kaplan pp 69 71 successor within context of integers addition of one also plays a special role for any integer a integer is least integer greater than a also known as successor of a hempel c g 2001 philosophy of carl g hempel studies in science explanation and rationality p 7 for instance 3 is successor of 2 and 7 is successor of 6 because of this succession value of can also be seen as successor of a making addition iterated succession for examples is 8 because 8 is successor of 7 which is successor of 6 making 8 2nd successor of 6 units to numerically add physical quantities with units they must be expressed with common units r fierro 2012 mathematics for elementary school teachers cengage learning sec 2 3 for example adding 50 milliliters to 150 milliliters gives 200 milliliters however if a measure of 5 feet is extended by 2 inches sum is 62 inches since 60 inches is synonymous with 5 feet on other hand it is usually meaningless to try to add 3 meters and 4 square meters since those units are incomparable this sort of consideration is fundamental in dimensional analysis performing addition innate ability studies on mathematical development starting around 1980s have exploited phenomenon of habituation infants look longer at situations that are unexpected wynn p 5 a seminal experiment by karen wynn in 1992 involving mickey mouse dolls manipulated behind a screen demonstrated that five month old infants expect to be 2 and they are comparatively surprised when a physical situation seems to imply that is either 1 or 3 this finding has since been affirmed by a variety of laboratories using different methodologies wynn p 15 another 1992 experiment with older toddlers between 18 and 35 months exploited their development of motor control by allowing them to retrieve ping pong balls from a box youngest responded well for small numbers while older subjects were able to compute sums up to 5 wynn p 17 even some nonhuman animals show a limited ability to add particularly primates in a 1995 experiment imitating wynn s 1992 result but using eggplants instead of dolls rhesus macaque and tamarin monkeys performed similarly to human infants more dramatically after being taught meanings of arabic numerals 0 through 4 one chimpanzee was able to compute sum of two numerals without further training wynn p 19 more recently asian elephants have demonstrated an ability to perform basic arithmetic childhood learning typically children first master counting when given a problem that requires that two items and three items be combined young children model situation with physical objects often fingers or a drawing and then count total as they gain experience they learn or discover strategy of counting on asked to find two plus three children count three past two saying three four five usually ticking off fingers and arriving at five this strategy seems almost universal children can easily pick it up from peers or teachers f smith p 130 most discover it independently with additional experience children learn to add more quickly by exploiting commutativity of addition by counting up from larger number in this case starting with three and counting four five eventually children begin to recall certain addition facts number bonds either through experience or rote memorization once some facts are committed to memory children begin to derive unknown facts from known ones for example a child asked to add six and seven may know that and then reason that is one more or 13 such derived facts can be found very quickly and most elementary school students eventually rely on a mixture of memorized and derived facts to add fluently different nations introduce whole numbers and arithmetic at different ages with many countries teaching addition in pre school s 2014 twenty third study primary mathematics study on whole numbers international journal of stem education 1 1 1 8 chicago however throughout world addition is taught by end of first year of elementary school schmidt w houang r cogan l 2002 a coherent curriculum american educator 26 2 1 18 table children are often presented with addition table of pairs of numbers from 0 to 9 to memorize knowing this one can perform any addition 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 3 3 4 5 6

prerequisite to addition in decimal system is fluent recall or derivation of 100 single digit addition facts one could memorize all facts by rote but pattern based strategies are more enlightening and for most people more efficient and dolk p 99 commutative property mentioned above using pattern a b b a reduces number of addition facts from 100 to 55 one or two more adding 1 or 2 is a basic task and it can be accomplished through counting on or ultimately intuition zero since zero is additive identity adding zero is trivial nonetheless in teaching of arithmetic some students are introduced to addition as a process that always increases addends word problems may help rationalize exception of zero doubles adding a number to itself is related to counting by two and to multiplication doubles facts form a backbone for many related facts and students find them relatively easy to grasp near doubles sums such as 6 7 13 can be quickly derived from doubles fact by adding one more or from but subtracting one five and ten sums of form 5 and 10 are usually memorized early and can be used for deriving other facts for example can be derived from by adding one more making ten an advanced strategy uses 10 as an intermediate for sums involving 8 or 9 for example as students grow older they commit more facts to memory and learn to derive other facts rapidly and fluently many students never commit all facts to memory but can still find any basic fact quickly carry standard algorithm for adding numbers is to align addends vertically and add columns starting from ones column on right if a column exceeds nine extra digit is carried into next column for example in addition 1 27 59 86 7 9 16 and digit 1 is carry some authors think that carry may be inappropriate for education van de walle p 211 calls it obsolete and conceptually misleading preferring word trade however carry remains standard term an alternate strategy starts adding from most significant digit on left this route makes carrying a little but it is faster at getting a rough estimate of sum there are many alternative methods decimal fractions decimal fractions can be added by a simple modification of above process rebecca wingard nelson 2014 decimals and fractions it s easy enslow publishers inc one aligns two decimal fractions above each other with decimal point in same location if necessary one can add trailing zeros to a shorter decimal to make it same length as longer decimal finally one performs same addition process as above except decimal point is placed in answer exactly where it was placed in summands as an example 45 1 4 34 can be solved as follows 4 5 1 0 0 4 3 4 4 9 4 4 scientific notation in scientific notation numbers are written in form where is and is exponential part addition requires two numbers in scientific notation to be represented using same exponential part so that two can simply be added for example non decimal addition in other bases is very similar to decimal addition as an example one can consider addition in binary dale r patrick stephen w vigyan chandra 2008 electronic digital system fundamentals fairmont press inc p 155 adding two single digit binary numbers is relatively simple using a form of carrying 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 carry 1 since 1 1 2 0 1 x 21 adding two 1 digits produces a digit 0 while 1 must be added to next column this is similar to what happens in decimal when certain single digit numbers are added together if result equals or exceeds value of radix 10 digit to left is incremented 5 5 0 carry 1 since 5 5 10 0 1 x 101 7 9 6 carry 1 since 7 9 16 6 1 x 101 this is known as carrying p e bates 1837 common school arithmetic henry benton p 31 when result of an addition exceeds value of a digit procedure is to carry excess amount divided by radix that is 10 10 to left adding it to next positional value this is correct since next position has a weight that is higher by a factor equal to radix carrying works same way in binary 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 36 in this example two numerals are being added together 1310 and 2310 top row shows carry bits used starting in rightmost column 1 is carried to left and 0 is written at bottom of rightmost column second column from right is added again 1 is carried and 0 is written at bottom third column this time a 1 is carried and a 1 is written in bottom row proceeding like this gives final answer 3610 computers right frame addition with an op amp see summing amplifier for details analog computers work directly with physical quantities so their addition mechanisms depend on form of addends a mechanical adder might represent two addends as positions of sliding blocks in which case they can be added with an averaging lever if addends are rotation speeds of two shafts they can be added with a differential a hydraulic adder can add pressures in two chambers by exploiting newton s second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons most common situation for a general purpose analog computer is to add two voltages referenced to ground this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network but a better design exploits an operational

ripple carry adder which follows standard multi digit algorithm one slight improvement is carry skip design again following human intuition one does not perform all carries in computing but one bypasses group of 9s and skips to answer flynn and overman pp 2 8 in practice computational addition may be achieved via xor and and logical operations in conjunction with bitshift operations as shown in pseudocode below both xor and and gates are straightforward to realize in digital logic allowing realization of full adder circuits which in turn may be combined into more complex logical operations in modern digital computers integer addition is typically fastest arithmetic instruction yet it has largest impact on performance since it underlies all floating point operations as well as such basic tasks as address generation during memory access and fetching instructions during branching to increase speed modern designs calculate digits in parallel these schemes go by such names as

prove usual properties of addition one must first define addition for context in question addition is first defined on natural numbers in set theory addition is then extended to progressively larger sets that include natural numbers integers rational numbers and real numbers enderton chapters 4 and 5 for example follow this development in mathematics education according to a survey of nations with highest mathematics test scores see schmidt w houang r cogan l 2002 a coherent curriculum american educator 26 2 p 4 positive fractions are added before negative numbers are even considered this is also historical route baez p 37 explains historical development in stark contrast with set theory presentation apparently half an apple is easier to understand than a negative apple natural numbers there are two popular ways to define sum of two natural numbers a and b if one defines natural numbers to be cardinalities of finite sets cardinality of a set is number of elements in set then it is appropriate to define their sum as follows let n s be cardinality of a set s take two disjoint sets a and b with and then is defined as p 49 johnson p 120 devine et al p 75 here is union of a and b an alternate version of this definition allows a and b to possibly overlap and then takes their disjoint union a mechanism that allows common elements to be separated out and therefore counted twice other popular definition is recursive let n be successor of n that is number following n in natural numbers so 0 1 1 2 define define general sum recursively by hence enderton p 79 again there are minor variations upon this definition in literature taken literally above definition is an application of recursion theorem on partially ordered set n2 for a version that applies to any with descending chain condition see bergman p 100 on other hand some sources prefer to use a restricted recursion theorem that applies only to set of natural numbers one then considers a to be temporarily fixed applies recursion on b to define a function a and pastes these unary operations for all a together to form full binary operation enderton p 79 observes but we want one binary operation not all these little one place functions this recursive formulation of addition was developed by dedekind as early as 1854 and he would expand upon it in following decades ferreiros p 223 he proved associative and commutative properties among others through mathematical induction integers simplest conception of an integer is that it consists of an absolute value which is a natural number and a sign generally either positive or negative integer zero is a special third case being neither positive nor negative corresponding definition of addition must proceed by cases for an integer n let n be its absolute value let a and b be integers if either a or b is zero treat it as an identity if a and b are both positive define if a and b are both negative define if a and b have different signs define to be difference between a and b with sign of term whose absolute value is larger k smith p 234 sparks and rees p 66 as an example because 6 and 4 have different signs their absolute values are subtracted and since absolute value of negative term is larger answer is negative although this definition can be useful for concrete problems number of cases to consider complicates proofs unnecessarily so following method is commonly used for defining integers it is based on remark that every integer is difference of two natural integers and that two such differences and are equal if and only if so one can define formally integers as equivalence classes of ordered pairs of natural numbers under equivalence relation if and only if equivalence class of contains either if or otherwise if is a natural number one can denote equivalence class of and by equivalence class of this allows identifying natural number with equivalence class addition of ordered pairs is done component wise a straightforward computation shows that equivalence class of result depends only on equivalences classes of summands and thus that this defines an addition of equivalence classes that is integers enderton p 92 another straightforward computation shows that this addition is same as above case definition this way of defining integers as equivalence classes of pairs of natural numbers can be used to embed into a group any commutative semigroup with cancellation property here semigroup is formed by natural numbers and group is additive group of integers rational numbers are constructed similarly by taking as semigroup nonzero integers with multiplication this construction has been also generalized under name of grothendieck group to case of any commutative semigroup without cancellation property semigroup homomorphism from semigroup into group may be non injective originally grothendieck group was more specifically result of this construction applied to equivalences classes under isomorphisms of objects of an abelian category with direct sum as semigroup operation rational numbers fractions addition of rational numbers can be computed using least common denominator but a conceptually simpler definition involves only integer addition and multiplication define as an example sum addition of fractions is much simpler when denominators are same in this case one can simply add while leaving denominator same so cameron and carolyn craig 2013 adding and subtracting fractions grades 5 8 mark twain inc commutativity and associativity of rational addition is an easy consequence of laws of integer arithmetic are carried out in enderton p 104 and sketched for a general field of fractions over a commutative ring in dummit and foote p 263 for a more rigorous and general discussion see field of fractions real numbers right 250px thumb adding p2 6 and e using dedekind cuts of rationals a common construction of set of real numbers is dedekind completion of set of rational numbers a real number is defined to be a dedekind cut of rationals a non empty set of rationals that is closed downward and has no greatest element sum of real numbers a and b is defined element by element define enderton p 114 this definition was first published in a slightly modified form by richard dedekind in 1872 ferreiros p 135 see section 6 of und zahlen commutativity and associativity of real addition are immediate defining real number 0 to be set of negative rationals it is easily seen to be additive identity probably trickiest part of this construction pertaining to addition is definition of additive inverses intuitive approach inverting every element of a cut and taking its complement works only for irrational numbers see enderton p 117 for details right 250px thumb adding p2 6 and e using cauchy sequences of rationals unfortunately dealing with multiplication of dedekind cuts is a time consuming case by case process similar to addition of signed integers schubert e thomas phillip j and james alves foss higher order logic theorem proving and its applications proceedings of 8th international workshop volume 971 of lecture notes in computer science 1995 another approach is metric completion of rational numbers a real number is essentially defined to be limit of a cauchy sequence of rationals lim an addition is defined term by term define textbook constructions are usually not so cavalier with lim symbol see burrill p 138 for a more careful drawn out development of addition with cauchy sequences this definition was first published by georg cantor also in 1872 although his formalism was slightly different ferreiros p 128 one must prove that this operation is well defined dealing with co cauchy sequences once that task is done all properties of real addition follow immediately from properties of rational numbers furthermore other arithmetic operations including multiplication have straightforward analogous definitions burrill p 140 complex numbers 200px right thumb addition of two complex numbers can be done geometrically by constructing a parallelogram complex numbers are added by adding real and imaginary parts of summands that is to say using visualization of complex numbers in complex plane addition has following geometric interpretation sum of two complex numbers a and b interpreted as points of complex plane is point x obtained by building a parallelogram three of whose vertices are o a and b equivalently x is point such that triangles with vertices o a b and x b a are congruent generalizations there are many binary operations that can be viewed as generalizations of addition operation on real numbers field of abstract algebra is centrally concerned with such generalized operations and they also appear in set theory and category theory abstract algebra vectors in linear algebra a vector space is an algebraic structure that allows for adding any two vectors and for scaling vectors a familiar vector space is set of all ordered pairs of real numbers ordered pair a b is interpreted as a vector from origin in euclidean plane to point a b in plane sum of two vectors is obtained by adding their individual coordinates this addition operation is central to classical mechanics in which vectors are interpreted as forces matrices matrix addition is defined for two matrices of same dimensions sum of two m x n pronounced m by n matrices a and b denoted by is again an matrix computed by adding corresponding elements lipschutz s m 2001 schaum s outline of theory and problems of linear algebra for example modular arithmetic in modular arithmetic set of integers modulo 12 has twelve elements it inherits an addition operation from integers that is central to musical set theory set of integers modulo 2 has just two elements addition operation it inherits is known in boolean logic as exclusive or function in geometry sum of two angle measures is often taken to be their sum as real numbers modulo 2p this amounts to an addition operation on circle which in turn generalizes to addition operations on many dimensional tori general theory general theory of abstract algebra allows an addition operation to be any associative and commutative operation on a set basic algebraic structures with such an addition operation include commutative monoids and abelian groups set theory and category theory a far reaching generalization of addition of natural numbers is addition of ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers in set theory these give two different generalizations of addition of natural numbers to transfinite unlike most addition operations addition of ordinal numbers is not commutative addition of cardinal numbers however is a commutative operation closely related to disjoint union operation in category theory disjoint union is seen as a particular case of operation and general coproducts are perhaps most abstract of all generalizations of addition some coproducts such as direct sum and wedge sum are named to evoke their connection with addition related operations addition along with subtraction multiplication and division is considered one of basic operations and is used in elementary arithmetic arithmetic subtraction can be thought of as a kind of addition that is addition of an additive inverse subtraction is itself a sort of inverse to addition in that adding and subtracting are inverse functions given a set with an addition operation one cannot always define a corresponding subtraction operation on that set set of natural numbers is a simple example on other hand a subtraction operation uniquely determines an addition operation an additive inverse operation and an additive identity for this reason an additive group can be described as a set that is closed under subtraction set still must be nonempty dummit and foote p 48 discuss this criterion written multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition if a single term appears in a sum n times then sum is product of n and if n is not a natural number product may still make sense for example multiplication by yields additive inverse of a number thumb a circular slide rule in real and complex numbers addition and multiplication can be interchanged by exponential function rudin p 178 this identity allows multiplication to be carried out by consulting a table of logarithms and computing addition by hand it also enables multiplication on a slide rule formula is still a good first order approximation in broad context of lie groups where it relates multiplication of infinitesimal group elements with addition of vectors in associated lie algebra lee p 526 proposition 20 9 there are even more generalizations of multiplication than addition p 49 observes by multiplication properly speaking a mathematician may mean practically anything by addition he may mean a great variety of things but not so great a variety as he will mean by multiplication in general multiplication operations always distribute over addition this requirement is formalized in definition of a ring in some contexts such as integers distributivity over addition and existence of a multiplicative identity is enough to uniquely determine multiplication operation distributive property also provides information about addition by expanding product in both ways one concludes that addition is forced to be commutative for this reason ring addition is commutative in general dummit and foote p 224 for this argument to work one still must assume that addition is a group operation and that multiplication has an identity division is an arithmetic operation remotely related to addition since division is right distributive over addition for an example of left and right distributivity see especially p 15 however division is not left distributive over addition is not same as ordering right thumb log log plot of and from 0 001 to viro figure 1 p 2 maximum operation max a b is a binary operation similar to addition in fact if two nonnegative numbers a and b are of different orders of magnitude then their sum is approximately equal to their maximum this approximation is extremely useful in applications of mathematics for example in truncating taylor series however it presents a perpetual difficulty in numerical analysis essentially since max is not invertible if b is much greater than a then a straightforward calculation of can accumulate an unacceptable round off error perhaps even returning zero see also loss of significance approximation becomes exact in a kind of infinite limit if either a or b is an infinite cardinal number their cardinal sum is exactly equal to greater of two enderton calls this statement absorption law of cardinal arithmetic it depends on comparability of cardinals and therefore on axiom of choice accordingly there is no subtraction operation for infinite cardinals enderton p 164 maximization is commutative and associative like addition furthermore since addition preserves ordering of real numbers addition distributes over max in same way that multiplication distributes over addition for these reasons in tropical geometry one replaces multiplication with addition and addition with maximization in this context addition is called tropical multiplication maximization is called tropical addition and tropical additive identity is negative infinity mikhalkin p 1 some authors prefer to replace addition with minimization then additive identity is positive infinity et al p 4 tying these observations together tropical addition is approximately related to regular addition through logarithm which becomes more accurate as base of logarithm increases mikhalkin p 2 approximation can be made exact by extracting a constant h named by analogy with planck s constant from quantum mechanics litvinov et al p 3 and taking classical limit as h tends to zero in this sense maximum operation is a version of addition viro p 4 other ways to add also known as successor operation is addition of to a number summation describes addition of arbitrarily many numbers usually more than just two it includes idea of sum of a single number which is itself and empty sum which is zero martin p 49 an infinite summation is a delicate procedure known as a series stewart p 8 counting a finite set is equivalent to summing 1 over set integration is a kind of summation over a continuum or more precisely and generally over a differentiable manifold integration over a zero dimensional manifold reduces to summation linear combinations combine multiplication and summation they are sums in which each term has a multiplier usually a real or complex number linear combinations are especially useful in contexts where straightforward addition would violate some normalization rule such as mixing of strategies in game theory or superposition of states in quantum mechanics convolution is used to add two independent random variables defined by distribution functions its usual definition combines integration subtraction and multiplication in general convolution is useful as a kind of domain side addition by contrast vector addition is a kind of range side addition see also verbal arithmetic also known as puzzles involving addition parallel addition mathematics notes
