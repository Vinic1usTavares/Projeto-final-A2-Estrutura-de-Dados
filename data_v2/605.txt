late one night in liverpool when he came into studio where he then developed it on piano according to martin clocks was inspired by english rock band muse martin presented riff to band s guitarist jonny buckland who then added a layer of guitar chords to basic track he picked up his guitar a sure sign that he likes a song and played these brilliant chords it was like a chemical reaction process before writing and composing clocks band had already written 10 songs for album however because a rush of blood to head was nearing completion they thought it was too late to include new song on it hence they recorded a demo and saved it with other unfinished tracks labelling it songs for 3 band intended these tracks for what would be their third album by june 2002 coldplay were ready to present new album to their record label parlophone however martin felt it was rubbish they were so far from being completely satisfied with album that both band and parlophone delayed release after a headlining tour coldplay went on working songs for 3 phil harvey band s manager and a friend of martin heard it and pressed him to rework clocks immediately harvey pointed out that with its lyrics that speak of urgency its meaning contradicted martin s idea of stashing track thus persuaded by harvey martin then further developed clocks while other band members supplemented his work with their ideas based on main piano track adding bass and drums coldplay recorded song very quickly because schedule of a rush of blood to head had already been delayed album was released two months later composition clocks is an alternative rock song with elements of psychedelic rock it features a repeating piano melody and a minimalist atmospheric soundscape of synthesizer pads drums electric guitar and bass guitar martin applied an ostinato with emphasis that imitates a three against two polyrhythm as well as a descending scale on piano chord progression which switches from major to minor chords themes of lyrics include contrast contradictions and urgency according to jon of mtv news martin seems to address helplessness of being in a dysfunctional relationship he doesn t necessarily want to escape lyrics are cryptic ending lines of second verse emphasise contradicting emotion come out upon my seas cursed missed opportunities am i a part of cure or am i part of disease song s title also metaphorically alludes to its lyrics pushing one to wonder about world s obsession with time while connecting it to theory make best of it when we re here present and alive song is in key of a major
