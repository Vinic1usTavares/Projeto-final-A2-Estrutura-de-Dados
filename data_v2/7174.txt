thumb uss west mahomet in first world war dazzle camouflage ship camouflage is a form of military deception in which a ship is painted in one or more colors in order to obscure or confuse an enemy s visual observation several types of marine camouflage have been used or prototyped blending or crypsis in which a paint scheme attempts to hide a ship from view deception in which a ship is made to look smaller or as with q ships to mimic merchantmen and dazzle a chaotic paint scheme which tries to confuse any estimate of distance direction or heading counterillumination to hide a darkened ship against slightly brighter night sky was trialled by royal canadian navy in diffused lighting camouflage ships were sometimes camouflaged in classical times mediterranean pirate ships were sometimes painted blue gray for concealment vegetius records that julius caesar s scout ships were painted bluish green when gathering intelligence along coast of britain during gallic wars ships were sometimes painted deceptively during age of sail while both sides in american civil war camouflaged their ships whether to run blockades or for night reconnaissance ship camouflage was used in earnest by british admiralty in first world war marine artist norman wilkinson led research into dazzle camouflage resulting in painting of thousands of british and later american ships in dazzle patterns he intended it not to make ships invisible nor even to cause enemy to miss his shot but to deceive him into taking up a poor firing position in second world war dazzle was revisited by royal navy and united states navy and applied to a limited extent by other navies after second world war radar made painted camouflage less effective though inshore craft continue to use camouflage schemes alongside anti radar stealth early use thumb roman ships depicted on a 3rd century ad sarcophagus ship camouflage was occasionally used in ancient times 3rd century book imagines notes that mediterranean pirate ships were sometimes painted blue gray for concealment vegetius writing in 4th century says that venetian blue bluish green same color as sea was used in years 56 54 bc during gallic wars when julius caesar sent his scout ships to gather intelligence along coast of britain ships were painted entirely in bluish green wax with sails and ropes same color sailors and marines were also dressed in venetian blue in age of sail deception was often used by ships and paint was applied ad hoc by ships captains for temporary tactical advantage a ship might be painted to look like another it might have its cannon ports hidden by painted canvas to look harmless or it might have additional cannon ports painted on to appear more powerful for example in one of his battles during 1778 1782 american privateer jonathan haraden hid guns of his ship general pickering to appear as if it were a slow merchant ship haraden allowed his ship to be approached at close range by a much faster british privateer then he quickly pulled painted canvas away and delivered a full broadside capturing enemy thumb great white fleet uss connecticut c 1906 in american civil war camouflage paint was applied by both sides during union blockade of 1861 1865 blockade runners aiding confederates sometimes painted their ships all in mist gray to hide themselves in coastal fog one union blockade crew may have painted their rowboat white and its oars and wore white clothing for a night reconnaissance patrol up an enemy held river in 1890s german and french fighting ships were being painted gray american interest in ship camouflage was given official funding in 1898 during spanish american war when white light gray and medium gray paint schemes were evaluated for their ability to hide a ship as seen against distant sky on horizon artist abbott handerson thayer investigated countershading color schemes to paint out natural shadows united states navy switched from gray to white in 1900s and in 1907 its great white fleet set out to circumnavigate globe with all white hulls white paint proved to be unsuccessful and after return of great white fleet its ships were painted gray british ships began being painted gray in 1903 lighter shades were preferred to minimize solar heating in warmer climates first world war thumb uss shawmut was former eastern steamship massachusetts converted to lay 1918 north sea mine barrage in first world war increasing range of naval guns and great fear of high speed long range torpedoes used against warships and merchant ships caused a significant increase in use of ship camouflage royal navy thumb hmt aquitania wearing dazzle camouflage patterned ship camouflage was pioneered in britain early in first world war zoologist john graham kerr advised winston churchill to use disruptive camouflage to break up ships outlines and countershading to make them appear less solid following american artist abbott handerson thayer s beliefs kerr was not an effective political campaigner and his ideas were abandoned on churchill s departure from admiralty while his postwar legal action to claim credit for ship camouflage failed his successor marine artist norman wilkinson successfully promoted idea that kerr s camouflage sought invisibility rather than image disruption under wilkinson admiralty researched and issued a large number of razzle dazzle designs which became known simply as dazzle to counter threat from submarines models were made and painted often by women artists and tested in a laboratory by viewing through a periscope after trials in october 1917 admiralty ordered all its merchant ships to be painted in dazzle patterns purpose of dazzle camouflage was not however motion dazzle but course deception as wilkinson later explained thumb q ship hms tamarisk over 4000 british merchant ships and some 400 naval vessels were painted in dazzle camouflage during 1917 1918 deceptive measures other than dazzle included fitting of anti rangefinder baffles to masts and yards of battleships such as hms emperor of india in 1917 deceptive mimicry was also practised with heavily armed q ships disguised as merchant ships german imperial navy thumb a gun aboard german imperial navy s commerce raider retracted behind side of ship when not in use gun was covered with canvas german navy put little emphasis on camouflage after battle of jutland german naval effort in any case went into submarine warfare however germany made use of disguise such as by painting ships in colour schemes of british or neutral shipping for example kronprinzessin cecilie was painted to resemble british liner olympic and managed to reach america evading british blockade in 1914 in 1915 and 1916 germans further made use of commerce raiders converted freighters with hidden weapons and long range able to slip through british blockade and then attack shipping as far away as south atlantic german first world war merchant ships were rarely camouflaged nor did they use q ships as allied navies did not attack merchant shipping other navies allied navies of france and italy essentially followed admiralty camouflage practice in 1913 american camouflage experiments included a submarine painted in a three color pattern of broad vertical stripes designed by william mackay using white stripes to separate green and blue stripes wilkinson visited united states to advise u s navy on ship camouflage dazzle schemes were used on merchant ships naval transports and smaller warships battleships were camouflaged in a variety of patterns second world war some two color paint schemes attempted to harmonize with both sea and sky near horizon us navy painted some ships dark gray with white structures above bridge level both us navy and royal navy painted ships dark gray on hull and light gray on superstructure and turrets usn measure 12 was a graded system with sea blue low on hull below first continuous deck with ocean gray above that top of masts were painted haze gray this measure was modified with ocean gray above navy blue low on hull below first continuous deck painted parallel to waterline rather than main deck this bold contrast on a horizontal line near horizon reduced visibility to surface observers and created illusion of greater range this camouflage was considered most effective for gunnery engagements with surface units or shore batteries in areas where aerial observation was unlikely it was used in atlantic and european coastal waters from end of 1942 through end of world war ii it was worn by shore bombardment ships in pacific from late 1944 after destruction of japanese naval aviation capability at battle of philippine sea similar admiralty standard schemes were applied beginning in 1944 when it was assumed enemy forces would have radar ships were painted light gray overall except for a sea blue patch low on hull either between main gun turrets or entire length of hull united states navy thumb uss northampton wearing false bow wave of measure 5 thumb uss antietam in measure 32 design 17a 2 in 1935 united states navy naval research laboratory began studies and tests on low visibility camouflage for ships some measures were deceptive like a false painted bow wave to give impression of high speed at all times measures making cruisers resemble destroyers were discontinued after causing station keeping confusion among ships operating in formation color schemes included light gray haze gray ocean gray and black haze gray was found to provide reasonable protection in widest range of conditions and became a standard us navy paint scheme after world war ii ocean gray also became a standard paint scheme after war although black is still used for submarines it was discontinued on destroyers after it had been determined that black ships remained more noticeable than gray ships on even darkest nights us navy painted some ships sea blue overall for concealment from aircraft during battle of coral sea and battle of midway ships painted completely blue came under attack less often than ships wearing two color schemes on advice of united states aviators blue color was darkened and used extensively in western and southern pacific from mid 1942 through 1945 to minimize detection and identification by enemy aircraft dark blue also proved effective under artificial illumination during night actions upper surfaces of aircraft operating from carrier decks were painted a similar shade of blue sailors were ordered to wear dungarees rather than white uniforms when topside thayer system was white with large polygonal patches of light sea blue called thayer blue this measure was most useful in arctic latitudes with extended twilight and frequent fog and cloud cover purity of color was important for full realization of purkinje effect where some colors appear lighter and some appear darker at low levels of illumination darkening pattern increased course deception but increased visibility at night and in haze measure 32 was a medium pattern of obtrusive polygons in navy blue or black against background polygons of lighter grays and greens this measure emphasized mistaken identity and course deception to complicate submarine attack patterns were carried across bow and light gray was used aft to blend with wake this measure was based on world war i dazzle system modified by observations in western pacific and was applied to most surface ships in pacific during 1944 and 1945 different patterns were devised for classes with large numbers of ships so pattern would not identify class of ship royal navy between world wars royal navy ships were painted dark gray in home fleet light gray in mediterranean and caribbean seas and white in indian ocean and western pacific many home fleet ships were painted medium gray during 1939 and 1940 to decrease visibility from peacetime dark gray in first year of war british captains largely painted their ships as they saw fit is believed to have been first ship to adopt a disruptive camouflage paint scheme in december 1939 and several g class destroyers of her flotilla used a similar scheme of contrasting stone colored polygons when concern arose about german aerial reconnaissance of scapa flow some home fleet ships were painted with disruptive flotta schemes of dark brown light gray and light green polygons from april to august 1940 for concealment and identity confusion in port most home fleet ships had been repainted medium gray by december 1940 royal navy painted mediterranean submarines dark blue in 1940 to reduce submerged visibility to aircraft captain louis mountbatten s 5th flotilla of k class destroyers were painted mountbatten pink in 1940 mountbatten observed a union castle liner disappear from convoy during an autumn sunset because of company s unusual lavender mauve gray hull color mountbatten reasoned color would be effective camouflage during dawn and dusk periods and devised a similar shade by mixing medium gray with a small amount of venetian red its effectiveness was much disputed but it was applied to other destroyers a few cruisers and numerous small warships which maintained scheme through 1944 for use in coastal waters no admiralty camouflage section was established until october 1940 admiralty camouflage schemes promulgated in 1941 were not universally adopted because of difficulties with operating schedules and shortages of some paint pigments nearly all destroyers and larger ships wore an admiralty disruptive camouflage scheme by late 1942 but commonwealth captains executed official camouflage schemes with greater variation than was customary with american measures initial admiralty disruptive camouflage schemes employed polygons of varying shades of gray blue and green so at least two of colors would blend with background sea or sky under different light conditions schemes devised for capital ships emphasized identity confusion rather than concealment became first ship to receive an official camouflage scheme in january 1941 as more ships received similar schemes through 1941 it became evident polygons were too small to be differentiated at effective camouflage ranges simplified admiralty light and dark disruptive schemes were promulgated in 1942 to use larger and simpler polygons with no more than four colors light disruptive schemes were intended for use in higher latitudes where skies were often overcast dark disruptive schemes used darker colors providing more effective disruption where bright sunlight could be expected admiralty western approaches scheme evolved from a camouflage scheme applied to in june 1940 at suggestion of naturalist peter scott who was serving aboard that ship broke was painted white with large polygonal patches of light gray light sea blue and light sea green broke achieved some notoriety in a collision where captain of other ship claimed to have been unable to see broke escort captains observing broke experimented with similar schemes including polygons of dark gray or dark blue for increased disruptive contrast while others tried painting their ships entirely white to emphasize concealment admiralty omitted light gray from peter scott s scheme white with large polygonal patches of light sea blue and light sea green was adopted in mid 1941 for use exclusively on destroyers and smaller ships engaged in anti submarine operations this was an effective scheme under typical north atlantic weather conditions of fog and overcast were delivered painted white with a pattern of sea blue and light gray in an american western approaches variant these were colors used in american camouflage measures but pattern was unique to ships produced for royal navy and was replaced by admiralty schemes and colors during refit home fleet destroyer scheme was similar to western approaches scheme but used darker shades of blue and gray on rear third of ship to assist in station keeping british decks were usually dark gray admiralty s informal approach changed when a branch of naval research laboratory was established at leamington spa under commander james bateman to test ship camouflage schemes experimentally painted models were floated in a large tank and examined against different backgrounds using theater lamps to simulate varying lighting conditions an experimental coating able to change color was tested on royal navy submarines on suggestion by professor leslie lead oxide was applied to hull enabling it to become black on application of a solution of sulphite and sea water for night operation for day sailing a solution of hydrogen peroxide and sea water would be applied producing sulphate and returning hull to a white colour desirable for daytime conditions german kriegsmarine german kriegsmarine ships before second world war were either light gray overall or had dark gray hulls and many retained this scheme during war cruiser deutschland for instance had a gray hull and light gray superstructure in 1934 others had dazzle camouflage usually in combinations of pale gray dark gray and sea blue for example hull of battleship scharnhorst had a dazzle pattern of stripes on a gray background in 1940 but some of these were later painted out and bows forward of main guns painted black scharnhorst was not camouflaged against air observation her decks fore and aft bearing large black on white swastikas on a red field her main gun turrets had red in baltic or yellow tops for air recognition battleship bismarck set out to norway in dazzle camouflage this was painted out with gray for her final trip to atlantic cruiser admiral scheer wore a low contrast pattern of irregular dark gray marks on light gray for her superstructure with a dark gray hull black waterline and away from air support while out raiding in 1941 dark gray turret tops larger ships often had false bows and sterns painted in a different shade from rest of hull to create impression of ship being at greater range from observer german decks were a very dark gray smaller ships operating in north sea or baltic sea were painted white or a very pale gray to blend in with daytime mist and nighttime phosphorescent organisms as in first world war germans again employed disguised commerce raiders hilfskreuzer such as atlantis thor and kormoran these ships were able to modify their appearance to throw off searching allied cruisers royal canadian navy thumb hmcs cobalt began secret sea trials of counter illumination camouflage in january 1941 in diffused lighting camouflage project royal canadian navy experimented with variable counter illumination camouflage to match horizon light levels and minimize ships silhouettes during prolonged arctic twilight during experiments one side of test ship was faintly illuminated by projectors mounted outboard results were improved with use of blue green filters and then with a photocell to measure brightness of night sky ship s visibility was reduced but technology was inconvenient and never adopted in practice other navies italian ships of mussolini s navy retained its pre war scheme of light gray overall for its smaller ships but larger units mostly had dazzle camouflage of dark gray light sea blue light sea green and light gray italian had a high visibility pattern of red and white diagonal stripes so that their own aircraft would not attack them japanese ships were generally not camouflaged in special tactical situations camouflage could be improvised as when battleships yamato and musashi had their decks blackened with a mixture of soot to help them hide while passing through san bernardino strait at night in october 1944 battle of leyte gulf japanese ships largely retained their pre war dark gray paint scheme although some major units like aircraft carriers changed to a dark sea green some aircraft carriers had their flight decks painted in a dazzle camouflage but this seems to have been ineffective by 1945 with remnants of japanese navy seeking to hide from american air power its battleships were painted in a variety of camouflage measures haruna for example wore olive green overall its turrets painted light green with gray stripes whereas ise s olive dress was broken up with patches of gray red brown yellow and dark green soviet ships were dark gray overall sometimes with medium gray upperworks french navy used light gray before war and under vichy regime free french ships that operated with british adopted one of british schemes those that were refitted in american shipyards were usually repainted in american measure 22 later uses after second world war universal adoption of radar made traditional camouflage generally less effective and led to development of stealth ships a form of radar camouflage however camouflage may have helped united states warships avoid hits from vietnamese shore batteries which used optical rangefinders some u s navy ptf boats were camouflaged experimentally in 1975 with green overall broken up by patterns of gray and black uss freedom a littoral combat ship is however said to be first u s navy ship to have camouflage reminiscent of that used in world wars notes references sources external links ship camouflage website category ships category military camouflage category camouflage patterns category
