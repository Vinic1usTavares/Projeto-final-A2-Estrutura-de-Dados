opposed to religious views not conforming with his in this he was more rigid than other early massachusetts leaders like john winthrop but less confrontational than john endecott son of a military man who died when he was young dudley saw military service himself during french wars of religion and then acquired some legal training before entering service of his likely kinsman earl of lincoln along with other puritans in lincoln s circle dudley helped organize establishment of massachusetts bay colony sailing with winthrop in 1630 although he served only four one year terms as governor of colony he was regularly in other positions of authority dudley s daughter anne bradstreet 1612 1672 was a prominent early american poet one of gates of harvard yard which existed from 1915 to 1947 was named

born in yardley hastings a village near northampton england on 12 october 1576 to roger and susanna thorne dudley anderson p 584 his father a captain in english army was apparently killed in battle it was for some time believed he was killed in 1590 battle of ivry jones p 3 but this is unlikely because susanna dudley was later found to be widowed by 1588 1586 battle of zutphen has also been suggested as occasion of roger dudley s death richardson et al p 280 family has long asserted connections to sutton dudleys of dudley castle there is a similarity in their coats of arms jones pp 3 10 but association beyond probable common ancestry has not yet been conclusively demonstrated anderson p 585 like many other young men of good birth thomas dudley became a page in his case in household of william baron compton at nearby castle ashby later he raised a company of men following a call to arms by queen elizabeth and served in english army led by sir arthur savage fighting with king

recognized for his honesty at a time when many judges were susceptible to bribery and other malfeasance jones pp 25 26 he was also sympathetic to puritan cause exposure to legal affairs and nicolls religious views probably had a significant influence on dudley after nicolls sudden death in 1616 dudley took a position with theophilus clinton 4th earl of lincoln serving as a steward responsible for managing some of earl s estates although there is a likely blood connection reason for appointment may be that dudley s soldier grandfather henry had served under edward clinton 1st earl of lincoln earl s estate in lincolnshire was a center of nonconformist thought and dudley was already recognized for his puritan virtues by time he entered earl s service jones pp 31 32 according to cotton mather s biography of dudley he successfully disentangled a legacy of financial difficulties bequeathed to earl and earl consequently came to depend on dudley for financial advice jones p 40

company with a view toward establishing a puritan colony in north america dudley s name does not appear on land grant issued to company that year but he was almost certainly involved in formative stages of company whose investors and supporters included many individuals in earl of lincoln s circle jones pp 44 46 55 company sent a small group of colonists led by john endecott to begin building a settlement called salem on shores of massachusetts bay a second group was sent in 1629 hurd p vii company acquired a royal charter in april 1629 and later that year made critical decision to

arrived in salem harbour on 22 june jones pp 64 75 finding conditions at salem inadequate for establishing a larger colony winthrop and dudley led forays into charles river watershed but were apparently unable to immediately agree on a site for capital jones p 78 with limited time to establish themselves and concerns over rumors of potential hostile french action leaders decided to distribute colonists in several places in order to avoid presenting a single target for hostilities dudleys probably spent winter of 1630 31 in boston which was where leadership chose to stay after

was banished from colony and a number of her followers left colony as a consequence battis pp 232 48 she settled in rhode island where roger williams also persona non grata in massachusetts over theological differences offered her shelter moore p 288 dudley s role in affair is unclear but historians supportive of hutchinson s cause argue that he was a significant force in her banishment jones p 226 and that he was unhappy that colony did not adopt a more rigid stance or ban more of her followers bremer 2003 p 298 vane was turned out of office in 1637 over hutchinson affair and his
