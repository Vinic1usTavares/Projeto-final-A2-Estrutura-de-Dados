and disc jockey from zoolander shown in a deleted scene production script stiller developed premise for tropic thunder while shooting empire of sun in which he played a small part stiller wanted to make a film based on actors he knew who after taking part in boot camps to prepare for war film roles became self important and self involved and appeared to believe they had been part of a real military unit co writer theroux revealed that initial script concept was to have actors go to a mock boot camp and return with posttraumatic stress disorder final script was developed to satirize vietnam war films such as apocalypse now rambo missing in action platoon full metal jacket hamburger hill and deer hunter theroux pointed out that since viewers had an increased awareness of inner workings of hollywood due to celebrity websites and hollywood news sources script was easier to write dialogue for unscripted portions of storyboard was developed on set by actors or was improvised casting etan cohen created role of kirk lazarus as a way of lampooning great lengths that some method actors go to depict a role downey was approached by stiller about part while on vacation in hawaii downey said on cbs early show that his first reaction was this is stupidest idea i ve ever heard and that stiller responded yeah i know isn t it great in another interview downey said that he accepted part but having no idea where or even how to start building character of lazarus eventually settled on a jive esque speech pattern and a ragged bass voice he then auditioned lazarus voice over phone to stiller who approved characterization immediately downey revealed that he modeled character on actors russell crowe colin farrell and daniel day lewis initial script was written for downey s character to be irish but was altered after downey stated he could improvise better as an australian he had previously played a similar outlandish australian character in film natural born killers

application according to downey one makeup artist would start on one side of my face and a second makeup artist would start on other side and then they d meet in middle downey s makeup was designed and created by makeup effects legend rick baker who is no stranger to race transformations after a number of films with eddie murphy where he has done so his makeup consisted of a prosthetic nose and bottom lip appliance with hair pieces and paint that would replicate african american skin tones makeup artists john blake and greg nelson would apply and maintain downey s makeup everyday on set downey acknowledged potential controversy over his role at end of day it s always about how well you commit to character if i didn t feel it was morally sound or that it would be easily misinterpreted that i m just c thomas howell in soul man i would ve stayed home jackson stated when i first read script i was like what blackface but when i saw him act he like became a black man it was just good acting it was weird on set because he would keep going with character he s a method actor stiller commented on downey s portrayal of a white actor playing a black man when people see movie in context of film he s playing a method actor who s gone to great lengths to play a black guy movie is skewering actors and how they take themselves so seriously stiller previewed film before naacp and several

embellished to look more destructive visual effects supervisor michael fink reflected on exaggerated explosions we worked really hard to make cg crashing helicopter in hot landing sequence look real ben was adamant about that but at same time he wanted explosion to be huge when you see it hit ground it was like it was filled with gasoline it was same thing with ben s sergeant character who almost intercepts a hand grenade now i was in army for three years and no hand grenade would make an explosion like that but it was a big dramatic moment and it looks really cool and feels kind of real filming large napalm explosion in opening scene of film required a 450 foot 137 meter row of explosive pots containing 1 100 gallons 4 165 liters of gasoline and diesel fuel all palm trees used in explosion were moved to specific location after crew determined impact of lighting and necessary camera angles due to size and cost of 1 25 second explosion it was only performed once and was captured

as one of dreamworks s best prospects for summer claudia puig of usa today gave film a positive review writing there are some wildly funny scenes a few leaden ones and others that are scattershot with humorous satire undercut by over top still when it s funny it s really funny a review in variety by todd mccarthy was critical apart from startling out there comic turns by robert downey jr and tom cruise however antics here are pretty thin redundant and one note rick groen of globe and mail gave film a negative review calling it an assault in guise of a comedy watching it is like getting mugged by a clown j r jones of chicago reader stated rest of movie never lives up to hilarity of opening partly because large scale production smothers gags but mostly because those gags are so easy to smother roger ebert of chicago sun times gave 3 5 4 and wrote movie is may i say considerably better than stiller s previous film zoolander 2001 it s kind of summer comedy that rolls in makes a lot of people laugh and rolls on to video faux trailers before film also received mixed reviews david ansen of newsweek approved of trailers writing tropic thunder is funniest movie of summer so funny in

hilarious and would bring viewers fondest memories of his work scott feinberg of los angeles times criticized concept of downey s portrayal of an african american writing i just can t imagine any circumstance under which a blackface performance would be acceptable any more than i can imagine any circumstance under which use of n word would be acceptable sara said cruise did an astonishingly funny and surprising supporting performance logan hill of new york argued against cruise s cameo saying that it just makes him look a little lost and almost pathetic shucking and jiving trying to appeal to younger moviegoers who are abandoning him several critics commented on controversy over lines in film talking about mentally disabled duane dudek of milwaukee journal sentinel wrote that film is just sophomoric enough to offend and while it is also funny it is without empathy or compassion to cause us to wonder why we are laughing christian toto of washington times argued against opposition tropic thunder is drawing fire from special interest groups for its frequent use of word retard but discerning audiences will know where humor is targeted and they ll be laughing too hard to take offense kurt loder of mtv contrasted opposition to lines with downey character portrayal of an african american scene in which derisive alpa chino brandon t jackson nails lazarus recitation of black uplift homilies as nothing more than lyrics to jeffersons theme is funny but one in which lazarus quietly explains to speedman that his simple jack character failed because he made mistake of going full retard rather than softening his character with cuteness in manner of forrest gump is so on nose accurate it takes your breath away critics lists in january 2009 entertainment weekly
