hundred horses and some camels while medinan defenders numbered 3 000 largely outnumbered defenders of medina mainly muslims led by islamic prophet muhammad dug a trench on suggestion of salman al farsi sealed nectar by safi ur rahman which together with medina s natural fortifications rendered confederate cavalry consisting of horses and camels useless locking two sides in a stalemate hoping to make several attacks at once confederates persuaded muslim allied medinan jews banu qurayza to attack city from south however muhammad s diplomacy derailed negotiations and broke up confederacy against him well organised defenders sinking of confederate morale and poor weather conditions caused siege to end in a fiasco siege was a battle of wits in which muslims tactically overcame their opponents while suffering very few casualties efforts to defeat muslims failed and islam became influential in region as a consequence muslim army besieged area of banu qurayza tribe leading to their surrender and enslavement or execution defeat caused meccans to lose their trade and much of their prestige name battle is named after trench or khandaq that was dug by muslims in preparation for battle word khandaq is form of persian word meaning that which has been dug nomani sirat al nabi pp 368 370 salman farsi persian advised muhammad to dig a trench around city battle is also referred to

battle of uhud their military strength was gradually growing in april 626 muhammad raised a force of 300 men and 10 horses to meet quraysh army of 1 000 at badr for time although no fighting occurred coastal tribes were impressed with muslim power muhammad also tried with limited success to break up many alliances against muslim expansion nevertheless he was unable to prevent meccan one watt muhammad at medina pp 34 37 as they had in battles of badr and uhud muslim army again used strategic methods against their opponents at badr muslims surrounded wells but did not deprive their opponents of water since ali did not want to follow footsteps of meccan army at battle of uhud muslims made strategic use of hills in this battle they dug a trench to render enemy cavalry ineffective reason for battle reason for this battle was to defend medina from attack after banu nazir and banu qurayzah tribes formed an alliance with quraysh to attack him as revenge for expelling them from medina during invasion of banu qaynuqa and invasion of banu nadir sealed nectar pp 196 198 online muslim scholar ibn kathir states reason why confederates came was that a group of leaders of banu nadir whom messenger of allah had expelled from al madinah to khaybar including sallam bin abu al sallam bin and kinanah bin ar rabi went to makkah where they met with leaders of quraysh and incited them to make war against prophet muhammad abdul rahman tafsir ibn kathir 21 part 21 al 46 to al ahzab 30 2nd edition p 122 msa publication limited 2009 online confederates early in 627 banu nadir met with quraysh of mecca huyayy ibn akhtab along with other leaders from khaybar travelled to swear allegiance with ibn umayya at mecca bulk of confederate armies were gathered by quraysh of makkah led by abu sufyan who fielded 4 000 foot soldiers 300 horsemen and 1 000 1 500 men on camels banu nadir began rousing nomads of najd nadir enlisted banu ghatafan by paying them half of their harvest this contingent second largest added a strength of about 2 000 men and 300 horsemen led by bin hasan bani assad also agreed to join led by al halabi al sirat al p 19 from banu nadir secured 700 men though this force would likely have been much larger had not some of its leaders been sympathetic towards islam bani amir who had a pact with muhammad refused to join lings muhammad his life based on earliest sources pp other tribes included banu with 400 men led by ibn auf murri and banu shuja with 700 men led by sufyan ibn abd shams in total strength of confederate armies though not agreed upon by scholars is estimated to have included around 10 000 men and six hundred horsemen in january 627 army which was led by abu sufyan marched on medina rodinson muhammad prophet of islam p 208 in accordance with plan armies began marching towards medina meccans from south along coast and others from east at same time horsemen from banu khuza a left to warn medina of invading army muslim defence men from banu khuza a reached muhammad in four days warning him of confederate armies that were to arrive in a week muhammad gathered medinans to discuss best strategy of overcoming enemy meeting enemy in open which led to victory at badr and waiting for them inside city a lesson learnt from defeat at uhud were both suggested ultimately outnumbered muslims opted to engage in a defensive battle by digging deep trenches to act as a barrier along northern front tactic of a defensive trench was introduced by salman persian every capable muslim in medina including muhammad contributed to digging massive trench in six days rodinson p 209 ditch was dug on northern side only as rest of medina was surrounded by rocky mountains and trees impenetrable to large armies especially cavalry digging of ditch coincided with a near famine in medina women and children were moved to inner city medinans harvested all their crops early so confederate armies would have to rely on their own food reserves muhammad established his military headquarters at hillock of sala and army was arrayed there this position would give muslims an advantage if enemy crossed trench final army that would defend city from invasion consisted of 3 000 men glasse smith new encyclopedia of islam a revised edition of concise encyclopedia of islam p 81 and included all inhabitants of medina over age of 14 except banu qurayza qurayza did supply muslims with some instruments for digging trench siege of medina siege of medina began in january 627 and lasted for 27 days watt muhammad at medina p since sieges were uncommon in arabian warfare arriving confederates were unprepared to deal with trenches dug by muslims confederates tried to attack with horsemen in hopes of forcing a passage but medinans were rigidly entrenched preventing such a crossing watt muhammad prophet and statesman pp 167 174 both of armies gathered on either side of trench and spent two or three weeks exchanging insults in prose and verse backed up with arrows fired from a comfortable distance according to rodinson there were three dead among attackers and five among defenders on other hand harvest had been gathered and besiegers had some trouble finding food for their horses which proved of no use to them in attack rodinson pp quraysh veterans grew impatient with deadlock a group of militants led by amr ibn abd wudd who was thought to be equal to a thousand men in ibn e sadd 1 412 page 84 and ikrimah ibn abi attempted to thrust through trench and managed to effect a crossing occupying a marshy area near hillock of sala amr challenged muslims to a duel in response ali ibn abi talib accepted challenge and was sent by muhammad to fight as ali went to fight amr ibn abd wudd muhammad said about ali he is embodiment of all faith who is going to an encounter with embodiment of all unbelief both fighters got lost in dust as duel became intense finally soldiers heard scream s which hinted decisive blows but it was unclear which of two was successful slogan allahu akbar god is greatest from dust confirmed ali s victory confederates were forced to withdraw in a state of panic and confusion khan muhammad seal of prophets pp 177 179 ali as per his principles allowed amr s entourage to retreat ali never pursued a fleeing enemy confederate army made several other attempts to cross trench during night but repeatedly failed although confederates could have deployed their infantry over whole length of trench they were unwilling to engage muslims at close quarter as former regarded latter as superior in hand to hand fighting as muslim army was well dug in behind embankment made from earth which had been taken from ditch and prepared to bombard attackers with stones and arrows any attack could cause great casualties banu qurayza confederates then attempted several simultaneous attacks in particular by trying to persuade banu qurayza to attack muslims from south from confederates huyayy ibn akhtab a leader of exiled tribe banu nadir returned to medina seeking their support against muslims nomani p 382 so far banu qurayza had tried their best to remain neutral and were very hesitant about joining confederates since they had earlier made a pact with muhammad when huyayy approached them their leader refused to allow him entry lings pp 221 223 huyayy eventually managed to enter and persuade them that muslims would surely be overwhelmed sight of vast confederate armies surging over land with soldiers and horses as far as eye could see swung qurayza opinion in favour of confederacy news of qurayzah s supposed renunciation of pact with muhammad leaked out and umar promptly informed muhammad such suspicions were reinforced by movement of enemy troops towards strongholds of qurayza ramadan in footsteps of prophet pp 137 145 muhammad became anxious about their conduct watt banu encyclopaedia of islam and realised grave potential danger qurayza posed because of his pact with qurayza he had not bothered to make defensive preparations along muslims border with tribe qurayza also possessed weaponry 1 500 swords 2 000 lances 300 suits of armour and 500 shields heck arabia without spices an alternate hypothesis pp 547 567 muhammad sent three leading muslims to bring him details of recent developments he advised men to openly declare their findings should they find banu qurayza to be loyal so as to increase morale of muslim fighters however he warned against spreading news of a possible breach of pact on qurayza s part so as to avoid any panic within muslim ranks leaders found that pact indeed had been renounced and tried in vain to convince qurayza to revert by reminding them of fate of banu nadir and banu qaynuqa at hands of muhammad findings of leaders were signalled to muhammad in a metaphor adal and qarah because people of adal and qarah had betrayed muslims and killed them at opportune moment maududi believes metaphor means qurayza were thought to be about to do same maududi meaning of quran p crisis in medina muhammad attempted to hide his knowledge of activities of banu qurayza however rumours soon spread of a massive assault on city of medina from qurayza s side which severely demoralised medinans peterson muhammad prophet of god p muslims found themselves in greater difficulties by day food was running short and nights were colder lack of sleep made matters worse so tense was situation that for first time canonical daily prayers were neglected by muslim community only at night when attacks stopped due to darkness could they resume their regular worship according to ibn ishaq situation became serious and fear was everywhere peters muhammad and origins of islam p quran describes situation in surah al ahzab muslim response immediately after hearing rumours about qurayza muhammad had sent 100 men to inner city for its protection later he sent 300 horsemen cavalry was not needed at trench as well to protect city loud voices in which troops prayed every night created illusion of a large force crisis showed muhammad that many of his men had reached limits of their endurance he sent word to ghatafan trying to pay for their defection and offering them a third of medina s date harvest if they withdrew although ghatafan demanded half they eventually agreed to negotiating with muhammad on those terms before muhammad began order of drafting agreement he consulted medinan leaders they sharply rejected terms of agreement lings pp 224 226 protesting medina had never sunk to such levels of ignominy negotiations were broken off while ghatafan did not retreat they had compromised themselves by entering into negotiations with medina and confederacy s internal dissension had thereby been increased at about that point muhammad received a visit from nuaym ibn masud an arab leader who was well respected by entire confederacy but who had unknown to them secretly converted to islam muhammad asked him to end siege by creating discord amongst confederates citation needed nuaym then came up with an efficient stratagem he first went to banu qurayza and warned them about intentions of rest of confederacy if siege fails he said confederacy will not be afraid to abandon jews leaving them at mercy of muhammad qurayza should thus demand confederate leaders as hostages in return for cooperation this advice touched upon fears qurayza had already harboured next nuaym went to abu sufyan confederate leader warning him that qurayza had defected to muhammad he stated that tribe intended to ask confederacy for hostages ostensibly in return for cooperation but really to hand over to muhammad thus confederacy should not give a single man as hostage nuaym repeated same message to other tribes in confederacy collapse of confederacy nuaym s stratagem worked after consulting confederate leaders sent ikrimah to qurayza signalling a united invasion of medina qurayza however demanded hostages as a guarantee that confederacy would not desert them confederacy considering that qurayza might give hostage to muhammad refused messages were repeatedly sent back and forth between parties but each held to its position stubbornly abu sufyan summoned huyayy ibn akhtab informing him of qurayza s response huyayy was taken aback and abu sufyan branded him as a traitor fearing for his life huyayy fled to qurayza s strongholds bedouins ghatafan and other confederates from najd had already been compromised by muhammad s negotiations they had taken part in expedition in hopes of plunder rather than for personal reasons they lost hope as chances of success dwindled uninterested in continuing siege two confederate armies were marked by recriminations and mutual distrust provisions of confederate armies were running out horses and camels were dying out of hunger and wounds for days weather had been exceptionally cold and wet violent winds blew out camp fires taking away from confederate army their source of heat muslim camp however was sheltered from such winds enemy s tents were torn up their fires were extinguished sand and rain beat in their faces and they were terrified by portents against them they had already well nigh fallen out among themselves during night confederate armies withdrew and by morning ground was cleared of all enemy forces lings pp aftermath siege and demise of banu qurayza following retreat of confederate army banu qurayza neighbourhoods were besieged by muslims after a 25 day siege of their neighbourhood banu qurayza unconditionally surrendered when banu qurayza tribe surrendered muslim army seized their stronghold and their possessions watt muhammad prophet and statesman pp 170 176 on request of banu aus who were allied to qurayza muhammad chose one of them sa ad ibn mu adh as an arbitrator to pronounce judgment upon them sa ad who would later die of his wounds from battle decreed sentence according to torah in which men shall be killed and women and children enslaved says when you march up to attack a city make its people an offer of peace if they accept and open their gates all people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you if they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle lay siege to that city when lord your god delivers it into your hand put to sword all men in it as for women children livestock and everything else in city you may take these as plunder for yourselves and you may use plunder lord your god gives you from your enemies deuteronomy 20 10 14 new international version muhammad approved of this decision and next day sentence was carried out men numbering between 400 and life of muhammad a translation of ibn ishaq s sirat rasul allah p 461 464 were bound and placed under custody of muhammad ibn while women and children were placed under abdullah ibn salam a former rabbi who had converted to islam muir a life of mahomet and history of islam to era of hegira pp 272 274 ibn ishaq describes killing of banu qurayza men as follows a number of individuals were spared when various muslims intervened on their behalf several accounts note muhammad s companions as executioners umar and al zubayr in particular and that each clan of aws was also charged with killing a group of qurayza men kister massacre of banu quraiza p inamdar muhammad and rise of islam pp according to ibn ishaq s biography of muhammad one woman who had thrown a millstone from battlements during siege and killed one of muslim besiegers was also beheaded along with men a isha one of mohammad s wives is cited as describing woman as laughing and chatting with her during massacre down to moment her name was called out by allah she said that is me i said to her you poor soul what is to happen to you she said i must be killed why i asked her for something i did she answered she went away and was beheaded by allah a isha adds i shall never forget her cheerfulness and her great laugh when she knew that she was to be killed maxime rodinson mohammad 1961 penguin books 1971 p 213 muir p 277 ibn ishaq biography of muhammad ibn asakir writes in his history of damascus that banu kilab a clan of arab clients of banu qurayza were also killed on arabs of banu kilab executed together with banu qurayza p 69 spoils of battle including enslaved women and children of tribe were divided up among muslims that had participated in siege and among from mecca who had hitherto depended on help of muslims native to medina kister massacre of banu quraiza pp rodinson muhammad prophet of islam p 213 as part of his share of spoils muhammad selected one of women for himself and took her as part of his booty muhammad offered to free and marry her and according to some sources she accepted his proposal while according to others she rejected it and remained muhammad s slave ramadan p 146 she is said to have later become a muslim scholars argue that muhammad had already decided upon this judgment before qurayza s surrender and that sa ad was putting his allegiance to muslim community above that to his tribe one reason cited by some for such punishment is that muhammad s previous clemency towards defeated foes was in contradiction to arab and jewish laws of time and was seen as a sign of weakness others see punishment as a response to what was perceived as an act of treason by qurayza since they betrayed their joint defence pact with muhammad by giving aid and comfort to enemies of muslims maxime rodinson interprets massacre as an astute political move that overrode all feelings of humanity in order to remove a constant source of threat to medina and dishearten his enemies implications failure of siege marked beginning of muhammad s undoubted political ascendancy in city of medina watt muhammad prophet and statesman p 96 meccans had exerted their utmost strength to dislodge muhammad from medina and this defeat caused them to lose their trade with syria and much of their prestige with it watt conjectures that meccans at this point began to contemplate that conversion to islam would be most prudent option islamic primary sources quran
