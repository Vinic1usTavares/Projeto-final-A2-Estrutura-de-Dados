record from outset band intended new record to be a double album partly inspired by beatles self titled album alexander phil interview with billy corgan mojo magazine february 2012 corgan said we almost had enough material to make siamese dream a double album with this new album i really liked notion that we would create a wider scope in which to put other kinds of material we were writing di perna alan zero worship guitar world december 1995 corgan felt that band s musical approach was running its course and wanted band to approach album as if it were its last corgan described album at time to music press as wall for generation x a comparison with pink floyd s 1979 album one of highest selling and best known concept albums of all time derogatis jim milk it collected musings on alternative music explosion of 90 s cambridge da capo 2003 p 46 80 band decided to forgo working with butch vig who had produced group s previous albums and selected flood and alan moulder as co producers corgan explained to be completely honest i think it was a situation where we d become so close to butch that it started to work to our disadvantage i just felt we had to force situation sonically and take ourselves out of normal pumpkin recording mode i didn t want to repeat past pumpkin work flood immediately pushed band to change its recording practices corgan later said flood felt like band he would see live wasn t really captured on record in april 1995 band began recording in a rehearsal space instead of entering studio straight away at these sessions band recorded rough rhythm tracks with flood originally designed to create a rough draft for record rehearsal space sessions ended up yielding much of new album s rhythm section parts flood also insisted band set aside time each day devoted to jamming or songwriting practices band had never engaged in before during recording sessions corgan said working like that kept whole process very interesting kept it from becoming a grind corgan sought to eliminate tension that permeated siamese dream recording sessions corgan said regarding problems with recording siamese dream t o me biggest offender was insidious amounts of time that everyone spends waiting for guitar parts to be overdubbed there were literally weeks where no one had anything to do but sit and wait band decided to counter idleness by using two recording rooms at same time this tactic allowed corgan to work on vocals and song arrangements in one room while recording was done in other during these sessions flood and corgan would work in one room as moulder guitarist james iha and bassist d arcy wretzky worked in a second thomas richard signal to noise sonic diary of smashing pumpkins eq magazine october 2008 iha and wretzky had a much greater role in recording of album unlike prior albums where corgan was rumored to have recorded all bass and guitar parts himself james iha commented about recording sessions big change is that billy is not being big i do this i do that it s much better band arranged a lot of songs for this record and song writing process was organic circumstances of last record and way that we worked was really bad kelly christina smashing pumpkins multi platinum band is over infighting but can harmony last us december 1995 following rehearsal space sessions band recorded overdubs at chicago recording company pro tools was used for recording guitar overdubs as well as for post production electronic looping and sampling no more guitars magazine 1995 wretzky also recorded numerous backup vocal parts but all were cut except one recorded for beautiful evans liz last word kerrang may june 1996 when recording sessions concluded band had 57 completed songs which were up for contention to be included on mellon collie album was originally going to have 32 songs but this was cut back to 28 songs corgan billy king b s guitar world january 1997 music songs of mellon collie and infinite sadness are intended to hang together conceptually with two halves of album representing day and night despite this corgan has rejected term concept album to describe it and it was at time described as more loose and vague than band s previous records however billy corgan has also said that album is based on human condition of mortal sorrow corgan aimed album s message at people aged 14 to 24 years hoping to sum up all things i felt as a youth but was never able to voice he summed up by stating i m waving goodbye to me in rear view mirror tying a knot around my youth and putting it under bed musically album has been described as featuring alternative rock grunge alternative metal and art rock its sprawling nature resulted in diverse music styles from song to song contrasting what some critics felt was one dimensional flavor of previous two albums a much wider variety of instrumentation is used such as piano mellon collie and infinite sadness synthesizers and drum loops 1979 a live orchestra tonight tonight and even salt shakers and scissors cupid de locke all guitars on album were tuned down a half step in order to make music a little lower according to corgan on some songs like jellybelly first string was tuned down an additional whole step to c referred to by corgan as grunge tuning there was a greater variety to number of guitar overdubs utilized than on previous albums iha said i n past everything had to be overdubbed and layered guitar overkill that wasn t really train of thought this time although we did that too to forgive consists of only one live guitar take while thru eyes of ruby contains approximately 70 guitar tracks various sections of of vast oceans were recorded at various times with different instruments and recording setups and were digitally composited in pro tools corgan and iha shared soloing duties iha estimated that guitar solo duties were divided half and half on record corgan has said that for solo in fuck you an ode to no one i played until my fingers saw blood you can t play a weak guitar solo in such a propulsive song it s got to be attack style he explains this method by saying i put on headphones and stand one foot away from amp i turn amp up so loud that i literally have to play harder than feedback because if i stop playing even for an instant whole thing explodes all but two songs on album were written by corgan closing track from first disc take me down was written and sung by iha while album s final track farewell and goodnight features lead vocals by all four band members and according to bmi database was written solely by iha despite being credited on album liner notes as being written by both iha and corgan iha wrote additional songs during making of album but they did not make final cut corgan said in a 1995 rolling stone interview t here are some b sides that james did that are really good they just don t fit in context of album and part of me feels bad but over seven years we ve been together least uptight part of band has been music release reception and legacy mellon collie and infinite sadness was released on october 24 1995 night before band played a release party show at riviera theater in chicago and took part in a live fm broadcast across united states following week mellon collie and infinite sadness debuted at number one on billboard 200 an unusual feat for a double disc

reception album received critical acclaim christopher john farley of time called album group s most ambitious and accomplished work yet farley wrote one gets feeling that band charged ahead on gut instincts sheer scope of album 28 songs didn t allow for second guessing or contrivance farley christopher john a journey not a joyride time november 13 1995 time selected mellon collie and infinite sadness as best album of year in its year end best of 1995 list entertainment weekly gave album an a rating reviewer david browne praised group s ambition and wrote mellon collie and infinite sadness is more than just work of a tortured finicky pop obsessive corgan presents himself as one of last true believers someone for whom spewing out this much music results in some sort of high art for ages he doesn t seem concerned with persistent alterna rock questions of selling out and good for him he s aiming for something bigger and all conquering ign gave album a score of 9 5 out of 10 and said as band s magnum opus it single handedly changed face of alternative rock that said it s not just music but a work of art music box gave it all five stars and said indeed for all its melodramatic self indulgence mellon collie and infinite sadness is one of best double albums of new material to be released by anyone in a long time rolling stone gave album three out of five stars reviewer jim derogatis praised album as one of rare epic rock releases whose bulk is justified in grooves derogatis noted that 28 songs on mellon collie and infinite sadness aren t linked by a libretto they re only connected conceptually through broad theme of being part of a day in life of a typical alienated teen writer stated that album s main flaw was corgan s lyrics describing songwriter as wallowing in his own misery and about everyone and everything not meeting his expectations derogatis contended that while mellon collie and infinite sadness may even match wall in its sonic accomplishments corgan s lyrics lacked in comparison mojo reviewer ben edmunds also praised music while criticizing corgan s lyrics edmunds wrote corgan s lyrics appear to be repository for worst aspects of his most treasured influences he writes with a heavy metal aptitude for wordplay and an inflated prog rock conviction of its worth a deadening combination but there s a sliver of distance in his rage mongering now that comments as well as expresses edmunds ben smashing pumpkins mellon collie and infinite sadness mojo december 1995 in his consumer guide village voice critic robert christgau picked 1979 as a choice cut indicating a good song on an album that isn t worth your time or money singles album spawned five singles while corgan considered issuing jellybelly as album s first single he told chart it was passed over in favor of bullet with butterfly wings because bullet s one of those songs where you know it s easy to sing along to and he affects a drawl ya gotta sell them records meredith amber
