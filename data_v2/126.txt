1948 atlantic hurricane season featured first tropical cyclone before month of june since 1940 season officially began on june 15 1948 and lasted until november 15 1948 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in atlantic basin there were 10 tropical cyclones six storms attained hurricane status and four storms intensified into major hurricanes which are category 3 or higher on modern day saffir simpson hurricane wind scale operationally it was believed that a weak tropical disturbance formed over southeast bahamas in may and moved northwest into georgia coast near savannah this system was later excluded from hurdat seventh tropical cyclone was not operationally considered a tropical cyclone but was later added to hurdat sixth and eighth systems designated as dog and easy by air weather service in real time respectively were most intense tropical cyclones of season peaking as a category 4 hurricane with a minimum barometric pressure of former caused eight deaths and 400 000 1948 usd in damage after bringing strong winds rough seas and heavy rainfall to bermuda and atlantic canada in cuba and florida eighth hurricane left 13 fatalities and at least 14 million in damage ninth hurricane assigned name fox by air weather service brought similar impact to cuba and florida about two weeks later in may first tropical cyclone killed 80 people from flooding in dominican republic collectively storms of this season left around 28 8 million in damage and 112 fatalities season summary atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 15 1948 however tropical cyclogenesis began on april 15 about two months before official start of season there was a total of ten tropical storms six of which strengthened into hurricanes further four of six hurricanes deepened into major hurricanes which are category 3 or higher on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale of nine tropical disturbances detected operationally five struck united states with winds of or greater while other tropical systems affected islands remained over open ocean or affected country with winds below tropical storm intensity three hurricanes made landfall in united states while three other storms with winds of at least largely remained at sea collectively storms of this season left around 28 8 million in damage and 112 fatalities strongest storms of season attained category 4 intensity two of major hurricanes formed in western caribbean sea and affected united states in late september and october a minimal hurricane struck southern louisiana on september 4 causing tides of and winds of in new orleans a minimal tropical storm made landfall near destin in july an intense hurricane attained category 4 strength and produced extensive damage and 100 mph 160 km wind gusts on bermuda in mid september a category 4 hurricane struck florida keys and everglades in september resulting in 12 million of damages in state after passage of one week another hurricane affected region as a category 2 storm after crossing cuba with winds of 125 mph 200 km h only three direct fatalities occurred in united states largely because of improved evacuations and adherence to warnings and advisories season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 95 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph 63 km h which is tropical storm strength systems tropical storm one a broad area of low pressure in central caribbean sea developed into a tropical depression early on may 22 circulation moved northward and it made landfall in southwest haiti around 1200 utc with winds of over next day system crossed hispaniola and turks and caicos islands with winds unchanged turning to northeast it strengthened into a tropical storm at 1200 utc on may 24 while over southwest atlantic shortly afterward tropical cyclone turned to north on may 25 storm s forward motion slowed to a crawl within a few hours storm attained its estimated peak intensity of as reported by reconnaissance aircraft though no ships reported gale force winds next day cyclone started to weaken and on may 27 system began to accelerate northward system diminished to a tropical depression on may 29 shortly prior to dissipation tropical system brought heavy precipitation to hispaniola and widespread flooding took place across region in dominican republic capital city of santo domingo then known as ciudad trujillo was impacted significantly where of rain fell in 24 hours more than 20 bridges were swept away isolating city from rest of country several people went missing in floodwaters and it is estimated that 80 people died storm ranks as deadliest atlantic tropical cyclone to form in off season tropical storm two after nearly two months of inactivity an area of disturbed weather developed in northern gulf of mexico area organized into a tropical depression over north central gulf of mexico on july 7 depression strengthened slightly and became a weak tropical storm early on july 9 when it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph 65 km h several hours later system made landfall east of pensacola florida but quickly weakened to a depression as it moved inland remnants moved north through southeastern alabama on july 10 and circulation dissipated over southern tennessee on july 11 system produced minimal effects along florida panhandle winds of were measured at pensacola during passage of a thunderstorm and tropical cyclone caused heavy precipitation over northern florida southern alabama and southern georgia overall damage was minimal hurricane three able a strong tropical storm named able by air weather service in real time was first identified on august 26 about 300 mi 485 km northeast of saint john as ship reports indicated winds of force 9 however it is likely that able formed much farther east possibly as a cape verde type hurricane tropical cyclone quickly intensified to a hurricane and it continued to steadily progress northwest storm strengthened into a category 2 hurricane on august 27 and while turning west northwestward it continued to intensify cyclone peaked as a 120 mph 195 km h category 3 hurricane by 1800 utc on august 28 which was measured by a reconnaissance aircraft flight its forward motion slowed on august 29 and it began to weaken as it turned to north on august 30 tropical system weakened to a minimal hurricane and it accelerated to northeast on august 31 storm soon became extratropical before striking southern newfoundland on september 2 over next several days system slowly weakened and its remnants turned east before dissipating south of southern iceland on september 5 in anticipation of storm u s weather bureau posted hurricane warnings from wilmington to cape hatteras on august 30 as tropical cyclone began to turn to north center was expected to pass over or near cape hatteras high tides occurred along north carolina coastline which prompted evacuations and precautions in area remnants of storm brought strong winds to atlantic canada in nova scotia storm severely disrupted electricity and communications between halifax and sydney at latter many trees were uprooted with several falling on streets and cars in newfoundland a wind gust as strong as was observed community of port au port was hard hit among structures damaged included a store which lost its roof and a church which storm completely destroyed port au port alone suffered about 200 000 1948 cad in damage along shore a number of pleasure crafts were wrecked some other structures trees and boats were impacted or destroyed throughout province communities along south coast of newfoundland collectively experienced about 400 000 1948 cad in damage overall storm left over 989 000 1948 cad in damage in canada tropical storm four baker on august 30 a tropical storm named baker by air weather service in real time was first detected about 275 mi 445 km east of barbados by a ship that reported high easterly seas and winds of force 10 upon being initially observed baker was already at its peak maximum sustained winds of 60 mph 95 km h small system moved rapidly westward and slowly weakened to a marginal tropical cyclone on august 31 on morning of september 1 baker passed between saint lucia and martinique when a reconnaissance aircraft mission reported a minimum pressure of 1007 mbar 29 73 inhg subsequent missions failed to detect a center of circulation and tropical cyclone quickly degenerated to a tropical depression baker dissipated over eastern caribbean sea on september 1 storm brought heavy rainfall to several eastern caribbean islands though most of it was beneficial on puerto rico water supplies and crops were replenished hurricane five charlie an area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical storm named charlie by air weather service in real time on september 1 over western gulf of mexico on morning of september 2 poorly defined center moved northeast and charlie gradually intensified it attained hurricane intensity on september 3 and then slowly accelerated toward upper gulf coast it rapidly reached its peak intensity of and it crossed coastline west of golden meadow louisiana on september 4 center moved inland over orleans parish and weakening tropical cyclone diminished to a strong tropical storm prior to moving over southern mississippi charlie continued to weaken and fell to tropical depression intensity on september 5 remnants turned to north and circulation dissipated over northwestern indiana on september 6 on september 4 u s weather bureau advised residents that storm was expected to strike land between morgan city and grand isle around midnight as its forward motion had increased to weather service also noted that abnormally high tides were expected from mississippi river to pensacola as center was predicted to pass east of new orleans and move to west of biloxi shortly before dawn about 1 000 people left their homes in terrebonne parish and took shelter in a courthouse and school buildings in houma as winds increased city officials in new orleans ordered 2 000 people to evacuate from a wartime housing project into an auditorium for shelter offshore oil drilling platforms and equipment were destroyed by high seas near grand isle island itself was cut off from mainland after inundated roadways throughout southeastern louisiana beans were destroyed north of lake pontchartrain while sugar cane and corn were flattened especially in lafourche jefferson st charles and terrebonne parishes pecan and tung nut crops also suffered damage in southeastern mississippi hurricane produced gusts of at airport and tides ranged from along coast from mississippi to florida panhandle maximum tide reached in new orleans and winds caused damage to small boats trees and power and communication lines remnants of hurricane brought rainfall far inland including of precipitation observed in detroit michigan total damage in united states reached 900 000 hurricane six dog a tropical wave moved off west coast of africa on september 3 and was designated as tropical storm dog by air weather service in real time on following day cyclone tracked a general westward path for much of its initial stages as it gradually intensified reaching tropical storm intensity shortly after development and then hurricane intensity a day later after reaching a longitude roughly equal to that of lesser antilles dog began to curve northward on a parabolic track bringing it near bermuda at peak intensity as a category 4 hurricane on september 13 hurricane then began to accelerate northeastward and weaken waning dog grazed cape race newfoundland before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on september 15 these remnants persisted for an additional day although storm never making landfall dog disrupted numerous shipping lanes and inflicted damage on bermuda and newfoundland in former hurricane brought winds in excess of 100 mph 160 km h downing power lines and trees property damage also resulted from strong winds totaling about 400 000 after passing west of bermuda tropical cyclone tracked across numerous shipping lanes two ships leicester and gaspar encountered hurricane and became stricken in open waters though most people were rescued from both ships six people perished on former while one died on latter beginning on september 15 hurricane tracked east of newfoundland producing heavy rainfall on land precipitation flooded roads and caused streams to overflow inundating additional areas on island one person were killed overall hurricane caused eight fatalities tropical storm seven operationally this storm was not considered a tropical cyclone late on september 7 an extratropical system transitioned into a tropical storm about 355 mi 570 km northeast of bermuda storm curved northwestward and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph 100 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of after turning northward and then northeastward storm began losing tropical characteristics and reverted to an extratropical cyclone on september 10 while situated about 215 mi 345 km southwest of sable island nova scotia remnants continued northeastward until dissipating just offshore newfoundland hurricane eight easy florida hurricane of 1948 eighth storm designated as tropical storm easy by air weather service in real time developed from a tropical wave over caribbean sea on september 18 early next day easy strengthened into a hurricane while moving westward thereafter it curved northwestward and continued to deepen by september 20 system turned northward and later that day made landfall along zapata peninsula of cuba as a category 3 hurricane on modern day saffir simpson hurricane wind scale another landfall occurred in cuba early next day to south of guines severe destruction was reported on island with winds up to 90 mph 140 km h observed in havana over 700 buildings were destroyed ten deaths occurred and damage totaled at least 2 million while other sources estimate several million dollars after emerging into straits of florida on september 21 easy resumed intensification before striking near boca chica key florida with winds of 120 mph 195 km h by early on september 22 system peaked as a category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 130 mph 215 km h shortly thereafter another landfall occurred near chokoloskee at same intensity severe damage was reported in state due to strong winds storm was considered worst in key west since 1919 throughout state 1 200 homes were severely damaged or destroyed while 40 businesses were demolished and 237 suffered impact there were three deaths and about 12 million in damage over half of which was inflicted on crops storm rapidly weakened while crossing state and emerged into atlantic ocean as only a category 1 hurricane later on september 22 slight fluctuations in intensity occurred before hurricane became extratropical early on september 24 while located northwest of bermuda remnants accelerated to east northeastward and continued to weaken before dissipating hundreds of miles east of newfoundland on september 26 late september tropical depression on september 25 a westward moving tropical wave near lesser antilles began appearing in historical weather map a reconnaissance aircraft flight into system when it was over central caribbean sea indicated wind gusts up to but no circulation during a separate fight on september 29 it was noted that a complete search of area shows well organized circle of storm but open to west and northwest although no circulation was detected westerly winds were reported making it likely that a tropical depression developed that day over western caribbean subsequently depression moved over northern yucatan peninsula which may have disrupted poorly defined circulation by october 1 system entered gulf of mexico where it began degenerating into an open trough on october 3 cold air and development of hurricane fox in western caribbean prevented re generation remnants continued northeastward into north florida and deepened while producing strong gales along coasts of north carolina and virginia it is possible that remnants lasted until october 8 when it was absorbed by fox hurricane nine fox miami hurricane of 1948 on october 3 a tropical depression developed over northwestern caribbean sea storm intensified into a tropical storm designated as tropical storm fox by air weather service in real time early on october 4 several hours later storm became a hurricane fox then significantly deepened peaking as a category 3 intensity with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph 205 km h early on october 5 around that time fox made landfall in eastern pinar del rio province of cuba fox crossed island and emerged into straits of florida a few hours later late on october 5 hurricane made landfall on bahia honda key florida with winds of 105 mph 165 km h and near flamingo about two hours later fox emerged into atlantic ocean near fort lauderdale early on october 6 storm moved northeastward and later curved to east northeast late on october 7 fox made landfall on bermuda with winds of 105 mph 165 km h fox weakened over next several days and later executed a large cyclonic loop by october 16 it became extratropical while well east southeast of newfoundland in cuba homes and cattle were swept away by flash flooding eleven deaths and about 300 injuries were attributed to tropical cyclone damage in country reached about 6 million storm brought strong winds to florida with a sustained wind speed of at naval air station key west heavy rainfall exceeding in miami and three tornadoes also contributed to damage in south florida throughout state 674 homes were severely damaged or destroyed while 45 other buildings were demolished overall damage in florida reached 5 5 million and there were no deaths but 36 injuries none of which were serious in bermuda buildings were unroofed and sides of some structures were knocked down electrical light wires and telephone lines were toppled across island damage totaled over 1 million hurricane ten george a tropical storm developed about midway between bermuda and puerto rico on november 8 designated as george by air weather service in real time storm moved quickly west northwestward early on november 10 george is believed to have reached hurricane intensity after reconnaissance aircraft flights recorded a small area of winds ranging from peaking as a category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph 120 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of george then curved north northwestward later that day hurricane began to become disorganized and weakened to a tropical storm early on november 11 george degenerated into an area of disturbed weather while located about 195 mi 315 km east of virginia beach virginia as hurricane threatened coast of north carolina on november 10 hurricane warnings were issued between cape lookout and cape hatteras other systems in addition to ten systems that became a tropical storm and other tropical depression there were a few tropical cyclones that failed to strengthen beyond tropical depression intensity a weak broad low pressure area formerly associated with a trough developed into a tropical depression well northeast of lesser antilles on april 15 a barometric pressure of was observed that day depression moved northward and then became stationary by april 17 before degenerating into a trough on next day next tropical depression developed from a northward moving tropical wave over eastern gulf of mexico on july 31 although depression continued northward it cannot be determined if system made landfall in florida panhandle before dissipating on august 2 tampa recorded a 5 minute sustained wind speed of on july 31 by august 13 another tropical depression formed from area of disturbed weather well offshore mid atlantic system moved rapidly northeastward and became extratropical early on august 14 it may have been a tropical storm based on barometric pressure of observed by a ship shortly after extratropical transition on september 16 a trough of low pressure developed into a tropical depression over western gulf of mexico unfavorable conditions caused depression to dissipated by following day season effects see also list of tropical cyclones list of atlantic hurricane
