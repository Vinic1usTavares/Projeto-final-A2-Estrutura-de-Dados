james dean an invented life before it was finalized as james dean when horovitz wrote script he explored psychological insight of dean by showcasing abandonment of his father which became fulcrum of storyline horovitz recalled why would a father ship his wife s body back on a train with an 8 year old son never go to funeral and never pick son up again never bring son back out to him screenwriter

james franco was cast into lead role and principal photography for james dean started in june 2000 filming took place around los angeles area and at sony pictures studios in culver city casting it was interesting because everyone i spoke to had a different perspective on james dean i think it is because he compartmentalized his friends so distinctly that everyone saw a different side of him i often found that if people did not have that much personal information about james dean experiences they had with him were mystical james franco on his research for james dean rydell and other filmmakers started a casting call in late march 2000 to find most suitable actor for lead role call encompassed new york los angeles toronto vancouver atlanta chicago and midwestern united states casting director nancy foy commented that search included everyone from highly trained experienced actors in their early and mid 20s to people who had no training and had sent in self made tapes five hundred actors auditioned and james franco was ultimately cast as james dean in may 2000 franco acknowledged he was cautious of taking role over fear of typecasting franco did extensive research for his role he went from being a non smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day but has since quit habit he learned how to ride a motorcycle play guitar as well as conga and bongo drums actor also carefully studied dean s mannerisms by watching his three films east of eden rebel without a cause and giant franco also read numerous biographies on dean s life actor also took advice from some of dean s closest friends including martin landau dennis hopper liz sheridan dean s former girlfriend and leonard rosenman martin was most informative person that i spoke to he helped me tremendously with james s physical mannerisms franco reflected i isolated myself a lot during filming i did this because i think he had a pervasive loneliness throughout his life and i wanted to feel what that felt like not talking to my family or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me release james dean premiered at 27th deauville american film festival in july 2001 press conferences were held with screening and
