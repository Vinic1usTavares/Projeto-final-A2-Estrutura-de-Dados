critical appraisal paul kincaid described white as a second rank writer who occasionally produced first rank works and attracted a devoted but not wide audience kincaid noted that his plots were often formulaic and his writing employed a predictable set of techniques and mannerisms along with a studied quietness review of dave langford s books complete critical assembly collected white dwarf and gm and columns and up through an empty house of stars reviews and essays 1980 2002 on other hand john clute wrote that in depiction of goodness may lie real genius of james white mike resnick described

that setting of television series star trek deep space nine is reminiscent of sector general and mark r leeper noted similarities between sector general s setting and that of television s babylon 5 chris aylott wrote that white s plot construction and writing including occasionally clumsy exposition are typical of golden age of science fiction in 1930s 40s and 50s algis budrys concluded his review of watch below with this is very nice writing when considered simply as prose and as an attempt to involve reader s emotions however when reviewing all judgment fled he wrote i suspect that he generates so much tension within himself while writing a book that he literally cannot bear to come to grips with crucial scenes white said of his approach to producing stories of course plot idea must come first but characters soon take over and compared it to using a compass rather than a map he explained that he was drawn to medical themes by two factors they offered opportunities for dramatic tension without war and he had wanted to become a doctor but had to go to work instead his avoidance of violent themes is as strong in his non medical stories as in sector general series none

award in 1996 in 1998 white received nesfa new england science fiction association edward e smith memorial award skylark award for contributions to science fiction named after a story by one of his
