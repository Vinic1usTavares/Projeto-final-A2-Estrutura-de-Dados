lactifluus volemus formerly known as lactarius volemus is a species of fungus in family russulaceae it is widely distributed in northern hemisphere in temperate regions of europe north america and asia as well as some subtropical and tropical regions of central america and asia a mycorrhizal fungus its fruit bodies grow on ground at base of various species of trees from summer to autumn either individually or in groups it is valued as an edible mushroom and is sold in markets in asia several other lactifluus mushrooms resemble l volemus such as closely related edible species l corrugis but these can be distinguished by differences in distribution visible morphology and microscopic characteristics l volemus produces a white spore print and has roughly spherical spores about 7 8 micrometres in diameter colour of l volemus mushroom varies from apricot to tawny and cap may be up to 11 cm in wide pale golden yellow gills on underside of cap are closely spaced and sometimes forked one of mushroom s most distinctive features is large amount of latex milk that it exudes when gills are damaged leading to common names weeping milk cap and voluminous latex milky it also has a distinctive fishy smell which does not affect taste fruit bodies have been chemically analysed and found to contain several sterols related to ergosterol some of which are unique to this species mushroom also contains a natural rubber that has been chemically characterized phylogenetic analysis suggests that lactifluus volemus represents several species or subspecies rather than a single taxon taxonomy and naming first mention of lactifluus volemus in scientific literature was in carl linnaeus s 1753 species plantarum under name agaricus lactifluus in 1821 swedish mycologist elias magnus fries called it agaricus volemus in his systema mycologicum in this work he proposed a grouping of related species called a tribus or tribe within genus agaricus which he named galorrheus fries later recognised lactarius as a distinct genus in his 1838 epicrisis systematis mycologici citing galorrheus as a synonym although linnaeus had published species before fries fries s name is sanctioned and thus has nomenclatural priority in 1871 paul kummer raised most of fries s tribes to generic rank and so renamed species galorrheus volemus variety l volemus var was identified by charles horton peck in 1879 but is now classified as a separate species l corrugis in 1891 otto kuntze moved species into lactifluus which was afterwards long considered a synonym of lactarius but confirmed as a separate genus through molecular phylogenetics in 2008 and subsequent taxonomical rearrangements within family russulaceae another historical synonym is lactarius lactifluus used by lucien quelet in 1886 a renaming based on linnaeus s agaricus lactifluus lactarius reported by hua an wen and jian zhe ying to be a new species from china in 2005 was synonymised two years later with l volemus specific epithet volemus is derived from latin meaning hollow of hand suggestive of fries s reference to large amount of latex flowing enough to fill hand common names for l volemus include weeping milk cap tawny milkcap orange brown milky voluminous latex milky lactarius orange fishy milkcap and apricot milk cap in west virginian mountains of united states mushroom is called a leatherback or a bradley latter name may originate from its german name bessette et al 2009 p 5 phylogeny lactifluus volemus was type species of section dulces in subgenus lactarius and is currently classified in lactifluus section lactifluus group around this l volemus includes species with a dry cap abundant latex and a white or pale cream spore print because closely related l corrugis has overlapping morphological characters including similar colouration in cap and stem it has been difficult to reliably distinguish between two species difficulty in discerning two is exacerbated by fact that both species have several colour forms japanese specimens of l volemus may have a red cap a yellow cap with a long stem or a velvet like surface texture caps of l corrugis may be either red commonly rust coloured in 2005 japanese researchers clarified relationships between these two species and others in section dulces using molecular phylogenetics and by comparing differences in fatty acid composition morphology and taste colour variants group phylogenetically into different subclades suggesting that they might better be considered as different species subspecies or varieties a 2010 molecular study of l volemus of northern thailand found that 79 tested specimens could be divided into 18 distinct phylogenetic species six of these were described as new species lactifluus l l l l and l description macromorphology thumb right profuse whitish latex may become brownish upon exposure to air and stains tissues brown fruit body of lactifluus volemus has a fleshy and firm cap with a velvety or smooth surface and a shape that changes with maturity it starts off convex with edges curved inwards then later grows flat with a depression in middle with a typical diameter of 5 to 11 cm 2 in its colour ranges from apricot to tawny cap colouration however is somewhat variable as has been noted in asian european and north american specimens stem whose height varies between 4 and 12 cm and 5 in and which is typically between thick has a slightly lighter colouration than cap it is firm with a velvety or smooth surface that sometimes has depressions running longitudinally up and down its length gills are adnate to slightly decurrent brittle narrow quite closely spaced and sometimes forked normally a pale golden yellow colour gills turn brown when bruised interspersed between gills are lamellulae short gills that do not extend to stem flesh is whitish and firm mushroom smells somewhat fishy one source suggests odour is like a dead shad which anglers will tell you is probably most malodorous freshwater fish odour is concentrated when fruit bodies are dried one of mushroom s most distinctive features is abundant latex so plentiful that a small nick on gills will cause it to weep milky substance latex tends to impart brown stains on whatever it contacts 250px thumb left spores are spherical hyaline and reticulate spore print is whitish spores are roughly spherical translucent hyaline and typically measure 7 5 10 0 by 7 5 9 0 um spore surface is reticulate covered with ridges that form a complete network ridges are up to 0 8 um high and have conspicuous projections up to 1 2 um high spore bearing cells of hymenium basidia are club shaped hyaline four spored and have dimensions of 40 62 by 7 2 10 4 um interspersed among basidia are sterile cells called cystidia pleurocystidia cystidia on side of a gill are roughly spindle to club shaped and measure 48 145 by 5 13 um cheilocystidia cystidia on edge of a gill may be spindle club or awl shaped or intermediate in between these forms and measure 27 60 by 5 7 um additionally there are cystidia present on both surface of cap and stem if a drop of ferric sulphate used as a chemical test in mushroom identification is applied to mushroom flesh it will immediately stain dark bluish green bessette et al 2009 pp 264 66 varieties variety lactifluus volemus var flavus was described by alexander h smith and lexemuel ray hesler in their 1979 monograph of north american lactarius species this rare variety found in southeastern united states ranging from south carolina to florida and extending west to texas has a cap that stays yellow throughout its development it also has slightly smaller spores than regular variety 6 5 9 0 by 6 8 um some authors have considered rarely collected l volemus var found in central and southern europe to be a distinct variety distinguished from common variety by a darker reddish brown cap and a swollen stem this assessment is not universally accepted possibly because it falls within range of morphological variation shown by main variety l volemus var asiaticus was named in 2004 based on vietnamese specimens associating with khasi pine pinus it has small dull brown velvety fruit bodies in general little taxonomical significance has been ascribed to several varieties of l volemus that have been proposed similar species lactifluus volemus is closely related to l corrugis and generally similar in appearance l corrugis usually has more surface wrinkles darker gills weaker or absent scent and less orange colouration however intermediate colour forms can be found two can be distinguished more definitively by microscopic characteristics l corrugis has larger spores typically 10 4 12 8 by 9 6 11 8 um with a coarser surface reticulum and larger pleurocystidia species lactifluus austrovolemus is closely related but has more crowded gills while l lamprocystidiatus can only be reliably distinguished from l volemus by microscopic characteristics reticulations on its spores are taller and more acute and meshes formed by intersections of reticulations are smaller both l austrovolemus and l lamprocystidiatus are known only from papua new guinea lactifluus also resembles l volemus but differs in having widely spaced gills and spores that lack surface reticulations some species of genus lactarius are also similar tropical african lactarius has a superficial resemblance to l volemus but former species in addition to its african distribution can be identified by its cinnamon brown spore print unique in russulaceae lactarius is also similar to l volemus but lacks fishy odour has a dull yellow orange to bright golden orange cap narrow gills and a white latex that does not change colour edibility and other uses despite unappealing fishy scent that develops after mushroom is picked lactifluus volemus is edible and recommended for culinary usage though typical of milk caps it has a slightly granular texture that some may find odor disappears during cooking latex only has a mild taste species is considered good for novice mushroom hunters to eat and is best prepared by slow cooking to prevent it from becoming too hard specimens that have been rehydrated after having been dried will require longer cooking times to eliminate grainy texture mushroom has also been suggested for use in casseroles and thick sauces pan frying is not a recommended cooking technique due to large amounts of latex it exudes l volemus is one of several species of milk caps that are sold in rural markets in yunnan province china and it is among most popular wild edible mushroom species collected for consumption and sale in nepal in their 2009 book on milk caps of north america bessette and colleagues consider mushroom best known and most popular edible milk mushroom in eastern united states a turkish study of nutritional composition of fruit bodies concluded that l volemus is a good source of protein and carbohydrates two elderly people developed a transient pancreatitis after consuming l volemus in central anatolia in turkey both had eaten mushroom which they knew as many times before condition resolved spontaneously bioactive compounds thumb 160px left volemitol fruit bodies contains a unique sterol molecule called a derivative of common fungal sterol ergosterol that may have application in fungal a 2001 study identified a further nine sterols three of which were previously unknown to science according to authors these types of highly oxygenated compounds similar to sterols found in marine soft coral and sponges are rare in fungi mushroom also contains volemitol d d a seven carbon sugar alcohol first isolated from species by french scientist emile in 1889 volemitol occurs as a free sugar in many plant and brown algal species due to their natural polyisoprene content 1 1 7 7 by dry weight of fruit bodies l volemus fruit bodies can also be used to produce rubber chemical structure of rubber from mushroom consists of a high molecular mass homologue of arranged as a group two trans units a long sequence of cis between 260 300 units terminated by a hydroxyl or fatty acid ester biosynthetically creation of polyisoprene begins with compound trans trans pyrophosphate and is thought to terminate by esterification of polyisoprenyl pyrophosphate enzyme diphosphate delta has been identified as required for initiation of rubber synthesis in l volemus and several other milk cap species ecology distribution and habitat thumb 250px right specimens in mixed forest found in bovec basin east julian alps slovenia like all milk caps bessette et al 2009 p 4 l volemus forms ectomycorrhizae mutually beneficial symbiotic associations with various tree species in this association fungal hyphae grow around root of plant and between its cortical cells but do not actually penetrate them hyphae extend outward into soil increasing surface area for absorption to help plant absorb nutrients from soil it is found growing at base of both coniferous and broad leaved trees although it is more common in deciduous woods it may also sometimes be found in peat moss beds fruit bodies which appear between summer and autumn are common they can be found growing solitarily or in groups and are more abundant in weather that is warm and humid fruit bodies can be inhabited by species of flies such as marginata or as well as several species of fungi dwelling mites flies are hosts for mites in a symbiotic association known as phoresis whereby mites are mechanically carried by its host mites are small and unable to migrate relatively long distances between mushrooms without assistance insect hosts in comparison are large and can transfer mites between their preferred feeding habitats lactifluus volemus is found in warm temperate regions and as well as some subtropical and tropical regions of northern hemisphere fungus is widely distributed throughout europe although it is in decline in some countries and has become rare enough in netherlands and flanders to be considered locally extinct in americas northern limit of its distribution reaches southern canada east of great plains and species extends south to east coast of united states and mexico and beyond into central america guatemala it is also known from asia including china qinling mountains guizhou province and yunnan province japan india korea nepal and vietnam collections have also been made from middle east including iran and turkey see also list of lactifluus species
