newspaper aurora in 1798 editor continually published torres views on spanish american independence in paper whose contents would be copied by others torres translated spanish pamphlets for duane and sometimes translated duane s editorials to spanish in spanish america purpose of this literature was to praise united states as an example of independent representative government to be emulated in united states it was to increase support for independence movements initially torres was quite wealthy and received remittances from his wife which helped him make important social connections however he had his money invested in risky merchant ventures on one occasion he lost 40 000 on another 70 000 thus he was forced to live more modestly in later years three years after torres arrival a spaniard in philadelphia wrote pamphlet released in english as observations on commerce of spain with her colonies in time of war author probably torres criticizes spanish colonialism in particular spain monopolized trade with colonies to their detriment during wartime mother country could not supply colonies with essential goods and in peacetime prices were too high author s solution is to implement a system of free trade in americas pamphlet was reprinted in london by william tatham torres residence increased attraction of philadelphia for spanish american revolutionaries torres probably met francisco de miranda also exiled after a failed conspiracy in 1805 shortly before miranda s failed expedition to captaincy general of venezuela and he met with simon bolivar in 1806 spanish minister to united states carlos martinez de irujo reported torres activity to his superiors coordinating revolutionaries during instability caused by napoleon bonaparte s conquest of spain peninsular war people of colonies followed model of peninsular spanish provinces by organizing juntas to govern in absence of central rule advocates of independence who called themselves patriots argued that sovereignty reverted to people when there was no monarch they clashed with royalists who supported authority of crown starting in 1810 patriot juntas successively declared independence and torres was their natural point of contact in united states brokered weapons shipments although president james madison s administration officially recognized no governments on either side patriot agents were permitted to seek weapons in u s and american ports became bases for privateering torres acted as an intermediary between newly arrived agents and influential americans such as introducing simon s brother to wealthy banker stephen girard juan vicente successfully purchased weapons for venezuela but was lost at sea on his return journey in 1811 together with de orea from venezuela and diego de and juan pedro de aguirre from buenos aires torres brokered a plan to purchase 20 000 muskets and bayonets from u s government girard agreed to finance plan on joint credit of buenos aires and venezuela but secretary of state james monroe blocked it by refusing to reply and aguirre managed to ship only 1 000 muskets to buenos aires but by end of 1811 torres had helped orea supply venezuela with about 24 000 weapons new purchasers continued to arrive and supplies were an important contribution while revolutionaries were suffering many defeats new spanish minister luis de onis covertly attempted to disrupt weapons shipments he became aware of plan to purchase from u s arsenal due to being informed by a postman onis reported on these subversive activities and his agents harassed suspected revolutionaries like torres francisco sarmiento and miguel cabral de norona two associates of onis attempted to assassinate torres in 1814 apparently on minister s orders due to his aid for revolution torres estate in royalist controlled new granada was confiscated after his wife and daughter died public writing running out of money during this period torres sustained himself in part by teaching with louis hargous he wrote an adaptation for both english and spanish teaching of nicolas gouin s nature displayed in her mode of teaching language to man lengthy book s title page styles torres and hargous as professors of general grammar in introduction they argue importance to americans of studying spanish literature influential revised editions by mariano velazquez de la cadena were published in new york 1825 and london 1826 soon after nature displayed followed 1812 pamphlet a republican s manual for use of a free people which torres probably wrote structured as a dialog anonymous pamphlet offers a defense of u s system of government based on philosophy of jean jacques rousseau and argues it should be a model for spanish america contents suggest author is a conservative partisan of jeffersonian democracy writes torres authorship is possible writes he probably wrote it and infers torres jeffersonianism besides duane s aurora torres sent news and opinion to irvine s baltimore whig and new york columbian jonathan elliot s city of washington gazette and hezekiah niles baltimore weekly register he acquainted himself with notables such as congressman henry clay lawyer henry marie brackenridge baltimore postmaster john stuart skinner judge theodorick bland and patent office head william thornton especially support of clay who became a champion of spanish american independence in congress permitted him to lobby many influential officials economic proposals thumb alt robert patterson director of u s mint pictured in 1908 endorsed torres book torres lobbying included domestic affairs in near end of war of 1812 that had preoccupied american public he wrote two letters to president madison describing a proposal for fiscal and financial reform torres to madison 1815 library of congress manuscript division james madison papers torres to madison 1815 james madison papers this included an equal and direct tax on all property which torres considered more just ultimately he calculated a 1million budget surplus under his scheme and suggested gradual elimination of national debt in his december5 message to congress madison did propose two ideas that torres had favored establishment of a second bank of united states and utilizing it to create a uniform national currency same year torres authored an exposition of commerce of spanish america with some observations upon its importance to united states refers to this book as two separate works this work published in 1816 was first inter american handbook torres plays on anglo american rivalry by arguing for importance of establishing american over british commercial interests in this critical region just as revolutionary agents in britain suggested opposite applying political economy he observes that a country with a negative balance of trade like united states needs a source of gold and silver specie like south america to stabilize its currency and economy political commentary is interwoven with practical advice to merchants followed by conversion tables between currencies and units of measure he momentarily returned to economics in through clay torres suggested to congress that he had discovered a new way to make revenue collection and spending more efficient which he would reveal in detail if he was promised a share of government s savings preliminary proposal was referred to house committee on ways and means which declined to examine it for being too complex philadelphia junta by 1816 spanish american propagandists had solidified american public opinion in favor of patriots however propaganda victories did not translate into practical success royalists reconquered new granada and venezuela by may 1816 pedro jose gual who had come to united states to represent those governments instead worked with torres on a plan to liberate new spain they were joined by a number of other agents to form a junta of their own which included orea mariano montilla jose rafael juan german roscio from venezuela miguel santamaria from mexico as well as from buenos aires this philadelphia junta surrounding torres conspired in mid 1816 to invade a new spanish port using ships commanded by french privateer louis aury this plan failed because aury s fleet was reduced to seven ships making it unable to capture any major port but plotters were able to organize a force under recently arrived general francisco xavier mina despite obstructions of jose alvarez de toledo an acquaintance of torres who was actually spying for onis operation was funded by a group of merchants from baltimore where torres traveled to oversee it exiled priest servando teresa de mier had traveled to u s with mina and became a good friend of torres he brought to mexico with him two copies of torres exposition and one of expedition sailed september 1816 but in just over a year mina was captured and shot thumb alt spanish language poster prominently signed by aury proclamation by aury as commander in chief of floridas another of agents to join junta was lino de clemente who in 1816 came to united states as venezuelan charge d affaires a diplomat of lowest rank torres became his secretary in philadelphia clemente was one of men who signed gregor macgregor s commission to seize amelia island off coast of florida what became a political scandal known as amelia island affair all who had been involved became intolerable to monroe philadelphia junta effectively disbanded because of event which simon bolivar disavowed secretary of state john quincy adams refused any further communication with clemente although torres participated he had discreetly avoided public involvement privately he derided don quixote aguirre and torres to juan german roscio 1819 in in bolivar thus instructed clemente to return home and to transfer his duties as charge d affaires to torres diplomat for colombia thumb alt painting showing patriot forces routing royalists patriot victory at battle of boyaca torres appointment coincided with a turn in wars of independence where before situation had been dire patriot forces under bolivar began a campaign to liberate new granada and achieved a famous victory at battle of boyaca when torres received his diplomatic credentials he was authorized to to do in united states everything possible to put an immediate end to conflict in which patriots of venezuela are now engaged for their independence and liberty venezuela and new granada united on december17 1819 to form republic of colombia a union called gran colombia by historians francisco antonio zea was first appointed colombia s envoy to united states but never went there torres was authorized to take over his duties on 1820 and thus formally empowered to negotiate for republic he would try to secure its independence by three methods by purchasing weapons and other military supplies by obtaining a loan and by obtaining diplomatic recognition of its government weapons purchases with help of samuel douglas forsyth an american citizen sent from venezuela by bolivar torres was instructed to procure thirty thousand muskets on credit this sum was not realistically available from private sources in part due to panic of 1819 torres did make substantial deals especially with philadelphia merchant jacob idler who represented a network of business associates in one such contract signed 1819 idler promised a total of 63 071 50 of supplies including 4 023 muskets and 50 quintals of gunpowder after delivery colombia was obliged to make payment in gold silver or tobacco produce of barinas province more agreements on this model followed as merchants gained confidence with news of successive patriot victories from to negotiated contracts worth 108 842 80 and in summer torres made a deal for colombian navy although torres repeatedly wrote to his superiors about great importance of maintaining colombia s credit among american merchants government failed to make payment as agreed in spite of this torres was able to negotiate continued shipments even with merchants who had unpaid claims after independence such claims became a significant problem of u s relations with south america idler s estate would litigate them up to end of century nevertheless torres obtained from idler 11 571 muskets and other supplies such as shoes and uniforms they arrived in venezuela in 1820 1821 aboard wilmot and endymion thumb alt illustration of a monroe cabinet meeting monroe s cabinet was initially divided over proposed sale birth of monroe doctrine by clyde o deland 1912 in february 1820 torres came to washington to purchase twenty thousand muskets from u s government a source that could fill what he could not obtain from private merchants monroe delayed by responding that constitution prevented him from selling weapons without consent of congress but his cabinet considered a missive from torres this missive argued for sale by emphasizing common interests of american republics against european monarchies secretary of war john c calhoun and secretary of navy smith thompson were supportive and torres had estimated house of representatives was in his favor however secretary of state adams emphatically spoke against what he considered a violation of american neutrality causing cabinet to unanimously decline request in a meeting on next day adams explained his feelings to monroe despite this skepticism adams trusted torres to inform him on spanish american affairs perhaps because torres was also strongly supportive of united states torres made six repeat visits to adams through february19 1821 without success attempted borrowing thumb alt black and white photo of building second bank of united states completed 1824 recognizing financial difficulty colombian government was in torres attempted to borrow money in united states on its behalf aided by a letter of introduction from henry clay in fall of 1819 he proposed a 500 000 loan to langdon cheves president of second bank of united states it would be repaid with colombian bullion which bank was severely short of within 18 months when bank stated it had no authority to lend to foreign governments torres restated his proposal as a of bullion he also contacted adams who said government had no objection and left it to bank directors judgment and gained cheves support despite continued negotiation this loan was never finalized let alone bolivar s bolder proposal for bank to take on entirety of venezuela s national debt in exchange for santa ana de mariquita silver mine in new granada colombia had poor credit and torres believed distressed bank was actually unable to make loan to improve colombia s financial reputation torres circulated several public memorials and he continued to seek loans from other sources idler introduced him to philip contteau american agent of dutch merchant firm mees boer and moens on 1820 torres and contteau negotiated a loan of 4million at eight percent interest colombia would maintain a state monopoly on barinas tobacco and would give sole control of tobacco to mees boer and moens until proceeds had repaid loan these terms were sent to colombia and holland for approval torres was instructed to borrow as much as 20million an impossible request he did hope to build on his success by borrowing an additional 1million with participation from u s government he made request to adams during winter of 1820 1821 and obtained support from monroe and secretary of treasury william h crawford however like weapons purchase this proposal failed due to adams commitment to neutrality loan in its original form was approved by colombian government but before dutch lenders could agree to it barinas was recaptured by royalists without source of tobacco on which repayment depended bankers rejected loan thus torres was ultimately unable to borrow any money for colombia historian charles bowman assessed torres as a talented negotiator with an exceptional knowledge of high finance who failed due to circumstances beyond his control influence in pamphleteering thumb alt profile of mier in priestly attire servando teresa de mier in june 1821 mier returned to philadelphia after escaping imprisonment in havana and moved into torres house another spanish american agent vicente rocafuerte was already living there connected through freemasonry torres became a father figure to mier signing his letters he gradually drew mier away from constitutional monarchism and toward republican model of united states in doing so torres tried to provide a political philosophical basis for mier s radicalism pair encouraged colombia to send a diplomat to mexico hoping to counter rising monarchism there when mier published his as well as a new edition of bartolome de las casas torres paid costs torres mier and rocafuerte worked together to publish numerous articles over next few months nature of their cooperation is disputed historian jose de onis mentions that some spanish american critics assert that torres works are generally regarded as having been written by mier and vicente rocafuerte this would be hard to verify but charles bowman gives opposite interpretation it is likely that several of works generally attributed to either mier or rocafuerte were actually from torres pen in particular bowman believes a pamphlet bearing mier s name was actually torres work discussing political organization after revolution author suggests a spanish america divided in two grand departments north and south or septentrional and meridional bowman bases this attribution on a moderation uncommon for mier and use of statistics mier would not have known torres motive for publishing it under mier s name would have been to avoid controversy and thus protect his influence with adams during this period torres also became friends with richard w meade a philadelphia merchant who had in 1820 returned from imprisonment in spain he had a claim against spanish government that adams onis treaty required him to collect from u s government instead meade was a of st mary s church like torres through diplomat mier and meade began working together in a controversy surrounding parish priest william hogan who had been excommunicated torres did not get publicly involved in battle of pamphlets mier left philadelphia for mexico in september 1821 traveling with a colombian passport torres had issued him for more on this controversy see diplomatic recognition thumb alt map covering modern panama ecuador colombia venezuela great extent of colombia former new granada highlighted on same day u s senate voted to ratify adams onis treaty february19 1821 torres met with adams next day he formally requested recognition of colombia as a free and independent nation a sister republic he expected that first united states would take possession of new territory while in meantime colombia gained increasing military control over its own and that recognition would soon follow torres suffered a three month illness in late 1821 but on wrote to adams reporting latest developments in colombia he glorified its achievement of near total military victory extent of its population and territory and its potential for commerce purpose of these boasts was to underscore importance of u s being first to recognize its independence to which torres added warnings about unstable politics of mexico and peru letter received significant publicity because of its extensive information and ambitious statement of colombia s importance president monroe noted success of colombia and other former colonies in his message to congress a signal that recognition was imminent torres wrote letters to adams on and reporting colombia s new constitution a sign republic was stable he hoped to go to washington to state case for recognition in person but was prevented by illness and poverty house of representatives asked administration on to report on state of south america colombia s de facto independence as a republic and conclusion of adams treaty with spain encouraged hesitant administration that time was ripe for recognition during this same period colombian government was starting to see prospect of recognition as hopeless torres health declined intermittently over winter his weakening disposition was attributed to asthma and severe overwork if i could move to a good climate where there were no books paper or pen and where i could speak of politics in a word with my little garden and a horse to carry me about perhaps i could convalesce he wrote to mier but in march monroe reported to house that spanish american governments had a claim to recognition by other powers which ought not to be resisted formerly reluctant adams dismissed a protest by spanish minister joaquin de by calling recognition mere acknowledgment of existing facts by may4 house and senate had sent monroe resolutions in support of recognition and an appropriation to put this into effect this news was greatly celebrated in colombia pedro jose gual now colombian secretary of state and foreign relations wrote to bolivar that torres deserved sole credit for achievement question remained when to send ministers and whom to recognize first at this time torres was only authorized agent in united states for any of patriot governments it was adams suggestion that torres should be received as charge d affaires immediately with united states reciprocating after other diplomats arrived monroe agreed to thus formalize his existing relationship with torres charge was invited on but delayed by his poor health nevertheless he insisted on traveling to washington at 1p m on june19 torres was received at white house by adams and monroe weakened torres told them of importance of recognition to colombia and wept when president said how satisfied he was for torres to be received as its first representative indeed he was first representative from any spanish american government on leaving short meeting torres gave adams a print of colombian constitution before torres departed washington adams visited him on june21 he promised adams to work for equal tariffs on american and european goods in colombia and predicted would be sent to u s as permanent diplomat adams published a satisfied announcement in national intelligencer death in rapidly declining health torres returned to now in west philadelphia where that spring he had purchased a new home duane was with him when he died there at 2p m on july15 1822 at age59 on funeral procession began from meade s house which was joined by commodore daniels of colombian navy and prominent citizens procession went to st mary s where requiem mass was held by father hogan and torres was buried with military honors ships in harbor held their flags at half mast this highly unusual display of honor was not only because torres was well liked but also because he was first foreign diplomat to die in united states an obituary named him franklin of south america new york evening post franklin of south america 1822 historical society of pennsylvania simon gratz collection for analysis of this comparison see duane and meade were executors of his estate not yet aware of his death colombian government appointed him consul general and as he had predicted sent salazar as envoy to succeed him legacy thumb alt olaya and his wife have drawn back flags of colombia and united states to reveal a bronze plaque colombian minister enrique olaya and his wife reveal plaque honoring torres sources for torres life include his voluminous correspondence much of it preserved in colombian archives see his published writing newspaper articles and adams and duane s memoirs his long exile from colombia has tended to obscure him in diplomatic history compared to his contemporaries indeed his grave site was forgotten until rediscovered by historian charles lyon chandler in 1924 r dana skinner called him first that year cited in during u s sesquicentennial exposition in 1926 a plaque was placed at st mary s that honors him as first latin american diplomatic representative in united states of america it was a gift from government of colombia and philadelphian descendants of his friends including duane s great great grandson ceremony was attended by colombian minister enrique olaya who held him up as a model for cooperation of peoples of new world responding to an accusation by spanish writer j e that torres was a traitor to his native spain nicolas garcia in 1941 called him a patriot even originator of monroe doctrine also citing early argument by though that specific claim has been met skeptically a 1946 article suggested torres had not been given a large enough place in colombian diplomatic histories and likewise praised him as a precursor of pan americanism in united states torres is given modest attention in general diplomatic histories e g but his importance is promoted by historians of spanish american agents in judgment of jose de onis torres was most successful of all spanish american agents charles h bowman jr wrote a master s thesis and a series of articles about torres in 1960s and 1970s to celebrate 150th anniversary of u s latin american relations in 1972 permanent council of organization of american states held a session in philadelphia because it was home of manuel torres however emily garcia documented that in 2016 torres was obscure even to archivists of st mary s where plaque still hangs that he is mostly unknown today despite being celebrated in his time and with plaque is for her illustrative that latinos inhabit a paradoxical position in larger u s national imaginary her book chapter analyzes him as embodiment of a culture bridge that existed between philadelphia and spanish america while he helped spread u s ideals to south he also brought spanish influences to north this dual nature is characteristic of torres life and thinking works english translation 1800 notes citations bibliography category 1762 births category 1822 deaths category
