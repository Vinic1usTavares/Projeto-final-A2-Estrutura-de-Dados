right thumb alt two storey brick building manchester grammar school best known of direct grant grammar schools was significantly larger than most a direct grant grammar school was a type of selective secondary school in england and wales that existed between 1945 and 1976 one quarter of places in these schools were directly funded by central government while remainder attracted fees some paid by local education authority and some by private pupils on average schools received just over half of their income from state status was introduced by education act 1944 as a modification of an existing direct grant scheme to privately endowed schools there were 179 direct grant grammar schools which together with over 1 200 grammar schools maintained by local authorities formed most academic tier of tripartite system they varied greatly in size and composition but on average achieved higher academic results than either maintained grammar schools or independent schools state secondary education was reorganised on comprehensive lines in late 1960s and early 1970s direct grant was phased out from 1975 and schools were required to choose between becoming maintained comprehensive schools or fully independent schools forty five schools almost all roman catholic joined state system while a few closed rest including all secular schools became independent and mostly remain as highly

expanded and adjusted to growing demand at start of that century some boarding schools like eton college and winchester college thrived educating sons of aristocracy but most endowed grammar schools were in decline their classical curricula seen as irrelevant to industrial age these schools were reformed under endowed schools act 1869 which also led to many endowments being diverted to creation of girls schools in meantime a range of other schools had appeared after roman catholic relief act 1829 and mid century irish immigration catholic teaching orders from ireland and mainland europe began to establish their own grammar schools new proprietary schools were established initially as joint stock companies converting to charities if they were successful one of largest such companies was girls public day school company later trust set up to provide an affordable academic education for girls which had established 32 schools by 1894 in latter part of century many of less wealthy schools received annual grants from department of science and art and from their county councils grant system was restructured when board of education was created in 1901 to fund early secondary schools and education act 1902 gave counties and county boroughs responsibility for schools designating them as local education authorities leas secondary schools controlled by voluntary bodies could receive a grant from either board of education or their local authority or both in return they were required to meet board s regulations and were subject to same system of inspections as state funded schools under education administrative provisions act 1907 secondary schools in receipt of grant were required to admit a specified proportion of their intake usually 25 free of charge from state elementary schools suitable pupils were selected using a scholarship examination circular 1381 a directive issued by board of education in 1926 required that schools choose a single source of grant they could receive a direct grant from central government or be grant aided by their local authority by 1932 there were 240 secondary schools receiving a direct grant compared with 1138 aided by local authorities although this division was intended purely as an administrative convenience local authorities gradually gained more influence over schools they aided in part because of schools weak financial position during great depression depression and falling birth rate in pre war years had also weakened independent schools and schools receiving direct grant at same time state funded sector had grown to point where universal secondary education seemed achievable and changes in society had made idea more popular proposals were made for a reorganisation of maintained sector including a new accommodation with voluntary schools in response headmasters conference persuaded president of board of education r a butler to establish a commission under lord fleming in july 1942 to consider means

grammar school originally a large secular boys school now mixed education act 1944 aimed to introduce a universal system of secondary education for england and wales under tripartite system there were to be three types of schools with pupils sitting an eleven plus exam to determine which type of school they would be sent to most academic tier would be grammar school and act revised terms of direct grant to operate alongside lea maintained grammar schools many of which were former lea aided schools latter schools unable to cope with costs of reorganisation required by 1944 act had been offered status of voluntary controlled or voluntary aided schools under which state would pay all their running costs and all or most of their capital costs they were thus integrated into state system new direct grant scheme was a modification of proposals in fleming report of 1944 a direct grant grammar school would provide 25 of its places free of charge to children who had spent at least 2 years in maintained primary schools and would reserve at least a further 25 of places to be paid for by lea if required remaining residuary places would attract fees but no child would be admitted unless they had achieved required standard in eleven plus schools would be inspected by her majesty s inspectors of schools would have one third of their governing bodies appointed by lea and would require approval of secretary of state to raise fees or carry out building work scheme was attractive to most of direct grant schools of 231 secondary schools receiving direct grant in 1945 196 applied to join new scheme with rest becoming independent schools in addition 31 grant aided schools applied to join scheme of these 164 schools including four formerly grant aided schools were accepted as direct grant grammar schools list was re opened between 1957 and 1961 when 44 applications were received of which 15 were accepted there were therefore 179 direct grant grammar schools alongside over 1200 maintained grammar schools beside direct grant scheme act also made provision for leas to fund places at independent schools in areas where there was a shortage of appropriate places in maintained schools for example there might be a lack of selective places or of selective places in roman catholic schools in late 1960s 56 independent schools had over 25 of their places funded by

pupil ratios to maintained grammar schools as their fees were regulated to match costs at latter schools proportion of teachers with first and second class degrees was slightly lower than in their maintained counterparts principal difference from maintained schools was greater freedom from lea influence although there was much variation these schools as a group were middle class institutions with many tending to move closer to independent schools in social composition on average three quarters of pupils came from white collar homes including 60 with fathers in management or professions while only 7 were children of semi skilled or unskilled workers on average intake of schools was also more academically selective than either maintained grammar schools or independent schools their

university admission rates that rivalled older public schools which in turn moved to raise their academic standards for admission and to increase their focus of academic achievement with their high

donnison issued its second report in 1970 concluding that grammar schools of traditional kind cannot be combined with a comprehensive system of education we must choose what we want fee paying is not compatible with comprehensive education also quoted in they recommended that schools choose between becoming voluntary aided comprehensives and full independence but conservatives came to power before any action had been taken meanwhile a trickle of schools had begun to leave scheme starting with trinity school of john whitgift which became independent in 1968 but still had half its places funded by lea it was followed in 1970 by oakham school which became co educational in following year and queen victoria high school which merged with cleveland school to form teesside high school a respite
