months before expiry and a completed immigration card on entry into russia visa free period was initially supposed to run for 72 hours between 19 may and 23 may but this was later extended to an eight day period lasting from 17 may to 25 may because of difficulty and expense of acquiring a ticket and visa fans who had not already got tickets were advised against travelling to moscow by uefa s

guaranteed a place in starting line up for paul scholes after midfielder had missed 1999 final through suspension ferguson made one change from team that had beaten wigan athletic to secure league title 10 days earlier with owen hargreaves starting on right side of midfield in a 4 4 2 formation in place of park ji sung who did not even make substitutes bench despite starting both legs of semi final cristiano ronaldo started on left wing where he was pitted against makeshift chelsea right back michael essien this went against prediction of guardians david pleat who thought a duel between ronaldo and ashley cole would be key to final ferguson hoped his substitutes might have a big impact on match just as teddy sheringham and ole gunnar solskjaer did in 1999 when pair came off bench to help manchester united come from behind and beat bayern munich a week before game ryan giggs was philosophical about his chances of being included in starting line up he was eventually named as one of seven allowed substitutes day before match avram grant predicted that game would throw up few tactical surprises due to two teams knowledge of each other from domestic league nevertheless he decided to start with florent malouda on left wing instead of salomon kalou and also chose to deploy michael essien at right back rather than in his preferred midfield position ahead of paulo ferreira who did not even make bench despite starting both legs of semi final and juliano belletti rest of chelsea s team was as expected with key players john terry dislocated elbow and didier drogba knee recovering from injuries suffered against bolton wanderers on last day of league season 10 days earlier to start game ashley cole also started despite hurting his right ankle in training day before game under a heavy challenge from claude makelele his replacement would have likely been wayne bridge but he recovered sufficiently that bridge was not even included in matchday squad as cover summary first half thumb manchester united and chelsea players shake hands ahead of match alt a team in blue shakes hands with a team in red in foreground are people wearing red shirts and gold shorts assisting with presentation of game after a fairly cagey first 21 minutes first major incident of game occurred when paul scholes and claude makelele clashed in mid air resulting in both players being booked and scholes having to leave field for treatment to a bloody nose first goal of game came five minutes later when an interchange of passes between scholes and wes brown after a throw in on right flank gave brown time to pick out a cross for cristiano ronaldo who directed his header past petr cech chelsea almost equalised in 33rd minute when frank lampard s cross was headed back into goal area by didier drogba united s rio ferdinand under pressure from michael ballack was forced to head ball towards his own goal and edwin van der sar pulled off a one handed save to deny chelsea a goal united spent rest of first half pressing for a second goal and had two good opportunities to extend their lead but were denied by a double save from cech wayne rooney delivered a long ball into path of ronaldo and united goalscorer placed his cross on head of diving carlos tevez only for cech to deny him chelsea s failure to clear loose ball gave michael carrick chance to extend his side s lead but cech was again equal to task with another save thumb left manchester united in possession chelsea survived pressure as tevez failed to connect with a low cross from rooney and equalised in final minute of first half goal followed from a long range shot by michael essien which deflected first off nemanja vidic and then ferdinand ball s change in direction caused van der sar to lose his footing leaving lampard who had made a run from deep with a simple finish in celebration lampard looked up and pointed to sky with both hands in memory of his mother pat who had died a month earlier at end of first half manchester united manager sir alex ferguson confronted match referee lubos michel jabbing out an angry finger and spitting out a few choice words second half thumb manchester united go on attack lampard s equaliser at end of first half led to a transformed chelsea in second and they kept united on back foot for long periods nevertheless red devils managed to contain most of chelsea s attacks chelsea had a few opportunities to take lead with essien breaking free of united s defence in 54th minute only for his left footed shot to curl well over goal chelsea s closest opportunity to take lead came in 77th minute when a drogba shot struck post from out ivorian striker came very close to turning joe cole s low cross home for winner four minutes from time but fired wide ryan giggs was then introduced in place of scholes making a record 759th appearance for manchester united extra time game moved into extra time and both teams had chances to score a vital second goal first lampard hit underside of bar with a left footed shot after ball was played in to him with a disguised pass from ballack then giggs stabbed ball left footed towards goal instead of sweeping it with his weaker right foot only to see it headed off line by terry late in second half of extra time ball was put out of play so players could be treated for cramp in returning ball to chelsea carlos tevez put it out for another throw in deep in chelsea s half then signalled to his teammates to put pressure on restart john terry and michael ballack reacted angrily to this and were joined by several of their teammates while manchester united s players rushed in to protect tevez ultimately most of 22 players were involved in fracas amid melee assistant referee martin balko saw drogba slap nemanja vidic and reported incident to referee lubos michel after showing a yellow card to ballack michel showed a red card to drogba for violent conduct making him only second player in history to be sent off in a european cup final after arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann in 2006 penalty shoot out thumb players prepare for penalty shoot out as match went to penalties rio ferdinand won coin toss for manchester united and opted for his side to go first in shoot out which would be taken at end housing manchester united fans tevez stepped up first and sent cech wrong way ballack was next up shooting powerfully past van der sar carrick buried his spot kick as did juliano belletti with his first touch of game having come on for makelele at end of extra time first miss of shoot out came from ronaldo who characteristically stuttered in his run up in an attempt to put cech off but goalkeeper dived to his right to save lampard then put chelsea 3 2 ahead but hargreaves levelled things up with a shot into top corner ashley cole was next up and van der sar got a strong hand to ball but could not keep it out nani then knew he had to score to keep united in it and he did leaving it up to john terry to win cup for chelsea however terry lost his footing when planting his standing foot by ball and even though van der sar was sent wrong way terry s mis hit effort struck outside of right post and went wide anderson scored first penalty in sudden death kalou then sent van der sar wrong way to make it 5 5 giggs was next up and he was also successful van der sar then pulled off crucial save for united he pointed to his left to indicate to nicolas anelka that he thought he would kick to that side as had six players who had kicked before him only to correctly dive to his right to deny anelka whose kick was at a good height to be saved securing european football s top prize for united for third time in their history details gk 1 edwin van der 6 wes brown cb 5 rio ferdinand c cb 15 nemanja vidic lb 3

admitted that terry was not originally due to take one of first five penalties if drogba had not been sent off he would have taken fifth penalty chelsea offered terry counselling as a result of his devastation following miss of his penalty and subsequently loss of final terry was later accused of spitting at manchester united striker carlos tevez but a uefa report into video evidence cleared him of any wrongdoing terry also wrote an open letter published on chelsea s official website apologising for missing penalty and costing chelsea trophy nicolas anelka who took decisive kick revealed he
