tropical storm edouard was first of eight named storms to form in september 2002 most such storms in north atlantic for any month at time fifth tropical storm of 2002 atlantic hurricane season edouard developed into a tropical cyclone on september 1 from an area of convection associated with a cold front east of florida under weak steering currents edouard drifted to north and executed a clockwise loop to west despite moderate to strong levels of wind shear storm reached a peak intensity of 65 mph 100 km h on september 3 but quickly weakened as it tracked westward edouard made landfall on northeastern florida on september 5 and after crossing state it dissipated on september 6 while becoming absorbed into larger circulation of tropical storm fay tropical storm edouard dropped moderate rainfall across florida exceeding 7 inches 175 mm in western portion of state though edouard was a tropical storm at landfall wind speeds along storm s path over land were light rain flooded several roads however there were no casualties and damage was minimal meteorological history an area of cloudiness and developed several hundred miles east southeast of bermuda on august 25 likely in association with a low level disturbance that formed along a cold front for several days it moved southwestward and while located on southwestern end of an upper level trough to north of puerto rico deep convection throughout system increased system tracked westward and initially remained disorganized while surface pressures remained high system turned to a northwest drift and began to slowly organize on august 30 while located a few hundred miles northeast of bahamas a broad low pressure area developed on august 31 though convection remained disorganized as winds of 20 to 25 mph 32 to 40 km h were reported in squalls conditions remained favorable for continued organization and convection increased and persisted across system system developed into tropical depression five on september 1 after developing a low level circulation while located about 140 miles 225 km east of daytona beach florida upon first forming tropical depression was located in an area of light to moderate westerly wind shear with a ridge to north and west of depression system moved to northwest under weak steering currents depression slowly strengthened and intensified into tropical storm edouard on september 2 while located about 120 miles 190 km east of jacksonville florida storm remained disorganized with wind shear displacing most of deep convection from low level circulation upon becoming a tropical storm forecasters initially predicted edouard to gradually turn to northeast and within three days be located a short distance off coast of south carolina with winds of 60 mph 95 km h however forecasters admitted little confidence in prediction and later forecasts predicted storm to execute a loop and track westward into northern florida or southern georgia shortly after tropical cyclogenesis of edouard steering currents became weak resulting in storm to turn sharply eastward late on september 2 deep convection developed over center though center quickly became exposed again environment appeared to become more hostile on september 2 and 3 with increasing shear and dry air center despite conditions storm maintained vigorous convection over eastern portion of circulation and it quickly intensified on september 3 to reach peak winds of 55 mph 90 km h a reconnaissance aircraft flight into system estimated surface winds of up to 60 mph 95 km h and reported flight level winds of 82 mph 132 km h right thumb tropical storm edouard seen by hurricane hunters on september 3 shortly after peaking in intensity tropical storm edouard began to weaken as convection diminished from vertical shear and dry air and later on september 3 center was exposed from steadily decreasing convection development of a weak and narrow mid level ridge turned storm to west southwest towards northeastern florida despite strong levels of wind shear edouard remained a tropical storm while producing sporadic amounts of deep convection and on september 4 banding structure improved early on september 5 edouard made landfall near ormond beach florida as a minimal tropical storm and almost immediately weakened to a tropical depression over land it tracked across state for about 13 hours and entered gulf of mexico near crystal river initial forecasts predicted edouard to restrengthen to a tropical storm over northeastern gulf of mexico though uncertainty was noted due to development of tropical storm fay in northwestern portion of gulf upon entering gulf of mexico depression encountered strong wind shear from outflow of tropical storm fay edouard generated minimal amounts of intermittent convection along southeastern portion of its circulation enough for it to remain a tropical cyclone by september 6 remaining convection dissipated and edouard dissipated while becoming absorbed into larger circulation of tropical storm fay preparations left thumb tropical storm edouard near landfall in florida on september 4 three hours after developing national hurricane center issued a tropical storm watch from titusville florida to brunswick georgia due to uncertainty in track of storm hours after becoming a tropical storm a tropical storm warning was issued from fernandina beach florida to mouth of savannah river with a tropical storm watch further northward to mouth of south santee river in south carolina though these were cancelled after edouard turned to east about 10 hours before landfall national hurricane center issued another tropical storm warning from titusville florida to brunswick georgia with a tropical storm watch further south to sebastian inlet florida two days before storm made landfall several florida counties were monitoring progress of storm though no serious impact was anticipated brevard county officials identified possible shelters if warranted putnam county officials placed several shelters on standby and utility crews in duval county were placed on standby in event of power failure several media releases of information were issued regarding storm state emergency operation center was on level 2 or partial activation and state government organized two conferences to discuss county actions in regards to storm national weather service issued a flood watch hours before edouard made landfall for much of eastern florida due to expected rainfall from storm south carolina emergency management division monitored progress of storm and division increased its awareness level in response to storm important state agencies in south carolina government were notified to be ready to respond if need arose impact right thumb total rainfall map of edouard in florida in bermuda outflow from storm produced cloudy conditions throughout island squally conditions were reported a short distance to west of island though no rain was reported on bermuda while moving erratically off east coast of florida tropical storm edouard produced rough surf conditions and rip currents along many beaches beachgoers and visitors were advised to exercise extreme caution storm produced water levels about 6 inches above normal near cape canaveral though elsewhere wave action and storm tides were not significant despite being a tropical storm at landfall sustained tropical storm force winds were not observed a rainband ahead of storm produced a 39 mph 63 km h wind gust at patrick air force base and a station in st augustine recorded a wind gust of 38 mph 61 km h sustained winds peaked at 31 mph 50 km h at patrick air force base edouard dropped light to moderate rainfall in eastern florida primarily during 2 to 3 hour periods highest official rainfall total peaked at 2 5 inches 64 mm at orlando executive airport though unofficial totals reached as high as 4 8 inches 122 mm in rockledge rainfall was higher in western florida peaking at 7 64 inches 194 mm in desoto county with an area near tampa reporting over 7 inches 175 mm moderate rainfall resulted in river flooding along st johns river resulting in flooding along roads in seminole county roadway urban and lowland flooding was also reported in brevard and orange counties roadway flooding was extensive in some areas resulting in road closures in oviedo cocoa beach and cape canaveral heavy rainfall in pinellas park caused heavy street flooding along an intersection on u s highway 19 no casualties were reported and no damage was
