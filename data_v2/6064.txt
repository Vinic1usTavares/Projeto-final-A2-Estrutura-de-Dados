abu ishaq muhammad ibn harun al rashid october 796 5 january 842 better known by his regnal name al mu tasim bi llah he who seeks refuge in god was eighth abbasid caliph ruling from 833 until his death in 842 a younger son of caliph harun al rashid he rose to prominence through his formation of a private army composed predominantly of turkish slave soldiers ghilman this proved useful to his half brother caliph al ma mun who employed al mu tasim and his turkish guard to counterbalance other powerful interest groups in state as well as employing them in campaigns against rebels and byzantine empire when al ma mun died unexpectedly on campaign in august 833 al mu tasim was thus well placed to succeed him overriding claims of al ma mun s son al abbas al mu tasim continued many of his brother s policies such as partnership with tahirids who ruled khurasan and baghdad on behalf of abbasids with support of powerful chief qadi ahmad ibn abi duwad he continued to implement rationalist islamic doctrine of mu tazilism and persecution of its opponents through inquisition mihna although not personally interested in literary pursuits al mu tasim also nurtured scientific renaissance begun under al ma mun in other ways his reign marks a departure and a watershed moment in islamic history with creation of a new regime centred on military and particularly his turkish guard in 836 a new capital was established at samarra to symbolize this new regime and remove it from restive populace of baghdad power of caliphal government was increased by centralizing measures that reduced power of provincial governors in favour of a small group of senior civil and military officials in samarra and fiscal apparatus of state was more and more dedicated to maintenance of professional army which was dominated by turks arab and iranian elites that had played a major role in early period of abbasid state were increasingly marginalized and an abortive conspiracy against al mu tasim in favour of al abbas in 838 resulted in a widespread purge of their ranks this strengthened position of turks and their principal leaders ashinas wasif itakh and bugha another prominent member of al mu tasim s inner circle prince of ushrusana al afshin fell afoul of his enemies at court and was overthrown and killed in 840 1 rise of turks would eventually result in troubles of anarchy at samarra and lead to collapse of abbasid power in mid 10th century but ghulam based system inaugurated by al mu tasim would be widely adopted throughout muslim world al mu tasim s reign was marked by continuous warfare two major internal campaigns of reign were against long running khurramite uprising of babak khorramdin in adharbayjan which was suppressed by al afshin in 835 837 and against mazyar autonomous ruler of tabaristan who had clashed with tahirids and risen up in revolt while his generals led fight against internal rebellions al mu tasim himself led sole major external campaign of period in 838 against byzantine empire his armies defeated emperor theophilos and sacked city of amorium amorium campaign was widely celebrated and became a cornerstone of caliphal propaganda cementing al mu tasim s reputation as a warrior caliph early life thumb right upright 1 2 alt multi color map of mediterranean and middle east showing phases of muslim expansion to 10th

his parents were fifth abbasid caliph harun al rashid and marida bint shabib a slave concubine otherwise unknown marida was born in kufa in iraq but her family hailed from soghdia and she is usually considered to have been of turkic origin young prince s early life coincided with what in judgment of posterity was golden age of abbasid caliphate abrupt downfall of powerful barmakid family which had dominated government during previous decades in 803 hinted at political instability at highest levels of court while provincial rebellions that were suppressed with difficulty provided warning signals about dynasty s hold over empire nevertheless compared to strife and division that followed in decades after harun s death abbasid empire was living through its halcyon days harun still ruled directly over bulk of islamic world of his time from central asia and sind in east to maghreb in west lively trade networks linking tang china and indian ocean with europe and africa passed through caliphate with baghdad at their nexus bringing immense prosperity revenues of provinces kept treasury full allowing harun to launch huge expeditions against byzantine empire and engage in vigorous diplomacy his envoys arriving even at distant court of charlemagne this wealth also allowed considerable patronage charitable endowments to muslim holy cities of mecca and medina and welcoming of religious scholars and ascetics at court secured benevolence of religious classes towards dynasty while funds lavished on poets guaranteed its lasting fame splendour of caliphal court provided inspiration for some of earliest stories of thousand and one nights career under al ma mun as an adult muhammad was commonly called by his kunya abu ishaq al tabari describes adult abu ishaq as fair complexioned with a black beard hair tips of which were red and end of which was square and streaked with red and with handsome eyes other authors stress his physical strength and his love for physical activity an anecdote recalls how during amorium campaign he went ahead of army riding on a mule and searched in person for a ford across a river in stark contrast to his more sedentary predecessors and successors later authors write that he was almost illiterate but as historian hugh kennedy comments this would have been most improbable for an abbasid prince and most likely reflects

half brothers al amin and al ma mun al amin enjoyed backing of traditional abbasid elites in baghdad abna al dawla while al ma mun was supported by other sections of abna al ma mun emerged victorious in 813 with surrender of baghdad after a long siege and death of al amin choosing to remain in his stronghold in khurasan on northeastern periphery of islamic world al ma mun allowed his main lieutenants to rule in his stead in iraq this resulted in a wave of antipathy towards al ma mun and his persian lieutenants both among abbasid elites in baghdad and generally in western regions of caliphate culminating in nomination of harun al rashid s younger brother ibrahim as anti caliph at baghdad in 817 this event made al ma mun realise his inability to rule from afar bowing to popular reaction he dismissed or executed his closest lieutenants and returned in person to baghdad in 819 to begin difficult task of rebuilding state throughout conflict and its aftermath abu ishaq remained in baghdad al tabari records that abu ishaq led hajj pilgrimage in 816 accompanied by many troops and officials among whom was hamdawayh ibn ali ibn isa ibn mahan who had just been appointed to governorship of yemen and was on his way there during his stay in mecca his troops defeated and captured a pro alid leader who had raided pilgrim caravans he also led pilgrimage following year but no details are known it appears that at least during this time abu ishaq was loyal to al ma mun and his viceroy in iraq al hasan ibn sahl but like most members of dynasty and abna of baghdad he supported his half uncle ibrahim against al ma mun in 817 819 formation of turkish guard from abu ishaq began forming his corps of turkish troops first members of corps were domestic slaves he bought in baghdad distinguished general itakh was originally a cook whom he trained in art of war but they were soon complemented by turkish slaves sent directly from fringes of muslim world in central asia under an agreement with local samanid rulers this private force was small it probably numbered between three and four thousand at time of his accession to throne but it was highly trained and disciplined and made abu ishaq a man of power in his own right as al ma mun increasingly turned to him for assistance long civil war shattered social and political order of early abbasid state abna al dawla main political and military pillar of early abbasid state had been much reduced by civil war along with abna old arab families settled in provinces since time of muslim conquests and members of extended abbasid dynasty formed core of traditional elites and largely supported al amin during remainder of al ma mun s reign they lost their positions in administrative and military machinery and with them their influence and power furthermore as civil war raged in eastern half of caliphate and in iraq western provinces slipped from baghdad s control in a series of rebellions that saw local strongmen claiming various degrees of autonomy or even trying to secede from caliphate altogether although he had overthrown old elites al ma mun lacked a large and loyal power base and army so he turned to new men who commanded their own military retinues these included tahirids led by abdallah ibn tahir and his own brother abu ishaq abu ishaq s turkish corps was politically useful to al ma mun who tried to lessen his own dependence on mostly eastern iranian leaders such as tahirids who had supported him in civil war and who now occupied senior positions in new regime in an effort to counterbalance their influence al ma mun granted formal recognition to his brother and his turkish corps for same reason he placed arab tribal levies of region of levant and iraq in hands of his son al abbas nature and identity of turkish slave soldiers as they are commonly described is a controversial subject both ethnic label and slave status of its members are disputed although bulk of corps were clearly of servile origin being either captured in war or purchased as slaves in arabic historical sources they are never referred to as slaves mamluk or abid but rather as mawali clients or freedmen or ghilman pages implying that they were manumitted a view reinforced by fact that they were paid cash salaries although members of corps are collectively called simply turks in sources prominent early members were neither turks nor slaves but rather iranian vassal princes from central asia like al afshin prince of usrushana who were followed by their personal retinues persian arabic likewise motives behind formation of turkish guard action are unclear as are financial means available to abu ishaq for purpose particularly given his young age turks were closely associated with abu ishaq and are usually interpreted as a private military retinue something not uncommon in islamic world of time as historian matthew gordon points out sources provide some indications that original recruitment of turks may have been begun or encouraged by al ma mun as part of latter s general policy of recruiting central asian princes and their own military retinues to his court it is therefore possible that guard was originally formed on abu ishaq s initiative but that it quickly received caliphal sanction and support in exchange for being placed under al ma mun s service service under al ma mun in 819 abu ishaq accompanied by his turkish guard and other commanders was sent to suppress a kharijite uprising under mahdi ibn al around sabur north of baghdad according to a most likely fanciful story provided by 10th century chronicler al tabari ashinas in later years one of chief turkish leaders received his name when he placed himself between a kharijite lancer about to attack future caliph shouting recognize me in persian ashinas ma ra in 828 al ma mun appointed abu ishaq as governor of egypt and syria in place of abdallah ibn tahir who departed to assume governorship of khurasan while jazira and frontier zone thughur with byzantine empire passed to al abbas ibn tahir had just brought egypt back under caliphal authority and pacified it after tumult of civil war but situation remained volatile when abu ishaq s deputy in egypt umayr ibn al walid tried to raise taxes nile delta and regions revolted in 830 umayr tried to forcibly subdue rebels but was ambushed and killed along with many of his troops with government troops confined to capital fustat abu ishaq intervened in person at head of his 4 000 turks rebels were soundly defeated and their leaders executed thumb upright 1 2

scale invasion of byzantine territory since start of abbasid civil war and sacked several byzantine border fortresses following his return from egypt abu ishaq joined al ma mun in his 831 campaign against byzantines after rebuffing theophilos offers of peace abbasid army passed through cilician gates and divided into three columns with caliph his son al abbas and abu ishaq at their head abbasids seized and destroyed several minor forts as well as town of tyana while al abbas won a minor skirmish against a byzantine army led by theophilos in person before withdrawing to syria in september soon after abu ishaq s departure from egypt revolt flared up again this time encompassing both arab settlers and native christian copts under leadership of ibn a descendant of one of original arab conquerors of country rebels were confronted by turks led by al afshin al afshin conducted a systematic campaign winning a string of victories and engaging in large scale executions many male copts were executed and their women and children sold into slavery while old arab elites who had ruled country since muslim conquest of egypt in 640s were practically annihilated in early 832 al ma mun came to egypt and soon after last elements of resistance copts of coastal marshes of nile delta were subdued later in same year al ma mun repeated his invasion of byzantine borderlands capturing strategically important fortress of loulon a success that consolidated abbasid control of both exits of cilician gates so encouraged was al ma mun by this victory that he repeatedly rejected theophilos ever more generous offers for peace and publicly announced that he intended to capture constantinople itself consequently al abbas was dispatched in may to convert deserted town of tyana into a military colony and prepare ground for westward advance al ma mun followed in july but he suddenly fell ill and died on 7 august 833 caliphate al ma mun had made no official provisions for his succession his son al abbas was old enough to rule and had acquired experience of command in border wars with byzantines but had not been named heir according to account of al tabari on his deathbed al ma mun dictated a letter nominating his brother rather than al abbas as his successor and abu ishaq was acclaimed as caliph on 9august with regnal name of al mu tasim in full al mu tasim bi llah he who seeks refuge in god it is impossible to know whether this reflects actual events or whether letter was an invention and abu ishaq merely took advantage of his proximity to his dying brother and al abbas s absence elsewhere to propel himself to throne as abu ishaq was forefather of all subsequent abbasid caliphs later historians had little desire to question legitimacy of his accession but it is clear that his position was far from secure a large part of army favoured al abbas and a delegation of soldiers even went to him and tried to proclaim him as new caliph only when al abbas refused them whether out of weakness or out of a desire to avoid a civil war and himself took oath of allegiance to his uncle did soldiers acquiesce in al mu tasim s succession precariousness of his position is further evidenced by fact that al mu tasim immediately called off expedition abandoned tyana project and returned with his army to baghdad which he reached on 20september new elites and administration thumb upright 1 2 alt obverse and reverse of silver coin with arabic inscriptions silver dirham of al mu tasim minted at al in 836 7 whatever true background of his accession al mu tasim owed his rise to throne not only to his strong personality and leadership skills but principally to fact that he was only abbasid prince to control independent military power in form of his turkish corps unlike his brother who tried to use tribal arabs and turks to balance out iranian troops al mu tasim relied almost exclusively on his turks historian tayeb el hibri describes al mu tasim s regime as militaristic and centred on turkish corps rise of al mu tasim to caliphate thus heralded a radical change in nature of abbasid administration and most profound shift islamic world had experienced since dynasty had come to power in abbasid revolution while latter had been backed by a mass popular movement seeking to enact social reforms al mu tasim s revolution was essentially project of a small ruling elite aiming to secure its own power already under al ma mun old established arab families such as muhallabids disappeared from court and minor members of abbasid family ceased to be appointed to governorships or senior military positions reforms of al mu tasim completed this process resulting in eclipse of previous arab and iranian elites both in baghdad and provinces in favour of turkish military and an increasing centralization of administration around caliphal court a characteristic example is egypt where arab settler families still nominally formed country s garrison jund and thus continued to receive a salary from local revenues al mu tasim discontinued practice removing arab families from army registers diwan and ordering that revenues of egypt be sent to central government which would then pay a cash salary ata only to turkish troops stationed in province another departure from previous practice was al mu tasim s appointment of his senior lieutenants such as ashinas and itakh as nominal super governors over several provinces this measure was probably intended to allow his chief followers immediate access to funds with which to pay their troops but also according to kennedy represented a further centralizing of power for under governors of provinces seldom appeared at court and played little part in making of political decisions indeed al mu tasim s caliphate marks apogee of central government s authority in particular as expressed in its right and power to extract taxes from provinces an issue that had been controversial and had faced much local opposition since early days of islamic state one major exception to this process were tahirids who remained in place as autonomous governors of their khurasani super province encompassing most of eastern caliphate tahirids provided governor of baghdad and helped to keep city a focus of opposition under al ma mun quiescent post was held throughout al mu tasim s reign by abdallah ibn tahir s cousin ishaq ibn ibrahim ibn mus ab who according to orientalist c e bosworth was always one of al mu tasim s closest advisers and confidants apart from turkish military and tahirids al mu tasim s administration depended on central fiscal bureaucracy as main source of revenue were rich lands of southern iraq sawad and neighbouring areas administration was staffed mostly with men drawn from these regions new caliphal bureaucratic class that emerged under al mu tasim were thus mostly persian or aramean in origin with a large proportion of newly converted muslims and even a few nestorian christians who came from landowner or merchant families on his accession al mu tasim appointed as his chief minister or vizier his old personal secretary al fadl ibn marwan a man trained in traditions of abbasid bureaucracy he was distinguished for his caution and frugality and tried to shore up finances of state these traits eventually caused his downfall when he refused to authorize caliph s gifts to his courtiers on grounds that treasury could not afford it he was dismissed in 836 and was lucky not to suffer any punishment more severe than being sent into exile to village of al sinn his replacement muhammad ibn al zayyat was of a completely different character a rich merchant he is described by kennedy as a competent financial expert but a callous and brutal man who made many enemies even among his fellow members of administration nevertheless and even though his political authority never extended beyond fiscal domain he managed to maintain his office to end of reign and under al mu tasim s successor al wathiq as well rise of turks al mu tasim s reliance on his turkish ghilman grew over time especially in aftermath of an abortive plot against him discovered in 838 during amorium campaign headed by ujayf ibn anbasa a long serving khurasani who had followed al ma mun since civil war against al amin conspiracy rallied traditional abbasid elites dissatisfied with al mu tasim s policies and especially his favouritism towards to turks discontent with latter grew due to their servile origin which offended abbasid aristocracy plotters aimed to kill caliph and raise al ma mun s son al abbas in his stead according to al tabari al abbas although privy to these designs rejected ujayf s urgent suggestions to kill al mu tasim during initial stages of campaign for fear of appearing to undermine jihad in event ashinas grew suspicious of al and ibn hisham and plot was soon uncovered al abbas was imprisoned and turkish leaders ashinas itakh and bugha elder undertook to discover and arrest other conspirators affair was signal for a large scale purge of army that kennedy describes as of almost ruthlessness al abbas was forced to die of thirst while his male offspring were arrested and likely executed by itakh other leaders of conspiracy were likewise executed in ingeniously cruel ways which were widely publicized as a deterrent to others according to kitab al uyun about seventy commanders and soldiers were executed including some turks as historian matthew gordon points out these events are probably connected to disappearance of abna from historical record correspondingly they must have increased standing of turks and their chief commanders particularly ashinas in 839 his daughter married son of al afshin and in 840 al mu tasim appointed him as his deputy during his absence from samarra when he returned al mu tasim publicly placed him on a throne and awarded him with a ceremonial crown in same year ashinas was appointed to a super governorate over provinces of egypt syria and jazira ashinas did not govern these directly but appointed deputies as governors while he remained in samarra when ashinas participated in hajj of 841 he received honours on every stop of route in 840 it was turn of al afshin to fall victim to caliph s suspicions despite his distinguished service as a general he was very much odd man out in samarran elite relations of iranian prince with low born turkish generals were marked by mutual antipathy furthermore he alienated tahirids who might under other circumstances have been his natural allies by interfering in tabaristan where he allegedly encouraged local autonomous ruler mazyar to reject tahirid control see below al tabari reports other allegations against al afshin that he was plotting to poison al mu tasim or that he was planning to escape to his native ushrusana with vast sums of money according to kennedy very variety of allegations against al afshin is grounds for skepticism about their truthfulness and it is likely that he was framed by his enemies at court whatever truth these allegations discredited al afshin in eyes of al mu tasim he was dismissed from his position in caliphal bodyguard al haras and a show trial was held at palace where he was confronted with several witnesses including mazyar al afshin was accused among other things of being a false muslim and of being accorded divine status by his subjects in ushrusana despite putting up an able and eloquent defence al afshin was found guilty and thrown into prison he died soon after either of starvation or of poison his body was publicly gibbeted in front of palace gates burned and thrown in tigris once more affair enhanced standing of turkish leadership and particularly wasif who now received al afshin s revenues and possessions nevertheless it seems that al mu tasim was not entirely satisfied with men he had raised to power an anecdote dating from his last years relayed by ishaq ibn ibrahim ibn mus ab recalls how caliph in an intimate exchange with ishaq lamented that he had made poor choices in this regard while his brother al ma mun had nurtured four excellent servants from tahirids he had raised al afshin who was dead ashinas a feeble heart and a coward itakh who is totally insignificant and wasif an unprofitable servant ishaq himself then suggested that this was because while al ma mun had used men with local connections and influence al mu tasim had used men with no roots in muslim community to which caliph sadly assented foundation of samarra thumb right upright 0 8 alt topographic map showing course of tigris river in blue and settled areas of city in orange with their names map of abbasid samarra turkish army was at first quartered in baghdad but quickly came into conflict with remnants of old abbasid establishment in city and city s populace latter resented their loss of influence and career opportunities to foreign troops who were furthermore often undisciplined and violent spoke no arabic and were either recent converts to islam or still pagans violent episodes between populace and turks thus became common this was a major factor in al mu tasim s decision in 836 to found a new capital at samarra some north of baghdad but there were other considerations in play founding a new capital was a public statement of establishment of a new regime according to tayeb el hibri it allowed court to exist at a distance from populace of baghdad and protected by a new guard of foreign troops and amid a new royal culture revolving around sprawling palatial grounds public spectacle and a seemingly ceaseless quest for leisurely indulgence an arrangement compared by oleg grabar to relationship between paris and versailles after louis xiv by creating a new city in a previously uninhabited area al mu tasim could reward his followers with land and commercial opportunities without cost to himself and free from any constraints unlike baghdad with its established interest groups and high property prices in fact sale of land seems to have produced considerable profit for treasury in words of kennedy a sort of gigantic property speculation in which both government and its followers could expect to benefit space and life in new capital were strictly regimented residential areas were separated from markets and military was given its own cantonments separated from ordinary populace and each home of a specific ethnic contingent of army such as turks or regiment city was dominated by its mosques most famous among which is great mosque of samarra built by caliph al mutawakkil in 848 852 and palaces built in grand style by both caliphs and their senior commanders who were given extensive properties to develop unlike baghdad new capital was an entirely artificial creation poorly sited in terms of water supply and river communications its existence was determined solely by presence of caliphal court and when capital returned to baghdad sixty years later samarra was rapidly abandoned due to this ruins of abbasid capital are still extant and city can be mapped with great accuracy by modern archaeologists science and learning as a military man al mu tasim s outlook was utilitarian and his intellectual pursuits could not be compared with those of al ma mun or his successor al wathiq but he continued his brother s policy of promoting writers and scholars baghdad remained a major centre of learning throughout his reign among notable scholars active during his reign were astronomers habash al al and ahmad al farghani polymath al jahiz and distinguished arab mathematician and philosopher al kindi who dedicated his work on first philosophy to his patron al mu tasim nestorian physician salmawayh ibn bunan a

dissection from caliph mu tazilism and mihna thumb right upright 1 2 alt map of middle east with main areas and events associated with mihna labelled map of events associated with mihna from 833 to 852 ideologically al mu tasim followed footsteps of al ma mun continuing his predecessor s support for mu tazilism a theological doctrine that attempted to tread a middle way between secular monarchy and theocratic approach espoused by alids and various sects of shi ism mu espoused view that quran was created and hence fell within authority of a god guided imam to interpret according to changing circumstances while revering ali they avoided taking a position on righteousness of opposing sides in conflict between ali and his opponents mu tazilism was officially adopted by al ma mun in 827 and in 833 shortly before his death al ma mun made its doctrines compulsory with establishment of an inquisition mihna during his brother s reign al mu tasim played an active role in enforcement of mihna in western provinces this continued after his accession chief advocate of mu tazilism head qadi ahmad ibn abi duwad was perhaps dominant influence at caliphal court throughout al mu tasim s reign thus mu tazilism became closely identified with new regime of al mu tasim adherence to mu tazilism was transformed into an intensely political issue since to question it was to oppose authority of caliph as god sanctioned imam while mu tazilism found broad support it was also passionately opposed by traditionalists who held that quran s authority was absolute and unalterable as literal word of god opposition to mu tazilism also provided a vehicle for criticism by those who disliked new regime and its elites in event active repression of traditionalists was unsuccessful and even proved counterproductive beating and imprisonment of one of most resolute opponents of mu tazilism ahmad ibn hanbal in 834 only helped to spread his fame by time al mutawakkil abandoned mu tazilism and returned to traditional orthodoxy in 848 strict and conservative hanbali school had emerged as leading school of jurisprudence fiqh in sunni islam domestic campaigns although al mu tasim s reign was a time of peace in caliphate s heartland territories al mu tasim himself was an energetic campaigner and according to kennedy acquired reputation of being one of warrior caliphs of islam with exception of amorium campaign most of military expeditions of al mu tasim s reign were domestic directed against rebels in areas that although nominally part of caliphate had remained outside effective muslim rule and where native peoples and princes retained de facto autonomy three great campaigns of reign amorium expedition against khurramite rebellion and that against mazyar ruler of tabaristan were in part also conscious propaganda exercises in which al mu tasim could solidify his regime s legitimacy in eyes of populace by leading wars against infidels an alid revolt led by muhammad ibn qasim broke out in khurasan in early 834 but was swiftly defeated and muhammad brought as a prisoner to caliph s court he managed to escape during night of 8 9october 834 taking advantage of eid al fitr

abbasid authority in 760 but muslim presence was limited to coastal lowlands of caspian sea and their cities mountainous areas remained under native rulers chief among whom were bavandids in eastern and in central and western mountain ranges who retained their autonomy in exchange for paying a tribute to caliphate with support of al ma mun mazyar had established himself as de facto ruler of all tabaristan even capturing muslim city of amul and imprisoning local abbasid governor al mu tasim confirmed him in his post on his accession but trouble soon began when mazyar refused to accept his subordination to tahirid viceroy of east abdallah ibn tahir instead insisting on paying taxes of his region directly to al mu tasim s agent according to al tabari qarinid s intransigence had been secretly encouraged by al afshin who hoped to discredit tahirids and assume their vast governorship in east himself tension mounted as tahirids encouraged local muslims to resist mazyar forcing latter to adopt an increasingly confrontational stance against muslim settlers and turn for support on native iranian and mostly zoroastrian peasantry whom he encouraged to attack muslim landowners open conflict erupted in 838 when his troops seized cities of amul and sari took muslim settlers prisoner and executed many of them in return tahirids under al hasan ibn al husayn ibn mus ab and muhammad

tahirid appointee while mazyar was taken captive to samarra like babak he was paraded before populace and then flogged to death on 6september 840 while autonomy of local dynasties was maintained in aftermath of revolt event marked onset of country s rapid islamization including among native dynasties near end of al mu tasim s life there were a series of uprisings in syrian provinces including

captive women were raped by theophilos khurramites caliph took personal charge of preparations for a retaliatory expedition as campaigns against byzantium were customarily only ones in which caliphs participated in person al mu tasim assembled a huge force 80 000 men with 30 000 servants and camp followers according to michael syrian or even larger according to other writers at tarsus he declared his target to be amorium birthplace of reigning byzantine dynasty caliph reportedly had name painted on shields and banners of his army campaign began in june with a smaller force under al afshin attacking through pass of hadath in east while caliph with main army crossed cilician gates on 19 21june theophilos who had been caught unaware by two pronged abbasid attack tried to confront al afshin s smaller force first but suffered a major defeat at battle of on 22july barely escaping with his life unable to offer any effective resistance to abbasid advance emperor returned to constantinople a week later al afshin and main caliphal army joined forces before ancyra which had been left defenceless and was plundered from ancyra abbasid army turned to amorium to which they laid siege on 1august al afshin itakh and ashinas all took turns assaulting city with their troops but siege was fiercely contested even after abbasids informed by a defector effected a breach in a weak spot of wall after two weeks taking advantage of a short truce for negotiations requested by one of byzantine commanders of breach abbasid army successfully stormed city it was thoroughly plundered and its walls razed while populace numbering into tens of thousands was carried off to be sold into slavery according to al tabari al mu tasim was now considering extending his campaign to attack constantinople when conspiracy headed by his nephew al abbas was uncovered al mu tasim was forced to cut short his campaign and return quickly to his realm without bothering with theophilos and his forces stationed in nearby dorylaion taking direct route from amorium to cilician gates both caliph s army and its prisoners suffered during march through arid countryside of central anatolia some captives were so exhausted that they could not move and were executed while others found in turmoil opportunity to escape in retaliation al mu tasim after separating most prominent among them executed rest some 6 000 sack of amorium brought al mu tasim much acclaim as a warrior caliph and ghazi warrior for faith and was celebrated by contemporaries most notably in a famous ode by court poet abu tammam abbasids did not follow up on their success warfare continued between two empires with raids and counter raids along border but after a few byzantine successes a truce was agreed in 841 at time of his death in 842 al mu tasim was preparing yet another large scale invasion but great fleet he had prepared to assault constantinople was destroyed in a storm off cape a few months later following al mu tasim s death warfare gradually died down and battle of mauropotamos in 844 was last major arab byzantine engagement for a decade death and legacy thumb right upright 1 2 alt family tree with rulers marked with green family tree of descendants of al mu tasim al mu tasim was forefather of all subsequent abbasid caliphs al tabari states that al mu tasim fell ill on 841 his regular physician salmawayh ibn bunan whom caliph had trusted implicitly had died previous year his new physician yahya ibn masawayh did not follow normal treatment of cupping and purging according to hunayn ibn ishaq this worsened caliph s illness and brought about his death on 5january 842 after a reign of eight years eight months and two days according to islamic calendar he was buried in al khaqani palace in samarra succession of his son al wathiq was unopposed al wathiq s reign through unremarkable was essentially a continuation of al mu tasim s own as government continued to be led by men al mu tasim had raised to power turks itakh wasif and ashinas vizier ibn al zayyat and chief qadi ahmad ibn abi duwad al tabari describes al mu tasim as having a relatively easygoing nature being kind agreeable and charitable according to c e bosworth sources reveal little about al mu tasim s character other than his lack of sophistication compared with his half brother nevertheless bosworth concludes he was a proficient military commander who secured caliphate both politically and militarily al mu tasim s reign represents a watershed moment in history of abbasid state and had long lasting repercussions in islamic history while early abbasid regime already relied heavily on non arab elements khurasanis who had formed bulk of abbasid revolutions military forces and persian and syriac secretarial class that had emerged in baghdad and iraq to staff abbasid administration al mu tasim s military reforms are truly moment when arabs lost control of empire they created according to kennedy while according to david ayalon institution of military slavery introduced by al mu tasim became one of most important and most enduring socio political institutions that islam has known with his turkish guard al mu tasim set a pattern that would be widely imitated not only did military acquire a predominant position in state but it also increasingly became preserve of minority groups from peoples living on margins of islamic world thus it formed an exclusive ruling caste separated from arab iranian mainstream of society by ethnic origin language and sometimes even religion this dichotomy would become according to hugh kennedy a distinctive feature of many islamic polities and would reach its apogee in mamluk dynasties that ruled egypt and syria in late middle ages more immediately although al mu tasim s new professional army proved militarily highly effective it also posed a potential danger to stability of abbasid regime as army s separation from mainstream society meant that soldiers were entirely reliant on ata for survival consequently any failure to provide their pay or policies that threatened their position were likely to cause a violent reaction this became evident less than a generation later during anarchy at samarra 861 870 where turks played main role need to cover military spending would henceforth be a fixture of caliphal government this was at a time when government income began to decline rapidly partly through rise of autonomous dynasties in provinces and partly through decline in productivity of lowlands of iraq that had traditionally provided bulk of tax revenue less than a century after al mu tasim s death this process would lead to bankruptcy of abbasid government and eclipse of caliphs political power with rise of khazar officer ibn ra iq to position of amir al umara al mu tasim in literature al mu tasim is featured in medieval arabic and turkish epic which features heavily fictionalized versions of events from arab byzantine wars in it al mu tasim helps heroes pursue traitor and apostate uqba across several countries from spain to yemen before having him crucified before constantinople on its return muslim army is ambushed in a defile by byzantines and only 400 men including caliph and most of heroes manage to escape in retaliation al mu tasim s successor al wathiq launches a campaign against constantinople where he installs a muslim governor name al mu tasim is used for a fictional character in story approach to al mu tasim written in 1936 by argentine author jorge luis borges which appears in his anthology ficciones al mu tasim referenced there is not abbasid caliph though borges does state regarding original non fictional al mu tasim from whom name is taken name of that eighth abbasid caliph who was victorious in eight battles fathered eight sons and eight daughters left eight thousand slaves and ruled for a period of eight years eight moons and eight days while not strictly accurate borges quote paraphrases al tabari who notes that he was born in eighth month was eighth caliph in eighth generation from al abbas his lifespan was eight and forty years that he died leaving eight sons and eight daughters and that he reigned for eight years and eight months and reflects widespread reference to al mu tasim in arabic sources as al man of eight notes references bibliography category 796 births category 842
