later became ubiquitous throughout 18th and 19th centuries in united states medicinal preparations of cannabis became available in american pharmacies in 1850s following an introduction to its use in western medicine by william o shaughnessy a decade earlier in 1839 early pharmaceutical and recreational use right upright thumb cannabis fluid extract medicine bottle around same time efforts to regulate sale of pharmaceuticals began and laws were introduced on a state to state basis that created penalties for mislabeling drugs adulterating them with undisclosed narcotics and improper sale of

prescription those that required labeling often required word poison if drug was not issued by a pharmacy other regulations were prohibitions on sale to minors as well as restrictions on refills some pharmaceutical laws specifically enumerated drugs that came under effect of regulations while others did not leaving matter to medical experts those that did generally included references to cannabis

eight states are listed with sale of poisons laws that specifically mention cannabis north carolina ohio wisconsin louisiana vermont maine montana and district of columbia among those states that required a prescription for sale were wisconsin and louisiana several sale of poison laws did not specify restricted drugs including in indiana rhode island hawaii nebraska kentucky mississippi and

involving substances later categorized as poisons first draft of bill an act to regulate sale of poisons prohibited sale of cannabis as with other substances without written order of a physician final bill as passed allowed sale without a prescription so long as purpose to which it was issued and name and address of buyer was recorded and in addition all packaging of such substances whether sold with a prescription or not had to have label poison on them in uppercase red letters in 1862 section which enumerated substances was repealed with an amendatory act though cannabis was still required to be labeled in some states where poison laws excluded cannabis there were nonetheless attempts to include it a bill introduced in 1880 in california state legislature was titled an act to regulate sale of opium and other narcotic poisons and would have forbidden anyone to keep sell furnish or give away any preparations or mixtures made or prepared from opium hemp or other narcotic drugs without a doctor s prescription at a licensed store that bill was withdrawn in favor of one specifically aimed at opium though further bills including hemp based drugs were introduced in 1885 and in 1889

hashish parlors were flourishing alongside opium dens to point that one could be found in every major city on east coast it was estimated there were around 500 such establishments in new york city alone an article in harper s magazine 1883 attributed to harry hubbell kane describes a hashish house in new york frequented by a large clientele including males and females of better classes and further talks about parlors in boston philadelphia and chicago hemp cigarettes were reported to be used by mexican soldiers as early as 1874 criminalization 1900s strengthening of poison laws 1906 1938 pure food and drug act was then passed by united states congress in 1906 and required that certain special drugs including cannabis be accurately labeled with contents previously many drugs had been sold as patent medicines with secret ingredients or misleading labels even after passage of regulations there continued to be criticism about availability of narcotics and around 1910 there was a wave of legislation aimed to strengthen requirements for their sale and remove what were commonly referred to as loopholes in poison laws new revisions aimed to restrict all narcotics including cannabis as poisons limit their sale to pharmacies and require doctor s prescriptions first instance was in district of columbia in 1906 under an act to regulate practice of pharmacy and sale of poisons in district of columbia and for other purposes act was updated in 1938 to federal pure food drug and cosmetics act of 1938 which remains in effect even today creating a legal paradox for

important tools in enforcement of statute and had a deterrent effect upon would be violators marijuana remains under this law defined as a dangerous drug further regulation of cannabis followed in massachusetts 1911 new york 1914 and maine 1914 in new york reform legislation began under towns boylan act which targeted all habit forming drugs restricted their sale prohibited refills in order to prevent habituation prohibited sale to people with a habit and prohibited doctors who were themselves habituated from selling them shortly after several amendments were passed by new york board of health including adding cannabis to list of habit forming drugs a new york times article noted on cannabis amendment in west first state to include cannabis as a poison was california poison act was passed in 1907 and amended in 1909 and 1911 and in 1913 an amendatory act was made to make possession of extracts tinctures or other narcotic preparations of hemp or loco weed their preparations and compounds a misdemeanor there is no evidence that law was ever used or intended to restrict pharmaceutical cannabis instead it was a legislative mistake and in 1915 another revision placed cannabis under same restriction as other poisons in 1914 one of first cannabis drug raids in nation occurred in mexican american neighborhood of in los angeles where police raided two dream gardens and confiscated a of cannabis other states followed with marijuana laws including wyoming 1915 texas 1919 iowa 1923 nevada 1923 oregon 1923 washington 1923 arkansas 1923 nebraska 1927 louisiana 1927 and colorado 1929 one source of tensions in western and southwestern states was influx of mexicans to u s following 1910 mexican revolution many mexicans also smoked marijuana to relax after working in fields it was also seen as a cheaper alternative to alcohol due to prohibition which went into effect nationally in 1920 later in 1920s negative tensions grew between small farms and large farms that used cheaper mexican labor shortly afterwards great depression came which increased tensions as jobs and resources became more scarce because of that passage of initial laws is often described as a product of racism yet use of hashish by near eastern immigrants was also cited as well as misuse of pharmaceutical hemp and laws conformed with other legislation that was being passed around country

commissioners on uniform state laws it was argued that traffic in narcotic drugs should have same safeguards and same regulation in all of states committee took into consideration fact that federal government had already passed harrison act in 1914 and federal import and export act in 1922 many people assumed that harrison act was all that was necessary harrison act however was a revenue producing act and while it provided penalties for violation it did not give states themselves authority to exercise police power in regard to seizure of drugs used in illicit trade or in regard to punishment of those responsible act was recommended to states for that purpose as a result of uniform state narcotic act federal bureau of narcotics encouraged state governments to adopt act by middle

instead of enacting marihuana tax act ama proposed cannabis be added to harrison narcotics tax act this approach was unappealing to some legislators who feared that adding a new substance to harrison act would subject that act to new legal scrutiny since federal government had no authority under 10th amendment to regulate medicines that power being reserved by individual states in 1937 a tax was

alternative raw material for paper had emerged it would have lowered price of paper needed to print hearst s many newspapers a positive thing for hearst moreover by year 1916 there were at least five machine brakes for hemp and it is unlikely that in 1930s hemp became a new threat for newspapers owners mellon was secretary of treasury as well as wealthiest man in america and had invested heavily in nylon dupont s new synthetic fiber he considered nylon s success to depend on it replacing traditional resource hemp company dupont and many industrial historians dispute a link between nylon and hemp they argue that reason for developing nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with silk and rayon in for example thin stockings for women silk was much more expensive than hemp and imported largely from japan there was more money in a substitute for silk dupont focused early on thin stockings for women as a commercial product nylon was a revolution in textiles strong and water resistant it was possible to make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials first sales in 1938 in new york of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women for years to come nylon demand was greater than dupont could produce and dupont group was very big it could move on if nylon had not become a success thumb left 260px hemp bast with fibers stem in middle in 1916 united

and have not been confirmed by paper production experts consistency of long fibers is too low in hemp hurds for commercial papermaking numerous machines had been devised for breaking and hemp fibers but none had been found to be fully satisfactory in actual commercial work to produce fiber from hemp was a labor intensive process if harvest transport and processing are included technological developments decreased labor but not sufficiently to eliminate this disadvantage there was also a misconception about intoxicating effects of hemp because it has same active substance thc which is in

with amendment in order to avoid a penalty of reduced federal highway funds these laws imposed mandatory driver s license suspensions of at least six months for persons committing a drug offense including simple possession of cannabis regardless of whether any motor vehicle was involved although amendment does contain a provision for states to opt out without penalty as of 2019 six states still have so called smoke a joint lose your license laws in effect house joint resolution 117 1998 by fall of 1998 california voters had approved proposition 215 to legalize medical cannabis and similar measures were up for vote in several more states in response to these developments house joint resolution 117 was passed by u s house of representatives on september 15 1998 to declare support for existing federal legal process for determining safety and efficacy of drugs and oppose efforts to circumvent this process by legalizing marijuana for medicinal use without valid scientific evidence and fda approval measure passed by a 310 to 93 vote united states v oakland cannabis buyers cooperative 2001 following passage of proposition 215 oakland cannabis buyers cooperative was created to provide seriously ill patients with a safe and reliable source of medical cannabis information and patient support in january 1998 u s government sued oakland cannabis buyers cooperative for violating federal laws created as a result of controlled substances act on may 14 2001 supreme court ruled in united states v oakland cannabis buyers cooperative that federal anti drug laws do not permit an exception for medical cannabis and rejected common law medical necessity defense to crimes enacted under controlled substances act because congress concluded cannabis has no currently accepted medical use when act was passed in 1970 united states v oakland cannabis buyers cooperative cornell law school retrieved may 26 2011 gonzales v raich 2005 gonzales v raich 545 u s 1 2005 was a decision in which u s supreme court ruled 6 3 that even where individuals or businesses in accordance with state approved medical cannabis programs are lawfully cultivating possessing or distributing medical cannabis such persons or businesses are violating federal marijuana laws therefore under federal law violators are prosecuted because commerce clause of united states constitution grants federal government jurisdiction pursuant to u s controlled substances act to prosecute marijuana offenses in gonzales defendants argued that because cannabis in question had been grown transported and consumed entirely within california and in compliance with california medical cannabis laws their activity did not implicate interstate commerce and as such could not be regulated by federal government through commerce clause supreme court disagreed reasoning that cannabis grown within california for medical purposes is indistinguishable from illicit marijuana and that because intrastate medical cannabis market contributes to interstate illicit marijuana market commerce clause applies even where california citizens are using medical cannabis in compliance with state law those individuals and businesses can still be prosecuted by federal authorities for violating federal law supreme court gonzales v raich 2008 cornell law school to combat state approved medical cannabis legislation drug enforcement administration continued routine targeting and arrests of medical cannabis patients and seizure of medical cannabis and business assets of growers and medical dispensaries this was finally curtailed with passage of rohrabacher farr amendment in 2014 although prosecutions initially continued until a pair of court rulings determined doj was interpreting amendment incorrectly cole memorandum rescinded 2018 in january 2018 attorney general jeff sessions rescinded cole memorandum an obama era policy that generally discouraged u s attorneys from enforcing federal law against state legal cannabis enterprises impact that rescinding memo would have on enforcement activities was not immediately made clear by justice department officials decriminalization 1970s medical use compassionate ind program 1978 in 1975 a washington d c resident named robert randall was arrested for cultivating cannabis randall who had discovered that cannabis relieved symptoms of his glaucoma employed a medical necessity defense at trial to justify his use of drug charges against randall were dismissed and as a result of an ensuing petition filed with fda randall became first person to receive cannabis from federal government in 1976 after his supply was cut off in 1978 he filed a lawsuit to have it restored setting in motion creation of compassionate investigational new drug program shortly thereafter program allowed patients with serious medical conditions to receive a regular supply of cannabis from federal government however only 13 patients ended up participating due to very complicated and drawn out application process involved compassionate ind program was closed to new patients in 1992 due to a flood of new applications from aids patients and concerns that program undercut bush administration efforts to discourage illegal drug use twenty eight applications that had recently been approved were rescinded and only 13 patients who were already receiving cannabis were allowed to do so moving forward all but two of patients have since died surviving two patients are only persons who currently receive cannabis through program early medical cannabis laws 1978 1982 during late 1970s and into early 80s a number of states passed legislation addressing medical use of cannabis new mexico was first to do so in 1978 and by end of 1982 over thirty states had followed suit majority of these laws sought to provide cannabis through federally approved research programs administered by states using cannabis supplied by national institute on drug abuse only seven states ended up implementing programs however due to large bureaucratic and regulatory obstacles involved other states passed laws allowing doctors to prescribe cannabis or reclassifying cannabis in a state s internal drug scheduling system additionally a few states passed legislation affirming right of individuals to present a medical necessity defense at trial these laws were all largely ineffectual though due to continued prohibition of medical cannabis at federal level by mid 80s efforts to pass new medical cannabis laws had ground to a halt and a number of existing laws were either repealed or allowed to expire dea judge recommends reclassification 1988 in 1972 national organization for reform of marijuana laws petitioned bndd which later became dea to remove cannabis from list of schedule i drugs in order to allow it to be prescribed by physicians after a decade of legal battles in which dea refused to consider petition public hearings were finally held on matter beginning in 1986 in september 1988 after two years of extensive public hearings dea chief administrative law judge francis l young ruled in favor of moving cannabis to a schedule ii classification finding that marijuana in its natural form is one of safest therapeutically active substances known to man young further concluded evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana has been accepted as capable of relieving distress of great numbers of very ill people and doing so with safety under medical supervision it would be unreasonable arbitrary and capricious for dea to continue to stand between those sufferers and benefits of this substance in light of evidence in this record as young s ruling was only a non binding recommendation however it was rejected by dea administrator john lawn in december 1989 a 1994 u s court of appeals ruling upheld dea s final decision proposition p and first cannabis dispensaries 1991 in 1991 79 of san francisco voters approved proposition p a non binding ballot measure expressing support for medical use of cannabis city board of supervisors soon followed with resolution 141 92 which urged law enforcement not to prosecute individuals using cannabis under a doctor s care as proven by a letter from a treating physician resolution enabled open sale of cannabis to aids patients and others within city most notably through san francisco cannabis buyers club which was operated by dennis peron similar clubs appeared outside san francisco in ensuing years as other cities passed legislation to support medical use of cannabis wo men s alliance for medical marijuana was founded in 1993 after santa cruz voters approved measure a in november 1992 and oakland cannabis buyers cooperative was founded in 1995 shortly before city council passed multiple medical cannabis resolutions these were first cannabis dispensaries in u s allowed to operate openly by city officials even though in violation of both state and federal law compassionate use act of 1996 in california following success of proposition p and other local initiatives medical cannabis advocates turned attention towards reform efforts at state level a pair of medical cannabis bills was approved by state legislators in 1994 and 1995 however both of these were vetoed by governor pete wilson frustrated by these vetoes medical cannabis advocates took issue directly to voters collecting 775 000 signatures for qualification of a statewide ballot initiative in 1996 on november 5 1996 california voters approved proposition 215 compassionate use act of 1996 making state first in nation to legalize medical use of cannabis measure approved with 56 of vote allowed use possession and cultivation of cannabis by patients with a physician s recommendation for treatment of cancer anorexia aids chronic pain spasticity glaucoma arthritis migraine or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief law also allowed patient caregivers to cultivate cannabis and urged lawmakers to facilitate safe and affordable distribution of marijuana passage of proposition 215 was followed by approval of five more medical cannabis ballot initiatives in 1998 washington oregon alaska nevada and district of columbia maine followed in 1999 along with nevada for a second time and colorado in 2000 also in 2000 hawaii became first state to legalize medical cannabis through an act of state legislature d c medical cannabis approved delayed 1998 in 1998 washington d c residents approved initiative 59 to legalize medical use of cannabis but a series of amendments introduced by rep bob barr and approved by congress prevented its implementation for over a decade initial barr amendment was enacted prior to november 1998 election but after ballots had been printed thereby allowing d c residents to vote on initiative but preventing results from being made public amendment was challenged in court by american civil liberties union on grounds that it violated first amendment rights and in september 1999 u s district court judge richard w roberts agreed overturning barr amendment rep barr then introduced a similar amendment which became law in november 1999 setting off a long legal battle until finally in december 2009 barr amendment was removed from annual d c appropriations bill allowing original 1998 ballot initiative to move forward rep barr who left congress in 2003 helped lobby for defeat of legislation he originally authored having reversed his earlier opposition to medical use of cannabis conant v mccaffrey 2000 after proposition 215 passed clinton administration reiterated its firm opposition to medical use of cannabis and threatened to revoke prescription writing abilities of doctors who recommend or prescribe drug additionally threats were made by administration to criminally prosecute physicians and ban them from participating in medicare and medicaid a group of physicians challenged this policy as a violation of first amendment rights and in september 2000 prevailed in case conant v mccaffrey which affirmed right of physicians to recommend but not prescribe cannabis as a result cannabis must be recommended instead of prescribed in all states where its medical use has been legalized ogden memo 2009 in october 2009 ogden memo was issued by justice department advising u s attorneys to only prosecute medical cannabis providers who violate state law or engage in other federally illegal activity such as money laundering or illegal use of firearms memo did not have effect that many expected however as raids on medical cannabis providers actually increased in frequency following its release prompted by public outcry and requests for clarification from numerous elected officials a new memo was issued by deputy attorney general james m cole in june 2011 2011 cole memo insisted that 2009 ogden memo was being adhered to and that ogden memo s protections applied only to individual patients and not commercial operations crackdown on medical cannabis continued following release of 2011 memo but was tempered somewhat by issuance of a new cole memo in 2013 which advised a more deferential approach towards states similar in nature to how 2009 ogden memo was widely interpreted rohrabacher farr amendment 2014 in response to increased raids on medical cannabis providers congress passed rohrabacher farr amendment in 2014 to prohibit federal prosecution of individuals acting in accordance with state medical cannabis laws amendment passed house by a 219 189 vote in may 2014 and was signed into law in december as part of an omnibus spending bill it was renewed following a 242 186 house vote in 2015 and has since been included in a long series of spending bills approved by congress after amendment s 2014 enactment justice department initially continued to prosecute medical cannabis providers based on a new interpretation of amendment that was being employed u s district judge charles breyer ruled against doj in october 2015 however stating that interpretation defies language and logic and tortures plain meaning of statute and was counterintuitive and opportunistic ninth circuit court of appeals similarly rejected doj s arguments in an august 2016 ruling non medical use shafer commission 1972 following passage of comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act of 1970 a commission was formed under decree of act to study rising use of cannabis in america and subsequently make policy recommendations formally known as national commission on marihuana and drug abuse shafer commission led by former pennsylvania governor raymond p shafer determined in its march 1972 report to president and congress that societal harms caused by cannabis were limited and recommended removal of criminal penalties for possession and distribution of small amounts of drug although no federal reforms resulted report s findings helped influence passage of decriminalization laws in a number of states during 1970s california marijuana initiative 1972 in 1972 california became first state to vote on a ballot measure attempting to legalize cannabis proposition 19 california marijuana initiative sought to legalize use possession and cultivation of cannabis but did not allow for commercial sale it was ultimately defeated by a wide margin 33 67 but supporters were encouraged by results which provided momentum to other reform efforts in california in subsequent years first wave of decriminalization 1973 1978 in 1973 oregon became first state to decriminalize cannabis reducing penalty for up to one ounce to a 100 fine states that decriminalized in following years were alaska 1975 maine 1975 colorado 1975 california 1975 ohio 1975 minnesota 1976 mississippi 1977 new york 1977 north carolina 1977 and nebraska 1978 norml was actively involved in helping to pass these laws lobbying in support of legislation and paying for decriminalization proponents including members of shafer commission to travel to various states to testify some cities also passed decriminalization laws in 1970s such as ann arbor in 1972 and madison in 1977 additionally san francisco voters approved a non binding measure in 1978 to effectively legalize cannabis but mayor george moscone was assassinated shortly afterwards and initiative was subsequently disregarded ravin v state 1975 ravin v state was a 1975 decision by alaska supreme court that held alaska constitution s right to privacy protects an adult s ability to use and possess a small amount of cannabis in home for personal use alaska supreme court thereby became first and only state or federal court to announce a constitutional privacy right that protects some level of cannabis use and possession this policy of effective legalization remained in place until it was overridden by a 1990 ballot initiative that cannabis in state second wave of decriminalization 2000s in 2001 nevada became first state in over two decades to decriminalize cannabis in following years major cities across u s began to either decriminalize cannabis or make enforcement of cannabis laws lowest priority among first cities to do so were seattle 2003 oakland 2004 denver 2005 and san francisco 2006 trend continued with
