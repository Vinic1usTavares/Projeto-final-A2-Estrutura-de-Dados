delayed gratification or deferred gratification describes process that subject undergoes when subject resists temptation of an immediate reward in preference for a later reward generally delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later a growing body of literature has linked ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes including academic success physical health psychological health and social competence a person s ability to delay gratification relates to other similar skills such as patience impulse control self control and willpower all of which are involved in self regulation broadly self regulation encompasses a person s capacity to adapt self as necessary to meet demands of environment delaying gratification is reverse of delay discounting which is preference for smaller immediate rewards over larger but delayed rewards and refers to fact that subjective value of reward decreases with increasing delay to its receipt it is theorized that ability to delay rewards is under control of cognitive affective personality system caps several factors can affect a person s ability to delay gratification cognitive strategies such as use of distracting or cool thoughts can increase delay ability as can neurological factors such as strength of connections in frontal striatal pathway behavioral researchers have focused on contingencies that govern choices to delay reinforcement and have studied how to manipulate those contingencies in order to lengthen delay age plays a role too children under five years old demonstrate a marked lack of delayed gratification ability and most commonly seek immediate gratification a very small difference between males and females suggest that females may be better at delaying rewards ability to wait or seek immediate reinforcement is related to avoidance related behaviors such as procrastination and to other clinical diagnoses such as anxiety attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression sigmund freud founder of psychoanalytic theory discussed ego s role in balancing immediate pleasure driven desires of id with morality driven choices of superego funder and block expanded psychoanalytic research on topic and found that impulsivity or a lack of ego control has a stronger effect on one s ability to delay rewards if a reward is more desirable finally environmental and social factors play a role for example delay is affected by self imposed or external nature of a reward contingency by degree of task engagement required during delay by early mother child relationship characteristics by a person s previous experiences with unreliable promises of rewards e g in poverty and by contemporary sociocultural expectations and paradigms research on animals comprises another body of literature describing delayed gratification characteristics that are not as easily tested in human samples such as ecological factors affecting skill background cognitive affective processing system one well supported theory of self regulation called cognitive affective personality system caps suggests that delaying gratification results from an ability to use cool regulatory strategies i e calm controlled and cognitive strategies over hot regulatory strategies i e emotional impulsive automatic reactions when faced with provocation in hot processing a person thinks intently about object causing temptation and especially about its most appealing elements and is subsequently less able to resist immediate reward use of cool strategies can translate to more control over behavior effective cool strategies involve distraction and restructuring perception of tempting stimulus to make it seem less appealing for example in one study of pre adolescent boys with behavioral problems boys showed a reduction in verbal and physical aggression when they used cool strategies such as looking away or distracting themselves most effective type of distraction seems to be imagining another desirable reward which takes attention away from immediate temptations stanford marshmallow experiment seminal research on delayed gratification now famous marshmallow experiment was conducted by walter mischel in 1960s and 1970s at stanford university mischel and his colleagues were interested in strategies that preschool children used to resist temptation they presented four year olds with a marshmallow and told children that they had two options 1 ring a bell at any point to summon experimenter and eat marshmallow or 2 wait until experimenter returned about 15 minutes later and earn two marshmallows message was small reward now bigger reward later some children broke down and ate marshmallow whereas others were able to delay gratification and earn coveted two marshmallows in follow up experiments mischel found that children were able to wait longer if they used certain cool distraction techniques covering their eyes hiding under desk singing songs or imagining pretzels instead of marshmallow in front of them or if they changed way they thought about marshmallow focusing on its similarity to a cotton ball rather than on its gooey delectable taste children who waited longer when re evaluated as teenagers and adults demonstrated a striking array of advantages over their peers as teenagers they had higher sat scores social competence self assuredness and self worth and were rated by their parents as more mature better able to cope with stress more likely to plan ahead and more likely to use reason they were less likely to have conduct disorders or high levels of impulsivity aggressiveness and hyperactivity as adults high delayers were less likely to have drug problems or other addictive behaviors get divorced or be overweight each minute that a preschooler was able to delay gratification translated to a 2 reduction in body mass index 30 years later each of these positive outcomes requires some ability to forgo short term reward in favor of a higher payoff in future ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection in a 20 year follow up of marshmallow experiment individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self esteem and self worth and more adaptive coping skills in comparison to individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four year olds these compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings forty years after first marshmallow test studies neuroimaging data has shed light on neural correlates of delayed gratification a team led by b j casey of cornell university recruited 59 of original participants who are now in their mid 40s and gave them a delayed gratification task instead of resisting marshmallows these adults were instructed to suppress responses to images of happy faces but not to neutral or fearful faces those who had been high delayers as pre schoolers were more successful at controlling their impulses in response to emotional faces i e not pressing button in response to happy faces suggesting that high delayers continued to show better ability to dampen or resist impulses casey and colleagues also scanned brains of 26 participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri as they completed task researchers hypothesized that high delayers would be more likely to use cool regulation strategies to control their responses which would manifest as activation of right prefrontal cortex whereas low delayers would use hot strategies which would activate ventral striatum an area also linked to addiction indeed results showed this differential brain activity this mirrors other fmri research of delayed gratification conducted by noah and jeremy gray of yale university demonstrating that individuals who chose larger delayed rewards over smaller immediate rewards in hypothetical situations showed greater brain activation in anterior prefrontal cortex factors affecting one s ability neurocognitive factors way that a person frames a situation heavily influences a decision s outcome research on hot and cool strategies suggests that when children cognitively represent what they are waiting for as a real reward by focusing on reward s arousing hot qualities taste smell sound feel etc their self control and delay of gratification decreases while directing attention to a symbol of reward by focusing on its abstract cool qualities shape color number etc can enhance self control and increase delay optimal self control and longest delay to gratification can be achieved by directing attention to a competing item especially arousing hot qualities of a competing item for example delays are increased when thinking about taste and smell of popcorn while waiting to eat candy this illustrates an individual s ability to manipulate his her cognitive representation of external stimuli for goal directed purposes delaying gratification is same as controlling impulse for immediate gratification which requires cognitive control ventral striatum located in midbrain is part of limbic system that is reward center as well as a pleasure center limbic system will always react to potential for instant pleasure to override this instinct prefrontal cortex which is also associated with reasoning and rational thought must be active prefrontal cortex is also part of brain that determines focus of a person s attention which enables a better framing that facilitates delayed gratification during adolescence and early adulthood prefrontal cortex develops and matures to become more complicated and connected with rest of brain older children and adults find deferment of gratification tasks easier than do young children for this reason however relative ability to defer gratification remains stable throughout development children who can better control impulses grow up to be adults who also have better control practicing deferred gratification is quite beneficial to cognitive abilities throughout life behavioral factors behaviorists focus on acquisition and teaching of delayed gratification and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay behavior analysts capitalize on effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on person s current behavior which promotes learning a delay of gratification it is important to note that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed reward must have some value to participant without a reward that is meaningful providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose as reward is not a strong reinforcer of desired behavior behavior theorists see delaying gratification as an adaptive skill it has been shown that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior such as sharing and positive peer interactions for example students who learn to delay gratification are better able to complete their assigned activities to put it simply if someone undertakes an activity with promise of a delayed reward after task s completion becomes more likely behavioral researchers have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether reward is negative or positive reinforcement a past study by et al focused on an experiment where main concentrations were time added to both conditions and preference of participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time 15 30 60 and 90 seconds buttons to turn off noise were manipulated by one button turning off noise for a short amount of time and other turning noise off for an extended time participants were found to be more willing to turn off noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for 120 seconds after a 60 second delay was issued findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time individual thresholds for delay in a 2011 study researchers tested to see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of hypothetical money that they could receive presently or telling them they could wait a month for more money results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended on amount of money being offered but also showed wide individual variation in threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo immediate reward subjective value of a reward can also stem from way one describes potential reward as prospect theory states people are heavily loss averse people tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain duration of time delay duration of time until an eventual reward also affects participants choice of immediate or delayed gratification a 2001 study demonstrated that if a reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time such as 180 300 months 15 25 years monetary amount of reward is inconsequential instead bulk of participants choose immediate reward even if their delayed reward would be quite large delayed gratification has its limits and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth effort it takes to wait behavioral training applications in classroom settings in a year 3 elementary classroom in south wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan was put into place study gave limits on numbers of questions children could ask and if they did not exceed limit they were given tokens for rewards token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification by way of cool processing instead of having girls focus on attention seeking behaviors that distracted teacher and students teacher had them focus on how many questions they had and if they needed to ask for help from teacher they also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on final reward which increased their delays by giving children this goal and promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior girls dropped their rate of question asking and attention seeking applications to adhd compared to neurotypical children those with adhd generally demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more than by frequency of reward and effort to obtain it however researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through implementation of a simple self control training procedure in which reinforcer immediacy competes with frequency quantity or saliency of reward and delay is gradually increased one study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with adhd in another study three children diagnosed with adhd and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation of quality of and by systematically increasing delay with a changing criterion design post assessment of children illustrated that self control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference across lifespan at birth infants are unable to wait for their wants and needs to be met and exhibit a defining lack of impulse control with age developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification developmental psychologists study progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over lifespan including deficiencies in development that are closely related to attention deficits and behavior problems effects of age children under five years old display least effective strategies for delaying gratification such as looking at reward and thinking about its arousing features by 5 years old most children are able to demonstrate better self control by recognizing counter productivity of focusing on reward five year olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self instructions to remind themselves of contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value between 8 and 13 years old children develop cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from reward and thereby increase delay once delaying strategies are developed capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood preschoolers performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing which parallels corresponding development of willpower and fronto striatal circuit neural pathways that connect frontal lobe to other brain regions declines in self regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward delaying strategies specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies effects of gender throughout 33 studies on gender differences a small significant effect r 06 has been found indicating that a base rate of 10 more females are able to delay rewards than males which is typical percentage of difference found between sexes on measures such as personality or social behavior this effect may be related to slight gender differences found in delay discounting i e minimizing value of a delayed reward and higher levels of impulsivity and inattention in boys further studies are needed to analyze if this minute difference begins at a certain age e g puberty or if it has a stable magnitude throughout lifespan some researchers suggest this gender difference may correspond with a mother s tendency to sacrifice her wants and needs in order to meet those of her child more frequently than a father does clinical factors contemporary clinical psychology perspectives self control has been called master virtue by clinical and social psychologists suggesting that ability to delay gratification plays a critical role in a person s overall psychological adjustment people with better ability to delay gratification report higher wellbeing self esteem and openness to experience as well as more productive ways of responding to anger and other provocations early delay ability has been shown to protect against development of a variety of emotional vulnerabilities later in life such as aggression and features of borderline personality disorder meanwhile many maladaptive coping skills that characterize mental illness entail a difficulty delaying gratification tendency to choose short term rewards at expense of longer term benefits permeates many forms of psychopathology a growing body of research suggests that self control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice in other words self control abilities are malleable a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill in psychotherapy treatment for impulse control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification in anxiety disorders this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation which is very uncomfortable at first but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person s mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist urge to escape situation early on to shed insight on tradeoff between short and long term gains therapists might also help individuals construct a pro con list of a certain behavior with sections for short term and long term outcomes for maladaptive coping behaviors such as self injury substance use or avoidance there are generally no long term pros meanwhile abstinence from acting on a harmful urge i e delayed gratification generally results in long term benefits this realization can be a powerful impetus for change externalizing disorders externalizing disorders i e acting out disorders show a clearer link to delayed gratification since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control for example attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents as are substance abuse gambling and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults in a 2010 study teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis a 2011 study found that contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without adhd was no longer significant after statistically controlling for iq in other words adhd was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond influence of iq this may stem from high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification and suggests that tie between delayed gratification and adhd could benefit from more investigation internalizing disorders difficulty delaying gratification also plays a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression a hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety provoking situations by seeking immediate relief that comes with avoidance a person is succumbing to pull of instant gratification over larger reward from overcoming fear and anxiety that caused avoidance procrastination which is often a reflection of anxiety is a clear example a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead obsessive compulsive disorder ocd is a more jarring case of this anxiety related struggle to delay gratification someone with ocd is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate torture of obsessive thoughts even though these compulsions do not banish obsessions in long run one experiment however did not find any significant differences between samples with ocd and healthy controls in delayed gratification while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive compulsive personality disorder depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification though direction of cause and effect is not clear a depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is deliberately or not prioritizing short term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification there is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self harm i e cut themselves are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly psychoanalytic drives and impulses sigmund freud viewed struggle to delay gratification as a person s efforts to overcome instinctive libidinal drive of id according to classic psychoanalytic theory a person s psyche is composed of id ego and superego id is driven by pleasure principle it wants physical pleasure and it wants it now ego operating under reality principle serves to moderate id s desire for instant gratification against superego which is guided by a person s internalized sense of morality according to psychoanalytic theory a person with difficulty delaying gratification is plagued by conflict ego cannot adequately regulate battle between id and superego and experiences psychological distress often in form of anxiety or neurosis other psychoanalytic researchers describe a more nuanced and less universally positive view of delayed gratification david c funder and jack block theorized that a person s tendency to delay or not delay gratification is just one element of a broader construct called ego control defined as a person s ability to modulate or control impulses ego control ranges from ego undercontrol at one end to ego overcontrol at other according to funder these tendencies are thought to be relatively stable in each individual such that someone who tends toward undercontrol will grab whatever rewards are immediately available even at cost of long term gain and someone who tends toward overcontrol will delay or even forgo pleasures even when they can be had without cost by this view delay of gratification may be adaptive in certain settings but inappropriate or even costly in other settings funder and block draw a distinction between ego control model in which delayed gratification is seen as a general tendency to contain motivational impulses whether or not it is adaptive in a specific instance and ego resiliency model supported by mischel s research in which delayed gratification is seen as a skill that arises only when it is adaptive to tease apart these models funder and block explored association between ego control ego resiliency iq and delayed gratification in adolescents adolescents had choice between being paid 4 at each of six study sessions or delaying their payment until last session in which case they would also earn an addition 4 of interest results supported both models of delayed gratification teens tendency to delay gratification was indeed associated with iq and with ego resiliency e g higher delayers were rated as more responsible consistent likable sympathetic generous less hostile moody self indulgent rebellious but was also independently associated with ego control e g higher delayers were rated as tends toward over control of needs and impulses and favors conservative values in a number of areas researchers noted that individual differences in ego control i e overall impulsivity may play a larger role in delayed gratification when incentives are larger and more motivating writing in 1998 funder described delayed gratification as a mixed bag he concluded participants who exhibited most delay were not just better at self control but in a sense they seemed unable to avoid it delayers are in general smart and well adjusted but they also tend to be somewhat and unnecessarily inhibited environmental and social factors who is in control factors affecting one s ability to delay gratification depend on whether delay contingency is self imposed delay can be terminated at will of person waiting or externally imposed by another person institution or circumstance when contingency is self imposed physical presence of reward seems to aid in delaying gratification on other hand when delay is externally imposed children are not able to wait as long when reward is present suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances task engagement engaging in work or an assigned task can generate an effective distraction from a reward and enable a person to wait for a longer delay as long as reward is not being flaunted having reward present during work and easily accessible creates a negative frustration akin to teasing rather than providing motivation for example a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his her homework will be less motivated to wait for his her turn for recess another factor work and task engagement adds to delay of gratification is that if work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it then attention to reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to work rather than a motivation to finish it mother child relationship more positive emotions and behavior that a 12 to 24 month old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent better s he is 3 5 years later at using cooling strategies in order to delay gratification this suggests that emotional skills and processes required for coping with social and interpersonal frustrations are similar to those utilized for coping with aggravation of goal directed delay of gratification maternal attachment also influences development of a child s ability to delay gratification an interaction has been found between a mother s level of control and how close a child stays to mother while exploring environment children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer similarly children who stay close to a non controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays this suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown a greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self regulation when child was a toddler indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for development of self regulation self control and emotional competency reliability of gratification researchers have investigated whether reliability of reward affects one s ability to delay gratification reliability of reward refers to how well reward received matches what person was expecting or promised in terms of quality and quantity for example researchers told children that they would receive better art supplies if they waited after children successfully waited for reward better supplies could not be found and so they had to use crayons and stickers that were in poor shape comparing these children to ones who received their promised rewards reliably revealed different results on subsequent marshmallow tests measuring delayed gratification children who had learned that researcher s promise was unreliable quickly succumbed to eating marshmallow waiting only an average of three minutes conversely children who had learned that researcher was reliable were able to wait an average of 12 minutes with many of them waiting full 15 minutes for researcher to return in order to double reward to two marshmallows genetics and evolution evolutionary theory can argue against selection of deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior one such cost is basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting while waiting individuals lose time that could be used to find other food seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage there are also two risks associated with being patient first there is a risk that another animal might get to food first also known as an interruption risk second there is risk that chance to get reward will be cut short perhaps by a predator also known as a termination risk these costs and risks create situations in which fitness of individual is threatened there are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in real world for example animals that eat fruit have option of eating unripe fruit right away or waiting delaying gratification until it becomes ripe interruption risk plays a part here because if individual forgoes unripe fruit there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first also in extractive foraging such as with nuts and shellfish outer shell creates a delay however animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage it is likely that there is a strong genetic component to deferred gratification though no direct link has been established since many complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform simplest tasks it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior for this same reason multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification further research is necessary to discover genetic to delayed gratification animal studies delayed gratification or deferred gratification is an animal behavior that can be linked to delay discounting ecological factors individual fitness and neurobiological mechanisms research for this behavior has been conducted with animals such as capuchin monkeys tamarins marmosets rats and pigeons delay discounting when animals are faced with a choice to either wait for a reward or receive a reward right away discounting of reward is hyperbolic as length of time of waiting for a reward increases reward is discounted at a gradual rate empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging discounting can also be related to risk sensitivity of animals rather than relating risk to delay risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting in a study conducted by haden and platt macaque monkeys were given choice of a medium reward that they knew they would receive versus a more risky choice riskier choice would reward monkey with a large reward fifty percent of time and a small reward other fifty percent ultimate payoff was same but monkeys preferred riskier choice they speculated that monkeys did not see their action as risky but rather as a large delayed reward they reasoned that monkeys viewed large reward as certain if they did not get large reward first time around they would eventually get it but at a longer delay to test for this theory they gave same test while varying time between opportunities to choose a reward they found that as interval increased number of times that monkeys chose more risky reward decreased while this occurred in macaque monkeys varying interval time did not affect pigeons choices in another study this suggests that research looking into varying risk sensitivity of different species is needed when provided a choice between a small short delay reward and a large long delay reward there is an impulsive preference for former additionally as delay time for small short and large long reward increases there is a shift in preference toward larger delayed reward this evidence only supports hyperbolic discounting not exponential ecological factors although predicting reward preference seems simple when using empirical models there are a number of ecological factors that seem to affect delayed gratification behavior of animals in real world situations discounting makes sense because of inherent uncertainty of future payoffs one study looked at how reward discounting is context specific by differing time and space between small and large rewards they were able to test how these factors affected decision making in tamarins and marmosets they showed that tamarins will travel longer distances for larger food rewards but will not wait as long as marmosets conversely marmosets will wait longer but will not travel as far they then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to normal feeding behavior of species tamarins feed over large distances looking for insects capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action marmosets on other hand eat tree sap which takes more time to secrete but does not require that marmosets to cover large distances physiological similarities between humans and other animals especially primates have led to more comparative research between two groups future research with animal models then can expand our own understanding of how people make decisions about instant versus delayed gratification in real world see also time preference economic analysis of delayed gratification preferences references category consumer behaviour category psychological adjustment category
