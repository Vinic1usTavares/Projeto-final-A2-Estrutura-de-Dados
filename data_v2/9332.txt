that year he was also appointed custos of pontifical college at sant isidoro a capo le case home of irish franciscans in rome egan remained there until 1790 when he returned to ireland and was appointed custos of ennis he remained in ireland until 1787 or 1788 when he may have made a visit to united states after several more years as a missionary in ireland egan came or returned to united states in 1802 priest in pennsylvania accepting an invitation from catholics near lancaster pennsylvania egan arrived in united states in january 1802 to serve as assistant pastor to louis de barth at conewago chapel in adams county when state legislature sat in lancaster that year word of egan s preaching abilities traveled back to philadelphia and soon parishioners of that city s st mary s church petitioned bishop john carroll of baltimore to send egan to them at that time bishop of baltimore had jurisdiction over entire catholic church in united states in 1803 egan became one of pastors of st mary s church at philadelphia move coincided with a yellow fever outbreak in philadelphia though less virulent than philadelphia s famous 1793 outbreak of disease there were nonetheless many deaths and egan presided over many funerals that year st mary s had 77 interments between june and november 1803 in 1804 egan received permission to establish a province of franciscans in united states for first time independent of irish franciscans who were then supervising american mission two years later a parishioner willed egan some land along yellow creek in indiana county for establishment of a franciscan church due to order s vows of poverty egan asked carroll to hold land in his name egan s dream was never realized as he was unable to attract franciscans from europe to establish planned church egan and trustees of st mary s established a singing school in 1804 with goal of improving quality of choir there following year was consumed by another yellow fever outbreak and egan joined john rossiter pastor of another of philadelphia s four catholic churches st joseph s in ministering to sick in 1806 they worked with parishioners of a third church holy trinity to found an orphanage as problem of orphaned children had been made worse by yellow fever deaths bishop of philadelphia ordination thumb st mary s church in philadelphia served as egan s pro cathedral catholic population in united states was growing and bishop john carroll had for some time wished for his vast diocese to be divided into more manageable territories on april 8 1808 pope pius vii granted carroll s request erecting four new sees in united states and elevating baltimore to an archdiocese among new sees was diocese of philadelphia which included states of pennsylvania and delaware as well as western and southern parts of new jersey even before diocese was created carroll had determined to recommend egan for post writing to rome that egan was truly pious learned religious remarkable for his great humility but deficient perhaps in firmness and without great experience in direction of affairs as a result of disruptions caused by napoleonic wars papal bull nominating egan did not reach united states until 1810 when it arrived egan traveled to st peter s pro cathedral in baltimore where he was ordained bishop by carroll assisted by benedict joseph and jean louis de who had been appointed to bishoprics but had not yet been consecrated egan chose st mary s to serve as his pro cathedral in philadelphia even before egan s installation philadelphia catholics began to raise funds to expand church in accordance with its new prominence in diocese after their ordinations new bishops planned a council of american church leadership for near future in fact they did not meet until 1829 long after egan s death trusteeism dispute egan s elevation to episcopate worsened an existing conflict in american church dispute over trusteeism in europe church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through clergy in united states however early catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased property and erected church buildings laypeople accordingly demanded some control over administration of parish even after arrival of clergy from europe who like egan held traditional view of parish organization dispute also had nationalist elements to it as heavily german parish of holy trinity resented imposition of an irish bishop instead of one of their own when holy trinity s pastor left for a new assignment in maryland in 1811 trustees there were perturbed at egan s temporary appointment of an irish priest patrick kenny to lead parish until a german priest could be found a german priest francis roloff was assigned following year egan s own research into issue showed that trustees had conveyed st mary s church to previous pastor robert harding and then to his heirs but trustees did not consider that property transfer to have extinguished their role in church s leadership by 1811 egan s worsening health caused him to accept assistance of two priests at st mary s james harold and his nephew william vincent harold egan and trustees became further embroiled in a dispute about clerical salaries a situation possibly made worse by decline in shipping income in port city caused by outbreak of war of 1812 egan also came to believe harolds were making situation worse by taking pro clergy positions that were more extreme than egan s own and by younger harold s scheming to be named egan s coadjutor bishop he appealed to trustees for compromise and offered to bring his cousin also a priest over from ireland to replace elder harold by 1813 egan and trustees had reconciled and together resolved to remove harolds who agreed to resign later that year and relocate to england death and burial although main complaints between bishop and trustees were resolved some salary disputes lingered into 1813 conditions at st mary s worsened in 1814 with election of new trustees who were more in conflict with egan than previous ones elsewhere in diocese egan was more successful in about 1811 he made his most extensive visitation of his diocese travelling as far west as pittsburgh after stopping in lancaster and conewago he continued to raise funds for catholic orphanage and opened a new parish sacred heart in trenton new jersey in 1813 bringing total number of churches in diocese to sixteen egan s health continued to decline and he died on july 22 1814 while 19th century chroniclers suggest that it may be said in all truth that bishop egan died of a broken heart modern biographers believe his health troubles more closely resembled tuberculosis egan was buried in st mary s churchyard in 1869 after construction of cathedral basilica of saints peter and paul on logan square his remains were removed there and reburied in a crypt along with those of his successor in see of philadelphia henry conwell conwell egan
