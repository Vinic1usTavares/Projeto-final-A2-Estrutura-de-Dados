candidate joseph raseta won 21 475 votes and padesm candidate won 19 014 votes role during and after malagasy uprising in early 1947 french administration instituted a new rule that increased weight of french vote over malagasy vote in selection of candidates and three padesm candidates favored by french conservatives were successfully elected to conseil de la republique results of election and popular discontent with french interference served to intensify widespread frustration against colonial authority and desire for malagasy self governance across island these factors finally erupted in a nationalist uprising that began on evening of 29 march 1947 with attacks against a police camp and several french plantations in eastern rainforest carried out by militant malagasy nationalists chief among them members of nationalist secret societies vy vvs and despite role of militants in leading uprising colonial authorities immediately accused mdrm of instigating movement this view was echoed by padesm leaders and shared by majority of french settlers french authorities responded by targeting not only mdrm leaders and members but also their supporters drawing wider population into conflict attacks against colonial authority in east were immediately followed by similar actions in south of island before rapidly spreading throughout country movement enjoyed particularly strong support in south where revolt attracted as many as one million peasants to fight for nationalist cause french responded with heavy military action and psychological warfare including incidences of crimes against humanity between july and september 1948 most of key leaders of uprising were captured or killed and last of fighters disbanded and fled into forests in december 1948 eruption of

suit allowing tantalizing opportunity for padesm to wield unfettered power in malagasy politics this emerging possibility fragmented party which became paralyzed by in fighting progressive faction
