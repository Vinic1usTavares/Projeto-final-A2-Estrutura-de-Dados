thumb figure 1 waveguide slotted line slotted lines are used for microwave measurements and consist of a movable probe inserted into a slot in a transmission line they are used in conjunction with a microwave power source and usually in keeping with their low cost application a low cost schottky diode detector and vswr meter rather than an expensive microwave power meter slotted lines can measure standing waves wavelength and with some calculation or plotting on smith charts a number of other parameters including reflection coefficient and electrical impedance a precision variable attenuator is often incorporated in test setup to improve accuracy this is used to make level measurements while detector and vswr meter are retained only to mark a reference point for attenuator to be set to thus eliminating entirely detector and meter measurement errors parameter most commonly measured by a slotted line is swr this serves as a measure of accuracy of impedance match to item under test this is especially important for transmitting antennas and their feed lines high standing wave ratio on a radio or tv antenna can distort signal increase transmission line loss and potentially damage components in transmission path possibly even transmitter slotted lines are no longer widely used but can still be found in budget applications their main drawback is that they are labour intensive to use and require calculation tables or plotting to make use of results they need to be made with mechanical precision and probe and its detector need to be adjusted with care but they can give very accurate results description slotted line is one of basic instruments used in radio frequency test and measurement at microwave frequencies it consists of a precision transmission line usually co axial but waveguide implementations are also used with a movable insulated probe inserted into a longitudinal slot cut into line in a co axial slotted line slot is cut into outer conductor of line probe is inserted past outer conductor but not so far that it touches inner conductor in a rectangular waveguide slot is usually cut along centre of broad wall of waveguide circular waveguide slotted lines are also possible multiple sources slotted lines are relatively h lee even describes a microstrip slotted line for use up to that he claims can be made for less than 10 he calls this a cost reduction over price of a network analyser that is its cost is 10 000 times less than an analyser costing 100 000 lee pages xv 268 271 and can perform many of measurements done by more expensive equipment such as network analysers however slotted line measurement techniques are more labour intensive and often do not directly output desired parameter some calculation or plotting is frequently required in particular they can only carry out a measurement at one spot frequency at a time so producing a plot of a parameter versus frequency is very time consuming this is to be compared to modern instruments like network and spectrum analysers which are intrinsically frequency swept and produce a plot instantly slotted lines have now largely been superseded but are still found where capital costs are an issue their remaining uses are mostly in millimetre band where modern test apparatus is either prohibitively expensive or not available at all and with academic laboratories and hobbyists they are also useful as a teaching aid as user is more directly exposed to basic line phenomena than with more sophisticated instruments multiple sources operation slotted line works by sampling electric field inside transmission line with probe for accuracy it is important that probe disturbs field as little as possible for this reason probe diameter and slot width are kept small usually around and probe is inserted in no further than necessary it is also necessary in waveguide slotted lines to place slot at a position where current in waveguide walls is parallel to slot current will then not be disturbed by presence of slot as long as it is not too wide for dominant mode this is on centre line of broad face of waveguide but for some other modes it may need to be off centre this is not an issue for co axial line because this operates in tem transverse electromagnetic mode and hence current is everywhere parallel to slot slot may be tapered at its ends to avoid discontinuities causing reflections multiple sources disturbance to field inside line caused by insertion of probe is minimised as far as possible there are two parts to this disturbance first part is due to power probe has extracted from line and manifests as a lumped equivalent circuit of a resistor this is minimised by limiting distance probe is inserted into line so that only enough power is extracted for detector to operate effectively second part of disturbance is due to energy stored in field around probe and manifests as a lumped equivalent of a capacitor this capacitance can be cancelled out with an inductance of equal and opposite impedance lumped inductors are not practical at microwave frequencies instead an adjustable stub with an inductive equivalent circuit is used to tune out probe capacitance result is an equivalent circuit of a high impedance in shunt across line which has little effect on transmitted power in line probe is more sensitive as a result of this tuning and distance it is inserted can be further limited as a result voltmer page 148 test setup 320 px thumb figure 2 a test setup using a waveguide slotted line thumb figure 3 co axial slotted line a typical test setup with a waveguide slotted line is shown in figure 2 referring to this figure power from a test equipment source not shown enters apparatus through co axial cable on left and is converted to waveguide format by means of a launcher 1 this is followed by a section of waveguide 2 providing a transition to a smaller size of guide an important component in setup is isolator 3 which prevents power being reflected back into source depending on test conditions such reflections can be large and a high power source may be damaged by returning wave power entering slotted line is controlled by a rotary variable attenuator 4 this is followed by slotted line itself 5 above which is probe mounted on a movable carriage carriage also carries probe adjustments 6 is probe depth adjustment 7 is a length of co axial section with tuning adjustments and 8 is a detector which uses either a point contact crystal rectifier or a schottky barrier diode h c torrey c a whitmer crystal rectifiers new york mcgraw hill 1948 right hand end of slotted line is terminated in a matched load 9 which absorbs all power exiting end of waveguide load can be replaced by component or system that it is desired to test it can also be replaced with a reference short circuit 10 which is used to calibrate slotted line carriage can be moved along slotted line by means of a rotary knob 11 which simultaneously moves a vernier gauge 12 for accurate measurement of probes position along line das das pages 496 498 probe is connected to a detector and a display meter not shown in figure 2 these can be respectively a thermistor and power meter or an envelope detector and vswr meter detector can be a crystal detector or a schottky barrier diode detector is mounted on probe assembly usually a distance l 4l customary symbol for wavelength it is usually most convenient to give distances on transmission lines in terms of wavelengths of transmitted wave or sometimes when distance involved is small or not an exact multiple of a quarter wavelength in radians where th radians from probe tip as shown in figure 3 this is because detector looks almost like a short circuit to transmission line and this distance will convert it to an open circuit through quarter wave impedance transformer effect thus detector has minimal effect on loading line probe tuning stub can be seen on figure 3 branching from line linking probe to detector figure 2 has a slightly different arrangement main probe into waveguide leads to a vertical co axial tuning and adjustment section but detector is on a horizontal side section with a secondary probe into upright co axial section das das pages 496 497 measurements measurements of microwave power can be made directly usually with a thermistor based detector and meter however these instruments are expensive and a common meter used in measurements with a slotted line is instead a cheaper low frequency vswr meter microwave power source is amplitude modulated with typically a signal which is recovered by envelope detector in probe and sent to vswr meter this scheme is preferred to simply detecting unmodulated carrier directly which would result in a dc output because a stable narrowband tuned amplifier can be used to amplify signal a large amplification is required in vswr meter because limit of square law law of a detector diode range over which output voltage is proportional to square of carrier voltage on line of detector diode is no more than multiple sources maxima and minima thumb figure 4 standing wave patterns on a line for various reflection coefficients showing maxima and minima when slotted line is terminated with a precision matching load there is no variation in detected power along line other than a very small decrease due to losses in line however when this is replaced by a device under test dut which is not perfectly matched to line there will be a reflection back towards source this causes a standing wave to be set up on line with periodic maxima and minima collectively extrema due to alternating constructive and destructive interference these extrema are found by moving probe back and forth along line and level at that point can then be measured on meter gupta pages 113 114 extrema are not of any great interest in themselves but are used in calculation of several more useful parameters some of these parameters require measurement of exact position of extremum either maxima or minima can equally be used from a mathematical point of view but minima are preferred because they are always much sharper than maxima especially for large reflections as shown in figure 4 additionally probe causes less disturbance to field near a minimum than it does near a maximum voltmer pages 147 148 wavelength wavelength is determined by measuring distance between two adjacent minima this distance will be l 2 there is no need for a dut better results are obtained with reference short in position multiple sources standing wave ratio standing wave ratio swr or vswr is a basic parameter and one most commonly measured on a slotted line this quantity is of particular importance for transmitter antennae a high swr indicates a poor match between feed line and antenna which increases wasted power can cause damage to components in transmission path possibly including transmitter and cause distortion to tv fm stereo and digital signals with input power set so that maxima are at 0 dbm a measurement of a minimum in decibels will directly give swr after discarding minus sign gupta pages 112 113 reflection coefficient reflection coefficient r is ratio of reflected wave to incident wave in general it is a complex number magnitude of reflection coefficient can be calculated from vswr measurement by where vswr is standing wave ratio expressed as a voltage ratio not in decibels however to completely characterise reflection coefficient phase of r must also be found this is done on a slotted line by measuring distance of first minimum from dut moving probe right up to dut is not practicable so a different approach is usually adopted position of first minimum when reference short is in place is noted distance back along line from this reference point to next minimum when dut is in place will be same as distance from dut to first minimum this is so because reference short guarantees a minimum at dut position multiple sources phase part of r is given by where l is wavelength and x is distance to first minimum as described earlier magnitude and phase representation of r can if required be expressed as real and imaginary parts instead by usual manipulation of complex numbers multiple sources impedance impedance z of dut can be calculated from reflection coefficient by where z0 is characteristic impedance of line an alternative method is to plot vswr and distance to node in wavelengths on a smith chart these quantities are directly measured by slotted line from this plot dut impedance normalised to z0 can be read directly off smith chart multiple sources accuracy considerations good slotted lines are precision made instruments they need to be because mechanical defects can affect accuracy some of mechanical issues that are relevant to this include backlash of vernier concentricity of inner and outer conductor circularity of outer conductor centrality and straightness of inner conductor variations in cross section and ability of carriage to maintain a constant probe depth issues with probe tuning and disturbances to field have already been discussed but insulated spacers holding centre conductor in place can also disturb field consequently these are made as discrete as is compatible with mechanical strength however greatest source of inaccuracy is usually not slotted line itself but characteristics of detector diode lee pages 251 252 detected voltage signal output of schottky barrier diodes typically used in microwave detectors have a square law relationship to power being measured and meters are calibrated accordingly however as power increases diode deviates significantly from a square law and remains accurate up to an output voltage of only around this can be improved a little by adding a load resistor to detector output but this also has undesirable effect of decreasing sensitivity another technique is to reduce range of power being measured so that it is brought within square law range of detector by measuring at a point other than a maximum maximum is then calculated from known mathematical shape of standing wave pattern this has objection that it adds significantly to labour required to make measurements as does technique of precisely calibrating detector and adjusting readings on meter according to a calibration chart lee pages 252 254 it is possible to completely eliminate errors in detector and meter if a precision variable attenuator is used in test setup in this technique a minimum is first found and attenuator adjusted so that meter is indicating precisely some convenient mark a maximum is then found and attenuation increased until meter is indicating same mark amount attenuation had to be increased is vswr of standing wave accuracy here depends on accuracy of attenuator and not at all on detector lee page 253 notes references bibliography connor f r wave transmission edward arnold ltd
