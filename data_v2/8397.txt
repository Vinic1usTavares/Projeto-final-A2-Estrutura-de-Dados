soyuz flight vs22 was a rocket launch conducted by multinational launch service provider arianespace it was sixteenth launch of a soyuz st b launch vehicle and 22nd launch of a soyuz 2 series launch vehicle from ensemble de lancement soyouz at guiana space centre after two scheduling delays and a 33 minute logistical delay rocket lifted off on 4 april 2019 and successfully delivered to medium earth orbit final four satellites in o3b broadband satellite constellation which services latin america africa and oceania after four previous soyuz flights delivered constellation s first sixteen satellites launch increased constellation s throughput by 26 percent flight marked second occasion in which two soyuz 2 launch vehicles were launched on same day occurring hours after launch of progress ms 11 from baikonur cosmodrome rocket launch vehicle used in soyuz flight vs22 was a soyuz st b a variant of soyuz 2 1b which utilizes a 4 1 x 11 4 metre st payload fairing soyuz 2 1b itself is a variant of soyuz 2 family that utilizes a rd 0124 engine for blok i stage rather than older rd 0110 engine used on soyuz 2 1a rd 0124 grants 34 more seconds of specific impulse than its predecessor improving rocket s performance manufactured at progress rocket space centre in samara russia rocket s components had been adapted for warmer climate at guiana space centre kourou its boosters and blok a first stage had also been equipped with pyrotechnic charges to ensure they would sink to sea floor upon impact with ocean in contrast to horizontal payload integration performed on soyuz 2 rockets at baikonur cosmodrome payload is integrated vertically with soyuz st b at kourou via a mobile service tower at ensemble de lancement soyouz els launch pad payload communications satellite services company ses s a was sole customer for soyuz flight vs22 commissioning a launch of four o3b satellites o3b is a broadband satellite constellation in non geostationary orbit which provides fiber like high performance data connectivity services to africa latin america and oceania each satellite weighed around totaling a payload mass of flight vs22 is fifth launch of an o3b satellite cluster previous launches include soyuz flights in june 2013 in july 2014 in december 2014 and in march 2018 launch increased number of satellites in constellation from 16 to 20 improving constellation s bandwidth and performance although it did not significantly increase constellation s coverage area of 50deg north and south of equator designed to operate in ka band each of o3b satellites has a maximum throughput of 10 20 gigabits per second and four satellites launched aboard flight vs22 increased total throughput of constellation by 26 percent launch completed first generation of 20 o3b satellites ses plans to succeed constellation with o3b constellation which will have a total throughput of up to 10 terabits per second satellites carried aboard flight vs22 are 58 61st ses satellites to be commissioned for launch by arianespace they were also 156 159th spacecraft launched by arianespace to be manufactured by thales alenia space and its predecessors flight soyuz flight vs22 was delayed twice from its intended launch date on 26 march 2019 first to 29 march and later to 4 april soyuz st b launch vehicle was rolled out to kourou s els launch pad on 1 april after a 33 minute delay to allow for further checks on ground systems it lifted off at 17 03 37 coordinated universal time utc on 4 april 2019 in an eastward direction over atlantic ocean rocket s boosters and first two stages were expended in ten minutes while fregat upper stage s s5 92 engine fired three times to place fregat and o3b satellites aboard into a near circular medium earth orbit above equator at an altitude of lower orbit roughly twenty times height of international space station iss and a fourth of altitude of typical geostationary satellites allows for decreased latency between satellites and ground satellites were deployed two at a time with first set of satellites deployed at 19 03 utc and second set 22 minutes later at 19 25 utc flight lasted 2 hours and 22 minutes after mission one final burn placed fregat into a controlled decaying orbit flight vs22 was 22nd launch of a soyuz 2 vehicle from kourou since launches from complex began in october 2011 and fourth soyuz 2 launch by arianespace in five months launch frequency of soyuz 2 increased dramatically with vehicle s usage in satellite programme which started with arianespace s previous soyuz flight flight vs22 occurred five and a half hours after launch of a soyuz 2 1a rocket from baikonur that carried progress ms 11 cargo spacecraft to iss marking second time that two soyuz 2 rockets launched on same day launch of first four o3b satellites from kourou and p no 1 from baikonur occurred within two hours of each other on 25 june 2013 see also list of r 7 launches 2015 2019 list of
