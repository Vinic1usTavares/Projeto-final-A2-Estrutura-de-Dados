historian q david bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production but at least two possible candidates exist blair smith was first cameraman of thanhouser company but he was soon joined by carl louis gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer role of cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions only known credit is for marie eline in role of their child other cast credits are unknown but many 1910 thanhouser productions are fragmentary in late 1910 thanhouser company released a list of important personalities in their films list includes g w abbe justus d barnes frank h crane irene crane marie eline violet heming martin j faust thomas fortune george middleton grace moore john w noble anna rosemond mrs george walters a surviving film still gives possibility of identifying most of actors in film it seems that marie eline was so well disguised as a boy that reviewer for nickelodeon was unable to recognize her true gender reviewer state meeting between father and his newsboy child also has a touch of originality and t he child is a fine little actor easily making himself star of piece though this was not lost on reviewer for new york dramatic mirror which stated work of little girl who plays leading role in this film is a constant wonder to spectators eline had proven herself capable of handling male characters with first such credit as a young italian boy in two roses eline would also star as hans in little hero of holland release and reception single reel drama approximately 1 000 feet long was released on october 21 1910 film had a wide national release with theaters showing film in maryland pennsylvania south dakota indiana and kansas in 1917 years after its release it was later approved by pennsylvania state board of censors of moving pictures for viewing without modification film was reviewed positively by trade publications moving picture world stated dramatic qualities of this film are high but subject is somewhat depressing maybe picture will teach lesson that it is better to listen to explanations at first and save all those intervening years of sorrow and suffering it ought to at any rate because that story is plainly wrought out and is apparent as it is possible to make it a review in nickelodeon offered little more than a summary of film but reviewer found subject to be enhanced by attention to detail in production reviewer was also pleased that child was not brought in to serve as in deus ex machina role though lonergan was fond of using technique even new york dramatic mirror gave some praise to production but noted that acting of mother s friend was weakest because a man of his caliber wouldn t have backed off so quickly overall reviewer found acting to be better than narrative itself and concluded that s less sentimental would be much stronger see also list of american films of 1910 references category 1910 films category 1910s drama films category american drama films
