thumb a waterspout near florida two flares with smoke trails near bottom of photograph are for indicating wind direction and general speed a waterspout is an intense columnar vortex usually appearing as a funnel shaped cloud that occurs over a body of water some are connected to a cumulus congestus cloud some to a cumuliform cloud and some to a cumulonimbus cloud in common form it is a non supercell tornado over water what is a waterspout weather channel video waterspout comes ashore in galveston by jessica hamilton houston chronicle july 17 2016 while it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur most waterspouts do not suck up water they are small and weak rotating columns of air over water while waterspouts form mostly in tropics and subtropical areas other areas also report waterspouts including europe australia new zealand great lakes antarctica and on rare occasions great salt lake publisher journals ametsoc org

observed in connection with lake effect snow precipitation bands waterspouts have a five part life cycle formation of a dark spot on water surface spiral pattern on water surface formation of a spray ring development of visible condensation funnel and ultimately decay formation thumb left waterspout filmed off anglesey wales on 12 november 2010 by an raf search and rescue crew waterspouts exist on a microscale where their environment is less than two kilometers in width cloud from which they develop can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus or as great as a supercell while some waterspouts are strong and tornadic in nature most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics they normally develop in moisture laden environments as their parent clouds are in process of development and it is theorized they spin as they move up surface boundary from horizontal shear near surface and then stretch upwards to cloud once low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus cloud or thunderstorm some weak tornadoes known as landspouts have been shown to develop in a similar manner more than one waterspout can occur in same vicinity at same time as many as nine simultaneous waterspouts have been reported on lake michigan types non tornadic thumb left non tornadic waterspouts seen from beach at near hague netherlands on 27 august 2006 waterspouts that are not associated with a rotating updraft of a supercell thunderstorm are known as non tornadic or fair weather waterspouts and are by far most common type fair weather waterspouts occur in coastal waters and are associated with dark flat bottomed developing convective cumulus towers waterspouts of this type rapidly develop and dissipate having life cycles shorter than 20 minutes they usually rate no higher than ef0 on enhanced fujita scale generally exhibiting winds of less than they are most frequently seen in tropical and sub tropical climates with upwards of 400 per year observed in florida keys they typically move slowly if at all since cloud to which they are attached is horizontally static being formed by vertical convective action instead of subduction interaction between colliding fronts fair weather waterspouts are very similar in both appearance and mechanics to landspouts and largely behave as such if they move ashore tornadic thumb left tornadic waterspout on 15 july 2005 off coast of punta gorda florida caused by a severe thunderstorm tornadic waterspouts also accurately referred to as tornadoes over water are formed from mesocyclones in a manner essentially identical to land based tornadoes in connection with severe thunderstorms but simply occurring over water a tornado which travels from land to a body of water would also be considered a tornadic waterspout since vast majority of thunderstorms occur in land locked areas of united states true tornadic waterspouts are correspondingly rarer than their fair weather counterparts in that country however in some areas such as adriatic aegean and ionian seas tornadic waterspouts can make up half of total number thumb right a large winter waterspout over lake ontario just off shore of whitby ontario on 26 january 1994 a winter waterspout also known as a snow devil an an ice devil a or a is an extremely rare instance of a waterspout forming under base of a snow squall term winter waterspout is used to differentiate between common warm season waterspout and this rare winter season event very little is known about this phenomenon and only six known pictures of this event exist to date four of which were taken in ontario canada there are a couple of critical criteria for formation of a winter waterspout very cold temperatures need to be present over a body of water warm enough to produce fog resembling steam above water s surface like more efficient lake effect snow events winds focusing down axis of long lakes enhance wind convergence and likely enhance their development climatology thumb a family of four waterspouts seen on great lakes lake huron on 9 september 1999 thumb four waterspouts seen in florida keys on 5 june 2009 though majority of waterspouts occur in tropics they can seasonally appear in temperate areas throughout world and are common across western coast of europe as well as british isles and several areas of mediterranean and baltic sea they are not restricted to saltwater many have been reported on lakes and rivers including great lakes and st lawrence river waterspouts are fairly common on great lakes during late summer and early fall with a record 66 waterspouts reported over just a seven day period in 2003 they are more frequent within 100 kilometers 60 mi from coast than farther out at sea waterspouts are common along southeast u s coast especially off southern florida and keys and can happen over seas bays and lakes worldwide approximately 160 waterspouts are currently reported per year across europe with netherlands reporting most at 60 followed by spain and italy at 25 and united kingdom at 15 they are most common in late summer in northern hemisphere september has been pinpointed as prime month of formation waterspouts are frequently observed off east coast of australia with several being described by joseph banks during voyage of endeavour in 1770 life cycle there are five stages to waterspout life cycle initially a prominent circular light colored disk appears on surface of water surrounded by a larger dark area of indeterminate shape after formation of these colored disks on water a pattern of light and dark colored spiral bands develop from dark spot on water surface then a dense annulus of sea spray called a cascade appears around dark spot with what appears to be an eye eventually waterspout becomes a visible funnel from water surface to overhead cloud spray vortex can rise to a height of several hundred feet or more and often creates a visible wake and an associated wave train as it moves eventually funnel and spray vortex begin to dissipate as inflow of warm air into vortex weakens ending waterspout s life cycle marine hazard waterspouts have long been recognized as serious marine hazards stronger waterspouts pose threats to watercraft aircraft and people it is recommended to keep a considerable distance from these phenomena and to always be on alert through weather reports united states national weather service will often issue special marine warnings when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters or tornado warnings when waterspouts are expected to move onshore incidents of waterspouts causing severe damage and casualties are rare however there have been several notable examples malta tornado in 1555 was earliest record of a deadly waterspout it struck grand harbour of valletta sinking four galleys numerous boats and claiming hundreds of lives 1851 sicily tornadoes were twin waterspouts that made landfall in western sicily ravaging coast and countryside before ultimately dissipating back again over sea threat to marine animals depending on how fast winds from a waterspout are whipping anything that is within about one yard of surface of water including fish of different sizes frogs and even turtles can be lifted into air a waterspout can sometimes suck small animals such as fish out of water and all way up into cloud even if waterspout stops spinning fish in cloud can be carried over land buffeted up and down and around with cloud s winds until its currents no longer keep flying fish in atmosphere depending on how far they travel and how high they are taken into atmosphere fish are sometimes dead by time they rain down people as far as inland have experienced raining fish fish can also be sucked up from rivers but raining fish is not a common weather phenomenon research and forecasting szilagyi waterspout index swi szilagyi waterspout index swi developed by canadian meteorologist wade szilagyi is used to predict conditions favorable for waterspout development swi ranges from 10 to 10 where values greater than or equal to zero represent conditions favorable for waterspout development international
