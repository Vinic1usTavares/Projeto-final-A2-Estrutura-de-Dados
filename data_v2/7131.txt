parasaurolophus meaning near crested lizard in reference to saurolophus is a genus of herbivorous ornithopod dinosaur that lived in what is now north america and possibly asia during late cretaceous period about 76 5 73 million years ago it was a herbivore that walked both as a biped and as a quadruped three species are universally recognized p walkeri type species p tubicen and short crested p cyrtocristatus additionally a fourth species p jiayensis has been proposed although it is more commonly placed in separate genus charonosaurus remains are known from alberta canada new mexico and utah united states and possibly heilongjiang china genus was first described in 1922 by william parks from a skull and partial skeleton found in alberta parasaurolophus was a hadrosaurid part of a diverse family of cretaceous dinosaurs known for their range of bizarre head adornments this genus is known for its large elaborate cranial crest which at its largest forms a long curved tube projecting upwards and back from skull charonosaurus from china which may have been its closest relative had a similar skull and potentially a similar crest visual recognition of both species and sex acoustic resonance and thermoregulation have been proposed as functional explanations for crest it is one of rarer hadrosaurids known from only a handful of good specimens description thumb left size of a p walkeri 10 metres long compared to a human 1 8 metres tall like most dinosaurs skeleton of parasaurolophus is incompletely known length of type specimen of p walkeri is estimated at and its weight is estimated at its skull is about long including crest whereas type skull of p tubicen is over long indicating a larger animal its single known forelimb was relatively short for a hadrosaurid with a short but wide shoulder blade thighbone measures long in p walkeri and is robust for its length when compared to other hadrosaurids upper arm and pelvic bones were also heavily built like other hadrosaurids it was able to walk on either two legs or four it probably preferred to forage for food on four legs but ran on two neural spines of vertebrae were tall as was common in lambeosaurines tallest over hips they increased height of back skin impressions are known for p walkeri showing uniform tubercle like scales but no larger structures skull thumb restoration of p walkeri most noticeable feature was cranial crest which protruded from rear of head and was made up of premaxilla and nasal bones william parks who named genus hypothesized that a ligament ran from crest to notch to support head and cited presence of possibly pathological notch as evidence although this idea seems unlikely parasaurolophus is sometimes restored with a skin flap from crest to neck crest was hollow with distinct tubes leading from each nostril to end of crest before reversing direction and heading back down crest and into skull tubes were simplest in p walkeri and more complex in p tubicen where some tubes were blind and others met and separated while p walkeri and p tubicen had long crests with only slight curvature p cyrtocristatus had a short crest with a more circular profile discovery and naming thumb holotype specimen of p walkeri showing pathologic v shaped notch meaning near crested lizard name parasaurolophus is derived from greek para para beside or near saurus sauros lizard and lophos lophos crest it is based on rom 768 a skull and partial skeleton missing most of tail and hind legs below knees which was found by a field party from university of toronto in 1920 near sand creek along red deer river in alberta canada these rocks are now known as campanian age upper cretaceous dinosaur park formation william parks named specimen p walkeri in honor of sir byron edmund walker chairman of board of trustees of royal ontario museum parasaurolophus remains are rare in alberta with only one other partial skull from probably dinosaur park formation and three dinosaur park specimens lacking skulls possibly belonging to genus in some faunal lists there is a mention of possible p walkeri material in hell creek formation of montana a rock unit of late maastrichtian age this occurrence is not noted by sullivan and williamson in their 1999 review of genus and has not been further elaborated upon elsewhere in 1921 charles h sternberg recovered a partial skull from what is now known as slightly younger kirtland formation in san juan county new mexico this specimen was sent to uppsala sweden where carl wiman described it as a second species p tubicen in 1931 specific epithet is derived from latin tubicen trumpeter a second nearly complete p tubicen skull nmmnh p was found in new mexico in 1995 using computed tomography of this skull robert sullivan and thomas williamson gave genus a monographic treatment in 1999 covering aspects of its anatomy and taxonomy and functions of its crest williamson later published an independent review of remains disagreeing with taxonomic conclusions john ostrom described another good specimen fmnh from new mexico as p cyrtocristatus in 1961 it includes a partial skull with a short rounded crest and much of postcranial skeleton except for feet neck and parts of tail its specific name is derived from latin shortened and cristatus crested specimen was found in either top of fruitland formation or more likely base of overlying kirtland formation range of this species was expanded in 1979 when david b weishampel and james a jensen described a partial skull with a similar crest byu from campanian age kaiparowits formation of garfield county utah since then another skull has been found in utah with short round p cyrtocristatus crest morphology species thumb left p tubicen crest and other hadrosaur material carnegie museum of natural history parasaurolophus is known from three certain species p walkeri p tubicen and p cyrtocristatus all of them can be distinguished from each other and have many differences first named species therefore type is p walkeri one certain specimen from dinosaur park formation is referred to it but many more are almost certainly referable like stated above it is different from other two species with it having a simpler internal structure than p tubicen a straighter crest and different internal structuring than p cyrtocristatus next named species is p tubicen which is largest of parasaurolophus species it lived in new mexico where three specimens are known and can be differentiated from its other species it possesses a long and straight crest with a very complex interior compared to other species all known specimens of p tubicen come from de na zin member of kirtland formation thumb p cyrtocristatus skeleton natural history museum of utah in 1961 third species p cyrtocristatus was named by john ostrom its three known specimens have been found in fruitland and kaiparowits formations from utah and new mexico second specimen first known from kaiparowits formation was originally unassigned to a specific taxon of parasaurolophus species p cyrtocristatus it is smallest and has most curved crest because of its possession of two above features it has often been speculated that it was a female of p walkeri or p tubicen which were males although p tubicen lived approximately a million years later as noted by thomas williamson type material of p cyrtocristatus is about 72 size of p tubicen close to size at which other lambeosaurines are interpreted to begin showing definitive sexual dimorphism in their crests 70 of adult size even though many scientists have supported possible fact of p cyrtocristatus being a female many other studies have found that it is not because of differences in age distribution and large differences in crest and its internal structure a study published in plos one in 2014 found that one more species could be referred to parasaurolophus this study led by xing found charonosaurus jiayensis was actually nested deeply inside parasaurolophus which created new species p jiayensis if this species is indeed inside parasaurolophus then genus lasted until k pg extinction and is known from two continents classification as its name implies parasaurolophus was initially thought to be closely related to saurolophus because of its superficially similar crest however it was soon reassessed as a member of lambeosaurine subfamily of hadrosaurids saurolophus is a hadrosaurine it is usually interpreted as a separate offshoot of lambeosaurines distinct from helmet crested corythosaurus hypacrosaurus and lambeosaurus its closest known relative appears to be charonosaurus a lambeosaurine with a similar skull but no complete crest yet from amur region of northeastern china and two may form a clade p cyrtocristatus with its short rounder crest may be most basal of three known parasaurolophus species or it may represent subadult or female specimens of p tubicen thumb comparison drawing between crests of p cyrtocristatus above and p walkeri below following cladogram is after 2007 redescription of lambeosaurus magnicristatus evans and reisz 2007 paleobiology thumb p walkeri head with scalation detail diet and feeding as a hadrosaurid parasaurolophus was a large bipedal quadrupedal herbivore eating plants with a sophisticated skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing its teeth were continually being replaced they were packed into dental batteries containing hundreds of teeth only a relative handful of which were in use at any time it used its beak to crop plant material which was held in jaws by a cheek like organ vegetation could have been taken from ground up to a height of around as noted by bob bakker lambeosaurines have narrower beaks than hadrosaurines implying that parasaurolophus and its relatives could feed more selectively than their broad beaked crestless counterparts growth upright thumb left juvenile skeleton ram 14000 parasaurolophus is known from many adult specimens and a juvenile described in 2013 juvenile was discovered in kaiparowits formation in 2009 excavated by joint expedition by webb schools and raymond m alf museum of paleontology ram juvenile has been identified as around only one year old when it died referred to parasaurolophus sp juvenile under specimen number ram 14000 is most complete as well as youngest parasaurolophus ever found and measures this individual fits neatly into currently known parasaurolophus growth stages and lived approximately 75 million years ago even though no complete skull of intermediate age between ram 14000 and adult parasaurolophus has been found yet a partial braincase of about right size is known at 25 of total adult size juvenile show that crest growth of parasaurolophus began sooner than in related genera such as corythosaurus it has been suggested that parasaurolophus adults bore such large crests especially when compared to related corythosaurus because of this difference in age between when their crests started developing its age also means that parasaurolophus had a very fast growth rate which took place in about a year crest of juvenile is not long and tubular like adults but low and hemispherical thumb alt juvenile skeleton reconstruction of a juvenile skeleton based on ram 14000 skull of ram 14000 is almost complete with left side only lacking a piece of maxilla however skull was split down middle by erosion possibly when it was resting on bottom of a river bed two sides are displaced slightly with some bones of right being moved off main block also by erosion after reconstruction skull viewed from side resembles other juvenile lambeosaurines found being roughly a trapezoid in shape a partial cranial endocast for ram 14000 was reconstructed from ct scan data first ever for a parasaurolophus of any ontogenetic stage endocast was reconstructed in two sections one on portion of braincase articulated with left half of skull and remainder on disarticulated portion of braincase their relative position was then approximated based on cranial landmarks and comparison with other hadrosaurids because of weathering many of smaller neural canals and foramina could not be identified for certain cranial crest thumb diagram showing internal features of crest many hypotheses have been advanced as to what functions cranial crest of parasaurolophus performed but most have been discredited it is now believed that it may have had several functions visual display for identifying species and sex sound amplification for communication and thermoregulation it is not clear which was most significant at what times in evolution of crest and its internal nasal passages differences in crests as for other lambeosaurines it is believed that cranial crest of parasaurolophus changed with age and was a sexually dimorphic characteristic in adults james hopson one of first researchers to describe lambeosaurine crests in terms of such distinctions suggested that p cyrtocristatus with its small crest was female form of p tubicen thomas williamson suggested it was juvenile form neither hypothesis became widely accepted as only six good skulls one juvenile braincase and one recently discovered juvenile skull are known additional material will help clear up these potential relationships williamson noted that in any case juvenile parasaurolophus probably had small rounded crests like p cyrtocristatus that probably grew faster as individuals approached sexual maturity recent restudy of a juvenile braincase previously assigned to lambeosaurus now assigned to parasaurolophus provides evidence that a small tubular crest was present in juveniles this specimen preserves a small upward flaring of frontal bones that was similar to but smaller than what is seen in adult specimens in adults frontals formed a platform that supported base of crest this specimen also indicates that growth of crest in parasaurolophus and facial profile of juvenile individuals differed from corythosaurus hypacrosaurus lambeosaurus model in part because crest of parasaurolophus lacks thin bony coxcomb that makes up upper portion of crest of other three lambeosaurines rejected function hypotheses thumb p walkeri skull cast many early suggestions focused on adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle following hypothesis that hadrosaurids were amphibious a common line of thought until 1960s thus alfred sherwood romer proposed it served as a snorkel martin that it was an attachment for a mobile proboscis used as a breathing tube or for food gathering charles m sternberg that it served as an to keep water out of lungs and ned colbert that it served as an air reservoir for prolonged stays underwater other proposals were more physical in nature as mentioned above william parks suggested that it was joined to vertebrae with ligaments or muscles and helped with moving and supporting head abel proposed it was used as a weapon in combat among members of same species and andrew milner suggested that it could be used as a foliage deflector like helmet crest called a casque of cassowary still other proposals made housing specialized organs major function halszka osmolska suggested that it housed salt glands and john ostrom suggested that it housed expanded areas for olfactory tissue and much improved sense of smell of lambeosaurines which had no obvious defensive capabilities most of these hypotheses have been discredited or rejected for example there is no hole at end of crest for a snorkeling function there are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one as a proposed airlock it would not have kept out water proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal size of parasaurolophus other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments also none of proposals explain why crest has such a shape why other lambeosaurines should have crests that look much different but perform a similar function how crestless or solid crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests these considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing capabilities of systems already present in animal such as salt gland and olfaction hypotheses and indicate that these were not primary functions of crest additionally work on nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that olfactory nerves and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside portion of nasal passages in crest so expansion of crest had little to do with sense of smell temperature regulation hypothesis large surface area and vascularization of crest also suggests a thermoregulatory function first to propose cranial crests of lambeosaurines related to temperature regulation was wheeler 1978 he proposed that there was a nerve connection between crest and brain so that latter could be cooled by former next people to publish a related idea were teresa maryanska and osmolska who realized that like modern lizards dinosaurs could have possessed salt glands and cooled off by osmo regulation in 2006 evans published an argument about functions of lambeosaurine crests and supported why this could be a causing factor for evolution of crest behavioural hypotheses thumb restoration of p walkeri with hypothetical skin frill parasaurolophus is often hypothesized to have used its crest as a resonating chamber to produce low frequency sounds to alert other members of a group or its species this function was originally suggested by wiman in 1931 when he described p tubicen he noted that crests internal structures are similar to those of a swan and theorized that an animal could use its elongated nasal passages to create noise however nasal tubes of hypacrosaurus corythosaurus and lambeosaurus are much more variable and complicated than airway of parasaurolophus a large amount of material and data supports hypothesis that large tubular crest of parasaurolophus was a resonating chamber weishampel in 1981 suggested that parasaurolophus made noises ranging between frequencies 55 and 720 hz although there was some difference in range of individual species because of crest size shape and nasal passage length most obvious in p cyrtocristatus interpreted as a possible female hopson found that there is anatomical evidence that hadrosaurids had a strong hearing there is at least one example in related corythosaurus of a slender stapes reptilian ear bone in place which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear furthermore hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian s indicating that auditory portion of inner ear was well developed based on similarity of hadrosaurid inner ears to those of crocodiles he also proposed that adult hadrosaurids were sensitive to high frequencies such as their offspring might produce according to weishampel this is consistent with parents and offspring communicating computer modeling of a well preserved specimen of p tubicen with more complex air passages than those of p walkeri has allowed reconstruction of possible sound its crest produced main path resonates at around 30 hz but complicated sinus anatomy causes peaks and valleys in sound other main behavioral theory is that crest was used for intra species recognition this means that crest could have been used for species recognition as a warning signal and for other non sexual uses these could have been some of reasons crests evolved in parasaurolophus and other hadrosaurids instead social and physiological functions have become more supported as function s of crest focusing on visual and auditory identification and communication as a large object crest has clear value as a visual signal and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries large size of hadrosaurid eye sockets and presence of rings in eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits evidence that sight was important to these animals if as is commonly illustrated a skin frill extended from crest to neck or back proposed visual display would have been even showier as is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls crest of parasaurolophus likely permitted both species identification such as separating it from corythosaurus or lambeosaurus and sexual identification by shape and size paleopathology parasaurolophus walkeri is known from one specimen which might contain a pathology skeleton shows a v shaped gap or notch in vertebrae at base of neck originally thought to be pathologic parks published a second interpretation of this as a ligament attachment to support head crest would attach to gap via muscles or ligaments and be used to support head while bearing a frill like predicted to exist in some hadrosaurids one other possibility is that during preparation specimen was damaged creating possible pathology notch however is still considered more likely to be a pathology even though some illustrations of parasaurolophus restore skin flap another possible pathology was noticed by parks and from around notch in fourth fifth and sixth vertebrae directly anterior to notch neural spines were damaged fourth had an obvious fracture with other two possessing a swelling at base of break paleoecology alberta thumb left locations of fossil finds written in french parasaurolophus walkeri from dinosaur park formation was a member of a diverse and well documented fauna of prehistoric animals including well known dinosaurs such as horned centrosaurus chasmosaurus and styracosaurus fellow gryposaurus and corythosaurus tyrannosaurid gorgosaurus and armored edmontonia euoplocephalus and dyoplosaurus it was a rare constituent of this fauna dinosaur park formation is interpreted as a low relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as western interior seaway transgressed westward climate was warmer than present day alberta without frost but with wetter and drier seasons conifers were apparently dominant canopy plants with an understory of ferns tree ferns and angiosperms some of less common hadrosaurs in dinosaur park formation of dinosaur provincial park such as parasaurolophus may represent remains of individuals who died while migrating through region they might also have had a more upland habitat where they may have nested or fed presence of parasaurolophus and kritosaurus in northern latitude fossil sites may represent faunal exchange between otherwise distinct northern and southern biomes in late cretaceous north america both taxa are uncommon outside of southern biome where along with pentaceratops they are predominate members of fauna new mexico thumb left teratophoneus attacking a p cyrtocristatus in fruitland formation of new mexico p cyrtocristatus shared its habitat with other ornithischians and theropods specifically its contemporaries were ceratopsian pentaceratops sternbergii pachycephalosaur stegoceras novomexicanum and some unidentified fossils belonging to tyrannosauridae ornithomimus troodontidae saurornitholestes langstoni struthiomimus ornithopoda chasmosaurus corythosaurus hadrosauridae and ceratopsidae when parasaurolophus existed fruitland formation was swampy positioned in lowlands and close to shore of cretaceous interior seaway lowermost part of fruitland formation is just younger than 75 56 0 41 mya with uppermost boundary dating to 74 55 0 22 mya existing slightly later than species from fruitland formation p tubicen is also found in new mexico in kirtland formation numerous vertebrate groups are from this formation including fishes crurotarsans ornithischians saurischians pterosaurs and turtles fishes are represented by two species and crurotarsans include brachychampsa montana and ornithischians from formation are represented by hadrosaurids anasazisaurus horneri naashoibitosaurus kritosaurus navajovius and p tubicen

unidentified taxa are known including leidyosuchus and theropods struthiomimus troodontidae and tyrannosauridae beginning of kirtland formation dates to 74 55 0 22 mya with formation ending at around 73 05 0 25 mya utah argon argon radiometric dating indicates that kaiparowits formation was deposited between 76 6 and 74 5 million years ago during campanian stage of late cretaceous period during late cretaceous period site of kaiparowits formation was located near western shore of western interior seaway a large inland sea that split north america into two landmasses laramidia to west and appalachia to east plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and abundant wetland peat swamps ponds and lakes and was bordered by highlands climate was wet and humid and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms this formation contains one of best and most continuous records of late cretaceous terrestrial life in world parasaurolophus shared its paleoenvironment with other dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurid theropods troodontid talos ornithomimids like ornithomimus velox tyrannosaurids like albertosaurus and teratophoneus armored ankylosaurids hadrosaur gryposaurus ceratopsians and richardsoni and oviraptorosaurian giganteus present in kaiparowits formation included sharks and rays frogs salamanders turtles lizards and
