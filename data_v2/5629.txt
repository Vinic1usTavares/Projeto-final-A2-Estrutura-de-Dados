updated unofficial simpsons guide warren martyn and adrian wood thought it was a bit lacking in focus but it contained a number of satisfying set pieces we like professor frink s walking house security system and displays wiggum at his all time most useless dvd movie guide s colin jacobson wrote after many plots of prior show vigilante maintains a much tighter focus it s not quite as wonderful an episode as its immediate predecessor but it s strong nonetheless much of humor comes from homer s newfound power and abuse of it if nothing else it s a great program due to homer s reaction to lisa s jug playing les of box office prophets named homer vigilante cape feare homer goes to college and deep space homer his favorite episodes of season five it was also liverpool daily
