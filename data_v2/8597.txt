inclement conditions than their opponents both crews started at a relatively low stroke rate to cater for conditions with cambridge moderately out rating their opponents light blues took an early lead and appeared to be coping with conditions better than oxford and were over a length ahead by time they passed london rowing club boathouse dark blues shipped more water until they became entirely submerged and were rescued by spectators on oxford launch cambridge continued and headed for relative protection of surrey shore but were caught by umpire s boat and informed that race was void it was
