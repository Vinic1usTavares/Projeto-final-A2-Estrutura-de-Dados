mauro roman kingdom latin regnum maurorum et romanorum was an independent christian berber kingdom centered on city of altava which controlled much of ancient roman province of mauretania caesariensis located in present day northern algeria kingdom was first formed in fifth century as roman control over province weakened and imperial resources had to be concentrated elsewhere notably in defending italian peninsula itself from invading germanic tribes rulers of mauro roman kingdom would repeatedly come into conflict with vandals of neighbouring vandalic kingdom which had been established following vandalic conquest of roman province of africa king masuna of moors and romans would ally with armies of eastern roman empire during their reconquest of northern africa in vandalic war following eastern roman victory over vandals mauro roman kingdom would maintain its alliance with eastern roman empire assisting it in wars against invading berbers of other tribes and kingdoms such as kingdom of aures eventually diplomatic ties between eastern roman empire and mauro roman kingdom would break down king garmul would invade eastern roman praetorian prefecture of africa in an attempt at capturing roman territories his defeat in 578 ad led almost immediately to end of mauro roman kingdom which was fragmented and partially reincorporated into roman empire kingdom was succeeded by some smaller romanized berber successor states such as kingdom of altava these petty kingdoms would last in maghreb until conquest of region by umayyad caliphate in seventh and eighth centuries history background left thumb province of mauretania caesariensis within roman empire mauretania and western numidia previously a roman client kingdom were fully annexed by roman empire in 40 ad and divided into two provinces under emperor claudius mauretania tingitana tangerine mauretania and mauretania caesariensis caesarian mauretania with separating border designated as river northern africa was not as well defended as frontiers that saw frequent attacks such as those against germania and persia but economic importance of african provinces made them important to retain to this end defensive structures were constructed alongside their borders such as africae a 750 km long linear defensive structure composed of ditches stone walls and other fortifications this structure would be in consistent use until vandal conquest of province of africa mauretanian frontier not as well defended as that of african frontier was known as limes mauretaniae as roman authority became occupied elsewhere during disastrous civil wars and disintegrations of crisis of third century local nomadic berber tribes harassed settlements and occupied some of border regions of mauretania tingitania and mauretania caesariensis incursions were seen as such a large threat that western roman emperor maximian personally became involved in conflict three berber tribes and had formed a confederation though berbers faced a defeat against a small army raised by governor of mauretania caesariensis in 289 ad they soon returned in 296 ad maximian raised an army from praetorian cohorts egyptian and danubian legionaries gallic and german auxiliaries and thracian recruits advancing through spain that autumn he may have defended region against raiding berbers before crossing strait of gibraltar into mauretania tingitana to protect area from frankish pirates maximian began an offensive against invading tribes in march 297 ad and pursued them even beyond borders of empire not content with simply letting them return to their homelands in atlas mountains from which they would be able to continue to wage war though berbers were skilled at guerrilla warfare and terrain was unfavorable maximian continued his campaign deep into berber territory when campaign was concluded in 298 ad maximian had driven tribes back into sahara devastated previously secure land and killed as many as he could on march 10 he made a triumphal entry into carthage with people hailing him as redditor lucis restorer of eternal light establishment thumb according to procopius unpopular policies attempted by vandal king huneric coin pictured in late 470s combined with fact that powerful king geiseric had recently died prompted large scale berber revolts against vandals and lead to vandals losing nearly all of mauretania fifth century would see collapse and fall of western roman empire inland territories of mauretania had already been under berber control since fourth century with direct roman rule confined to coastal cities such as septem in mauretania tingitania and caesarea in mauretania caesariensis berber rulers of inland territories maintained a degree of roman culture including local cities and settlements and often nominally acknowledged suzerainty of roman emperors as barbarian incursions became more common even in previously secure provinces such as italy western roman military became increasingly occupied to defend territories in northern parts of empire even vital rhine frontier against germania had been stripped of troops in order to organize a defense against a visigothic army invading italy under alaric undermanned frontier allowed several tribes such as vandals alans and suebi to cross rhine in 406 ad and invade roman territory as attention was needed elsewhere central authority began to collapse in many of more distant provinces in 423 there was a powerful uprising of berbers of mauritania and numidia which was suppressed only with great difficulty by count boniface in 427 in 429 however vandals and alans led by gaiseric invaded mauritania from hispania berbers supported them causing roman rule to disappear from province by 439 at same time it enabled romanized berbers to form an independent state with their capital in altava in mauretania local berber leaders and tribes had long been integrated into imperial system as allies foederati and frontier commanders and as roman control weakened they established their own kingdoms and polities in region presence of romanized communities along frontier regions of provinces meant that berber chieftains had some experience in governing populations composed of both berbers and romans following final collapse of western roman empire mauro roman kingdom would grow into a fully fledged barbarian kingdom not entirely unlike those that had sprung up in other parts of former empire though most other barbarian kingdoms such as those of visigoths and vandals were fully within borders of former roman empire mauro roman kingdom extended beyond formal imperial frontier also encompassing berber territories never controlled by romans according to eastern roman historian procopius moors only began to truly expand and consolidate their power following death of powerful vandal king gaiseric in 477 ad after which they won many victories against vandal kingdom and established more or less full control over former province of mauretania having feared gaiseric moors under vandal control revolted against his successor huneric following his attempt to convert them to arian christianity and harsh punishments incurred on those who did not convert in aures mountains this led to foundation of independent kingdom of aures which was fully independent by time of huneric s death in 484 ad and would never again come under vandal rule under rule of huneric s successors gunthamund and thrasamund wars between berbers and vandals continued during thrasamund s reign vandals suffered a disastrous defeat at hands of a berber king ruling city tripolis named who almost completely destroyed a vandal army that had been sent to subjugate city kings of moors and romans one of berber rulers of mauretania masuna titled himself as rex gentium maurorum et romanorum king of roman and moorish peoples masuna is known only from an inscription on a fortification in altava modern in region of oran dated 508 ad he is known to have possessed altava assumed to have been capital due to its prominence under subsequent kings and at least two other cities castra severiana and safar as mention is made of officials he appointed there as seat of an diocese diocese of castra severiana an ancient which flourished during late antiquity control of castra severiana may have been particularly important in full inscription reads pro sal ute et reg is gent ium maur orum et um castrum atum a pref de safar proc castra a quem masuna altava posuit et maxim us pr alt ava it p p three officials appointed are prefect of safar procurator of castra severiana and maximus procurator of altava date 469 is provincial founding date and would correspond to 508 ad core administrative centers of kingdom were located on territorial interface of two distinct populations coastal and settled provincial romani romans and tribal mauri moors or berbers situated around and beyond former roman frontier citizens of roman cities were subjects of a formal and organized administration headed by appointed officials such as those appointed by king masuna military manpower was derived from berber tribes over which control was maintained through control of key individuals such as tribal leaders by issuing honors and estates to them as mauro roman kingdom adopted military religious and sociocultural organization of roman empire it continued to be fully within western latin world administrative structure and titulature used by rulers of kingdom suggests a certain romanized political identity in region this roman political identity was maintained by other smaller berber kingdoms in region as well such as in kingdom of aures where king claimed title of imperator during his rule around 516 ad postulating that he had not broken trust with either his berber or roman subjects eastern roman empire and vandals thumb monogram of king mastigas alt left eastern roman records referring to vandal kingdom which had occupied much of old roman province of africa and coastal parts of mauretania often refer to it with regards to a trinity of peoples vandals alans and moors and though some berbers had assisted vandals in their conquests in africa berber expansion was as previously stated more often than not focused against vandals rather than with them which would lead to some expansion of mauro roman kingdom and other berber kingdoms of region such as kingdom of aures indeed a berber king identified by historian procopius of eastern roman empire as massonas often assumed to be same person as masuna allied with forces of eastern roman empire in 535 ad against vandal kingdom during vandalic war when belisarius and eastern roman forces arrived in northern africa to invade and restore roman rule over region local berber rulers willingly submitted to imperial rule only demanding in return symbols of their offices a silver crown a staff of silver gilt a tunic and gilded boots essentially client kings many of berber rulers would prove recalcitrant those rulers that were not directly adjacent to imperial territories were more or less independent though nominally still imperial subjects and were treated with larger amounts of courtesy than ones directly bordering empire as to keep them in line gelimer final vandal king attempted to recruit berber kingdoms to fight for him but very few berber troops took part in fighting for vandal side though vandals had supplied berber kings with symbols of their offices similar to those supplied by romans berber kings did not consider vandals to hold that power securely during vandalic war most berber rulers waited out conflict in order to avoid fighting for losing side following eastern roman re conquest of vandal kingdom local governors began to experience problems with local berber tribes province of byzacena was invaded and local garrison including commanders and rufinus was defeated newly appointed praetorian prefect of africa solomon waged several wars against these berber tribes leading an army of around 18 000 men into byzacena solomon would defeat them and return to carthage though berbers would again rise and overrun byzacena solomon would once again defeat them this time decisively scattering berber forces surviving berber soldiers retreated into numidia where they joined forces with iabdas king of aures masuna allied with eastern empire and another berber king who ruled a kingdom in former province of mauretania sitifensis urged solomon to pursue enemy berbers into numidia which he did solomon did not engage iabdas in battle however distrusting loyalty of his allies and instead constructed a series of fortified posts along roads linking byzacena with numidia masuna died around 535 ad and was succeeded as king by mastigas also known as mastinas procopius states that mastigas was a fully independent ruler who ruled almost entire former province of mauretania caesariensis except for former provincial capital caesarea which had been under control of vandals and was in eastern roman hands during his time rulers of mauro roman kingdom and other berber kingdoms continued to regard themselves as subjects of eastern roman emperor in constantinople even when they were at war with him or engaged in raids of imperial territory most berber rulers using titles such as dux or rex collapse last recorded king was garmul also known as garmules who would resist eastern roman rule in africa in late 560s garmul launched raids into roman territory and although he failed to take any significant town three successive generals praetorian prefect theodore in 570 ad and two magistri militum theoctistus in 570 ad and amabilis in 571 ad are recorded by visigoth historian john of to have been killed by garmul s forces his activities especially when regarded together with simultaneous visigoth attacks in spania presented a clear threat to province s authorities garmul was not leader of a mere semi nomadic tribe but of a fully fledged barbarian kingdom with a standing army thus new eastern roman emperor tiberius ii constantine re appointed thomas as praetorian prefect of africa and able general gennadius was posted as magister militum with clear aim of reducing garmul s kingdom preparations were lengthy and careful but campaign itself launched in 577 78 ad was brief and effective with gennadius utilizing terror tactics against garmul s subjects garmul was defeated and killed in 578 ad with defeat of garmul mauro roman kingdom collapsed eastern roman empire re incorporated some of territory of kingdom notably coastal corridor of old provinces of mauretania tingitania and mauretania caesariensis legacy left thumb map depicting romano berber kingdoms of northern africa after collapse of mauro roman kingdom from left to right altava ouarsenis hodna aures and tripolis altava remained capital of a romanized berber kingdom though kingdom of altava was significantly smaller in size than kingdom of masuna and garmul had been in late fifth and early sixth century christianity grew to be fully dominant religion in berber altava kingdom with syncretic influences from traditional berber religion a new church was built in capital altava in this period altava and other successor kingdoms of mauro roman kingdom kingdoms of ouarsenis and hodna also saw an economical rise and construction of several new churches and fortifications though eastern roman praetorian prefecture of africa and later exarchate of africa would see some further berber rebellions these would be put down and many berber tribes would be accepted as foederati as they had been many times in past last known romanized berber king to rule from altava was kusaila he died in year 690 ad fighting against muslim conquest of maghreb he was also leader of awraba tribe of berbers and possibly christian head of confederation he is known for having led an effective berber martial resistance against umayyad caliphate s conquest of maghreb in 680s in 683 ad uqba ibn nafi was ambushed and killed in battle of vescera near by kusaila who forced all arabs to evacuate their just founded kairouan and withdraw to cyrenaica but in 688 ad arab reinforcements from abd al malik ibn marwan arrived under ibn kays kusaila met them in 690 ad with support of eastern roman troops at battle of mamma vastly outnumbered awraba and romans were defeated and kusaila was killed with death of kusaila torch of resistance passed to a tribe known as tribe who had their home
