coming from area around shaoshan hunan in south central china same region as mao her family were impoverished local landowners most of what is known about their marriage comes from an account mao gave to american reporter edgar snow in 1936 which snow included in his book red star over china according to mao he and luo yixiu were subject of an arranged marriage organised by their respective fathers mao yichang and luo helou luo was eighteen and mao just fourteen years old at time of their betrothal although mao took part in wedding ceremony he later said that he was unhappy with marriage never consummating it and refusing to live with his wife socially disgraced she lived with mao s parents for two years until she died of dysentery while he moved out of village to continue his studies elsewhere eventually becoming a founding member of communist party of china various biographers have suggested that mao s experience of this marriage affected his later views leading him to become a critic of arranged marriage and a vocal feminist he would marry three more times to yang kaihui he zizhen and jiang qing last of whom was better known as madame mao early life born on 20 october 1889 luo yixiu was eldest daughter of luo helou 1871 1943 a or rural intellectual who earned his living as a farmer and his wife 1869 1912 whose surname was mao and who was a distant great aunt of mao zedong although historian lee feigon stated that luo family was locally important mao biographers alexander v pantsov and steven i levine claimed that they had fallen into poverty luo helou and his wife had five sons and five daughters but seven of these children died leaving them only three daughters couple s lack of adult sons diminished their social status for in chinese society at time only sons could continue family lineage marriage preparation mao zedong had been born and raised at his father s farm in shaoshanchong a small rural village named for nearby shaoshan mountain his disciplinarian father mao yichang had decided to deal with zedong s rebellious attitude in a manner typical of time by forcing him into an arranged marriage that would compel him to take family matters seriously yichang also desired a helper for his own wife wen qimei whose health had deteriorated through years of heavy agricultural labour he selected luo yixiu in either late 1907 or 1908 her kinship to may have helped in this selection as luo yixiu s mother s four brothers surnamed mao lived only two li 1 km from mao yichang s home in shaoshanchong following traditional procedures a matchmaker would have been sent to luo family house and luo family would have been socially expected to accept marriage proposal immediately luo helou was happy to see his eldest daughter married two families exchanged gifts and signed marriage contract after which marriage was considered inviolable zedong first met yixiu on day that contract was signed years later his granddaughter kong stated that mao was unhappy with his father s choice and that he instead was in love with his cousin wang however marriage to wang had been ruled out by a local diviner because their horoscopes were incompatible although displeased by arrangement mao agreed to marry luo at time he was fourteen and later erroneously informed edgar snow that luo was aged twenty a claim independently accepted by mao biographers ross terrill and philip short but later challenged by biographers jung chang and jon halliday and alexander v pantsov and steven i levine who established that she was eighteen wedding wedding took place in 1908 according to a number of mao s biographers ceremony would have likely followed traditional rural custom thus it probably would have begun with a feast in groom s home on day before ceremony to which friends and relatives were invited next day bride would have been dressed in red with a red veil over her face and carried by red palanquin to groom s family home there her veil would have been removed and she would have been expected to express unhappiness and dissatisfaction with groom by publicly insulting him according to tradition a display of fireworks would probably have taken place before both bride and groom would have to each guest to groom s ancestral altar to spirits and to one another concluding ceremony if traditional practices were adhered to feasting would have continued for two days while guests would have given gifts mainly of money to newlyweds wedding ceremony would have culminated with guests entering bridal chamber where they would have made various sexual references and innuendos led by a figure with his face painted black in chinese rural tradition bride was expected to show bloodstains on bed sheets from her wedding night to prove that her hymen had been broken during sexual intercourse and that she had therefore been a virgin married life thumb right 250px mao s shaoshanchong home in 2010 it was here that luo lived after wedding according to what he told snow mao refused to live with his wife and claimed that they had never consummated their marriage soon after wedding he ran away from home to live with an unemployed

in autumn of 1910 agreed to finance his son s studies at higher primary school and so mao left shaoshanchong when in 1936 mao told snow i do not consider her my wife he made no mention of her death

organize a local peasant movement he went to visit luo yixiu s relatives including her father luo helou and his nephew luo shiquan shi quan luo shiquan would join communist party in winter of that year and would remain a peasant activist until 1949 revolution because luo yixiu had died without offspring when mao lineage updated its genealogy book in 1941 mao who was mao zedong s third son with his second wife yang kaihui was listed as luo s descendant in 1950 mao sent his eldest son mao to shaoshan and instructed him to visit luo shiquan mao also kept in contact with two men who had married luo yixiu s sisters and met one of these men when he returned to shaoshan in 1959 for first time since 1920s influence on mao in mao a reinterpretation american historian lee feigon argued that mao s experience with arranged marriage inspired him to become a vehement advocate of women s rights in late 1910s as he began to write articles for left wing press criticizing traditional chinese family system and arguing that love rather than societal or family pressures should be primary determinant in marriage this idea had previously been expressed by journalist and sinologist clare hollingworth in their biography mao unknown story jung chang and jon halliday agreed stating that it was this experience with luo that turned mao into a fierce opponent of arranged marriage mao would marry three more women over course of his life yang kaihui in december 1920 he zizhen in may 1928 and jiang qing in november 1939 references notes footnotes bibliography category 1889 births category 1910 deaths
