seeley g mudd chemistry building was a chemistry laboratory and classroom building on campus of vassar college in town of poughkeepsie new york postmodern building stood on north end of a cluster of other science buildings on site of school s first chemistry laboratory it was completed in 1984 at a cost of 7 2 million after college received money from a fund bequeathed to it in will of california cardiologist and professor seeley g mudd structure replaced sanders hall of chemistry and included elements designed to be energy efficient notably a large wall of glass blocks that designers hoped would passively heat building reviews of structure were positive when it opened with critics praising way its form complemented nearby older buildings by 2015 many aspects of building had been evaluated as being in fair or poor condition and building was demolished in april 2016 as part of science center project later replaced with an open green space history vassar brothers laboratory was first chemistry building on campus of vassar college in town of poughkeepsie new york built in 1880 around from college s main building laboratory which was first free standing chemistry structure at a women s college stood until 1938 29 years after construction of its replacement ewing chapelle designed sanders hall of chemistry thumb left north entrance to building with mudd s name prominently displayed overhead in 1981 seeley g mudd fund granted vassar 1 3 million for construction of a new chemistry building mudd was a california based cardiologist professor and trustee with university of southern california s school of medicine as well as with a number of other west coast schools over his lifetime mudd donated more than 10 million to higher education institutions and upon his death in 1968 his will established a further 44 million for building construction at universities and colleges with stipulation that institutions requesting a grant provide at least half funds for their projects and that his name be prominently displayed on any buildings receiving funding while cost of building was originally reported to be 4 5 million this estimate grew to 6 5 million by 1984 and would ultimately come to 7 2 million once project was completed college planned to cover costs not paid for by mudd fund with a 100 million development fundraising program that spanned entirety of 1980s ground was broken on new building on october 8 1982 in a ceremony presided over by vassar president virginia b smith smith had previously selected engineer fred dubin to aid school in constructing a more environmentally friendly chemistry building as design progressed she identified need to hire architects to design building alongside dubin so perry dean rogers architects of boston were selected named seeley g mudd chemistry building after its benefactor building was constructed on site where vassar brothers laboratory once stood dubin initially tried to have it placed on south side of sanders physics building but that site was deemed unworkable in part because of its proximity to school s shakespeare gardens building was instead placed southwest of sanders hall of chemistry which would be renamed sanders classrooms and completed a quadrangle consisting of both sanders buildings and new england building though built across from sanders physics mudd was actually out of alignment with it associates served as project s structural engineers and w j barney corporation served as its general contractor thumb right building s demolition april 2016 alt a clawed construction vehicle grabs at an exposed girder in a torn open building in 2007 despite being vassar s youngest completed academic building a report by platt byard dovell white architects report found that many components of mudd s structure were in either fair or poor condition structure was slated for demolition in spring 2016 as part of college s science center project which also included construction of new bridge for laboratory sciences building and renovations of new england building sanders physics and olmsted hall chemistry department began its move to bridge for laboratory sciences in summer 2015 and mudd s demolition followed exterior facade elements windows and indoor walls were cut away before building s frame was dismantled concluding on april 22 2016 site was cleared and replaced with an open green space features seeley g mudd chemistry building was designed in postmodern style structure s exterior walls were constructed from limestone and brick that surround regular glass blocks each about thick with side lengths ranging from brick and limestone walls faced west north and east while southern face was primarily glass a feature designed for efficient energy use when sunlight hit wall air rose into building and was heated then pumped throughout where it aided in operation of structure s 46 fume hoods north wall meanwhile was designed to be resistant to cold air building was well insulated and its plain outer walls were as uninterrupted in material as possible to keep as much warm air inside structure as possible in winters thumb right south side of mudd with its glass brick wall encompassing seeley g mudd chemistry building stood three stories tall second and first floors latter of which lies partially below ground contained laboratory space while third floor consisted of communal and teaching spaces like classrooms and offices other offices on first floor were lit via skylights stairwells in mudd were designed with purpose of discouraging students from passing through lab spaces to get from one side of building to other in spite of this michael j crosbie reported in architecture in 1986 that students had taken to passing through building as a shortcut instead of going around it furnishings and carpeting in building were deep blue and rust colored thumb left moving clockwise from top mudd sanders classrooms sanders physics and new england building critics responded favorably to building s placement relative to its neighbors 2007 report by platt byard dovell white architects evaluating condition and context for many of vassar s buildings found mudd to be by far vassar s most interesting and most important post modern building a contemporary review in architecture commented that mudd responds on a variety of levels to its context but it does so without sacrificing its own unique and powerful identity margaret also praised building s placement and among its fellow structures in a 1986 issue of architectural record scale of structure beneath its outcroppings is sympathetic to existing buildings in quad and its mass though larger is appropriate to its role as a gateway between them and central campus she went on to positively comment on building s aesthetics saying eye can feast on mingled sparkle and luminosity drawn from minimal outdoor exposures used to maximum effect in more public areas where crisp glass block and lucent glass ignite clear deep timbered tones and pretty pastels feast becomes a banquet crosbie in architecture noted some instances of shoddy drywall work and sloppy painting but otherwise praised building s bare bones and nuts and bolts interior as functional and environmentally friendly platt byard dovell white report found that mudd s glass walls seem to function particularly poorly as a passive heat control system but otherwise noted that structure s expressive postmodernist ambitions marked it as a strong compact if busy building that makes it more than a bit of a tour de force
