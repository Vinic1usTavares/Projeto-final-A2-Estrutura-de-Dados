black currawong strepera fuliginosa also known locally as black jay is a large passerine bird endemic to tasmania and nearby islands within bass strait one of three currawong species in genus strepera it is closely related to butcherbirds and australian magpie within family artamidae it is a large crow like bird around long on average with yellow irises a heavy bill and black plumage with white wing patches male and female are similar in appearance three subspecies are recognised one of which strepera fuliginosa colei of king island is vulnerable to extinction within its range black currawong is generally sedentary although populations at higher altitudes relocate to lower areas during cooler months habitat includes densely forested areas as well as alpine heathland it is rare below altitudes of omnivorous its diet includes a variety of berries invertebrates and small vertebrates less arboreal than pied currawong black currawong spends more time foraging on ground it roosts and breeds in trees taxonomy black currawong was first described by ornithologist john gould in 1836 as cracticus fuliginosus and in 1837 as fuliginosa pl 5 specific epithet is late latin adjective fuliginosus sooty from latin fuligo soot and refers to black plumage higgins et al p 556 american ornithologist dean amadon regarded black currawong as a subspecies of pied currawong strepera graculina seeing it as part of a continuum with subspecies ashbyi of latter species complex having progressively less white plumage as one moves south subsequent authors have considered it a separate species higgins et al p 563 although richard schodde and ian mason describe it as forming a superspecies with pied currawong a 2013 genetic analysis by anna kearns and colleagues gave some indication that black currawong lineage diverged from a common ancestor of grey and pied currawongs though sampling was limited and not focus of study common names include black currawong sooty currawong black bell magpie black or mountain magpie black or sooty crow shrike and black jay is a local name applied to species within tasmania species is often confused with local dark plumaged subspecies of grey currawong s versicolor known as clinking currawong or hill magpie there are three subspecies of black currawong nominate form strepera fuliginosa fuliginosa of tasmania strepera fuliginosa parvior of flinders island described by schodde and mason in 1999 and strepera fuliginosa colei of king island described by gregory mathews in 1916 two island subspecies have identical plumage to nominate but are slightly smaller with shorter wings and tails subspecies colei having a shorter tail than parvior together with pied and grey currawong black currawong forms genus strepera although crow like in appearance and habits currawongs are only distantly related to true crows and are instead closely related to australian magpie and butcherbirds affinities of all three genera were recognised early on and they were placed in family in 1914 by ornithologist john albert leach after he had studied their musculature ornithologists charles sibley and jon ahlquist recognised close relationship between and butcherbirds and relatives in 1985 and combined them into a clade which later became family artamidae description thumb left 250px gathering nesting material near tasmania black currawong is about long with an wingspan male is slightly larger and heavier than female males of nominate subspecies average to females male wings average around and tails while female wings average and tails data for two island subspecies is limited but males of subspecies colei have been measured at with wings on average and a female at with a wing and subspecies parvior at for males with wings on average and and wing for a female sexes are similar in plumage which is all black except for white patches at tips of wings and tail feathers bill and legs are black and eyes bright yellow white tips line trailing edges of wings in flight and a paler arc across bases of primary flight feathers is also visible on underwing although there is no seasonal variation to plumage black may fade a little to a dark brown with wear immature birds have browner tinged plumage and a yellow gape until they are two years old oldest recorded age of a black currawong has been 15 years a bird was sighted in july 2004 near fern tree tasmania less than from where it had been banded in july 1989 voice black currawong is a loud and vocal species and makes a variety of calls its main call is markedly different from pied or grey currawongs and has been described as a combination of alternating kar and sounds higgins et al p 560 killok killok or even akin to part song and part human laughter although often noisy when flying in flocks it can be silent when seeking prey or thieving food before or around dawn and at nightfall appear to be periods of increased calling and birds are reported to be more vocal before rain or storms parents also make a long fluting whistle to summon their young similar species black currawong is commonly confused with clinking currawong but latter species has a white rump and larger white wing patches black currawong has a heavier bill and a characteristic call unlike clink clink call of clinking forest and little ravens are similar in size but lack white wing patches and instead have entirely black plumage and white rather than yellow eyes higgins et al p 557 black currawong is unlikely to be mistaken for closely related pied currawong as latter does not reach tasmania but it has a longer and deeper bill and lacks white rump and undertail coverts higgins et al p 562 distribution and habitat thumb left juvenile black currawong cradle mountain alt a brownish black bird looks to be squawking perched next to a bush with red flowers black currawong is endemic to tasmania where it is widespread although it is uncommon or absent from areas below altitude it breeds mainly in central highlands with scattered records elsewhere in tasmania reports of breeding are rare from northeast it is found on many islands of bass strait including hunter and furneaux groups it was recorded historically from kent group but its status there is unknown higgins et al p 558 within its range it is largely sedentary although some populations at higher altitudes may move to lower altitudes during winter higgins et al p 559 flocks have also been recorded making long journey across water from maria island to mainland in morning and returning at nightfall as well as moving between islands in group black currawong has expanded into northeast corner of island to bay and cape portland black currawong is evaluated as least concern on iucn red list of threatened species one of its subspecies strepera fuliginosa colei of king island has declined over much of its range on king island possibly due to clearing of its forest habitat and has been listed as vulnerable there are estimated to be around 500 birds it is unclear whether competition with more numerous forest raven is impacting on subspecies there black currawong is generally found in wetter eucalypt forests dominated by such species as alpine ash eucalyptus delegatensis messmate e obliqua and mountain gum e dalrympleana sometimes with a beech nothofagus understory it also frequents cool rainforest of beech king billy pine in lowlands it is more restricted to denser forests and moist gullies while it also occurs in alpine scrubland and heathland at altitude in dryer more open forest it is replaced by clinking currawong although two may co occur in places such as central highlands and eastern tiers both flinders and king island subspecies are found across their respective islands but prefer more forested habitats there black currawong has been recorded in gardens in hobart in tasmania s southeast and around mount wellington on hobart s outskirts in winter some remained to breed in hobart in 1994 after a year of severe weather behaviour black currawongs are found singly or in pairs but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds birds have been observed digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and applying it all over their plumage wiping carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills they did not appear to wash afterwards using procedure as a form of dirt bath black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats and often cocks its tail in air for balance when it lands play behaviour has been observed particularly with subadult individuals black currawongs have been observed wrestling with each other where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back at while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as pears with their feet one species of chewing lice has been recovered and described from a black currawong near launceston breeding breeding occurs from august to december like all currawongs it builds a large cup nest out of sticks lined with softer material and placed in fork of a tree from high old nests are sometimes tidied up and reused in following years a typical clutch has two to four pale grey brown purplish buff spotted blotched red brown or purplish brown eggs as in all passerines chicks are born naked and blind altricial and remain in nest for an extended period nidicolous both parents feed young but male feeds them alone after leaving nest and as they become more independent and also moves from giving food directly to them to placing it on ground near them so they learn to eat for themselves feeding thumb black currawong fortescue bay tasman peninsula alt a black crow like bird with a heavy bill and yellow eyes sits on a rock with some bushland in background no systematic studies have been done on diet of black currawong but it is known to be omnivorous feeding on a wide variety of foodstuffs including insects and small vertebrates carrion and berries birds forage on ground most often but also in tree canopies they use their bills to probe ground or turn over clods of earth or small rocks looking for food birds have been seen using walking tracks to forage along a group of ten birds were observed trying to break open ice on a frozen lake they have been recorded foraging along beach for fly larvae in beached kelp most commonly black currawongs forage in pairs but they may congregate in larger groups flocks of 100 birds have descended on orchards to eat apples or rotten fruit species has been observed in a mixed species flocks with forest ravens corvus and silver gulls chroicocephalus novaehollandiae white faced herons novaehollandiae white fronted chats albifrons and european starlings sturnus vulgaris on beach at sundown point they have been observed securing dead larger prey to ease subsequent dismemberment a parent currawong had wedged a dead chicken s wings under a log to facilitate pulling off portions such as legs and entrails to feed to its young and another time hooked a dead rabbit on a spur of a log to rip it into pieces black currawong consumes berries of heath species juniperina and astroloma and native sedge grandis as well as domestic pea and apples invertebrates consumed include earthworms and many types of insects such as ants moths flies crickets grasshoppers and beetles like weevils scarabs and leaf beetles it is adaptable and has learnt to eat introduced european wasp vespula germanica a bird that was being harassed by three scarlet robins petroica was seen to suddenly turn on them and catch and eat one other vertebrates recorded as prey include house mouse mus musculus small lizards tadpoles chickens ducklings young of domestic turkey tasmanian nativehen gallinula flame robin petroica and rabbit it can become quite bold and tame much like its close relative pied currawong on australian mainland especially in public parks and gardens where people make a habit of feeding it black currawongs have been recorded taking young peas from pods raiding orchards seizing chickens from poultry yards and entering barns in search of mice black currawongs are very common around picnic areas in tasmania s two most popular national parks freycinet and cradle mountain lake st clair and are often fed by tourists there national parks authority tolerated this practice until 1995 when they found birds were becoming a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife however agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so birds may only ultimately be discouraged by an impractical ban on food in national parks birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine references notes cited text external links
