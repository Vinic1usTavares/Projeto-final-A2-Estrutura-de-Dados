76th infantry division of british army was raised during second world war to defend norfolk coast against a possible german invasion before being transformed into a training division in late 1942 it was responsible for providing final tactical and field training to soldiers who had already passed their initial training after five additional weeks of training soldiers would be posted to fighting formations overseas formation was used as a source of reinforcements for 21st army group that was fighting in normandy after all available british army troops left united kingdom for france division was disbanded in september 1944 in addition to actual formation a phantom 76th infantry division was formed for deception phantom division was part of notional british fourth army to be used for fictitious operation trolleycar this operation aimed to deceive germans into believing that an allied landing would occur along northern german coast while deception effort was not a complete success it managed to divert german attention to northern flank for remainder of war background thumb alt men of 8th battalion lincolnshire regiment during an anti invasion exercise in norfolk 1941 in early stages of second world war following battle of france in 1940 united kingdom was under threat of invasion from germany but during summer battle of britain dampened this threat as year progressed size of british army increased dramatically as 140 new infantry battalions were raised in late 1940 with possibility of a german invasion during 1941 these new battalions were formed into independent infantry brigades that were then loaned to newly created county divisions county divisions including norfolk county division were around 10 000 men strong and assigned to defend coast of threatened sections of country undertaking defensive tasks including manning of coastal artillery these divisions were largely static lacking mobility and also divisional assets such as artillery engineers and reconnaissance forces using new formations in this manner allowed pre war regular infantry divisions to undertake training and form an all important reserve that could be used to counter attack any possible german landing on 22 june germany launched operation barbarossa invasion of soviet union this attack all but removed german threat to united kingdom british still had to consider threat of an invasion due possibility that soviet union could collapse under german onslaught after which germany could easily transfer troops back to west with arrival of winter in late 1941 threat of invasion subsided this coupled with production of new equipment for british army allowed war office to begin steps to better balance army due to large number of infantry units formed during preceding year and a half as part of this reform county divisions were disbanded history home defence during war divisions of british army were divided between higher establishment and lower establishment formations former were intended for deployment overseas and combat whereas latter were strictly for home defence in a static role on 18 november 1941 norfolk county division was abolished and reformed as 76th infantry division a lower establishment division division like its predecessor comprised 213th 220th and 222nd infantry brigades that day division was assigned artillery an anti tank regiment engineers and signallers reconnaissance troops joined division in january 1942 paper strength of an infantry division at this time was 17 298 men major general william maingay ozanne who had commanded norfolk county division since its inception retained command of division 76th division was assigned to ii corps and maintained its previous mission of defending norfolk coastline imperial war museum comments that division insignia a red norfolk wherry under sail underscored association of division with norfolk after division became a training formation insignia was only worn by permanent division members division was involved in establishing ability of abwehr german military intelligence a german published order of battle of british army based within united kingdom dated 10 april 1942 was captured this document included division and had a near perfect listing of its subordinate units with one exception rather than including 1st battalion leicestershire regiment germans believed 18th battalion welch regiment had already replaced it this and similar errors led british to understand capability of germans to intercept wireless communications in united kingdom in 1943 this in part led to operation fortitude a plan to exploit german ability and deceive their intelligence community about future allied operations like operation overlord training formation thumb left alt a bren gun team train at eastern command s battle school 1942 during winter of 1942 43 army overhauled training of recruits 76th division along with 48th infantry and 77th infantry divisions was changed from a lower establishment unit to a reserve division on 20 december division was renamed 76th infantry reserve division becoming a training formation in process these three divisions were supplemented by a fourth training formation 80th infantry reserve division which was raised on 1 january 1943 76th infantry reserve division was assigned to eastern command and moved to norwich soldiers who had completed their corps training were sent to these training divisions soldiers were given five weeks of additional training at section platoon and company level before undertaking a final three day exercise troops would then be ready to be sent overseas to join other formations training was handled in this manner to relieve higher establishment divisions from being milked for replacements for other units and to allow them to intensively train without interruption of having to handle new recruits for example 9th battalion dorsetshire regiment provided recruits to other battalions within regiment as well as royal norfolk regiment during this period command of division changed several times on 21 december 1943 ozanne was replaced by major general colin callander who in turn was replaced by major general john edward utterson kelso on 13 march 1944 on 30 june 1944 76th infantry reserve division along with other training divisions had a combined total of 22 355 men of this number only 1 100 were immediately available as replacements for 21st army group remaining 21 255 men were considered ineligible for service abroad due to a variety of reasons ranging from medical not being considered fully fit or not yet fully trained over following six months up to 75 per cent of these men would be deployed to reinforce 21st army group following completion of their training and having met required fitness levels stephen hart comments that by september 21st army group had bled home forces dry of riflemen due to losses suffered during normandy campaign leaving army in britain with exception of 52nd lowland infantry division with just young lads old men and unfit on 1 september 1944 division was disbanded utterson kelso assumed command of 47th infantry reserve division which took over role of 76th division deception thumb front line in north west europe following operation market garden creation of fictitious division arose from an actual reorganisation of british forces during 1944 british army was facing a manpower crisis army did not have enough men to replace losses to front line infantry while efforts were made to address this such as transferring men from royal artillery and royal air force to be retrained as infantry war office began disbanding divisions to reduce size of army and to transfer surplus men to other units to help keep those as close to full strength as possible 76th infantry reserve division was one of several lower establishment divisions in united kingdom chosen to be disbanded r force fortitude deception staff seized upon this opportunity to retain division as a phantom unit a cover story was established to explain change in division s status it was claimed that with war nearing an end several territorial army divisions would revert to their peacetime recruiting role and release their equipment and resources to other units for 76th this was 47th division with transfer of equipment 76th was notionally raised to higher establishment and assigned to reinforce 21st army group as a deception unit division was assigned to bogus operation trolleycar trolleycar was initially envisioned as a fictitious amphibious assault upon coast of netherlands by phantom british fourth army to exploit success of authentic operation market garden when battle of arnhem failed notional invasion plan was temporarily scrapped trolleycar was revived to convince germans that fourth army would land near emden in support of an imaginary assault by first canadian army that would be launched west of arnhem and through netherlands deception effort was kept up until 1945 being wound down in january despite british ceasing their attempts to deceive germans about this possible landing and germans not believing all that had been reported to
