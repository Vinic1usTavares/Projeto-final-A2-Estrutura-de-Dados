boxes dazzling production a clutch of clever couplets choruses you can demolish a tower block with a positive review came from bradley stern of muumuse who wrote in detail gypsy is kind of arena anthem that already sounds like it s being belted in middle of a sold out madison square garden it s a slow and steady build but once it reaches that journey esque chorus i don t want to be alone forever but i can be tonight there s no going back cue endless intercontinental shout outs at end i don t speak german but i try a cute nod to scheisse and you ve got an instant classic from artpop

portraying yearning of fame than lead single applause kevin fallon of daily beast compared it to work of singer bruce springsteen adding that power ballad is kind destined for last call sing a longs at those bars with peanut shells on floor with gaga belting over tickling ivories about trusting instincts and charging into unknown michael cragg of guardian called gypsy an epic narrative about fame and loneliness with composition comparable to edge of glory and a vocal riff similar to that of poker face comparisons to edge of glory were also present in robbie daw s review of album for idolator chris bosman of time thought that gypsy serves as epic end of album track along with dope but criticized songs for not being unique enough saying that one song would have done job better than both

similarities in gaga s vocals to those of singer lana del rey she felt that gaga plowed into gypsy with aplomb of a vegas lounge goddess from future girl hit her notes and well and i d take gypsy over applause or born this way any day of week but gypsy on snl was a bit of a confusing display from beginning to end gypsy was performed on howard stern show on november 12 2013 during her second thanksgiving television special lady gaga and muppets holiday spectacular which aired on abc gaga sang gypsy as a duet with kermit frog myles mcnutt of a v club criticised performance saying that
