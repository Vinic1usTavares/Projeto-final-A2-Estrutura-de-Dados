nearby confederate capital of richmond from assaults by overwhelmingly superior union army forces his influence over confederate strategy was lessened by his poor professional relationships with president jefferson davis and other senior generals and officials in april 1865 beauregard and his commander general joseph e johnston convinced davis and remaining cabinet members that war needed to end johnston surrendered most of remaining armies of confederacy including beauregard and his men to major general william tecumseh sherman following his military career beauregard returned to

which he convinced assembled general officers to change their plan for attacking fortress of chapultepec he was one of first officers to enter mexico city beauregard considered his contributions in dangerous reconnaissance missions and devising strategy for his superiors to be more significant than those of his engineer colleague captain robert e lee so he was disappointed when lee and other officers received more than he did williams pp 13 33 woodworth p 73 beauregard returned from mexico in 1848 for next 12 years he was in charge of what engineer department called mississippi and lake

beauregard obtained an appointment as superintendent of u s military academy on january 23 1861 his orders were revoked and he relinquished office after only five days when louisiana seceded from

authorities which included further strengthening forts st philip and jackson which guarded mississippi approaches to new orleans he hoped to be named commander of state army but was disappointed that state legislature appointed braxton bragg aware that beauregard might resent him bragg offered him rank of colonel instead beauregard enrolled as a private in orleans guards a battalion of french creole aristocrats at same time he communicated with slidell and newly chosen president davis angling for a senior position in new confederate states army rumors that beauregard would be placed in charge of entire army infuriated bragg concerned about political situation regarding federal presence at fort sumter in charleston harbor davis selected beauregard to take command of charleston s defenses beauregard seemed perfect combination of military engineer and charismatic southern leader needed at that time and place williams pp 47 50 hattaway taylor p 21 woodworth p 75 beauregard became one of most frequently described generals in confederate chronicles and almost every observer noted his foreign french visage williams p 55 his comportment was courteous grave sometimes reserved and severe sometimes abrupt with people who displeased him associates would see him go months without smiling williams p 56 57 many who saw him thought he looked like a french marshal or like napoleon in a gray uniform which was what he wanted them to think williams p 57 because he was french and seemed different he was victim of all kind of rumors most of them baseless charge of immorality was of course inevitable some soldiers believed that he was accompanied by a train of concubines and wagons loaded with cases of champagne even in louisiana it was said by non creoles that he was unfaithful to his wife infidelity being allegedly a creole characteristic williams p 58 beauregard s military retinue was a wonderful collection in itself to inspire rumor his staff glittered with former governors and senators serving as voluntary aides williams p 59 a prominent member of beauregard s entourage was frederick marinnis a slave whom beauregard hired from a south carolinian woman whom he personally described as being a very intelligent fellow williams p 60 marinnis would comport himself with an air of importance and would talk liberally about general beauregard s future plans and was his confidant another eminent camp follower was a young spaniard who served as beauregard s barber and valet beauregard became first confederate general officer appointed a brigadier general in provisional army of confederate states on march 1 1861 on july 21 he was promoted to full general in confederate army one of only seven appointed to that rank his date of rank made him

display a great deal in way of zeal and energy but little professional knowledge and experience hattaway taylor p 21 major robert anderson at fort sumter wrote to washington d c that beauregard who had been his student at west point in 1837 fort sumter brochure national park service united states department of interior would guarantee that south carolina s actions be exercised with skill and sound judgment beauregard wrote to first confederate capital of montgomery alabama that anderson was a most gallant officer he sent several cases of fine brandy and whiskey and boxes of cigars to anderson and his officers at sumter but anderson ordered that gifts be returned detzer allegiance p 208 by early april political tensions were mounting and beauregard demanded that sumter surrender before a planned union expedition to re provision fort could arrive early on morning of april 12 negotiations with anderson had failed and aides of beauregard sent to deal personally with anderson ordered first shots of american civil war to be fired from nearby fort johnson bombardment of fort sumter lasted for 34 hours subjected to thousands of rounds fired from batteries ringing harbor

may 31 june 2 alexandria line june 2 20 and confederate army of potomac june 20 july 21 after first battle of bull run joseph e johnston merged his army of shenandoah with beauregard s and commanded overall force which was later renamed army of northern virginia beauregard persisted in calling his part of army army of potomac although he was in essence a corps commander in that army reporting to johnston until march 14 1862 of defenses against an impending federal offensive that was being organized by brig gen irvin mcdowell one of beauregard s west point classmates against confederate railroad junction at manassas beauregard devised strategies to concentrate forces of full general joseph e johnston from shenandoah valley with his own aiming not only to defend his position but to initiate an offensive against mcdowell and washington despite his seniority in rank johnston lacked familiarity with terrain and ceded tactical planning of impending battle to beauregard as a professional courtesy president davis considered many of beauregard s plans to be impractical for an army as inexperienced as confederates could field in 1861 throughout war davis and beauregard would argue about beauregard s tendencies to devise grand strategies based on formal military principles davis believed he lacked a pragmatic grasp of logistics intelligence relative military strengths and politics williams pp 66 80 first battle of bull run first manassas began early on july 21 1861 with an element of surprise for both armies both mcdowell and beauregard planned to envelop their opponent with an attack from their right flank detzer donnybrook pp 172 73 mcdowell struck first crossing bull run and threatening beauregard s left flank for a while beauregard persisted in moving his troops for an attack on his right flank mcdowell s left toward centreville but johnston urged him to travel with him to threatened flank at henry house hill which was weakly defended seeing strength of union attack at that point beauregard insisted that johnston leave area of immediate action and coordinate overall battle from a position to rear beauregard rallied troops riding among men brandishing regimental colors and giving inspirational speeches confederate line held williams pp 81 85 as johnston s final troops arrived from shenandoah valley confederates launched a counterattack that routed union army sending it streaming in disorder back toward washington william c davis credits johnston with majority of tactical decisions that led to victory judging that beauregard acted chiefly as a dime novel general leading charge of an individual regiment riding along line to cheer troops accepting huzzas of soldiers and complementing them in turn closest he came to a major tactical decision was his fleeting intention to withdraw from henry hill line when he briefly mistook advance of johnston s reinforcements for arrival of fresh union troops davis p 248 nonetheless beauregard received bulk of acclaim from press and general public on july 23 johnston recommended to president davis that beauregard be promoted to full general davis approved and beauregard s date of rank was established as date of his victory july 21 williams pp 91 92 after bull run beauregard advocated use of a standardized battle flag other than stars and bars confederate national flag to avoid visual confusion with u s flag alan reason behind stars and bars teachinghistory org accessed october 8 2011 he worked with johnston and william miles to create confederate battle flag confederate women visiting beauregard s army contributed silk material from their dresses to create first three flags for beauregard johnston and earl van dorn thus first flags contained more feminine pink than martial red williams pp 109 10 hattaway taylor p 23 however official battle flag had a red background with white stars williams p 109 throughout his career beauregard worked to have flag adopted and he helped to make it most popular symbol of confederacy coski p 9 as army went into winter quarters beauregard caused considerable friction with confederate high command he strongly advocated an invasion of maryland to threaten flank and rear of washington with his plan rebuffed as impractical he requested reassignment to new orleans which he assumed would be under union attack in near future but his request was denied he quarreled with commissary general lucius b northrop a personal friend of davis about inadequate supplies available to his army he issued public statements challenging ability of confederate secretary of war to give commands to a full general and he enraged president davis when his report about bull run was printed in newspaper which suggested that davis s interference with beauregard s plans prevented pursuit and full destruction of mcdowell s army and capture of washington williams pp 96 112 woodworth pp 76 77 hattaway taylor p 23 shiloh and corinth thumb map of battle of shiloh afternoon of april 6 1862 after beauregard took command having become a political liability in virginia beauregard was transferred to tennessee to become second in command to general albert sidney johnston no relation to joseph e johnston in his army of mississippi effective march 14 1862 two generals planned concentration of confederate forces to oppose advance of maj gen ulysses s grant before he could combine his army with that of maj gen don carlos buell in a thrust up tennessee river toward corinth mississippi march from corinth was plagued by bad weather which delayed army s arrival by several days and during that time several contacts were made with union scouts because of this beauregard felt element of surprise had been lost and recommended calling off attack but johnston decided to proceed with plan in battle of shiloh which began april 6 1862 confederates launched a surprise attack against grant s army of tennessee which despite days of prior reports of confederate troop movements were completely unaware that entire army of mississippi was coming right at them once again a more senior general named johnston deferred to junior beauregard in planning attack massive frontal assault was marred by beauregard s improper organization of forces successive attacks by corps in lines long rather than assigning each corps a discrete portion of line for a side by side assault this arrangement caused intermingling of units and confusion of command it failed to concentrate mass at appropriate place on line to affect overall objectives of attack in midafternoon johnston who was near front of battle action was mortally wounded beauregard positioned in rear of army to send reinforcements forward assumed command of army and johnston s overall western department officially designated department number two as darkness fell he chose to call off attack against grant s final defensive line which had contracted into a tight semicircle backed up to tennessee river at pittsburg landing williams pp 113 32 hattaway taylor pp 23 24 woodworth pp 99 102 cunningham pp 99 138 40 277 80 eicher p 124 beauregard s decision was one of most controversial of civil war numerous veterans and historians have wondered what might have happened if assault had gone forward into night beauregard believed that battle was essentially won and his men could finish off grant in morning he knew terrain to be crossed a steep ravine containing a creek named dill branch was extremely difficult and grant s defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in river unbeknownst to beauregard buell s army of ohio began arriving that afternoon and he and grant launched a massive counterattack on april 7 overwhelmed confederates retreated to corinth williams pp 148 49 woodworth pp 102 103 cunningham pp 323 27 grant was temporarily disgraced by surprise attack and near defeat causing his superior maj gen henry w halleck to assume field command of combined armies halleck cautiously and slowly approached beauregard s fortifications at corinth his action became derisively called siege of corinth beauregard withdrew from corinth on may 29 to tupelo mississippi he was able to deceive halleck into thinking confederates were about to attack he ran empty trains back and forth through town while whistles blew and troops cheered as if massive reinforcements were arriving beauregard retreated because of overwhelming union force and because of contaminated water supplies in corinth in april and may confederates lost almost as many men to death by disease in corinth as had been killed in battle at shiloh nevertheless his leaving critical rail junction at corinth without a fight was another controversial decision when beauregard went on medical leave without requesting permission in advance president davis relieved him of command and replaced him with gen braxton bragg williams pp 150 59 woodworth pp 103 106 cunningham pp 387 96 kennedy pp 52 55 return to charleston at beauregard s request his allies in confederate congress petitioned davis to restore his command in west davis remained angry at beauregard s absence and told him he should have stayed at his post even if he had to be carried around in a litter he wrote if whole world were to ask me to restore general beauregard to command which i have already given to general bragg i would refuse it williams p 165 beauregard was ordered to charleston and took command of coastal defenses in south carolina georgia and florida eicher 124 he commanded department of south carolina and georgia from august 29 to october 7 1862 and department of south carolina georgia and florida from october 7 1862 to april 18 1864 replacing maj gen john c pemberton latter was promoted to lieutenant general and transferred to command defenses of vicksburg mississippi williams p 166 beauregard was unhappy with his new assignment believing that he deserved command of one of great confederate field armies he performed successfully however preventing capture of charleston by union naval and land attacks in 1863 on april 7 1863 rear admiral samuel francis du pont commander of south atlantic blockading squadron led a union ironclad attack against fort sumter that was repulsed by highly accurate artillery fire from beauregard s forces in july through september 1863 union land forces under brig gen quincy a gillmore launched a series of attacks on fort wagner on morris island and other fortifications at mouth of harbor while rear adm john a dahlgren attempted to destroy fort sumter because latter operation failed successful seizure of morris island was not effective in threatening charleston reed pp 263 320 williams pp 177 96 wise pp 1 204 kennedy pp 191 94 during this period beauregard promoted innovative naval defense strategies such as early experimentation with submarines naval mines called torpedoes in civil war and with a small vessel called a torpedo ram a swift boat fitted with a torpedo on a pole projecting from its bow under water it could be used to surprise an enemy vessel and impale it underneath water line he was also busy devising strategies for other generals in confederacy he proposed that some of state governors meet with union governors of western states what are called midwest states today for a peace conference davis administration rejected idea but it caused considerable political maneuvering by davis s enemies in congress beauregard also proposed a grand strategy submitted anonymously through his political allies so that it was not tainted by his reputation to reinforce western armies at expense of robert e lee s army in virginia destroy federal army in tennessee which would induce ulysses s grant to relieve pressure on vicksburg and maneuver his army into a place where it could be destroyed confederate army would continue to ohio and induce western states to ally with confederacy meanwhile a fleet of torpedo rams built in england could be used to recapture new orleans ending war there is no record that his plan was ever officially presented to government williams pp 167 68 181 83 203 204 hattaway taylor p 25 while visiting his forces in florida which had just repelled a union advance at jacksonville beauregard received a telegram that his wife had died on march 2 1864 living in union occupied new orleans she had been seriously ill for two years a northern leaning local newspaper printed an opinion that her condition had been exacerbated by actions of her husband this so fanned negative popular opinion that 6 000 people attended her funeral union maj gen nathaniel p banks provided a steamer to carry her body upriver for burial in her native parish beauregard wrote that he would like to rescue her hallowed grave at head of an army williams pp 204 205 richmond in april 1864 beauregard saw little opportunity for military glory because he foresaw that there would be no more significant assaults against charleston and prospects for a major field command were unlikely he requested a leave to recover from fatigue and a chronic throat ailment but he instead received an order to report to weldon north carolina near virginia border to play a key role in defense of virginia his new assignment department of north carolina and cape fear also included virginia south of james river when he took command on april 18 he renamed it on his own initiative department of north carolina and southern virginia confederates were preparing for spring offensive of union lt gen ulysses s grant and were concerned that attacks south of richmond could interrupt critical supply lines to richmond and army of robert e lee williams pp 207 208 eicher p 124 as grant moved south against lee in overland campaign union maj gen benjamin butler launched surprise bermuda hundred campaign with landings up james river beauregard successfully lobbied with jefferson davis s military adviser braxton bragg to prevent significant units of his small force from being transferred north of richmond to aid of lee his timely action coupled with military incompetence of butler bottled up union army nullifying its threat to petersburg and lee s supply line now that this sector was stable pressure began to rise to transfer troops from beauregard s front to lee s beauregard did send a division maj gen robert hoke s to lee for battle of cold harbor but lee urgently wanted more and took step of offering beauregard command of right wing of army of northern virginia for his cooperation beauregard replied in a passive aggressive manner i am willing to do anything for our success but cannot leave my department without orders of war department williams pp 208 25 kennedy p 278 thumb beauregard s defense of petersburg federal assaults of june 15 18 after cold harbor lee and confederate high command were unable to anticipate grant s next move but beauregard s strategic sense allowed him to make a prophetic prediction grant would cross james river and attempt to seize petersburg which was lightly defended but contained critical rail junctions supporting richmond and lee despite persistent pleas to reinforce this sector beauregard could not convince his colleagues of danger on june 15 his weak 5 400 man force including boys old men and patients from military hospitals resisted an assault by 16 000 federals known as second battle of petersburg he gambled by withdrawing his bermuda hundred defenses to reinforce city assuming correctly that butler would not capitalize on opening his gamble succeeded and he held petersburg long enough for lee s army to arrive it was arguably his finest combat performance of war williams pp 225 35 gallagher p 90 kennedy pp 352 53 beauregard continued commanding defenses of petersburg in early days of siege but with loss of weldon railroad in battle of globe tavern august 18 21 he was criticized for not attacking more forcefully and he became dissatisfied with command arrangements under lee he hoped for an independent command but his desires were thwarted in two instances lee chose lt gen jubal early to lead an expedition north through shenandoah valley and threaten washington and davis chose lt gen john bell hood to replace faltering joseph e johnston in atlanta campaign williams pp 236 38 gallagher p 90 return to west after fall of atlanta in september 1864 president davis considered replacing john bell hood in command of army of tennessee and he asked robert e lee to find out if beauregard would be interested beauregard was indeed interested but it is unclear whether davis seriously considered appointment and in end decided to retain hood davis met with beauregard in augusta georgia on october 2 and offered him command of newly created department of west responsible for five southern states from georgia to mississippi river with armies of hood and richard taylor under his ostensible command however it was a thankless job that was limited to logistical and advisory responsibilities without true operational control of armies unless he should join them in person during an emergency nevertheless anxious to return to field he accepted assignment williams pp 239 42 woodworth p 293 hattaway taylor pp 25 26 major field operation of fall was hood s franklin nashville campaign an invasion of tennessee which he undertook under beauregard and davis orders beauregard always kept in touch with hood despite all obstacles facing latter general s way two would later develop a friendship lasting until hood s death in 1879 after which beauregard became chairman of hood relief committee he arranged for publication of hood s memoirs advance and retreat in order to care for orphaned hood children hood stephen m john bell hood rise fall and resurrection of a confederate general el dorado hills ca savas beatie 2013 pp 91 111 while hood traveled through alabama and into tennessee union maj gen william tecumseh sherman began his march to sea from atlanta to savannah which focused beauregard s attention back to georgia he was ineffective in stopping or even delaying sherman s advance he had inadequate local forces and was reluctant to strip defenses from other locations to concentrate them against sherman furthermore sherman did an excellent job of deceiving confederates as to intermediate and final targets of his march savannah fell on december 21 and sherman s army began to march north into south carolina in january also in late december beauregard found out that hood s army had been severely damaged in its defeat at battle of nashville there were very few men in fighting condition who could oppose sherman s advance williams pp 243 50 woodworth p 296 beauregard attempted to concentrate his small forces before sherman could reach columbia south carolina state capital his urgent dispatches to richmond were treated with disbelief davis and robert e lee now general in chief of all confederate armies could not believe that sherman was advancing without a supply line as quickly as beauregard was observing him do also concerned about what he considered beauregard s feeble health lee recommended to davis that he be replaced by joseph e johnston change of command came on february 22 and beauregard although outwardly cooperative and courteous to johnston was bitterly disappointed at his replacement for remainder of war beauregard was johnston s subordinate assigned to routine matters without combat responsibilities johnston and beauregard met with president davis on april 13 and their assessment of confederate situation helped convince davis that johnston should meet with sherman to negotiate a surrender of his army two surrendered to sherman near durham north carolina on april 26 1865 and were paroled in greensboro on may 2 beauregard traveled to mobile and then took a u s naval transport to his hometown of new orleans williams pp 251 56 eicher p 124 in august that year beauregard s house was surrounded by troops who suspected he was harbouring edmund kirby smith all inhabitants were locked in a cotton press overnight beauregard complained to general philip sheridan who expressed his annoyance at his erstwhile enemy s treatment america arrival of cuba manchester guardian september 4 1865 postbellum life thumb left beauregard later in life after war beauregard was reluctant to seek amnesty as a former confederate officer by publicly swearing an oath of loyalty but both lee and johnston counseled him to do so which he did before mayor of new orleans on september 16 1865 he was one of many confederate officers issued a mass pardon by president andrew johnson on july 4 1868 his final privilege as an american citizen right to run for public office was restored when he petitioned congress for relief and bill on his behalf was signed by president grant on july 24 1876 williams pp 257 61 beauregard pursued a position in brazilian army in 1865 but declined brazilians offer he claimed that positive attitude of president johnson toward south swayed his decision i prefer to live here poor and forgotten than to be endowed with honor and riches in a foreign country he also declined offers to take command of armies of romania and egypt williams pp 262 65 as a lifelong democrat beauregard worked to end republican rule during reconstruction his outrage over perceived excesses of reconstruction such as heavy property taxation was a principal source for his indecision about remaining in united states and his flirtation with foreign armies which lasted until 1875 he was active in reform party an association of conservative new orleans businessmen which spoke in favor of civil rights and voting for former slaves hoping to form alliances between african americans and democrats to vote out radical republicans in state legislature hattaway taylor p 26 williams pp 266 72 beauregard s first employment following war was in october 1865 as chief engineer and general superintendent of new orleans jackson and great northern railroad in 1866 he was promoted to president a position he retained until 1870 when he was ousted in a hostile takeover this job overlapped with that of president of new orleans and carrollton street railway 1866 1876 where he invented a system of cable powered street railway cars once again beauregard made a financial success of company but was fired by stockholders who wished to take direct management of company hattaway taylor p 27 williams pp 273 86 in 1869 he demonstrated a cable charles avenue streetcar line 1835 and was issued after loss of these two railway executive positions beauregard spent time briefly at a variety of companies and civil engineering pursuits but his personal wealth became assured when he was recruited as a supervisor of louisiana state lottery company in 1877 he and former confederate general jubal early presided over lottery drawings and made numerous public appearances lending effort some respectability for 15 years two generals served in these positions but public became opposed to government sponsored gambling and lottery was closed down by legislature hattaway taylor pp 27 28 williams pp 291 303 beauregard s military writings include principles and maxims of

immediately after civil war after being insulted and ridiculed in his own community losing right to vote and becoming outraged in learning that properties he owned before war just outside of city limits of memphis had been confiscated by freedman s bureau and developed into houses for blacks and a schoolhouse he wrote letters to his friend john slidell about his opinion on emancipated black population he wrote that colored people were inferior ignorant and indolent he predicted that in seventy five years colored race would disappear from america along with indians and buffalo and a more historically accurate one in which blacks would be controlled by whites politically blacks had not yet voted in south and it did not appear to him that they would williams pp 267 79 in following years beauregard s inflamed opinion of blacks changed in march 1867 radical republicans enforced black suffrage as many southerners became excited and resistant and beauregard wrote a widely published public letter that advised southerners to accept new situation he said that south could either submit or resist and that sensibly resistance is futile he saw that through colored right to vote and cooperation excesses of radical republican reconstruction like burden of heavy taxation could be overcome and create a better future for south his pragmatic change in opinion is illustrated when he wrote that negro is southern born with a little education and some property qualifications he can be made to take sufficient interest in affairs and prosperity of south to insure an intelligent vote

when asked if beauregard were weak rosecrans responded by side of lee certainly take him alone however and he strikes you as quick ready and incisive well a man of world a good business character a smart active frenchman but with lee he lee says shut door and beauregard shuts door interviewer asked if southern generals would really allow blacks to vote rosecrans responded by saying lee will not probably but beauregard will he is in favor of it and so expressed himself to me williams pp 280 81 dernier tribut by victor e rillieux 1893 french oh chez lui l on peut dire avec toute franchise qu
