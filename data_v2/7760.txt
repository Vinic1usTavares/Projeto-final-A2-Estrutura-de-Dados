dartmouth castle is an artillery fort built to protect dartmouth harbour in devon england earliest parts of castle date from 1380s when in response to threat of a french attack civic authorities created a small enclosure castle overlooking mouth of dart estuary this was intended to engage enemy ships with catapults and possibly early cannon and incorporated local chapel of saint petroc within its walls at end of 15th century castle was expanded with an artillery tower and an iron chain which could be stretched across harbour to a tower at godmerock this addition formed oldest known purpose built coast artillery fort in britain further gun batteries were added during french invasion scare of 1540s castle saw service during english civil war of 1642 to 1646 during which its vulnerability to attack from land became apparent resulting in gallants bower defensive work above it being used to provide additional protection in 1748 a new gun position called grand battery was added to castle equipped with twelve guns after years of neglect in early 19th century castle was upgraded in 1859 with modern artillery but defending port of dartmouth was no longer a military priority by early years of 20th century castle was considered redundant by authorities who opened it to visitors it was brought back into use during first and second world wars but in 1955 it was finally retired from service in 21st century it is managed by english heritage and castle received 37 940 visitors in 2007 history 14th 15th centuries dartmouth castle was built to protect coastal town of dartmouth in devon by 12th century town s harbour located in estuary of river dart was an important trading and fishing port able to hold up to 600 vessels it also had a reputation as a centre for both piracy and privateering particularly for its attacks on french shipping by 1370s during hundred years war dartmouth was a key target for french navy and crown repeatedly advised town to improve its defences nothing was done however until in 1388 john hawley mayor of dartmouth and a privateer was authorised by richard ii to raise funds from town for a new fortalice by sea to defend harbour thumb left remains of fortalice wall fortalice or small fort took form of an enclosure castle with a curtain wall protected by mural towers and a gate tower it was constructed on land in manor of stoke fleming belonging to carew family lent by them due to threat of french attack and was built around a pre existing chapel to saint petroc on site it held catapults to attack enemy ships and may also have been armed with early cannon and equipped with a chain to block entrance to harbour it did not see active service but may have deterred original plans of french and breton attack force in 1404 which under command of du chastel landed at sands instead where they were then dispersed by local militia carew family subsequently built a family house in an inside corner of fortalice in 1481 henry vii entered into fresh discussions with town about defences in 1462 crown had agreed to pay dartmouth ps30 a year to maintain a chain across harbour for twenty years and town were probably keen to extend this profitable arrangement before it expired henry agreed to pay ps150 over five years for construction of a new artillery tower with an annual subsidy of ps30 towards maintenance costs later increased to ps40 a year new tower was placed alongside old fortalice using stone from and kingsbridge and a team of up to 12 stonemasons project dragged on until fears of a french invasion grew in 1486 two great murderer guns were installed and by 1492 there were four murderer and twelve serpentine guns installed there tower was finally completed in 1495 with a protective chain linking to other side of river supported by small boats called where it was protected by a tower at godmerock another castle kingswear was also built by dartmouth on opposite side of estuary 16th 18th centuries thumb a depiction of castle in 1794 by paul sandby in 1543 henry viii allied himself with spain in a war against france despite henry s initial successes france and spain made peace in 1544 leaving england exposed to a french invasion backed by her allies in scotland in response henry issued an instruction to improve country s defences particularly along south coast dartmouth castle was reinforced by three new gun batteries two either side of gun tower and another lamberd s bulwarke positioned in south east corner of fortalice sir peter carew a soldier and local member of parliament for dartmouth opposed this final addition arguing that it trespassed on family s house within castle he seized castle and threw out town s officers a law case followed and in 1554 town regained property after carew fled county facing charges of treachery he returned in 1556 and retook castle eventually a reprieve was agreed under which town regained control of fortifications and carews continued to occupy house in 1597 with threat of a spanish invasion gun tower was improved and lamberd s bulwarke repaired two years later hortensio spinola a spanish spy described castle as being defended with 24 pieces and 50 men commenting that harbour was well protected and that inhabitants were warlike at outbreak of english civil war in 1642 between supporters of charles i and those of parliament dartmouth initially sided with parliament and castle was guarded by five men in 1643 prince maurice besieged town and castle was overcome by artillery positioned on higher ground of overlooking hill behind it an earthwork fort called gallants bower may subsequently have been built to protect this vulnerable position an alternative explanation is that fort was first built in 1627 and was simply brought back into use during conflict in january 1646 sir thomas fairfax led a parliamentary army to retake dartmouth he first took town then gallants bower before forcing surrender of sir hugh pollard castle s commander following day carews house was probably badly damaged during attack during interregnum gallants bower was decommissioned but castle itself remained in use carews house was pulled down a governor sir john fowell was appointed to run castle and local defences and to prevent smuggling charles ii was restored to throne in 1660 and initially granted dartmouth castle and former annual subsidy to town once again by 1662 however fortifications in dartmouth were garrisoned by a royal force of 23 men and sir john who continued in his post as captain and governor until 1677 fears of a dutch and french attack resulted in castle being maintained until 1690s castle was neglected at start of 18th century and a survey in 1715 reported that it was in a ruinous condition and that none of its artillery had been adequately maintained a renewed threat from france prompted fresh work in 1741 lamberd s bulwarke was strengthened and in 1748 government then renamed bulwark grand battery transforming it into a two tiered platform armed with twelve guns older parts of castle were retained by town and used primarily for accommodation and storage port of dartmouth began to decline in importance however with nearby plymouth taking over much of its former trade 19th 21st centuries thumb left traversing 19th century artillery gun on old battery roof dartmouth castle was garrisoned during napoleonic wars by volunteer dartmouth artillery unit but saw no active service at end of conflict castle s guns were reduced in number and garrison cut back to a single caretaker gunner in 1820 there were only two serviceable guns and in 1847 writer clarkson stanfield observed that castle while picturesque was not spacious and mounts but a few guns introduction of shell guns and steam ships during 1840s created a new risk that french might successfully attack along south coast and fears grew of a conflict in early 1850s further worries about france combined with development of rifled cannon and iron clad warships led to royal commission on defence of united kingdom being established in 1859 and expressing fears about security of south coast as a result grand battery at dartmouth castle was rebuilt and retitled dartmouth point battery with shell proof granite defences protecting three traversing gun emplacements for 68 pounder guns looking out to sea and two 10 inch 86 cwt guns on roof one small 8 inch howitzer protected entrance to harbour itself it was manned by three professional soldiers and a team of over fifty five reservists drawn from newly formed sixth devonshire artillery volunteer corps castle however was of low military priority only of importance because harbour might be used to as a staging post to attack plymouth and guns allocated it were old fashioned a further upgrade in 1888 again installed only out dated artillery pieces by 1909 bulk of castle was considered obsolete and war office transferred it to office of works who carried out restoration work and opened it to visitors it reentered service during first world war equipped with two quick firing guns to protect harbour but they did not see service during conflict after war castle was restored and leased to town who again opened it to visitors between 1940 and 1943 during second world war it was rearmed with two 4 7 inch 11 9 cm quick firing guns dating from first world war and housed in concrete gun houses to protect merchant convoys and philips shipyard castle was manned by members of british army officers lived in a nearby cottage non commissioned officers in castle itself and other ranks in 19th century fortifications and later in temporary nissen huts in 1955 castle was transferred back to ministry of works and repaired dartmouth point battery by now known as old battery was leased back to town for use as a restaurant and site was reopened to public in 21st century it is managed by english heritage with grand battery displayed as it would have appeared in 19th century it received 37
