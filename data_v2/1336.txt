wanted when crew was going by early working name spongeboy ahoy help wanted was written by series creator stephen hillenburg derek drymon and tim hill and animation was directed by show s supervising director alan smart hillenburg also functioned as storyboard director and drymon worked as storyboard artist hillenburg initially conceived show in 1994 and began to work on it shortly after cancellation of rocko s modern life in 1996 hillenburg s original idea for pitch was that writers would write a storyboard for a possible episode and pitch it to nickelodeon one of original ideas was to write an episode with spongebob and squidward on a road trip inspired by 1989 film powwow highway eventually idea developed while they were working on it but hillenburg gave up on storyboard idea for initial pitch crew resurrected road trip idea during first season and used a lot of ideas for an episode called pizza delivery originally character was to be named spongeboy and show was to be called spongeboy ahoy however nickelodeon legal department discovered that name spongeboy was already in use for a mop product this was discovered after voice acting for original seven minute pilot was recorded in november of 1997 upon finding this out hillenburg decided that character s given name still had to contain sponge so viewers would not mistake character for a cheese man hillenburg decided to use name spongebob he chose squarepants as a family name as it referred to character s square shape and it had a nice ring to it execs from nickelodeon flew out to burbank and we pitched it to them from storyboards we had squeezy toys wore hawaiian shirts and used a boom box to play tiny tim song livin in sunlight lovin in moonlight that comes on in third act we really went all out in that pitch because we knew pilot lived or died by if execs laughed when it was over they walked out of room to discuss it we figured they would fly back to new york and we d hear in a few weeks we were surprised when they came back in what seemed like minutes and said they wanted to make it derek drymon hillenburg and derek drymon had dinner and came up with idea for help wanted based on an experience hillenburg had in boy scouts hillenburg and writer hill worked it into an outline in summer of 1997 while pitching cartoon to nickelodeon executives hillenburg donned a hawaiian shirt brought along an underwater terrarium with models of characters and hawaiian music to set theme setup was described by nickelodeon executive eric coleman as pretty amazing when given money and two weeks to write pilot episode drymon and jennings returned with what nickelodeon official albie hecht described as a performance i wish i had on tape although described as stressful by creative director derek drymon pitch went very well kevin kay and hecht had to step outside because they were exhausted from laughing making cartoonists worried with a help from hill and art director nick jennings hillenburg finished pitch and sold spongebob squarepants to nickelodeon drymon said network approved it so we were ready to go in an interview with cyma zarghami she told their nickelodeon executives immediate reaction was to see it again both because they liked it and it was unlike anything they d ever seen before hillenburg said character construction in episode was loose but character development was already pretty strong design when crew began production on episode they were tasked to design stock locations where show would return to again and again and in which most of action would take place such as krusty krab and spongebob s pineapple house hillenburg had a clear vision of what he wanted show to look like idea was to keep everything nautical so crew used ropes wooden planks ships wheels netting anchors and boilerplate and rivets pilot and rest of series features sky flowers as main background when series background designer kenny pittenger was asked what are those things he answered they function as clouds in a way but since show takes place underwater they aren t really clouds since show was influenced by tiki background painters have to use a lot of pattern pittenger said so really sky flowers are mostly a whimsical design element that steve hillenburg came up with to evoke look of a flower print hawaiian shirt or something like that i don t know what they are either casting 200px thumb tom kenny voiced character of spongebob squarepants while drymon and hill were writing pilot hillenburg was also conducting auditions to find voices for show characters he had created character of spongebob with tom kenny in which he utilised kenny s and other people s personalities to help create its personality drymon said tom came in a few times so we could pitch him what we were working to help him find right voice tom had already worked on lots of other animated shows and steve wanted to find an original sounding voice voice of spongebob was originally used by kenny for a very minor female alligator character named al in rocko s modern life who appeared in episode dear john kenny forgot voice initially as he created it only for that single use hillenburg however remembered it when he was coming up with spongebob and used a video clip of episode to remind kenny of voice kenny says that spongebob s high pitched laugh was specifically aimed at being unique stating that they wanted an annoying laugh in tradition of popeye and woody woodpecker kenny also provided voice of gary spongebob s meowing sea snail and narrator in episode according to him it was always steve s intention that narrator be a nod to his beloved jacques cousteau kenny described cousteau s voice as very dispassionate very removed very flatline even when he s describing something miraculous and beautiful at first they found that narrator just sounds bored so they decided that he has to sound a little fun and playful kenny said eet ees most amazing thing i have ever seen in my life we found that after a while we had to make narrator a little more playful than that bill fagerbakke voiced spongebob s best friend a starfish named patrick star in episode he auditioned for role after kenny had been cast as spongebob fagerbakke said steve is such a lovely guy and i had absolutely no feeling for material whatsoever he described his experience in audition saying i was just going in for another audition and i had no idea what was in store there in terms of remarkable visual wit and really kind of endearing child like humanity in show i couldn t pick that up from audition material at all i was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give guy what he wanted for part of squidward hillenburg originally had mr lawrence in mind for role lawrence worked with hillenburg and drymon before on rocko s modern life so while working on episode hillenburg invited him to audition for all characters drymon said we were showing doug storyboard and he started reading back to us in his tony tiger gregory peck voice it was really funny and we wound up having spongebob use a deep voice when he entered krusty krab for first time hillenburg decided to give lawrence part of series villain plankton instead music thumb 160px left tiny tim s song livin in sunlight lovin in moonlight was featured in episode episode features song called livin in sunlight lovin in moonlight by tiny tim at point pilot had already been completed music editor nick carr was asked to retool existing music on it carr said when i first started on spongebob my duties were mainly music editorial but would quickly thrust me into composers supervisor chair production team had no budget and no music but they placed budget on song called livin in sunlight lovin in moonlight carr said it is a sadly familiar scenario with most cartoons for television by time it comes to consider music budget is blown idea of using livin in sunlight lovin in moonlight originated when an anonymous sent hillenburg a tape with a bunch of music while writers were developing show outside nickelodeon hillenburg played song for drymon as an example of enthusiasm he was looking for when it came time to write pilot they had idea to use song in third act crew eventually got rights to use song for pilot but all they had was crummy copy on steve s old tape writers were able to use music as one of women who worked at nickelodeon at time knew somebody somewhere who had access to something and she brought in a copy of song on cd drymon said we were totally lucky that she had contact otherwise we wouldn t have been able to use it sad part was tiny tim died right around time we were writing pilot so he never knew we used his song jeff hutchins was with hillenburg in rocko s modern life working on animation sound hutchins was approached by hillenburg to do music for show he was asked for 20 things like an ocean liner horn and hutchins knew he had music hillenburg was looking for hutchins said i offered him options and in some cases multiple choices we agreed to meet at warner bros gate near water tower in 20 minutes he recorded sound to a tape and met hillenburg by gate hutchins said he was about as happy as you could imagine and off he went next thing you know i am working on show hutchins became regular series sound designer release
