imperial bedrooms is a novel by american author bret easton ellis released on june 15 2010 it is sequel to less than zero ellis 1985 bestselling literary debut which was shortly followed by a film adaptation in 1987 imperial bedrooms revisits less than zero s self destructive and disillusioned youths as they approach middle age in present day like ellis earlier novel which took its name from elvis costello s 1977 song of same name imperial bedrooms is named after costello s 1982 album action of novel takes place twenty five years after less than zero its story follows clay a new york based screenwriter after he returns to los angeles to cast his new film there he becomes embroiled in sinister world of his former friends and confronts darker aspects of his own personality novel opens with a literary device which suggests possibility that narrator of imperial bedrooms may not be same as narrator of less than zero although both are ostensibly narrated by clay in doing this ellis is able to comment on earlier novel s style and on development of its moralistic film adaptation in novel ellis explores clay s pathological narcissism masochistic and sadistic tendencies and exploitative personality which had been less explicit in less than zero ellis chose to do this in part to dispel sentimental reputation less than zero has accrued over years that of an artifact of 1980s imperial bedrooms retains ellis characteristic transgressive style and applies it to 2000s decade and 2010s covering amongst other things impact of new communication technologies on daily lives ellis began working on what would become imperial bedrooms during development of his 2005 novel lunar park as with his previous works imperial bedrooms depicts scenes of sex extreme violence and hedonism in a minimalist style devoid of emotion some commentators have noted however that unlike previous works imperial bedrooms employs more of conventional devices of popular fiction reviews were mixed and frequently polarized some reviewers felt novel was a successful return to themes explored in less than zero lunar park and american psycho 1991 while others derided it as boring or self indulgent background development of imperial bedrooms began after ellis had re read less than zero during writing of his 2005 pseudo memoir lunar park novel takes its name from elvis costello s 1982 album imperial bedroom just as less than zero had been named for a costello single upon reading zero ellis began to reflect on how his characters would have developed in interim soon he found himself overwhelm ed by idea of what would become imperial bedrooms as it continually returned to him after gestating idea and making voluminous notes ellis realised that his detailed outline had become longer than finished book he felt that this process of note taking limited him to novels that he genuinely wanted to stay with for a couple of years to this he attributed having written so few novels ellis described novel as an autobiographical noir written during a midlife crisis his most significant literary influence was american novelist raymond chandler citing his particular brand of pulpy noir fiction he found particular inspiration in opacity of chandler s fiction citing lack of closure in some of books which he called existentialist masterpieces he also admired cynical worldview that chandler created and his particular sense of style and mood in terms of his own plotting however he opined that plots really don t matter nor solutions to mysteries because it s mood that s so enthralling a kind of universal this idea of a man searching for something or moving through this moral landscape and trying to protect himself from it and yet he s still forced to investigate it part of impetus behind imperial bedrooms which ellis wrestled with was to try and dispel sentimental view of less than zero that made it to some an artifact of 80s alongside john hughes movies and ray bans and fast times at high he felt he began assessing audience s reactions to his work when working on lunar park on april 14 2009 mtv news announced that ellis had nearly finished novel and it would be published in may 2010 at time ellis revealed that all novel s main characters would return prior to publication ellis had been convinced by his persuasive editor to remove some of more graphic lines from imperial bedrooms torture scenes which he later regretted my most extreme act of self censoring in imperial bedrooms he said however was to omit a three line description of a silver wall because he felt that clay would never have written it ellis stated he had no plans to make changes to book as it stands in a second edition months prior to book s release ellis tweeted first sentence of novel they had made a movie about us random house website later announced on sale date of june 22 2010 in both hardback and paperback with it they released a picture of book s cover and a short synopsis which described book as focusing on a middle aged clay now a screenwriter drawn back into his old circle amidst this clay begins dating a young actress with mysterious ties to julian rip and a recently murdered hollywood producer his life begins to spin out of control imperial bedrooms biz in imperial bedrooms los angeles returns once again as book s setting it is along with new york one of two major locations in ellis fiction plot action of imperial bedrooms depicts clay who after four months in new york returns to los angeles to assist in casting of his new film there he meets up with his old friends who were characters in less than zero like clay they have all become involved in film industry his philandering friend trent burroughs who has married blair is a manager while clay s former classmate at camden daniel carter has become a famous director julian wells who was a male prostitute in less than zero has become an ultra discreet high class pimp representing struggling young actors who do not wish to tarnish future careers rip millar clay s former drug dealer now controls his own cartel and has become disfigured through repeated plastic surgeries clay attempts to romance rain turner a gorgeous young woman auditioning for a role in his new film leading her on with promise of being cast all while knowing she is too old for part his narration reveals he has done this with a number of men and women in past and yet often comes out of relationship hurt and damaged himself over course of their relationship he is stalked by unknown persons driving a jeep and is frequently reminded by various individuals of grisly murder of a young producer whom he knew as novel progresses clay learns that rip also had a fling with rain and is now obsessed with her when clay discovers that julian is currently rain s boyfriend he conspires with rip to hand julian over to him when julian is then found murdered rain confronts clay about his role in affair and is raped by him in response he later receives a video of julian s murder from rip which has been overdubbed with an angry voicemail from clay as a means to implicate him in crime novel then depicts sequences of savage sexual and physical abuse of a beautiful young girl and young boy perpetrated by clay clay experiences no feelings of remorse or guilt for this or for exploiting and raping rain in last scenes it is strongly implied that blair has been hiring people to follow clay in return for his giving her what she wants she offers to provide clay with a false alibi that will prevent police from arresting him as an accomplice to julian s murder characters much critical attention has been given to development of characters from original book 25 years on one review opined that ellis characters are incapable of growth they cannot credibly find jesus or even see a skilled psychologist or take right medication to fend off despair they are bound to be american psychos their development some critics have observed illuminates ways they have not developed as people clay is for example in mind and spirit if not quite in body destined to remain unchanged undeveloped unlikable and unloved in less than zero though characters of novel compose for some most hollow and vapid representation of mtv generation one could possibly imagine they remained to other reviewers particularly sympathetic like novel its characters were equally cultural milestones described by a reviewer as seminal characters of american fiction on subject of 1987 film clay describes that parents who ran studio would n t ever expose their children in same black light book did to bill this shows how children have become parents writing scripts and producing movies still imprisoned by hollywood s youth and drug cultures but now looking at things from outside in eisinger comments for new york press that while they re in careers now and new relationships and different states of mind their preoccupations are just same clay protagonist of less than zero once a paralyzed observer is now a more active character and has grown to be a narcissist reason behind this shift in character personality was due to ellis s lack of interest in other characters thus solipsism is mirrored in fiction for ellis this became an exploration of intense narcissism in 2010 clay is now a successful screenwriter with occasional producer credit he returns to la to help cast listeners reminiscent of ellis involvement with 2009 film adaptation of his short story collection informers now 45 and no longer a disaffected teen clay is described by details as arguably worse than american psychos patrick bateman ellis says that he would not disagree with this citing ambiguous nature of bateman s crimes in terms of clay s psychology ellis notes his preponderance for a masochistic cycle of control and rejection and seduction and inevitable pain which is something he gets off on because he s a masochist and not a romantic los angeles times notes how clay shares biographical details with ellis a successful party boy who in 1985 was often conflated with his fictional counterpart ellis asserts to contrary i m not really clay as opposed to his portrayal in less than zero clay is more unambiguously manipulative in bedrooms he is in ellis words guilty as in zero clay has stagnated in an impassive and jaded state abusing alcohol and sedatives such as ambien living with a kind of psychic locked in syndrome as in zero and psycho novel also poses question of clay s perception of reality independent asking is clay really being followed or is he being dogged by a guilty conscience for crimes committed even when they are crimes of inaction over novel clay shifts from damaged to depraved a final scene in imperial bedrooms of unremitting torture enacted by clay on two beautiful teenagers who are bought and systematically abused demonstrates clay s graduation from a passively colluding observer to active perpetrator who either indulges in torture or fantasizes about it novel is written in first person from clay s perspective clay who felt betrayed by less than zero uses imperial bedrooms to make a stand or a case for himself though ultimately reveals himself to be far worse than author of less than zero ever began to hint at clay still bears similarities to earlier character in less than zero according to one reviewer not all that much is changed clay is a cipher an empty shell who is only able to approximate interactions and experiences through acts of sadism and exploitation he is also in many ways a new character because opening of book presents that clay of less than zero had merely been just a writer pretending to be him when asked why he changed clay from passive to guilty ellis explained he felt clay s inaction in original novel made him equally as guilty it had always bothered ellis that clay didn t do anything to save little girl being raped in first novel independent notes his passivity in less than zero has hardened into something far more culpable and nefarious according to ellis in la over time real person you are ultimately comes out he also speculates maybe fear turned him into a monster ellis remarks that he finds developments in clay so exciting one reviewer summarized character s development nascent narcissist of less than zero is now left in a dead end novel is pessimistic presentation of human nature as an unflinching study of evil blair and trent burroughs share a loveless marriage blair remains according to janelle brown moral center of ellis work and trent has become a hollywood manager oregonian notes although blair and trent have children children are never described and hardly mentioned their absence is even more unsettling than absence of parents in a story about teenagers underlining endlessly narcissistic nature of characters world julian wells has gone on to establish a very exclusive escort service of his own in hollywood while in less than zero clay felt protective of julian who had fallen into prostitution and drug addiction in new novel he attempts to have him killed grisly dispatch of julian late in book and clay s casual mention of it early on were part of a rhythm that ellis felt suited book he speculates whether artist looking back becomes a destructive force he hadn t planned to kill off character just finding that while writing it felt right rip millar occupies both terrifying and comic relief roles in novel vice describes him as like supervillain of these two books uncertainties about character s specifics originate in clay who doesn t really want to know which makes it kind of scarier writing style writing for observer alison kelly of university of oxford observed novel s philosophical qualities and opined that its thriller style hints and foreshadowings form part of a metaphysical investigation kelly describes it as an expose of worst depths of human nature labelling it existentialist to extent that it confronts minimal limits of identity she further argues that novel s motif of facial recognitions amounts to message that people should be read at face value and that furthermore past action is greatest indicator of future behaviour leaving no room for change growth or self reinvention in terms of stylistic literary changes ellis also displays more fondness for pathetic fallacy than in previous works for most part novel is written in ellis trademark writing style lawson refers to this as sexual and narcotic depravities in an emotionless tone with regard to this style ellis cites precursors to himself particular work of filmmakers ellis feels that technique itself gives reader a unique kind of insight into characters and comments that numbness is a feeling too emotionality isn t only feeling there is in terms of style ellis told vice that he enjoyed his return to minimalism because of challenge of t to achieve that kind of tension with so few words was enjoyable to do while some reviewers of popular fiction derided ellis s style as flat others found it unexpectedly moving literary devices and themes imperial bedrooms opens with an acknowledgement from clay main character that both less than zero novel and its film adaption are actual representational works within narrative of his life movie was based on a book by someone we knew it was labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and our names weren t changed and there was nothing in it that hadn t happened los angeles times described this as a nifty little trick as it allows ellis to establish newer book as primary narrative one that trumps ellis as author and real world san francisco chronicle calls it a neat trick of authorial self abnegation another reviewer describes it as ellis at his most ambitious a philip doppelganger gambit making his new narrator real clay and other an imposter this allows ellis to skilfully with writerly jujitsu acknowledge robert downey jr s popular performance as julian in moralistic 1987 film in which he died ellis appreciates adaptation as a milestone in a lot of ways device also allows novelist to insert self critique sunday times reviewer notes that imperial bedrooms finds its characters still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies john crace in his digested read of imperial bedrooms insinuates through parody that author of metafictional less than zero is also meant to be ellis describing him in clay s voice as too immersed in passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote me into story as man who was too frightened to love with regard to opening narrative conceit ellis queries is it complication or is it clarification opining that it certainly is latter for clay even though ellis never names himself explicitly in book he conceded to lawson that one can guess bret easton ellis is who clay of imperial bedrooms is referring to ellis did however reveal that he had not decided when writing novel whether clay was referring to him or not eileen battersby likened bedrooms to lunar park 2005 cited his use of self consciousness as a device this device was picked up on by several other critics in particular vice noted that scatological violence of american psycho and otherworldly terror of lunar park had here been combined ellis himself raised sequel question commenting i don t think it is a sequel well i mean it is and it isn t it s narrated by him sure but i guess i could maybe have switched names around and it could stand alone asked about motif and casual approach to bisexual characters in his novels continued in imperial bedrooms ellis stated he really didn t know and that he wished he could provide an answer depicting him as extremely conscious of those choices he believes it to be an interesting aspect of his work details notes how ellis own sexuality frequently described as bisexual has been notoriously hard to pin down reviewers have long tried to probe ellis on autobiographical themes in his work he reiterates to vice that he is not clay ellis says that other contemporary authors naming michael chabon jonathan franzen jonathan lethem as examples don t get asked if their novels are autobiographical however ellis tells one interview that he cannot fully say that i m not clay because of their emotional connections vice attributes this streak to ellis age when less than zero came out which led to him being seen as a voice of generation ellis feels that autobiographical truths of his novels lie in their writing processes which to him are like emotional exorcisms crace s abovementioned parody suggests that less than zero clay was originally a flattering portrayal of ellis ellis discusses lightly kinds of self insertion present in book while clay is clearly parodically working on film adaptation of informers he is at same time fully aware that he has been a character in less than zero and that ostensibly ellis is author whom clay knew however there are clear differences to characters as well for example ellis had to omit lines from book he felt clay would never have thought of on subjects he would never have noticed ellis himself feels he is adapting to middle age very well clay however isn t imperial bedrooms also breaches several new territories when compared to less than zero its huge shift is a technological one novel picks up on many aspects of early 21st century culture such as internet viral videos which depict executions novel reflects how technology changes nature of interpersonal relationships additionally clay is text stalked throughout book ellis himself had been text stalked before in real life ellis feels this was an unconscious exploration of dynamics brought on by new technology author also predicts that fans of less than zero may feel betrayed imperial bedrooms thrust is its narrative of exploitation one reviewer describes novel s central theme as hollywood is an industry town running on exploitation and criticizes this theme for being unoriginal in 2010 an irish times review notes positively however that of society is bleak his dark studies of human animal as shocking as ever new setting poses questions such as is hollywood intended as a variation of ancient rome is movie industry a coliseum another review found that celebrity setting as visited before in his novel glamorama 1998 allows ellis to make a number of observations about contemporary pop culture via clay such as when he asserts that exposure can ensure fame ellis comments how in less than zero clay s passivity worked to protect him from bleak moral landscape he was a part of which he views as clay s major flaw ellis developed this into more unabashedly guilty clay of new novel ellis says that a portrait of narcissism was big nut that i had of entitlement this imperial idea difference he notes between this portrait of a narcissist and his earlier ones such as american psycho and lunar park come in form of its more moral bent this time ellis comments narcissist reaches a dead end to one reviewer clay s world at its most exaggerated in scenes of torture reach heights of dystopian fantasy comparing imperial bedrooms to brave new world 1932 where command economy now manifests as rampant late capitalist consumerism where ambien is new soma and humans are zombies one character s face is unnaturally smooth redone in such a way that eyes are shocked open with perpetual surprise it s a face mimicking a face and it looks agonized reception guardian attempted to aggregate what they found to be polarised reviews of imperial bedrooms noting that one times reviewer felt novel was simply dull impoverished and ghastly whereas london review of books felt that in spite of its flaws book was enjoyable for its beautiful one liners and fun of seeing old easton ellis magic applied to popular culture of our era iphones apple stores internet videos and lost new statesman compiled reviews from independent observer and new york times first two reviews are positive praising ellis modern noir book s atmosphere and indebtedness to philip roth and f scott fitzgerald with observer saying it ranks with his best in latter register of fitzgerald latter review accused ellis of falling flat attracting negative comparison to martin amis both have a flair for such perfect surreal description but struggle to set it in an effective context other writers attempting to gauge book s reception also describe it as mixed periscope press deemed that novel s reviews were mostly negative citing dr alison kelly s article for guardian as only counter example while deeming that it still read more like restrained criticism than outright praise on subject of reviews british critic mark lawson notes tendency for ellis reviews to be unpredictable he cited irony of favour amongst right wing critics and extent to which liberal media attack his work ellis himself however states that he proudly accepts label of moralist he also attributes some of negative criticism that imperial bedrooms and ellis earlier works have received in past to earlier schools of feminist criticism today he observes young girls reading works correctly opining books shouldn t be read through lens of old school feminism to that end author observes that older women reviewing imperial bedrooms in us had issues with it not least feelings of betrayal he feels these are ironic because book is in fact a critique of a certain kind of male perspective and behaviour tom shone writing for sunday times praised novel for its atypical qualities for ellis known for his orgies of violence shone asks why is a new sequel to less than zero so moving noting presence of feelings in novel to be starkly different from ellis usual style touching on its personal qualities shone notes if lunar park atrocities of american psycho back to their source imperial bedrooms pulls thread further and reaches less than zero emotive energy in new book is traced back to last pages of lunar park as well fellow writer jay mcinerney observes that last few pages of lunar park are among most moving passages i know in recent american fiction because bret was coming to terms with his relationship with his father in that book vice observes that final passages in both imperial bedrooms and lunar park pack a lot of emotional impact san francisco chronicle hails imperial bedrooms as very definition of meta ellis is either so deeply enmeshed in his own creepy little insular world that he can t write his way out of it or else he is such a genius that he s created an entire parallel universe that folds and unfolds on itself like some kind of escher print regarding book s achievement shone remarks he now stands at year zero creatively psychologically however typical features of ellis earlier works remain intact for example in its depictions of violence commenting on its self referential aspects janelle brown of san francisco chronicle recommends for his next endeavor ellis should stop worrying and start looking for exit of his own personal rabbit hole buffalo news awarded novel its editor s choice jeff simon comments that it brings an excessive flavor to obama america with regards to novel s writing style he comments first person sentences run on and on but individual sections of book are nothing if not minimal ghastly narcissism or not bret easton ellis has a fictional territory all his own and heaven forbid a mastery there wall street journal on other hand described this prose style as flat and such is book s violent aesthetic that for eileen battersby of irish times book is closer to his remarkable third novel american psycho she further compliments ellis as a bizarrely moral writer who specializes in evoking amoral concerning his writing she notes its despair is blunt factual and seldom approaches laconic unease of jg ballard following her positive comments however battersby concludes negatively book is a bleak performance a tired study of vacuous with feeling of an improvised screenplay being performed by an uncommitted cast she sums that ellis novel consists of too many doors being left slightly ajar and not enough rooms or opportunities being fully explored some critics have questioned book s relevance to a contemporary audience dallas news poses question whether imperial bedrooms is a story anyone is interested in anymore because ellis blunt spare journal entry prose is no longer in 2010 backstage pass it once was to lives of la s rich and famous furthermore tom maurstrad argues that since 1980s that decade has become a go to bargain bin for retro trends and ready made nostalgia easy to package into fashion lines and tv shows review bemoans that novel s theme dark side of hollywood is no longer a culture shocking revelation and that ellis fails to capitalize on conceit which it opens with maurstrad does highlight positive aspects however ellis wisely appropriates unblinking brutality of american psycho to add some dramatic heft to this anorexic update making sequel a celebrity snuff film to earlier backstage pass wall street journal damned novel as a dull stricken under medicated that goes nowhere boston globe reviewer opined that ellis is aiming for noir for territory of james and raymond chandler but ends up with an xxx rated episode of melrose place andrew mccarthy who played clay in 1987 less than zero film described novel as an exciting shocking conclusion a surprising one actor praised clay s character citing a wicked vulnerability which character covers up with alcohol hostility and its portrayal of a world full of pain and suffering and beneath glossy and shimmering and seductive veneer of hollywood mccarthy described his experience of reading book as like revisiting an old friend owing to consistency of characters and ellis voices possible film adaptation in may 2010 when mtv news first announced that ellis had finished writing imperial bedrooms writer told them in interview that he had begun looking ahead to possibility of a film adaptation and felt that interpreting it as a sequel to 1987 movie adaptation starring andrew mccarthy robert downey jr james spader and jami gertz would be a great idea two months prior to book s release less than zero actor andrew mccarthy stated it was early days in thinking about a potential film adaptation mccarthy felt however that novel would adapt well because characters in imperial bedrooms have been owned by 20th century fox since ellis sold film rights to less than zero prospective film for imperial bedrooms rights revert to fox ellis stated to vice in june 2010 that he would be interested in writing screenplay in july 2010 however author clarified to california chronicle saying there s no deal there s no one attached there s been some vague talk among cast members as far as i know right now nothing s happening ellis opines that were robert downey jr to get involved film would move straight into production however remembering adaptation process less than zero went through he admits i ve learned to be cautious about saying oh they ll never turn this dark depraved character into any sort of interesting mulholland drive david lynch kind of movie but i could be totally wrong about that i don t know references category 2010 american novels category alfred a knopf books category metafictional novels category novels by bret easton ellis
