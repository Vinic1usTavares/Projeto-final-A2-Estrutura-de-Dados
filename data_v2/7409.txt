easier to catch he could throw it in a quart cup but rogan was all over plate high low inside outside he d walk five six men but he didn t give up many runs bullet had a little more steam on ball than paige and he had a better breaking curve batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from plate and all of a sudden it would break sharply for a strike i would rank him with today s best i have never seen a pitcher like him and i have caught some of best pitchers in business lester 2006 p 91 another monarchs teammate george carr said rogan was greatest pitcher that ever threw a ball he had not only an arm to pitch with but a head to think with rogan was a smart pitcher with a wonderful memory once rogan pitched to a batter he never forgot that batter s weaknesses and strong points and don t think rogan was nicknamed bullet for nothing that guy had a ball that was almost too fast to catch he would really burn em in there as a manager he was a strict disciplinarian possibly a result of his military background carroll dink maintained that rogan wanted to run ball club like they did it in army he liked to give orders too much even before he was managing he used to bawl players out for different things i could take it but we had ball players when he d get on them they d go into a shell resented it and didn t give him their best another

man what i threw holway 1992 p 179 according to historian phil dixon in rogan s first few years as manager he was reluctant to pinch hit for many of veterans on his roster because they were his
