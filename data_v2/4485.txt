originally took place picard wakes up in present unsure if events took place or if it was as a result of his injury a number of previously screen used props were used including some from 1956 film ten

directed to chemistry between stewart and de lancie plot during a diplomatic mission captain picard is rushed to sickbay due to severe unexpected injuries after dying from his wounds he awakes to find

picard lost his original heart as a young officer when he was stabbed during a bar brawl an event he regrets but which led to him becoming disciplined and restrained man he is today when picard

is a junior science officer who has led an unremarkable career doing routine work picard consults commander riker and counselor troi who explain that his aversion to risk means he has never distinguished himself picard confronts q who tells him that although fight with nearly cost him his life it also gave him a sense of his mortality it taught him that life was too precious to squander by playing it safe picard realizes that his attempts to suppress and ignore consequences of his indiscretions have resulted in him losing a part of himself picard declares that he would rather die as captain of enterprise than live as a nobody q sends him back to bar fight and events unfold as they did originally with picard being stabbed through heart and laughing as he collapses to floor picard awakens in sickbay a captain again as picard recovers from his injury he wonders whether his journey into past was one of q s tricks or merely a dream regardless he is grateful for insight experience gave him production writing thumb right writer ronald d moore initially sought to base premise of episode on a christmas carol this was first time that ronald d moore wrote a q based episode and he was excited by idea of giving picard a near death experience and q appearing to captain as if he were god his plan for tapestry was to follow a similar path to charles dickens a christmas carol but with q playing a similar role to three ghosts in dickens story moore envisaged three stages to story one where picard is attacked and needs an artificial heart another with picard as a child and a third based on uss stargazer he pitched idea to executive producer michael piller who wasn t enthusiastic about premise combination of that disapproval and expected cost of filming because of additional sets required meant that episode had to be trimmed altman 1994 p 78 moore discussed idea with other members of writing staff they focused on incident which caused picard to require an artificial heart it had previously been mentioned in episodes samaritan snare and final mission they compared picard to captain james t kirk describing them as opposites in terms of development they saw picard being a during his time at starfleet academy only to become more serious later reverse was true for kirk with staff describing him as a bookworm while at academy and only becoming crazy once posted to a starship altman 1994 p 79 together they sought for a way to support picard s claim in samaritan snare that he laughed when he was stabbed story editor rene echevarria said that it made us all think we had really come up with right story for premise and tying that together i think it s one of finest efforts ever while moore called episode a q carol based on original premise piller was one to suggest tapestry as he said you have to learn to set your part of tapestry of your life altman 1994 p 83 however writers could not remember source of white room idea and it was only after episode aired that james mooring contacted staff he had submitted a spec script featuring a similar idea producer jeri taylor admitted that similarity was unintentional and after both she and moore spoke to mooring matter was settled mooring was paid and his contribution to episode was acknowledged by staff nemecek 2003 p 236 there were several changes made to script prior to filming including removal of edward as captain of enterprise in picard s alternative future and clarification that stabbing of picard was not major event in his life which boothby described in first duty casting and filming thumb left upright john de lancie made his seventh appearance as q during series in tapestry john de lancie returned to series in tapestry as q having appeared on a regular basis since his first appearance in pilot encounter at farpoint he had already appeared twice during 1992 93 television series as character both earlier in season in true q as well as star trek deep space nine episode q less de lancie thought that script for tapestry was terrific and praised speech he got to perform at end of episode appearing for first time in star trek was j c brandy as marta batanides she was nervous and intimidated to work with patrick stewart but said that everyone on cast and crew made her feel welcome however there were concerns when she first arrived on set for costume fitting as she looked quite young and stewart was worried about age difference on screen director les landau requested that hair and make up on brandy should make her look older brandy said that this worked nicely but they still downplayed sex she was pleased with her scenes with stewart as they managed to capture a nervousness and innocence in picard and marta s relationship altman 1994 p 81 episode marked first appearance of nausicaans on screen with clint carmichael playing lead alien although they had been mentioned earlier in episode samaritan snare two non speaking members of race were portrayed by stuntmen tom morta and dick dimitri two appeared on screen without make up in episodes a fistful of datas and emergence respectively a significant number of previously created costumes and make up were included in bar room scenes in tapestry there were notes from producers not to include any ferengi as at that point federation had not yet made first contact with them scene featured both anticans and selay close to one another despite being at war at time that this flashback scene was set and only making peace earlier in next generation in episode lonely among us several of glasses and other props in this scene were from a collection that paramount had stored from 1956 charlton heston film ten commandments there were problems with audio recordings of some scenes with stewart and brandy as camera dolly was noisy which required them to re record their lines later so that they could be dubbed over originals brandy was amazed that there was no difference she could tell in stewart s performance but felt that it took away an element from her performance scenes with q and picard together on a white background were compared to those in warren beatty and buck henry 1978 film heaven can wait by producer merri howard and director of photography jonathan west these particular scenes caused some problems as there were concerns by director of photography that q s white robes would not show up on camera well against all white background they were worried that he might appear simply as a floating head with both de lancie and stewart anticipating re shoots for these scenes they were both unhappy as they shot those appearances however this was filmed late on last day de lancie said that it resulted in both of them looking quite tired altman 1994 p 80 some scenes were cut in order to reduce episode down to required length this included a one page monologue by marta which would have taken place on morning after her liaison with picard a scene where picard was to report to la forge in engineering audio mention of dr and a mention of scobee hall a reference to dick scobee commander of space shuttle challenger at time of destruction of vessel themes michele and duncan barrett describe in their book star trek human frontier that tapestry has complex implications as it demonstrates who a person is by experiences they have had throughout their life as well as who that person truly is they also wrote that picard was not required to pay a price for his resurrection at hands of q due to popular narrative being what it is barrett barrett 2001 p 102 in atara stein s byronic hero in film fiction and television author describes tapestry as showing a change in q from his usual satanic stance and instead taking on role of picard s guardian angel stein also references alien s increasing influence on personal lives of enterprise crew a path which q began in episode hide and q stein 2009 p 149 reception ratings tapestry was originally
