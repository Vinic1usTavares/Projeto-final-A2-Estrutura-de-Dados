sputnik 1 or satellite 1 or ps 1 sputnik 1 or sputnik 1 elementary satellite 1 siddiqi p 155 was first artificial earth satellite soviet union launched it into an elliptical low earth orbit on 4 october 1957 orbiting for three weeks before its batteries died then silently for two more months before falling back into atmosphere it was a 58 cm 23 in diameter polished metal sphere with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses its radio signal was easily detectable even by radio amateurs and 65deg inclination and duration of its orbit made its flight path cover virtually entire inhabited earth satellite s unanticipated success precipitated american sputnik crisis and triggered space race a part of cold war launch was beginning of a new era of political military

would launch an artificial satellite four days later leonid i a leading soviet physicist announced that they too would launch an artificial satellite on 8 august politburo of communist party of soviet union approved proposal to create an artificial satellite on 30 august vasily head of state commission on r 7 rocket test launches held a meeting where korolev presented calculation data for a spaceflight trajectory to moon they decided to develop a three stage version of r 7 rocket for satellite launches right thumb this metal arming key is last remaining piece of sputnik 1 satellite it prevented contact between batteries and transmitter prior to launch currently on display at smithsonian national air and space museum on 30 january 1956 council of ministers approved practical work on an artificial earth orbiting satellite this satellite named object d was planned to be completed in 1957 58 it would have a mass of and would carry of scientific instruments first test launch of object d was scheduled for 1957 work on satellite was to be divided among institutions as follows ussr academy of sciences was responsible for general scientific leadership and supply of research instruments ministry of defence industry and its primary design bureau okb 1 were assigned task of building satellite ministry of industry would develop control system radio technical instruments and telemetry system ministry of ship building industry would develop gyroscope devices ministry of machine building would develop ground launching refueling and transportation means ministry of defense was responsible for conducting launches preliminary design work was completed in july 1956 and scientific tasks to be carried out by satellite were defined these included measuring density of atmosphere and its ion composition solar wind magnetic fields and cosmic rays this data would be valuable in creation of future artificial satellites a system of ground stations was to be developed to collect data transmitted by satellite observe satellite s orbit and transmit commands to satellite because of limited time frame observations were planned for only 7 to 10 days and orbit calculations were not expected to be extremely accurate by end of 1956 it became clear that complexity of ambitious design meant that object d could not be launched in time because of difficulties creating scientific instruments and low specific impulse produced by completed r 7 engines 304 sec instead of planned 309 to 310 sec consequently government rescheduled launch for april 1958 object d would later fly as sputnik 3 lanius et al p 38 fearing u s would launch a satellite before ussr okb 1 suggested creation and launch of a satellite in april may 1957 before igy began in july 1957 new satellite would be simple light and easy to construct forgoing complex heavy scientific equipment in favour of a simple radio transmitter on 15 february 1957 council of ministers of ussr approved this simple satellite designated object ps this version allowed satellite to be tracked visually by earth based observers and it could transmit tracking signals to ground based receiving stations launch of two satellites ps 1 and ps 2 with two r 7 rockets 8k71 was approved provided that r 7 completed at least two successful test flights launch vehicle preparation and launch site selection right thumb ussr miniature sheet depicting sputnik 1 orbiting earth earth orbiting sun and sun orbiting centre of milky way galaxy r 7 rocket was initially designed as an intercontinental ballistic missile icbm by okb 1 decision to build it was made by central committee of communist party of soviet union and council of ministers of ussr on 20 may 1954 rocket was most powerful in world it was designed with excessive thrust since they were unsure how heavy hydrogen bomb payload would be r 7 was also known by its grau later russian abbreviation for chief directorate of rocket forces designation 8k71

site would be collected at six separate observatories and telegraphed to nii 4 located back in moscow at nii 4 was a scientific research arm of ministry of defence that was dedicated to missile development siddiqi p 39 six observatories were clustered around launch site with closest situated from launch pad a second nationwide observation complex was established to track satellite after its separation from rocket called command measurement complex it consisted of coordination center in nii 4 and seven distant stations situated along line of satellite s ground track siddiqi p 162 these tracking stations were located at tyuratam sary in oblast and in krasnoyarsk krai stations were equipped with radar optical instruments and communications systems data from stations were transmitted by telegraphs into nii 4 where ballistics specialists calculated orbital parameters observatories used a trajectory measurement system called tral developed by okb mei moscow energy institute by which they received and monitored data from transponders mounted on r 7 rocket s core stage wonderful seven and first satellites at website of okb mei data was useful even after satellite s separation from second stage of rocket sputnik s location was calculated from data on second stage s location which followed sputnik at a known distance yu a memories at website of russian state archive for scientific technical documentation tracking of booster during launch had to be accomplished through purely passive means such as visual coverage and radar detection r 7 test launches demonstrated that

that were hermetically sealed with o rings and connected by 36 bolts it had a mass of hemispheres were 2 mm thick and were covered with a highly polished 1 mm thick heat shield made of an aluminium magnesium titanium alloy satellite carried two pairs of antennas designed by antenna laboratory of okb 1 led by mikhail v each antenna was made up of two whip like parts in length and had an almost spherical radiation pattern power supply with a mass of was in shape of an octagonal nut with radio transmitter in its hole it consisted of three silver zinc batteries developed at all union research institute of power sources under leadership of nikolai s two of these batteries powered radio transmitter and one powered temperature regulation system batteries had an expected lifetime of two weeks and operated for 22 days power supply was turned on automatically at moment of satellite s separation from second stage of rocket satellite had a one watt radio transmitting unit inside developed by vyacheslav i from nii 885 moscow electronics research institute that worked on two frequencies 20 005 and 40 002 mhz signals on first frequency were transmitted in 0 3 s pulses near f 3 hz under normal temperature and pressure conditions onboard with pauses of same duration filled by pulses on second frequency form of signals of first earth s artificial satellite a document at website of russian state archive for scientific technical documentation analysis of radio signals was used to gather information about electron density of ionosphere temperature and pressure were encoded in duration of radio beeps a temperature regulation system contained a fan a dual thermal switch and a control thermal switch if temperature inside satellite exceeded fan was turned on when it fell below fan was turned off by dual thermal switch if temperature exceeded or fell below another control thermal switch was activated changing duration of radio signal pulses sputnik 1 was filled with dry nitrogen pressurized to 1 3 atm satellite had a barometric switch activated if pressure inside satellite fell below 130 kpa which would have indicated failure of pressure vessel or puncture by a meteor and would have changed duration of radio signal impulse while attached to rocket sputnik 1 was protected by a cone shaped payload fairing with a height of fairing separated from both sputnik
