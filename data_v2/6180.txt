noted he was more frustrated about revelation that bernadette wouldn t allow strippers at s bachelor party as it is never explained why shaffer claimed that there were only a few laughs here and there and scored episode 5 5 out of 10 classifying it as mediocre carla day of tv fanatic gave a more positive review rating episode 4 5 out of 5 and praising penny s response to howard s apology and claiming that it provided a nice chuckle jill mader of inside pulse also gave episode a more positive review praising that episode ended with a really sweet moment for howard as after all he is a character who doesn t often get to be sweet and claimed that it was definitely about people changing and moving forward and big bang theory has done a great job of emotionally maturing many of their characters over past couple seasons despite this she said that episode wasn t as as she had hoped it would be and felt like there was more potential in howard s bachelor party than just revealing some unflattering secrets to bernadette robin pierson of tv critic rated episode as 56 out of 100 describing howard s little speech as very well written and performed however he considered most of comedy generic especially in regards to jokes about jewish stereotypes and penny s dismissal of leonard overall pierson said it wasn t strongest episode of comedy and wasn t a particularly interesting
