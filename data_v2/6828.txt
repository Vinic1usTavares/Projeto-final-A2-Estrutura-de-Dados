42nd infantry division murska was an infantry formation of royal yugoslav army that formed part of 4th army during german led axis invasion of kingdom of yugoslavia in april 1941 it did not have a corresponding divisional district in peacetime and was raised at time of mobilisation like all yugoslav infantry divisions of time it was a very large and unwieldy formation which was almost entirely reliant on animal transport for mobility and also lacked modern arms and sufficient ammunition commanded by divizijski deneral borisav ristic it was largely manned by croat troops many of whom saw germans as potential liberators from serbian oppression along with rest of yugoslav army 42nd infantry division murska began mobilising on 3 april 1941 and was still engaged in that process three days later when germans began an air campaign and a series of preliminary operations against yugoslav frontiers these attacks prompted desertions from division which increased over following days division briefly established a defensive line behind drava river then fell back towards bednja river to conform with withdrawals of flanking formations on 10 april 14th panzer division broke out of a bridgehead on right flank of division and by early evening it had reached zagreb following day german formations attacking from north had outflanked division on its left encircled it promptly surrendered almost all of croat members of 4th army taken as prisoners of war were soon released by axis powers background thumb left a map showing location of yugoslavia in europe alt map highlighting location of yugoslavia kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes was created with merger of serbia montenegro and south slav inhabited areas of austria hungary on 1 december 1918 in immediate aftermath of world war i army of kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes was established to defend new state it was formed around nucleus of victorious royal serbian army as well as armed formations raised in regions formerly controlled by austria hungary many former austro hungarian officers and soldiers became members of new army from beginning much like other aspects of public life in new kingdom army was dominated by ethnic serbs who saw it as a means by which to secure serb political hegemony army s development was hampered by kingdom s poor economy and this continued during 1920s in 1929 king alexander changed name of country to kingdom of yugoslavia at which time army was renamed royal yugoslav army vkj army budget remained tight and as tensions rose across europe during 1930s it became difficult to secure weapons and munitions from other countries consequently at time world war ii broke out in september 1939 vkj had several serious weaknesses which included reliance on draught animals for transport and large size of its formations infantry divisions had a wartime strength of 26 000 27 000 men as compared to contemporary british infantry divisions of half that strength these characteristics resulted in slow unwieldy formations and inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even very large yugoslav formations had low firepower generals better suited to trench warfare of world war i were combined with an army that was neither equipped nor trained to resist fast moving combined arms approach used by germans in their invasions of poland and france weaknesses of vkj in strategy structure equipment mobility and supply were exacerbated by serious ethnic disunity within yugoslavia resulting from two decades of serb hegemony and attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by central government attempts to address disunity came too late to ensure that vkj was a cohesive force fifth column activity was also a serious concern not only from croatian nationalist ustase but also from country s slovene and ethnic german minorities structure peacetime organisation according to regulations issued by vkj in 1935 headquarters of 42nd infantry division murska 42nd id would be created at time of mobilisation unlike most other yugoslav divisions 42nd id did not have a corresponding divisional district in peacetime and would be allocated units from other divisional districts and vkj reserve when it was formed division was named for mura river a tributary of drava wartime organisation wartime organisation of vkj was laid down by regulations issued in 1936 37 which set strength of an infantry division at 26 000 27 000 men a total of 11 200 horses and other pack and draught animals were required to provide mobility for each infantry division theoretical wartime organisation of a fully mobilised yugoslav infantry division was headquarters divisional infantry headquarters with three or four infantry regiments divisional artillery headquarters with one or two artillery regiments a cavalry battalion with two squadrons a bicycle squadron and a machine gun platoon a pioneer battalion of three companies an anti tank company equipped with twelve or anti tank guns a machine gun company an anti aircraft machine gun company a signals company logistics units each infantry regiment was to consist of three or four infantry battalions and a machine gun company and divisional artillery regiments were animal drawn and largely equipped with world war i vintage pieces an artillery regiment consisted of four battalions one of light howitzers one of or mountain guns and two of or field guns 42nd id was included on wartime order of battle in defence plan s which was developed by yugoslav general staff in 1938 1939 it was to be formed using 36th infantry regiment administered by savska divisional district with addition of 105th and 126th infantry regiments and 42nd artillery regiment attached from reserve planned deployment 42nd id was a component of 4th army as part of 1st army group which was responsible for defence of north and northwestern yugoslavia in event of mobilisation 4th army was to deploy in a cordon along western sector of hungarian border with 42nd id opposite hungarian city of nagykanizsa 42nd id was to establish positions between triple border with germany and hungary and confluence of mura and drava at with divisional headquarters at seketin just south of varazdin on left flank of division it was planned that detachment ormozski would be positioned west of varazdin and centred around ivanec and on right flank would be 27th infantry division savska 27th id positioned opposite hungarian village of only border guard unit in division s area of responsibility was 341st reserve regiment operations mobilisation after unrelenting pressure from adolf hitler yugoslavia signed tripartite pact on 25 march 1941 on 27 march a military coup d etat overthrew government that had signed pact and a new government was formed under royal yugoslav army air force commander armijski deneral dusan simovic a general mobilisation was not called by new government until 3 april 1941 out of fear of offending hitler and thus precipitating war however on same day as coup hitler issued fuhrer directive 25 which called for yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state and on 3 april fuhrer directive 26 was issued detailing plan of attack and command structure for invasion which was to commence on 6 april 42nd id had only commenced mobilisation and was largely in its mobilisation centres

south of murska sobota and at letinja further west on 42nd id s right flank german troops were also tasked to capture a bridge over drava at zakany in 27th id sector these local attacks were

mobilisation centres from their concentration areas during day yugoslav sabotage units attempted to destroy bridges over mura at mursko sredisce letinja and kotoriba these attempts were only partially successful due to influence of ustase propaganda yugoslav radio network in 4th army area was sabotaged by ustase on 6 april and radio communications within 4th army remained poor throughout fighting 7 april reconnaissance units of xxxxvi motorised corps crossed mura at letinja and mursko sredisce early on 7 april and captured cakovec 42nd id was ordered to urgently dispatch 2nd battalion of 36th infantry regiment from ludbreg towards koprivnica to assist 27th id in repelling expected german attempt to cross drava at zakany but this order was soon modified to require detachment of whole 36th
