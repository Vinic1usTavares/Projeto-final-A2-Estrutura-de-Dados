elizabeth canning married name treat 17 september 1734 june 1773 was an english maidservant who claimed to have been kidnapped and held against her will in a hayloft for almost a month she ultimately became central to one of most famous english criminal mysteries of 18th century she disappeared on 1 january 1753 before returning almost a month later to her mother s home in aldermanbury in city of london emaciated and in a deplorable condition after being questioned by concerned friends and neighbours she was interviewed by local alderman who then issued an arrest warrant for susannah wells woman who occupied house in which canning was supposed to have been held at wells house in enfield wash canning identified mary squires as another of her captors prompting arrest and detention of both wells and squires london magistrate henry fielding became involved in case taking canning s side further arrests were made and several witness statements were taken and wells and squires were ultimately tried and found guilty squires of more serious and potentially capital charge of theft however crisp gascoyne trial judge and lord mayor of london was unhappy with verdict and began his own investigation he spoke with witnesses whose testimony implied that squires and her family could not have abducted canning and he interviewed several of prosecution s witnesses some of whom recanted their earlier testimony he ordered canning s arrest following which she was tried and found guilty of perjury squires was pardoned and canning sentenced to one month s imprisonment and seven years of transportation canning s case pitted two groups of believers against one another pro canning canningites and pro squires egyptians gascoyne was openly abused and attacked in street while interested authors waged a fierce war of words over fate of young often implacable maid she died in wethersfield connecticut in 1773 but mystery surrounding her disappearance remains unsolved history background canning was born on 17 september 1734 in city of london eldest of five surviving children born to william a carpenter and elizabeth canning family lived in two rooms in aldermanbury postern a northern extension of aldermanbury that formerly ran from a postern gate on london wall to fore street it no longer exists in london aldermanbury was a respectable but not particularly wealthy neighbourhood canning was born into poverty her father died in 1751 and her mother and four siblings shared a two room property with james lord an apprentice lord occupied building s front room while canning s family lived in back room her schooling was limited to only a few months at a writing school and aged 15 or 16 she worked as a maidservant in household of nearby publican john wintlebury who considered her an honest but shy girl from october 1752 she lived at neighbouring home of a carpenter edward lyon who shared wintlebury s opinion of young maidservant canning was described as a plump 18 year old about tall with a face pitted by smallpox a long straight nose and wide set eyes disappearance canning disappeared on 1 january 1753 with no work that day she spent time with her family and made plans to go shopping with her mother after visiting her aunt and uncle alice and thomas colley but changed her mind and instead remained with them for evening at about 9 pm accompanied by her aunt and uncle for about two thirds of journey she left to return to her lodgings in aldermanbury when she failed to return to her lodgings at edward lyon s house her employer twice went looking for her at her mother s home mrs canning sent her other three children to moorfields to search for her while james lord went to colleys who told him that they had left elizabeth at about 9 30 pm near aldgate church in houndsditch next morning mrs canning also travelled to colleys house but to no avail as elizabeth was still missing neighbours were asked if they knew of her whereabouts and weeks passed as mrs canning searched neighbourhood for her daughter while her relatives scoured city an advertisement was placed in newspapers prayers were read aloud in churches and meeting houses but other than a report of a woman s shriek from a hackney coach on 1 january no clues were found as to elizabeth s disappearance reappearance canning reappeared at about 10 pm on 29 january 1753 at sight of her daughter whom she had not seen for almost a month elizabeth canning fainted once recovered she sent james lord to fetch several neighbours and inside only a few minutes house was full elizabeth was described as being in a deplorable condition her face and hands were black with dirt she wore a shift a petticoat and a a dirty rag tied around her head was soaked with blood from a wounded ear according to her story she had been attacked by two men near bedlam hospital they had partially stripped her robbed her and hit her in temple rendering her unconscious she awoke by a large road where was water with two men that robbed me and was forced to walk to a house where an old woman asked if she would go their way become a prostitute canning had refused and woman cut off her corset slapped her face and pushed her upstairs into a loft there young maidservant had remained for almost a month with no visitors and existing only on bread and water clothing she wore she had scavenged from a fireplace in loft canning had eventually made her escape by pulling some boards away from a window and walking five hour journey home she recalled hearing name wills or wells and as she had seen through window a coachman she recognised thought she had been held on hertford road on this evidence john wintlebury and a local journeyman robert scarrat identified house as that of mother susannah wells at enfield wash nearly distant her reappearance and subsequent explanation including assumption that she had been held at wells s house were following day printed in london daily advertiser she was visited by apothecary but with her pulse faint and so weak she could scarcely speak she vomited up medicine he gave her he administered several until satisfied with results following which canning was taken by her friends and neighbours to guildhall to see alderman thomas chitty to ask that he issue a warrant for wells s arrest enfield wash thumb upright 1 1 a plan of house of susanna wells at enfield wash from london magazine 1754 chitty issued warrant and on 1 february canning s friends took her to enfield wash despite her poor physical condition canning s supporters wanted her to identify her captors and room she claimed to have been held in and worried she might die before then took risk of moving her wintlebury scarrat and joseph adamson a neighbour were first to arrive on horseback they met warrant officer and several peace officers and waited for susannah wells to appear wells s house had served a variety of functions including that of a carpenter s shop a butchers and an ale house old woman kept animals in house and occasionally had lodgers she had twice been widowed her first husband was a carpenter and her second had been hanged for theft she had also been imprisoned in 1736 for perjury sarah howit her daughter by her first husband had lived there for about two years howit s brother john was a carpenter like his father and lived nearby when at about 9 am wells entered her house officers immediately moved to secure building inside they found wells an old woman named mary squires her children virtue hall and a woman they supposed was wells s daughter another woman judith natus was brought down from loft to be questioned with rest warrant officer who searched loft was surprised when he discovered that it did not resemble room described by canning and nor could he find evidence of her having jumped from window rest of party who had by then arrived in a hired coach and chaise were similarly surprised canning who had arrived in chaise with her mother and two other people was carried into house by adamson there she identified mary squires as woman who had cut off her stays and claimed that virtue hall and a woman presumed to be squires s daughter had been present at time canning was then taken upstairs where she identified loft as room in which she had been imprisoned although it contained more hay than she recalled boards covering window appeared to have only recently been fastened there with such damning evidence against them suspects were taken to a nearby justice of peace merry who examined canning alone and then those from wells s house squires and wells were committed former for removing canning s stays and latter for keeping a disorderly house george squires and virtue hall who both denied any involvement in kidnapping were set free canning and her supporters were allowed home fielding s investigation right thumb upright alt a half length monochrome portrait profile of an elderly man wearing a long wig henry fielding investigated canning s claims assault in 18th century england was viewed by authorities not as a breach of peace but rather as a civil action between two parties in dispute onus therefore was on canning to take legal action against those she claimed had imprisoned her and she would also be responsible for investigating crime this was an expensive proposition and she would therefore require help of her friends and neighbours to pursue her case an additional complication was that rather than send such matters to trial justices preferred to reconcile parties concerned therefore although it was state in which she returned to them on 29 january which most offended canning s friends it was theft of her stays valued then at about 10 shillings that was most promising aspect of case theft could be tried under a capital statute making assault charge less worthy of legal attention while canning s medical treatment continued her supporters mostly men prepared case against squires and wells they took legal advice from a solicitor a mr salt who advised them to consult magistrate and author henry fielding fielding was 45 years old and after years of arguments with other grub street authors and a lifetime of drink was approaching end of his life since taking sacrament four years earlier and becoming a justice of peace for middlesex and westminster he had with volcanic energy concerned himself with activities of criminals in december 1751 he had published amelia a story of a young woman dragged into vice and folly by her abusive husband although book was poorly received with his experience of criminology fielding believed he understood depths to which humans could descend thus when salt divulged case to him on 6 february fielding s curiosity was piqued and he agreed to take canning s sworn testimony next day although fielding was disinclined to believe a simple servant girl he was impressed with her modesty and genteel manner and issued a warrant against all occupants of wells s house that they might appear before me and give security for their good behaviour virtue hall and judith natus were thus seized but george squires his sisters and wells s daughter sarah howit had by then left house and remained at large early press reports london daily advertiser a grub street publication reported on 10 february meanwhile canning s supporters were soliciting donations through case of elizabeth canning an independently printed pamphlet designed to raise support for prosecution of her captors in case of wells was clearly identified as that monster of a woman and in an edited version which appeared a week later in public advertiser it was revealed that canning had suffered a fit after being struck on head squires was called an old gypsy woman who robbed girl of her stays and then in a miserable naked condition because she would not become a common prostitute confined her in an old back room or loft although squires was often referred to as a gypsy this identification had on occasion been called into question being named a gypsy could carry certain legal penalties and although these were rarely applied gypsies were nevertheless treated as moore 1994 described squires as a dark tall but stooping elderly woman with an estimated age ranging from sixty to eighty sometimes depicted as exceptionally hearty continuing all accounts do agree that she was an exceptionally ugly woman with a very large nose and a lower lip swollen and disfigured by scrofula therefore for a while public were firmly on canning s side an 18 year old servant girl threatened with prostitution and held captive by a remarkably ugly old gypsy of bad repute having escaped emaciated to return to her loving mother it was a story that vast bulk of general public as well as gentry found irresistible virtue hall s confession fielding prided himself upon his fairness no matter what social standing of witness he subjected hall to repeated questioning and frustrated at her contradictory answers threatened her with imprisonment this had desired effect because on 14 february hall stated that john squires son of mary and another man had brought canning to wells s house early on morning of 2 january there before two kidnappers lucy squires and hall old woman had assaulted canning and forced her upstairs where she remained until her escape hall said that fortune natus and his wife judith had been at house for some weeks but were moved into loft to make it appear as though they had stayed there throughout january hall s and canning s evidence now tallied almost perfectly and fielding turned to judith natus although she corroborated hall s claim that she and her husband had slept in wells s loft throughout january fielding was unconvinced and urged her to reconsider her statement although not charged with any crime hall meanwhile was committed to gatehouse prison in westminster her stay paid for by canningites fielding left london for a short while before returning to interview squires wells and others wells and squires denied any knowledge of canning or her travails and strongly protested their innocence this had little credence due to long standing habit of accused of breaking law and lying about it story as it had appeared in london daily advertiser had already aroused public s interest fielding had left london believing that he had ended all trouble which i thought it necessary for me to give myself in this affair but on his return he learnt that during his brief absence amongst others several noble lords had attempted to contact him on 15 february a reward was offered for capture and conviction of john squires and his unnamed associate also listed were locations at which donations could be left either applied to carrying on of prosecution or given to poor girl as a for her virtue and miseries she has gone through a rather embellished account of story was later sent to press george squires could not be found trial of squires and wells squires charged with assault and theft and wells with well knowing what her accomplice had done were tried on 21 february at session house of old bailey lord mayor of london sir crisp gascoyne presided over court with a panel of other justices including martin wright justice of king s bench nathaniel gundry

col 261 276 and case 532 col 283 680 1418 gallery was packed with interested spectators charge of theft was extremely serious value of canning s stays about 10 shillings meant that if she was found guilty squires would almost certainly be hanged at tyburn tree as she arrived at court canning was cheered by large crowd gathered outside building inside she testified that she was taken by two men to prisoner wells s house at about 4 am on morning of 2 january in kitchen old woman squires was sat in a chair and asked her if i chose to go their way canning s refusal had prompted squires to cut off her stays slap her face and push her up stairs into a darkened room she told court she saw nothing brought up but w hen day light appeared i could see about room there was a fire place and a grate in it no bed nor nothing but hay to lie upon there was a black pitcher not quite full of water and about twenty four pieces of bread about a quartern loaf she claimed to have escaped by removing a board from a window at north end of loft climbing out and jumping down to soft clay below she fled along a lane behind house through some fields and on finding a road set out for london when asked if she had seen or spoken to anyone on way back she replied that she had not explaining that she had shied away from contact for fear of meeting somebody from house she had escaped from canning was cross examined by william davy who questioned her recollection of events in house asked why she had not attempted escape earlier she replied because i thought they might let me out it never came into my head till that monday morning squires who had been quietly muttering to herself in dock shouted i never saw that witness in my lifetime till this day three weeks left upright thumb alt a half length

morning of 2nd of january and squires replied i return thanks for telling me for i am as innocent as child unborn susannah wells used opportunity to ask how long squires and her family were supposed to have been at house and was answered by hall they were there six or seven weeks in all they had been there about a fortnight before young woman was brought in amongst others thomas colley and mrs canning also gave testimony canning s former employer john wintlebury told court how he had deduced that it was wells s house where canning had been held mary myers and james lord also claimed to have heard canning say wills or wells as did robert scarrat a hartshorn and previously a servant in nearby edmonton who had visited wells s house on previous occasions although both were subpoenaed as witnesses neither fortune nor judith natus were called to stand attorney responsible later explaining that mob outside may have intimidated several witnesses susannah wells s neighbours were turned away by mob and her daughter and half brother were quickly recognised and stopped however three witnesses found in dorset by george squires to testify for his mother passed by unrecognised first john gibbons said that squires had visited his house in abbotsbury with handkerchiefs lawns and checks to sell about town from 1 9 january this was corroborated by his neighbour william clarke squires s last witness thomas greville claimed that he had accommodated mary and her sister and her brother under his roof in coombe on 14 january where they sold handkerchiefs lawns and such things this was contradicted by john iniser a fishmonger around waltham cross and claimed he knew squires by sight and that in three weeks before her arrest he had seen her telling fortunes in neighbourhood of wells s house wells whose witnesses had been unable to pass by mob outside was able to offer only two sentences in her defence she told court that she had not seen canning before 1 february and that as to squires i never saw her above a week and a day before we were taken up according to a contemporary report in london daily advertiser as three witnesses left court mob waiting in yard beat them kicked them rolled them in kennel and otherwise misused them before they suffered them to get from them verdict character witnesses in 18th century english trials were according to author douglas hay extremely important and very frequently used in character testimony too word of a man of property had greatest weight judges respected evidence of employers farmers and neighboring gentlemen not mere neighbors and friends jury were apparently unimpressed by defence s case and pronounced both defendants guilty they were sentenced on 26 february wells would be branded in her hand and spend six months in prison for stealing canning s stays squires was to be hanged by march 1753 pamphlets on canning s story were being read in coffee houses of london there was widespread outrage over squires treatment of her exacerbated when little a poor man who cries sticks about streets was supposedly robbed and then stamped on by five gypsies canning was celebrated by mob and gentry several of whom contributed to her purse enabling her to move to better accommodation in house of a mr marshall a in aldermanbury gascoyne s investigation right thumb upright alt a full length monochrome portrait of an elderly man wearing 18th century dress and a long wig sir crisp gascoyne was convinced that a miscarriage of justice had occurred not everybody was satisfied with verdict trial judge sir crisp gascoyne and some of his colleagues on bench found canning s story extremely unlikely gascoyne had been disgusted by canning s supporters who while outside court had prevented witnesses from giving evidence and he was particularly sympathetic to mary squires whom he named poor creature then 52 years old gascoyne had started life as a houndsditch brewer before he married daughter of a wealthy physician he had progressed through ranks to become master of brewer s company then served as alderman of ward sheriff of london and been knighted after presenting an address to king he had argued on behalf of city s orphans and was known for his benevolence in essex where he owned large estates gascoyne at once began a private enquiry and wrote to anglican minister at james harris he thought it unlikely that three witnesses found by george squires would travel so far to themselves on behalf of this miserable object and harris did not disappoint reverend was able to corroborate gibbons s testimony and offer new witnesses who could claim to have seen squires well away from enfield wash gascoyne also thought that some of canningites doubted girl s veracity and had colluded in her version of events to spite him this he thought was a political attack on a public official and he refused to let matter rest he justified his activities by comparing his apparent compassion for victim mary squires with his outrage for deceit of her accuser elizabeth canning but his fervour was influenced in part by attitudes of time he considered behaviour of canningites inappropriate for their low station and was more impressed by assurances of people such as alderman chitty and reverend harris who as gentlemen and public advocates were presumed more reliable gascoyne s colleague on bench mr justice gundry had written to undersheriff of dorset who knew john gibbons and william clarke undersheriff wrote back claiming that they would not have given evidence had it not been true clarke may have been in a relationship with lucy squires and claimed that he had stayed with squires in ridgeway fifteen prominent residents of abbotsbury including churchwardens overseers of poor a schoolmaster and a tithing man swore that squires were in dorset in january and that their witnesses were trustworthy men a further six abbotsbury men walked to sign an affidavit corroborating their neighbours evidence fielding and gascoyne had each issued contradictory pamphlets on case but it was virtue hall s testimony fundamental in prosecution of squires and wells which became central to gascoyne s investigation hall had given her testimony to fielding under threat of imprisonment and when by chance grub street writer john hill heard from a magistrate that she had showed signs of remorse he was presented with a perfect opportunity to settle an old score a prodigious writer and author of a renowned newspaper column inspector hill had squabbled with several of his peers notably so in fielding s case as fielding had closed that argument in his covent garden journal by stating that this hill was only a paltry dunghill and had long before been levelled with dirt supported by canningites hall was by then staying at gatehouse prison although still not charged with any crime hill immediately communicated his concerns to gascoyne who sent for young woman accompanied by a contingent of canningites her answers were at first noncommittal but once isolated from canning s friends she soon admitted to gascoyne that she had perjured herself she was committed to poultry where canningites continued to support her until they learnt that particular persons only were allowed to visit hall was again questioned on 7 march by both gascoyne and canning s supporters when asked why she had lied to court she said when i was at mr fielding s i at first spoke truth but was told it was not truth i was terrified and threatened to be sent to newgate and prosecuted as a felon unless i should speak truth she was asked by one of her supporters if she was still lying but her replies were deemed inconclusive and having confessed to and denied most of things about which she was questioned each side began to see her as a liability perjury reverend harris had several of his witnesses sent to london where they were interviewed by gascoyne in newgate prison on 9 march gascoyne also interviewed susannah wells who confirmed hall s new version of events he then performed several interviews from 12 13 march including fortune and judith natus and a witness who could cast doubt on john iniser s testimony gascoyne also asked george and lucy squires about their travels early in 1753 george was unable to recall all places they had visited and so gascoyne sent him to dorset to help him remember gascoyne then met with elizabeth long wells s daughter who had been prevented by mob from testifying for her mother and on 23 march three of canning s former witnesses expressed to gascoyne their doubts about young maid s story another witness who swore that squires had been in abbotsbury in january was interviewed two days later gascoyne instructed him to visit squires in newgate where two recognised one another immediately meanwhile john myles who had replaced salt and who now led canningites had been gathering witnesses who could claim they had seen mary squires in vicinity of enfield wash one said he had seen two men dragging a woman towards enfield early in january others told him they had on 29 january seen a miserable poor wretch travelling toward london myles found witnesses who claimed they had seen squires at enfield wash in december and january myles unwittingly made gascoyne aware of his investigation when he asked a john cooper of salisbury his opinion of seven of gascoyne s witnesses who claimed they had seen squires in coombe cooper wrote back affirming good character of thomas greville who had testified for squires at her trial but later sent same information to gascoyne offering his support at this point it appeared certain to gascoyne that canning had not told truth through january he thought squires had very likely been travelling through dorset hampshire and then london and had not been in enfield wash to kidnap canning on 13 march he therefore ordered canning arrested for perjury public spats gascoyne s investigation caused a press frenzy output of writers and publishers of grub street emboldened opinions about case and in some instances reinforced long held stereotypes of wicked gypsies and a poor innocent girl refusing to yield her honour canningites stirred up anti gypsy sentiment with a range of pamphlets and advertisements one of which named now deeply unpopular gascoyne king of reports began to emerge of sinister goings on one such claimed that several men on horseback threatened that they would burn all people s houses barns and corn thereabouts should squires be hanged right thumb upright alt a half length colour portrait of a man wearing a long wig various emblems are apparent on his jacket and his left hand holds a pole george ii issued a stay of execution on squires s sentence and later a pardon canning s honesty or lack of it and fielding s handling of case were raised in a deeply critical attack printed by london daily advertiser on same day that gascoyne ordered canning s arrest an advertisement appeared in public advertiser asking its readers to suspend their judgement in case of gypsy woman till a full state of whole which is now being prepared by mr fielding is published fielding had learnt of hall s questioning by gascoyne and had brought canning to his house in bow street to sift truth out of her and to bring her to confession if she was guilty satisfied with her account and unconcerned with hall his critique of squires supporters was published as a clear statement of case of elizabeth canning in which he espoused virtuous nature of young maid and attacked those her detractors copies sold so quickly that a second print run was ordered two days later john hill saw a clear statement as a direct attack on gascoyne and blasted fielding with story of elizabeth canning considered which ridiculed his enemy with such comments as who sir are you that are thus dictating unto government retire into yourself and know your station fielding however played little part in saga from thereon believing that canning s supporters had begun to see him as an obstacle to their case about half of those condemned to death during 18th century went not to gallows but to prison or colonies abroad although pardons were not common it was possible to bypass judge and petition king directly and although gascoyne had some concerns about character of witnesses upon whom he was able to call he nevertheless wrote to george ii to request that squires be pardoned on 10 april 1753 therefore king granted a stay of execution of six weeks while new evidence on both sides of case was sent to lord chancellor lord hardwicke and attorney and solicitor general squires would receive her pardon on 30 may 1753 but wells was less fortunate she served her sentence and was released from newgate on 21 august trial of abbotsbury men while squires s eventual pardon was being deliberated upon myles was busy building canning s defence he was far from complacent on 20 april he was in dorchester with a warrant for arrest of gibbons clark and greville three abbotsbury men who had testified for squires with a small armed party he captured gibbons and clarke at local inn and took them back to dorchester but his warrant was incorrectly worded and gibbons was released by justice clarke was taken to london and interrogated by myles at his house for two days but cordwainer refused to cooperate he was granted bail and returned to abbotsbury three were charged with wilful corrupt perjury and tried on 6 september 1753 at old bailey as lord mayor and fearing accusations of bias gascoyne excused himself from case defendants were represented by william davy who had earlier defended squires and wells over 100 people were present to testify on their behalf but canningites stayed away they were unaware of gascoyne s withdrawal and feared an embarrassing release of evidence to public from an appearance by canning they also kept their witnesses away with exception of one of mrs canning s neighbours none were present myles had not been paid by his employers and to delay proceedings his brother thomas sent a clerk to deliver to court a selection of writs but nevertheless gibbons clark and greville were found not guilty and released at this point canning had not been seen publicly for some time and she was proclaimed an outlaw when in november 1753 a new lord mayor was installed she remained out of sight but at february sessions in 1754 she reappeared at old bailey and presented herself to authorities canning s trial canning s trial began at old bailey on monday 29 april 1754 continuing on wednesday 1 may 3 4 may 6 7 may and ending on 8 may an unusually long trial for time during jury selection defence objected to three potential jurors much less than crown s 17 objections but were too late to argue choice of foreman who it was claimed had publicly called canning a lying b h a cheat or an imposter presiding over courtroom was new lord mayor thomas rawlinson crisp gascoyne s successor edward ironside having died in office in november 1753 with edward clive justice of common pleas heneage legge baron of exchequer william moreton

her indictment was read by clerk of story of canning s supposed abduction and imprisonment was retold by bamber gascoyne then davy spoke at length he attacked canning s story and told how squires and her family had travelled through england with smuggled goods to sell he offered new evidence to support squires alibi and canning s description of her prison before questioning her account of her escape he concluded with virtue hall s recantation of her earlier testimony willes was next to speak picking over discrepancies between various accounts offered by canning of her disappearance left thumb alt a sketch of a loft containing a bale of hay some implements on a wall and a window at end a contemporary sketch of loft in which it was supposed canning was held canning s defence began with opening statements from williams and morton latter emphasised her misfortune at twice being subjected to such anguish firstly for prosecuting her assailants and secondly for being punished for doing so he complimented jury and poured scorn on davy s allegations and seized upon prosecution s unwillingness to call virtue hall to stand morton highlighted how unlikely it was that canning could so profoundly fool her supporters and countered prosecution s complaint about canning s description of loft third attorney george nares concentrated on societal problems of prosecuting canning for perjury implying that other victims of crime would be less likely to pursue their assailants for fear of being prosecuted themselves morton questioned george squires who could not recall with absolute certainty path he claimed his family took through south of england while canning was missing his sister lucy was not called to stand as she was considered rather more stupid than her brother and has not been on road since their coming to enfield wash robert willis who had accompanied squires to retrace gypsy family s steps was also called to testify his evidence was judged as hearsay and ruled inadmissible as in trial of squires and wells reliability of prosecutor s witnesses was considered dependent upon their character three men from litton cheney testified that they had seen squires family enter village on 30 december three abbotsbury men then stepped up and gave their evidence 39 witnesses for prosecution were heard on first day alone most of them establishing briefly squires family s alibi at end of first day s proceedings mob outside expecting a short trial and a not guilty verdict were presented not with young maid but rather with crisp gascoyne infuriated they threw dirt and stones at him forcing him to retreat to a nearby inn before returning to court to escort canning away from building on 1 may therefore trial continued not with a resumption of first day s examination but with concern over attack on gascoyne a guard was found to protect him and jury a member of canning s defence was forced to apologise and canningites later that day printed a notice appealing to crowd to not interfere alderman thomas chitty was sworn in and guided by bamber gascoyne gave his account of his first meeting with canning on 31 january 1753 davy questioned several witnesses who described discrepancies in canning s account of her prison one of them told of his disgust at virtue hall s testimony against squires along with several other witnesses including sarah howit fortune and judith natus testified that canning had never been in loft before 1 february and that it was in fact howit and virtue hall who had been in loft in january end of day s proceedings was again overshadowed by mob outside and gascoyne was accorded an escort of a body of constables friday saw yet more witnesses for prosecution bringing total brought by davy to about 60 defence

seeking to establish whether or not she could have been sustained for a month by bread she claimed to have been given on third day of trial mrs canning was brought to stand one possible line of defence for her daughter was simply that she was too stupid to have ever invented tale but under cross examination by davy mrs canning demonstrated that her daughter was capable of writing a little this in davy s view was sufficient to demonstrate that she was certainly no imbecile scarrat was questioned next and admitted that he had been to wells s house before canning had disappeared two of canning s neighbours testified to her deplorable condition her employer was questioned as was her apothecary who thought that canning would have been quite able to survive on pitcher of water and

were illiterate and struggled similarly court also heard from three witnesses present solely to discredit testimony offered by final day s proceedings were taken up by davy who produced more prosecution witnesses and proceeded to pick apart testimony of those who claimed to have seen squires in enfield wash in january he summarised prosecution s case by telling jury that canning was guilty of most impious and detestable crime human heart can conceive recorder william moreton stated defence s case and asked jury to consider if they thought that canning had answered charges against her to their satisfaction and if it was possible she could have survived for almost a month on no more than a quartern loaf and a pitcher of water verdict repercussions later life jury took almost two hours to find canning guilty of perjury but not wilful and corrupt recorder refused to accept verdict as it was partial and jury then took a further 20 minutes to find her guilty of wilful and corrupt perjury crisp gascoyne was not present when verdict was delivered he had been advised to leave earlier to avoid any trouble outside court defence tried unsuccessfully for a retrial canning held at newgate prison was sentenced on 30 may by a majority of nine to eight she was given a month s imprisonment to be followed by seven years transportation according to state trials canning spoke and

gascoyne but mainly grub street press concerned itself with fallout from affair was filled with satirical letters between such authors as aristarchus tacitus and t trueman esq one such a called complained that without gypsies what would become of your young nobility and gentry if there were no to procure young girls of pleasure for them those on squires s side were not only ones to come under such attacks john hill wrote a short song celebrating his and gascoyne s role in affair and pictures of canning in loft her bodice loosened to reveal her bosom were readily available another showed wells and squires held aloft by a broomstick an obvious allusion to witchcraft gascoyne had stood for parliament during canning s trial but came bottom of poll to justify his pursuit of canning he wrote an address to of city of london from sir crisp gascoyne and suffered not only literary but physical attacks as well as death threats canningites published several responses to gascoyne s thoughts including a liveryman s reply to sir crisp gascoyne s address and a refutation of sir crisp gascoyne s of his conduct in cases of elizabeth canning and mary squires latter presenting trial as culmination of a gascoyne vendetta against canning canning held at newgate was reported to be in presence of methodists an unfortunate accusation for her side on same day this report appeared handbills were circulated asserting that rector of st mary magdalen had visited her and was satisfied that she was still a member of church of england among her visitors was mr justice ledinard who had helped deliver virtue hall to gascoyne ledinard asked canning to confess but was told by canning that i have said whole truth in court and nothing but truth and i don t choose to answer any questions unless it be in court again despite calls for clemency she was taken to convict ship tryal for her voyage to british america several threats made by ship s crew however meant she eventually sailed on board in august 1754 canning arrived in wethersfield connecticut and by arrangement with her supporters went to live with methodist reverend elisha williams she was not employed as a servant but was taken in as a member of williams family williams died in 1755 and canning married john treat a distant relation of former governor robert treat on 24 november 1756 had a son joseph canning treat in june 1758 and a daughter elizabeth in november 1761 she had two more sons john and salmon but died suddenly in june 1773 views and theories for georgian britain story of elizabeth canning was fascinating little attention was paid in trial to squires s request for canning to go their way according to moore 1994 overtly saga questioned canning s chastity while covertly it questioned whether someone of her social standing had any right to be taken notice of in view of immense interest taken in case this last seems unlikely author kristina straub compares case with more general debate over sexuality of female servants canning may have been either a childlike innocent victimized by brutally criminal outlaws or a wily manipulator of justice system who uses innocent bystanders to escape consequences of her own sexual misdeeds case of elizabeth canning fairly stated posited that canning either suffered imprisonment to protect her virtue or lied to conceal her own criminal transactions in dark straub opines that debate was not merely about canning s guilt or innocence but rather kinds of sexual identity that were attributable to women of her position in social order partisan nature of canningites and egyptians ensured that trial of elizabeth canning became one of most notorious criminal mysteries in 18th century english law for years case was a regular feature in such publications as newgate calendar and s registers artist allan ramsay wrote a letter to right honourable earl of concerning affair of elizabeth canning which was inspiration for voltaire s histoire d elisabeth canning et de jean calas 1762 who shared ramsay s opinion that canning had gone missing to hide a pregnancy case was revisited in 1820 by james caulfield who retold story but with several glaring mistakes throughout 19th and 20th centuries several authors offered their own interpretations of case caulfield s essay was followed in 1852 by john paget s elizabeth canning paget s apt summary of case read in truth perhaps most complete and most inexplicable judicial puzzle on record canning s trial was marked by prosecution s inability to find any evidence whatsoever that she had been anywhere but in wells s home and where canning was in january 1753 remains unknown similarly mystery surrounds precise movements of squires family when it was supposed they were travelling through dorset early in 1753 writer f j harvey darton suspected that family were smugglers and that it was significant they had passed through where isaac gulliver operated although gulliver was at time a child 18th century artist allan ramsay claimed that canning s initial story was exceedingly stupid and false he viewed lack of detail in her testimony as unsurprising to a more analytical mind us author lillian bueno mccue theorised that she was an amnesiac and that her former employer john wintlebury was to blame for her imprisonment at wells house treherne 1989 considers this theory very unlikely however and instead concludes that canning was almost certainly at enfield wash but was not kept prisoner at wells s home he suggests that robert implanted suggestion that canning had been held at wells s house as a useful decoy and that he had somehow been involved in an unwanted pregnancy treherne also suggests that canning was suffering from partial amnesia and that she may not have lied intentionally at trial of squires and wells he calls canning first media product although some early authors adopted same stance as fielding or hill who actively took sides in affair most later writers believe that canning did not tell truth moore 1994 however believes that canning was probably innocent moore explains discrepancies between canning and squires testimonies as understandable omissions and modifications and placing much emphasis on ability of those men in power to follow their own pursuits often at expense of others see also josephine tey s franchise affair 1948 based on
