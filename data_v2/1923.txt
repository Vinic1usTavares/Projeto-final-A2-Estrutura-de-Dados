stephanolepis cirrhifer commonly known as thread sail filefish is a species of marine fish in family monacanthidae it is found in western pacific in an area that ranges from northern japan to east china sea to korea other common names for fish include kawahagi kawahagi pi bo japanese and jwi chi korean fish grows to a maximum length of about and consumes both plant material and small marine organisms like skeleton shrimp s cirrhifer is host of parasite peniculus minuticaudae some minor genetic differentiation between s cirrhifer born in wild and those bred in a hatchery for consumer use has been shown fish is edible and sold commercially for culinary purposes in many asian countries taxonomy fish was first described in 1850 by coenraad jacob temminck and hermann schlegel when it was observed along with other fauna off coasts of japan they initially placed it in genus monacanthus as monacanthus cirrhifer however it was transferred to genus stephanolepis by david starr jordan and henry weed fowler in 1903 species name derives from latin word cirrhifer which means bearing fringes of hair other common names japanese kawahagi korean jwi chi english file fish fool fish porky russian small striped malyi description and habitat thread sail filefish grow to a maximum adult length of about first dorsal fin is a strong retractable folding backwards spine second dorsal fin and anal fin are soft they have comparatively small pectoral fins and truncated fan shaped tail fins dorsal and anal fins are colorless their second dorsal anal and caudal fins rounded in males 1 3 soft dorsal fin rays extended as filaments first ray has a particularly long thread fish have a small abdominal spike fish are colored from light brown to grayish to light greenish beige and are slightly patterned with irregular broken stripes that range from medium brown to blackish juveniles of species usually seek shelter and safety from predators within clusters of drifting seaweed adult thread sail filefish usually reside near seabed where depth is around fish migrate wholly in ocean waters between their feeding and spawning grounds which can cover a range of over spawning season lasts from may to august juveniles under inhabit shallow water and feed on small crustaceans mollusks and algae adult fish are mostly solitary and live among coral and seaweeds ecology thread sail filefish is an omnivore and can feed on plant or animal matter its diet includes kelp but consists mainly of amphipods such as gammarids and skeleton shrimp as well as seagrass species zostera marina fish also feeds upon smaller organisms including bryozoans and some species of serpulid tube worms thread sail filefish feed on fish amphipods isopods polychaetes pelecypods seaweeds such as those of genus sargassum and gelatinous plankton such as moon jellyfish aurelia sp and giant jellyfish s cirrhifer is host of copepod parasite peniculus minuticaudae which mostly infects fins of female fish thumb prepared as sushi uses thread sail filefish is cultured and sold commercially as food in asian countries including korea and japan demand for fish in korea is very high and fisheries often employ services of fish hatcheries for breeding more of fish to supplement and enhance supply of stock this has been done to such a degree that some as many as 95 alleles have been found to be unique to one of populations resulting from minor variations in certain genes that occur exclusively within either population genetic differentiation between s cirrhifer born in wild and those bred in a hatchery has apparently occurred references category monacanthidae category fish described in 1850
