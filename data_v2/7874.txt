enabled fellow front row starter nato to out brake him and claim lead going into sainte devote corner sirtokin then repelled an challenge from king over second place field avoided incident on first lap and top three of sirotkin nato and king pulled away from fourth placed evans over next few laps on lap six first mandatory pit stops to change tyres were made by giovinazzi ghiotto pic and kirchhofer in lower end of order meanwhile nato set consecutive fastest laps to give himself a lead of 1 2 seconds over sirotkin at start of lap 10 king was distanced by nato and sirotkin by lap 11 as sirotkin made an driving error and cut novelle chicane and lost time as a result rowland was challenging slower evans who straight lined novelle chicane at exit of tunnel to keep position evans was subsequently issued with a five second time penalty on 20th lap after stewards deemed him to have gained an illegal advantage left thumb upright norman nato pictured in 2012 came second after he lost feature race win to artem markelov in last ten laps of event meanwhile another vsc was triggered on lap 18 when gasly was trying to recover ground and mounted back of eriksson s car at la corner which

cleared from circuit at restart rowland quickly displaced evans and charged after leading trio of nato sirotkin and king more drama came on lap 23 when latifi was battling markelov for seventh and got distracted this caused latifi to clip barrier alongside circuit in tunnel and retired in pit lane with a bent front left suspension then as sirotkin was quickly catching nato his car got into an uncontrolled sideways manoeuvre after clipping kerb too hard at exit of la turn and he ran into wall for second successive feature race another vsc was activated to allow for a general cleanup and racing resumed on lap 24 on next lap a third vsc was required when jeffri crashed at la rascasse corner vsc was lifted on lap 26 competitive action lasted for three laps until a fourth vsc came about after king clouted a barrier alongside track he recovered to pit lane to retire markelov moved into lead when lynn rowland and evans pitted over laps 29 and 31 as nato s pit crew were slow installing his front right wheel set faster lap times than anyone else despite being on heavily worn tyres vsc was called out twice more for separate incidents that ghiotto caused on lap 36 as he left debris on racing line and then glanced inside barrier at loews hairpin markelov was main beneficiary of this as he was 15 seconds ahead of nato he was quicker than nato in tunnel and tabac turn while his rivals pace was limited since they were slower in track s tighter corners after restart markelov made his mandatory pit stop on lap 39 to switch onto super soft tyres he emerged just ahead of nato who could not overtake markelov on his out lap because five elongated race number of laps contested was lowered to 40 from 42 markelov s fresher tyres allowed him to hold off nato in last two laps and claimed his maiden gp2 series victory by one and a half seconds third was rowland and rest of provisional order consisting of lynn evans marciello giovinazzi kirchhofer matsushita de jong pic canamasas gelael

getaway and second placed kirchhofer was faster off grid and drew alongside him going into sainte devote corner however kirchhofer did not move into lead as matsushita repelled his challenge by staying on right and out braking him behind duo maricello went defensive against fast starting evans and nato went to outside of rowland to overtake him but he could not get past lynn as field were approaching casino corner from there on race settled into a rhythm as matsushita opened his advantage over kirchhofer to three seconds yellow flags were briefly waved by course officials on fourth lap as king was about to pass armand for 18th but he left latter without enough space to get by and put him into a wall at loews hairpin king incurred a five second time penalty for causing incident on lap nine further disruption was caused when gelael slid wide at sainte devote and crashed into a barrier which activated vsc sirotkin s poor season continued when on board fire extinguisher in his car was activated by debris from his tyre at entry to massenet turn on eleventh lap sirotkin s visibility was greatly hindered by foam on his visor and he came to a halt in escape road at casino square corner and retired at front of field kirchhofer took a second out of matsushita s lead under vsc only for latter to respond by increasing his advantage to six seconds by lap 15 it further grew as race progressed and kirchhofer was left to holding off third placed maricello nato and matsushita traded fastest lap as laps passed by with accolade being claimed by matsushita on lap 28 with a time of 1 minute and 21 554 seconds and earned him two championship points in a processional race it was matsushita s victory achieving his second win in gp2 series after 2015 hungaroring feature race and

upright oliver rowland pictured in 2016 took first podium of his gp2 series career with a third place finish in feature race top three drivers in both races appeared on podium to collect their trophies and spoke to media separate press conferences markelov spoke of his delight over claiming his maiden gp2 series win and that his team remained on soft compound tyres because his team deemed their pace was decent we really did a good job together to finish p1 in monaco and score my first victory in gp2 it s amazing i don t have any other words i m really happy nato who came second stated that he was displeased and angry over seeing markelov take lead of feature race as he did not feel need to change tyres and was urged by his engineer to pressure him i tried to overtake him before turn 5 and when i saw i couldn t do it i just focused on end of race p2 is better than nothing this race was for us today but it s still good points for team and drivers standings rowland said he was pleased with his third place result and was complimentary of his team it was a pretty good day it was just a bit strange when artem came out first i didn t expect that after sprint race matsushita called his monaco sprint race victory even more special than other circuits and revealed degradation on his tyres was low as he focused on race i m happy to come home with a trophy a victory here and some good points for team it was my first win in monaco so it feels special i led whole race i felt good in car so i m just really happy kirchhofer spoke of his enjoyment racing at monaco for first time and had not anticipated achieving a podium result at track i m really happy with p2 i had a good gateway at start but i couldn t overtake matsushita at first corner after that i was thinking to bring car home but we are all happy me and team with this result there s more to come third placed marciello called his race boring because he found it difficult to overtake kirchhofer and hoped for a safety car or an extended vsc nevertheless he said he was still happy with result and wanted to continue form into baku round it s still a good weekend with artem s p1 yesterday and my podium today but we need to improve during qualifying our car is really good in long runs and we have good pace so our goal is to improve during qualifying session technical director of racing engineering sebastien explained his team visited stewards for several hours after feature race to understand how nato lost chance of victory this showed how wrong things went for us with multiple virtual safety cars basically markelov was very lucky as he took vsc on slow zones of track where he was not losing time and norman and others took it on fast zones which resulted in huge time losses despite vsc allowing markelov to increase his advantage upfront svetlana team principal of russian time said she felt they were within regulations we led by 15 seconds over nato but question is where did other 15 seconds come that we could stop and rejoin first but there was vsc six seconds to turn it off six seconds to turn it on and each driver reacts in a different way they press button at moment that engineer says on radio and car is running full speed again valentin of motorsport com wrote that changes in gap were unlikely to account for markelov s reaction time but for where on track vsc was activated as some drivers slowed to a different extent he also noted suggestions that any protest against markelov s victory would be unsuccessful nato left monaco as leader of drivers championship with 49 points and markelov s feature race victory moved him to second with just one point separating two drivers lynn s results allowed him to maintain third in standings with 41 points while previous championship leader gasly fell to fourth with 33 and marciello rounded out top five with 28 in teams championship russian time moved from fourth to take lead with 76 points and racing
