thumb 300px an 1887 cricket match in progress at sydney s association ground site of riot sydney riot of 1879 was an instance of civil disorder that occurred at an early international cricket match it took place on 8 february 1879 at what is now sydney cricket ground at time known as association ground during a match between new south wales captained by dave gregory and a touring english team captained by lord harris riot was sparked by a controversial umpiring decision when star australian batsman billy murdoch was given out by george coulthard a victorian employed by englishmen dismissal caused an uproar among spectators many of whom surged onto pitch and assaulted coulthard and some english players it was alleged that illegal gamblers in new south wales pavilion who had bet heavily on home side encouraged riot because tourists were in a dominant position and looked set to win another theory given to explain anger was that of intercolonial rivalry that new south wales crowd objected to what they perceived to be a slight from a victorian umpire pitch invasion occurred while gregory halted match by not sending out a replacement for murdoch new south wales skipper called on lord harris to remove umpire coulthard whom he considered to be inept or biased but his english counterpart declined other umpire edmund barton defended coulthard and lord harris saying that decision against murdoch was correct and that english had conducted themselves appropriately eventually gregory agreed to resume match without removal of coulthard however crowd continued to disrupt proceedings and play was abandoned for day upon resumption after sunday rest day lord harris s men won convincingly by an innings in immediate aftermath of riot england team cancelled remaining games they were scheduled to play in sydney incident also caused much press comment in england and australia in australia newspapers were united in condemning unrest viewing chaos as a national humiliation and a public relations disaster an open letter by lord harris about incident was later published in english newspapers and caused fresh outrage in new south wales when it was reprinted by australian newspapers a defensive letter written in response by new south wales cricket association further damaged relations affair led to a breakdown of goodwill that threatened future of anglo australian cricket relations however friction between cricketing authorities finally eased when lord harris agreed to lead an england representative side at oval in london against touring australians in 1880 this match became fourth ever test and cemented tradition of anglo australian test matches background thumb upright alt black and white photograph of head and shoulders of a bearded man wearing a striped top dave gregory captain of new south wales england cricket tours to australia started in 1861 and while successful were still in their infancy in 1879 despite first test match having been played in 1877 teams were of variable quality while promoters sought best cricketers they still had to agree to terms in addition many could not afford time for long boat trip tour itself and return voyage journey itself often took up to two months aside from a tour by an australian aboriginal team in 1868 dave gregory led campaign in 1878 was first major australian tour to england tour was generally regarded as a success a highlight was australians famous victory over a very strong marylebone cricket club outfit which included w g grace dominant cricketer of 19th century in less than four hours keen to make most of this success melbourne cricket club australian board of control for international cricket was not created until 1905 invited lord harris an eminent amateur cricketer of time to lead a team to australia team was originally meant to be entirely amateur but two professional yorkshire bowlers george ulyett and tom emmett joined tour team after two middlesex players had to withdraw due to a bereavement main distinction between amateurs and professionals was social status and although amateurs were not paid for playing they did receive generous expenses which usually exceeded anything they would have been paid as professionals despite presence of two professionals in team englishmen were described as gentlemen a euphemism for amateurs now that ulyett and emmett were in team they did a large part of bowling and commentators felt that harris had overworked them at time english cricket was dominated by amateurs generally educated in public schools such as harrow and eton and universities such as oxford and cambridge to them sport was in a large part a social leisure pursuit in contrast australians were regarded by social standards of 19th century as coarse rowdy and uncultured likes of bushranger ned kelly heightened perceptions that australia had a bandit culture violence heckling and abusive chanting among drunken spectators and gamblers at sporting grounds were commonplace in 19th century australia and prevalence of betting was seen as a major cause of crowd unrest there were many instances of concerning player behaviour during 1878 tour of england and gregory s men were considered to be unrefined and raucous cheating was a regular occurrence in 19th century australian cricket and inter colonial rivalry was strong modern states of australia were separate colonies until their federation in 1901 as in real life sporting rivalry was at its most bitter between two most populous and politically powerful colonies new south wales and victoria endless dispute between colonies over whether sydney or melbourne would be capital of australia eventually forced compromise that saw construction of canberra midway between two cities with regards to sport cricket administrators from both colonies sought to undermine their cross border counterparts on field matches were dominated by tit for tat throwing wars both colonies sought to stack their teams with players who either had borderline and sometimes flagrantly illegal bowling actions to use physical intimidation as a means of negating opposition batsmen gregory whose action was regarded as highly dubious was prominent in his new south wales team pursuing a policy of condoning illegal bowling it was amidst a background of inter colonial rancour and a belligerent australian sports culture that riot broke out soon after gregory s 1878 australian team returned home lord harris s englishmen arrived australia won first match played at melbourne cricket ground by 10 wickets match was later recognised as third test match in history new south wales paceman fred spofforth nicknamed demon because of his ferocious pace took 13 wickets in match including first ever test hat trick next tour match was against new south wales and started on 24 january at association ground in sydney new south wales won by five wickets despite absence of spofforth who withdrew from home side after spraining his wrist night before start of match and gregory who had been dropped for missing a training session and failing to provide an explanation for his absence match thumb

victorian george coulthard upon a recommendation from melbourne cricket club as well as being a star footballer for carlton coulthard was a ground bowler employed by melbourne but was yet to make his first class cricketing debut coulthard accompanied harris s men from melbourne following test new south wales selected edmund barton who later became first prime minister of australia as both gregory and spofforth were playing for hosts bookmakers were offering attractive odds against an english win and new south wales were heavily backed having won previous match with an even weaker side sydney morning herald condemned impunity with which open betting was transacted in pavilion in defiance of prominent notices indicating that gambling was banned lord harris won toss and chose to bat at about 12 10 pm in front of approximately 4 000 spectators a n hornby and a p lucas opened england innings they put on 125 for first wicket before spofforth bowled lucas for 51 and hornby soon after for 67 hornby had given a chance during his innings but lucas did not ulyett and harris steadied innings after two quick wickets and added 85 ulyett made 55 before falling victim to a running diving catch and harris made 41 during his innings harris edged a ball to wicket keeper murdoch but coulthard ruled him not out this was noticed by journalists present and reported following day spofforth cut up wicket with his feet so badly that it became very difficult to play and edwin evans bowling from other end pitched nearly every ball into marks loss of ulyett and harris in quick succession triggered a sudden collapse as england lost 7 34 to be all out for 267 evans took 5 62 and spofforth 5 93 english batsmen were productive against bowling of edwin tindall taking 79 runs from his 27 overs without losing a wicket at stumps on first day new south wales were 2 53 with wicket keeper and opening batsman billy murdoch on 28 and hugh massie on three match recommenced at noon next day saturday 8 february ten thousand were in attendance and new south wales started well murdoch and massie took score to 107 before latter fell and hosts reached 3 130 at lunch without losing another wicket however wickets tumbled through afternoon none of incoming batsmen passed single figures and new south wales were all out for 177 a deficit of 90 runs tom emmett took last seven wickets to end with 8 47 murdoch batted through innings for 82 not out making him hero in eyes of locals he hit 11 fours and wisden called his effort a grand innings prevailing rule of time required new south wales to

partnership between murdoch and alick bannerman ended when former was adjudged run out by coulthard for 10 riot many in crowd disagreed with decision and took exception to it being made by an umpire employed by englishmen that coulthard was a victorian added to emotions of crowd who thought along intercolonial lines sydney evening news propagated rumours that coulthard had placed a large bet on an english victory something that umpire and lord harris later denied loud hooting came from pavilion especially section where gamblers who had overwhelmingly backed a new south wales victory were situated it was reported that well known gamblers were prominent in inciting other members of crowd amid loud chants of not out and go back to playing field murdoch gregory was later accused of trying to fan dispute and encourage crowd to gain an advantage for his team crowd was already suspicious of coulthard s competence and impartiality sydney morning herald commented in that morning s edition decision to give lord harris not out on first day was admittedly a mistake pavilion stood at an angle to crease so members were not in an ideal position to see how accurate decision was uproar continued as it became obvious that no batsman was coming out to replace murdoch so harris walked towards pavilion and met gregory at gate at which point gregory asked harris to change his umpire harris refused as english team considered decision to be fair and correct lord harris later said that his two fielders in point and cover positions being side on to crease had a good view of incident and that they agreed with coulthard s judgement barton said that coulthard s decision was correct and that englishmen were justified in standing by their nominated umpire thumb upright alt caricature

paterson who later went on to write iconic australian bush ballad waltzing matilda was among pitch invaders of 10 000 spectators up to 2 000 participated in disorder on 10 february sydney morning herald described number of riot participants as not more than 2 000 at outside who took an active art in disorder on 31 may following publication of harris s letter argus described a significantly lesser figure that only a few hundred sided with objectors those that were actively violent were fewer still and they were kept in check by better disposed of crowd coulthard was jostled and lord harris who had returned to field to support coulthard was struck by a whip or stick but was not hurt hornby a keen amateur boxer who had been offered english captaincy before stepping aside for harris grabbed his captain s assailant and conveyed his prisoner to pavilion in triumph it was later said that he had caught wrong man hornby was also attacked and almost lost shirt off his back emmett and ulyett each took a stump for protection and escorted lord harris off assisted by some members in meantime crowd anger grew and there was mounting fear that riot would intensify due to speculation that crowd would try to free hornby s captive however there was only jostling as players were evacuated into pavilion and injuries were limited to minor cuts and bruises an english naval captain who was at ground had his top hat pulled over his eyes and was verbally abused by some spectators after 30 minutes field was cleared when ground was finally cleared gregory insisted according to harris that coulthard be replaced when harris would not agree gregory said then game is at an end harris asked barton whether he could claim match on a forfeit barton replied i will give it to you in two minutes if batsmen don t return harris then asked barton to speak with gregory to ascertain his intentions when barton came out he announced that alick bannerman and nat thomson would resume new south wales innings they walked onto arena and reached stumps but before they could receive a ball crowd again invaded pitch and remained there until scheduled end of play according to sydney mail approximately 90 minutes play had been lost lord harris maintained his position on ground standing erect with moustache bristling among spectators fearful that his leaving arena would lead to a forfeit sunday was a rest day so match resumed on monday 10 february as it was a working day crowd was much smaller rain had fallen and sun had baked playing surface into a sticky wicket which caused erratic behaviour nat thomson was out for a duck without addition to overnight total and a collapse ensued new south wales made only 49 in their second innings bannerman top scored with 20 while six of his colleagues failed to score while emmett and ulyett took four and five wickets respectively including four wickets in four balls for latter england thus won by an innings and 41 runs reaction there were widespread allegations by media and english players that riot was started by bookmakers or at least encouraged by widespread betting that was known to be occurring at match vernon royle a member of english team wrote in his diary that it was a most disgraceful affair and took its origin from some of better gambling class in pavilion australian press and cricket officials immediately condemned riot which dominated front pages of local newspapers even though infamous bushranger ned kelly and his gang had raided on same weekend local media were united in their disgust at scenes of tumult fearing a public relations disaster would erupt in england sydney morning herald called riot a national humiliation and that it would remain a blot upon colony for some years to come they accused those involved in gambling of inciting larrikins and roughs to storm field and attack englishmen however they also suggested that some of blame should be put on one of english professionals who made use of a grossly insulting remark to crowd about their being nothing but sons of convicts barton defended englishmen and coulthard saying that none had done anything wrong he claimed that emmett and ulyett were incapable of insulting australians in such a way australasian claimed that three policemen at ground idled and allowed rioters to attack englishmen they said that riot forever made match memorable in annals of new south wales cricket and lamented fact that became rampant for rest of afternoon paper asked question what will they say in england wisden condemned unrest as a disgraceful affair and described spectators as a rough and excited mob richard driver of new south wales cricket association nswca issued a statement of regret for what had happened to tourists lord harris thumb left upright alt caricature of a tall thin man with a moustache holding a cricket bat lord harris captain of visiting english team nswca appealed to lord harris and in reply he said he did not blame them or cricketers of sydney in any way but said that it riot was an occurrence it was impossible he could forget on 11 february one day after conclusion of match and three days after riot harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about disturbance it was clear that he intended letter to be printed in press and it appeared in full in daily telegraph on 1 april among other london newspapers reigniting furore wisden cricketers almanack considered incident of such significance that it reprinted whole correspondence letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what lord harris thought about riot lord harris s letter was originally published by british newspaper daily telegraph on 1 april 1879 it and nswca response were reprinted in 1880 edition of wisden cricketers almanack and then in lord harris referred to crowd as a howling mob and said i have seen no reason as yet to change my opinion of coulthard s qualities or to regret his engagement in which opinion i am joined by whole team he further added that beyond slyly kicking me once or twice mob behaved very well their one cry being change your umpire and now for cause of this disturbance not unexpected i may say by us for we have heard accounts of former matches played by english teams harris further accused a new south wales parliamentarian of assisting gamblers in inciting unrest although he did not name he said he further accused australian public of being bad losers claiming that they were sparing in their applause upon his team s victory and were unable to appreciate skills shown by an opposing team he summed up his feelings response in new south wales nswca were outraged by lord harris s letter and convened a special meeting to consider their response and subsequently had their honorary secretary mr j m gibson write to daily telegraph in reply gibson argued that misconduct of those who took possession of wickets has been exaggerated and that lord harris s account was universally regarded here as both inaccurate and letter said that we cannot allow a libel upon people of new south wales so utterly unfounded as this to pass without challenge it went on to accuse harris of omitting certain facts in his account which according to nswca depicted australia and cricket authorities in a poor light these included an accusation that harris had failed to note that nswca and media had immediately and strongly condemned disturbance and treatment of english visitors gibson also criticised lord harris for claiming that coulthard was competent while admitting he had made two mistakes in our innings especially as coulthard s not out ruling against lord harris was openly admitted by his lordship to be a mistake that favoured englishmen letter further denied claim that those who incited riot were associated with nswca and accused harris of inflammatory conduct during disorder spofforth australia s leading bowler commented on incident in an 1891 cricket magazine interview but put a different slant on cause he thought that english team were victims of intercolonial rivalry between new south wales and victoria aftermath immediately after game lord harris led his men from sydney cancelling planned return match against a representative australian side that would have become fourth ever test match england team returned to melbourne where two further matches were played against victoria on 21 25 february and 7 10 march at farewell banquet hosted by melbourne cricket club harris spoke publicly for first time about riot he was critical of way his team had been treated by a portion of new south wales press which had unintentionally he trusted but with questionable courtesy described them as if they were strolling actors rather than as a party of gentlemen however speech was otherwise regarded as reconciliatory thumb upright alt photograph of bearded man without moustache richard driver president of new south wales cricket association nswca pressed charges against two men who were charged with having participated in disorder their president richard driver who appeared for prosecution told court that inmates of pavilion who had initiated disturbance including a well known bookmaker of victoria who was at time ejected had had their fees of membership returned to them and they would never again be admitted to ground sydney morning herald reported that two men expressed regret for what had occurred and pleaded guilty and bench fined them 40 shillings and to pay 21 shillings professional costs of court despite initial cynicism from journalists nswca announced a crackdown on betting on cricket matches and it was reported that over next 10 years gambling at cricket matches in sydney mainly died out impact on later tours thumb left upright alt

side captained by billy murdoch toured england tourists had difficulty finding good opponents most county sides turned them down although yorkshire played two unofficial matches against them there was a lot of bad will exacerbated by australians arrival in england at short notice to some extent unexpectedly this was heightened by an english perception that australians came frequently to maximise their profits at time professionalism was frowned upon in his autobiography lord harris wrote they asked no one s goodwill in matter and it was felt this was a discourteous way of bursting in on our arrangements and result was they played scarcely any counties and were not generally recognised we felt we had to make a protest against too frequent visits harris initially shunned team and tried to avoid correspondence and meetings with them an attempt to arrange a game against an english xi for cricketers fund was turned down and public advertisements in newspapers were shunned w g grace was sympathetic to australians and felt that they were not to blame for riot he attempted to arrange a game for them at lord s but was rebuffed by marylebone cricket club who gave excuse that ground was not available despite it being murdoch s wicket that started riot english public were more sympathetic towards him than gregory and although australians played against weak opposition including many they attracted large crowds leading counties to regret their decision to snub them eventually secretary of surrey c w alcock asked lord harris to put together a representative side to play australians while grace acted as a mediator luckily for australians lord harris had a personal rapport with their captain murdoch and leading player spofforth especially as they shared his antipathy towards throwing an agreement was reached and although lord harris was generous in agreeing to lead side three cricketers who played in infamous sydney game hornby emmett and ulyett refused to play harris assembled a strong team which included three grace brothers and australia who had not faced strong opposition and were without star bowler fred spofforth went down by five wickets in front of 45 000 spectators this game later recognised as fourth test in history and first to be played in england is more important than its result as custom of cricket tours between england and australia was cemented overall tour was a financial success and an effective exercise in mending relations team were received by lord mayor of london at end of tour and were given gifts profits were healthy and
