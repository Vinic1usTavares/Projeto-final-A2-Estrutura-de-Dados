lacked modern cruisers and destroyers several years after first s were ordered navy finally gained approval for four light cruisers as part of 1912 1916 shipbuilding program to scout for capital ships and to lead destroyer flotillas design work for ships had begun as back as 1907 but it took irn several iterations between alternating specifications and designs to decide what was feasible in early 1912 it conducted a design contest for a ship armed with a dozen 55 caliber pattern 1913 guns capable of a speed of and protected by some side armor other important requirements were a strong resemblance to dreadnoughts under construction and ability to lay mines none of submissions were entirely satisfactory and shipyards were asked for new larger designs navy combined submissions from russo baltic and putilov shipyards for a design in november in february 1913 irn needed to divert some money from cruisers to pay for s and shipyards agreed to reduce price from 9 660 000 rubles excluding guns and armor to 8 300 000 rubles in exchange for reducing speed to navy then ordered two ships from each yard on 13 february late changes to design including addition of anti roll tanks

displaced at normal load they were powered by four p 103 curtis aeg vulkan steam turbines westwood p 91 each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by 13 yarrow boilers turbines were designed to produce which would propel ship at 29 5 knots ships carried of fuel oil their crew consisted of approximately 630 officers and crewmen increase in size of svetlanas during design process allowed their main armament to be increased from 12 to 15 pattern 1913 guns in single mounts six of 10 guns on main deck were positioned in casemates and all were difficult to work in bad weather meister pp 34 35 guns had a range of at an elevation of 20deg and fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of friedman p 262 maximum rate of fire was eight rounds per minute campbell p 361 ships were
