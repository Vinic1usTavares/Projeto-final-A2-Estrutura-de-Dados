slipknot for manic intensity while employing a freeform approach to songcraft which invites comparison to lunatic fringe rock of 60s referring to toxicity as both manic and schizoid keith harris of rolling stone noted tankian s ability to veer easily from sing rap rhythm to korn ish hysterics to demonic baritone growl to ruminative and that music insists on forward motion without trapping itself
