genoese occupation of rhodes refers to period between 1248 and late 1249 early 1250 during which city of rhodes and parts of namesake island were under genoese control genoese took possession of city and island a dependency of empire of nicaea in a surprise attack in 1248 and held it with aid from principality of achaea against nicaean attacks until 1250 background in early 13th century possibly already before fall of constantinople to fourth crusade in 1204 rhodes and its nearby islands were detached from control of central byzantine government under rule of caesar leo gabalas although at times gabalas seems to have acknowledged suzerainty of main byzantine greek successor state empire of nicaea rhodes became centre of a practically independent domain in an effort to counterbalance nicaea and strengthen his position leo concluded treaties with republic of venice in 1234 and 1236 but his brother john gabalas who succeeded him when leo died in was clearly in a less powerful position and he soon recognized overlordship of nicaean emperor john iii doukas vatatzes in exchange he received high titles of sebastos and megas doux and likely hand of an imperial relative possibly one of vatatzes sisters at same time republic of genoa left out of spoils of fourth crusade and sidelined by venice in constantinople was eager to acquire footholds in east genoese sent several embassies to nicaea but apparently without much success this failure as well as threat posed to two maritime republics by frederick ii hohenstaufen forced genoa and venice to a temporary rapprochement in a treaty signed in 1248 they divided mediterranean into spheres of influence rhodes was in an area to be jointly controlled by two republics occupation and reconquest in 1247 or 1248 john gabalas left island with land and naval forces to join in a nicaean campaign against latin empire in area of nicomedia in his absence in spring or summer of 1248 a genoese fleet possibly sailing to join king louis ix of france s seventh crusade came upon rhodes which they found to be virtually unprotected given that genoa had long coveted island due to its strategic position genoese exploited opportunity and in a surprise night attack seized city of rhodes island s capital thumb right view of citadel of lindos 2014 vatatzes reacted swiftly sending a fleet to island led by and doux of thracesian theme john kantakouzenos kantakouzenos set out in late 1248 or early 1249 but did not directly move to rhodes instead capturing first islands of leros and kalymnos initially kantakouzenos had only a small army at his disposal possibly only troops from his own thracesian theme as a result he apparently first moved to secure fortresses in southern part of island not yet captured by genoese before marching north towards city of rhodes nicaeans landed near fortress town of lindos some south of rhodes city and then established their base at phileremos southwest of rhodes city at this time reinforcements sent by vatatzes arrived allowing kantakouzenos to blockade genoese in capital thumb right remnants of byzantine fortifications of rhodes city 2008 genoese defenders were well supplied with food which they had seized from inhabitants as a result they were not greatly discomfited contemporary historian george akropolites even complains that they slept with most beautiful local women expelling old and ugly ones from city and blockade dragged on into spring according to account of george akropolites city was on verge of falling when in about middle of may 1249 william ii of villehardouin prince of achaea and hugh iv duke of burgundy arrived by chance in rhodes city on their way to join seventh crusade then about to sail from cyprus for egypt of 400 knights with him villehardouin agreed to leave 100 in rhodes to assist genoese this caused nicaeans to raise siege and fall back to phileremos where they were themselves now besieged by genoese both by land and sea while achaeans ravaged countryside when vatatzes was informed of these events at nymphaion he ordered another expeditionary force to be prepared in smyrna comprising 300 horse under theodore kontostephanos to whom vatatzes gave written instructions for campaign arrival of kontostephanos and his men once again tipped balance nicaean troops caught achaeans off guard while they were scattered plundering and killed them all at kantakouzenos orders genoese fled back to city of rhodes but as they were unable to withstand another siege they agreed to surrender it in exchange for their safe departure this took place either in late 1249 or early 1250 island was certainly recovered soon enough that news reached vatatzes ally frederick ii hohenstaufen before september 1250 when he addressed a letter to nicaean emperor congratulating him on this success aftermath following eviction of genoese rhodes became fully incorporated into empire of nicaea and gabalas family rule was discontinued rhodes may have been briefly restored to john gabalas but he died soon after probably before year 1250 was out his son leo probably underage at time although a nephew of nicaean emperor did not succeed his father and instead left rhodes with his mother and settled in crete around 1256 or according to a different opinion after recapture of constantinople in 1261 island s government was entrusted to john palaiologos younger brother of future emperor michael viii palaiologos nevertheless already increasing threat of turkish raids led emperor michael viii palaiologos to grant rhodes to john de lo a genoese corsair in imperial service as a fief western and particularly genoese interest in rhodes did not abate however particularly with rapid of restored byzantine empire under andronikos ii palaiologos western powers hatched new plans to seize strategically situated island in 1300s venetians began seizing some of neighbouring islands in 1300s and cast their sights on rhodes as well at same time however andronikos ii gave some of islands as fiefs to genoese corsairs in his service andrea and his uncle de faced with threat of venetian expansion latter allied with knights hospitaller leading to hospitaller conquest of rhodes begun in 1306 and completed after a long siege of capital of rhodes in 1309 10 notes references citations bibliography further reading
