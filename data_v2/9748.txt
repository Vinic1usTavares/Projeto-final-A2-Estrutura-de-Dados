products to a banquet adapted for two to any size or type of party with appropriate music and dance to performances intended for thousands and even for a global audience experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement so that one common understanding of idea is fun and laughter although many entertainments have a serious purpose this may be case in various forms of ceremony celebration religious festival or satire for example hence there is possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth an important aspect of entertainment is audience which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment audience may have a passive role as in case of persons watching a play opera television show or film or audience role may be active as in case of games where participant audience roles may be routinely reversed entertainment can be public or private involving formal scripted performance as in case of theatre or concerts or unscripted and spontaneous as in case of children s games most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries evolving due to changes in culture technology and fashion for example with stage magic films and video games for example although they use newer media continue to tell stories present drama and play music festivals devoted to music film or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days some entertainment such as public executions are now illegal in most countries activities such as fencing or archery once used in hunting or war have become spectator sports in same way other activities such as cooking have developed into performances among professionals staged as global

museology psychologists say function of media entertainment is attainment of gratification no other results or measurable benefit are usually expected from it except perhaps final score in a sporting entertainment this is in contrast to education which is designed with purpose of developing understanding or helping people to learn and marketing which aims to encourage people to purchase commercial products however distinctions become blurred when education seeks to be more entertaining and entertainment or marketing seek to be more educational such mixtures are often known by neologisms edutainment or infotainment psychology of entertainment as well as of learning has been applied to all these fields for example marketers mix commercial messages with non commercial messages in

speaking from mouth to ear and their force as entertainment derived from very same elements we today enjoy in films and novels storytelling is an activity that has evolved and developed toward variety many entertainments including storytelling but especially music and drama remain familiar but have developed into a wide variety of form to suit a very wide range of personal preferences and cultural expression many types are blended or supported by other forms for example drama stories and banqueting or dining are commonly enhanced by music sport and games are incorporated into other activities to increase appeal some may have evolved from serious or necessary activities such as running and jumping into competition and then become entertainment it is said for example that pole vaulting may have originated in netherlands where people used long poles to vault over wide canals rather than wear out their clogs walking miles to nearest bridge others maintain that pole vaulting was used in warfare to vault over fortress walls during battle equipment for such sports has become increasingly sophisticated vaulting poles for example were originally made from woods such as ash hickory or

gladiatorial combats also known as gladiatorial games popular during roman times provide a good example of an activity that is a combination of sport punishment and entertainment changes to what is

revolutions during chinese cultural revolution for example revolutionary opera was sanctioned by communist party and world war i great depression and russian revolution all affected entertainment

performances typically dramatic or musical are presented on a stage for an audience and have a history that goes back to hellenistic times when leading musicians and actors performed widely at poetical competitions for example at delphi delos ephesus p 26 aristotle and his teacher plato both wrote on theory and purpose of theatre aristotle posed questions such as what is function of arts in shaping character should a member of ruling class merely watch performances or be a participant and perform what kind of entertainment should be provided for those who do not belong to elite in egypt seleucids in pergamum also had a strong theatrical tradition and later wealthy patrons in rome staged far more lavish productions expectations about performance and their engagement with it have changed over time 1 for example in england during 18th century prejudice against actresses had faded p 620 and in europe generally going to theatre once a socially dubious activity became a more respectable middle class pastime pp 65 66 in late 19th and early 20th centuries when variety of popular entertainments increased operetta and music halls became available and new drama theatres such as moscow art theatre and theatre in russia opened at same time commercial newspapers began to carry theatre columns and reviews that helped make theatre a legitimate subject of intellectual debate in

film for example aims to create a record or inform although two purposes often work together medium was a global business from beginning lumiere brothers were first to send cameramen throughout world instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for public p 9 in 1908 pathe launched and distributed newsreels and by world war i films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment in first decade of 20th century cinematic programmes combined at random fictions and americans first contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images but french were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle film therefore became a part of entertainment industry from its early days increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in film medium to delight and entertain audiences animation for example which involves display of rapid movement in an art work is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences advent of computer generated imagery cgi in 21st century made it possible to do spectacle more cheaply and on a scale never dreamed of by cecil b demille from 1930s to 1950s movies and radio were only mass entertainment but by second decade of 21st century technological changes economic decisions risk aversion and globalisation reduced both quality and range of films being produced sophisticated visual effects and cgi techniques for example rather than humans were used not only to create realistic images of people landscapes and events both real and fantastic but also to animate non living items such as lego normally used as entertainment as a game in physical form creators of lego movie wanted audience to believe they were looking at actual lego bricks on a tabletop that were shot with a real camera not what we actually did which was create vast environments with digital bricks inside computer convergence of computers and film has allowed entertainment to be presented in a new way and technology has also allowed for those with personal resources to screen films in a home theatre recreating in a private venue quality and experience of a public theatre this is similar to way that nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries films also re imagine entertainment from other forms turning stories books and plays for example into new entertainments story of film a documentary about history of film gives a survey of global achievements and innovations in medium as well as changes in conception of film making it demonstrates that while some films particularly those in hollywood tradition that combines realism and melodramatic romanticism are intended as a form of escapism others require a deeper engagement or more thoughtful response from their audiences for example award winning senegalese film xala takes government corruption as its theme charlie chaplin s film great dictator was a brave and innovative parody also on a political theme stories that are thousands of years old such as noah have been re interpreted in film applying familiar literary devices such as allegory and personification with new techniques such as cgi to explore big themes such as human folly good and evil courage and despair love faith and death themes that have been a main stay of entertainment across all its forms as in other media excellence and achievement in films is recognised through a range of awards including ones from american academy of motion picture arts and sciences british academy of film and television arts cannes international film festival in france and asia pacific screen awards dance left thumb

becoming professional theatrical performers p 98 some dances such as quadrille a square dance that emerged during napoleonic years in france and other country dances were once popular at social gatherings like balls but are now rarely performed on other hand many folk dances such as scottish highland dancing and irish dancing have evolved into competitions which by adding to their audiences has increased their entertainment value irish dance theatre which sometimes features traditional irish steps and music has developed into a major dance form with an international reputation since dance is often associated with female body and women s experiences female dancers who dance to entertain have in some cases been regarded as distinct from decent women because they use their bodies to make a living instead of hiding them as much as possible society s attitudes to female dancers depend on culture its history and entertainment industry itself for example while some cultures regard any dancing by women as most shameful form of entertainment van karin changing images and shifting identities female performers in egypt in albright 2001 p 141 other cultures have established venues such as strip clubs where deliberately erotic or sexually provocative dances such as striptease are performed in public by professional women dancers for mostly male audiences various political regimes have sought to control or ban dancing or specific types of dancing sometimes because of disapproval of music or clothes associated with it nationalism authoritarianism and racism have played a part in banning dances or dancing for example during nazi regime american dances such as swing regarded as completely un german had become a public offense and needed to be banned similarly in shanghai china in 1930s dancing and nightclubs had come to symbolise excess that plagued chinese society and officials wondered if other forms of entertainment such as brothels should also be banned banning had effect of making dance craze even greater in ireland public dance hall act of 1935 banned but did not stop dancing at crossroads and other popular dance forms such as house and barn dances

animals kept in zoos in ancient times were often kept there for later use in arena as entertainment or for their entertainment value as exotica many contests between animals are now regarded as sports for example horse racing is regarded as both a sport and an important source of entertainment its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry one in which horses are carefully transported around world to compete in races in australia horse race run on melbourne cup day is a public holiday and public regards race as an important annual event like horse racing camel racing

involved among these are blood sports such as bear baiting dog fighting and cockfighting other contests involving animals remain controversial and have both supporters and detractors for example conflict between opponents of pigeon shooting who view it as a cruel and moronic exercise in marksmanship and proponents who view it as entertainment has been tested in a court of law an extensive discussion of legal and cultural issues can be found in fox hunting which involves use of horses as well as hounds and bullfighting which has a strong theatrical component are two entertainments that have a long and significant cultural history they both involve animals and are variously regarded as sport entertainment or cultural tradition among organisations set up to advocate for rights of animals are some whose concerns include use of animals for entertainment examples include league against cruel sports uk people for ethical treatment of animals peta multinational and showing animals respect and kindness shark us however in many cases of animal advocacy groups versus organisations accused of animal abuse both sides have cultural claims circus thumb children entertained by a stilt walker performing in a circus act a circus described as one of most brazen of entertainment forms is a special type of theatrical performance involving a variety of physical skills such as acrobatics and juggling and sometimes performing animals usually thought of as a travelling show performed in a big top circus was first performed in permanent venues philip astley is regarded as founder of modern circus in second half of 18th century and jules leotard is french performer credited with developing art of trapeze considered synonymous with circuses astley brought together performances that were generally familiar in traditional british fairs at least since beginning of 17th century tumbling rope dancing juggling animal tricks and so on it has been claimed that there is no direct link between roman circus and circus of modern times between demise of roman circus and foundation of astley s amphitheatre in london some 1300 years later nearest thing to a circus ring was rough circle formed by curious onlookers who gathered around itinerant tumbler or on a village green magic form of entertainment known as stage magic or conjuring and recognisable as performance is based on traditions and texts of magical rites and dogmas that have been a part of most cultural traditions since ancient times references to magic for example can be found in bible in hermeticism in zoroastrianism in kabbalistic tradition in mysticism and in sources of freemasonry stage magic is performed for an audience in a variety of media and locations on stage on television in street and live at parties or events it is often combined with other forms of entertainment such as comedy or music and showmanship is often an essential part of magic performances performance magic relies on deception psychological manipulation sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience illusion that a performer can achieve impossible audiences amazed at stunt performances and escape acts of harry houdini for example regarded him as a magician reprint originally published new york dutton c1920 fantasy magicians have held an important place in literature for centuries offering entertainment to millions of readers famous wizards such as merlin in arthurian legends have been written about since 5th and 6th centuries while in 21st century young wizard harry potter became a global entertainment phenomenon when book series about him sold about 450 million copies as at june 2011 making it best selling book series in history street performance thumb didgeridoo player entertaining passers by in street street entertainment street performance or busking are forms of performance that have been meeting public s need for entertainment for centuries it was an integral aspect of london s life for example when city in early 19th century was filled with spectacle and diversion minstrels or troubadours are part of tradition art and practice of busking is still celebrated at annual busking festivals for example 2012 coffs harbour international buskers and comedy festival there are three basic forms of contemporary street performance first form is circle show it tends to gather a crowd usually has a distinct beginning and end and is done in conjunction with street theatre puppeteering magicians comedians acrobats jugglers and sometimes musicians this type has potential to be most lucrative for performer because there are likely to be more donations from larger audiences if they are entertained by act good buskers control crowd so patrons do not obstruct foot traffic second form walk by act has no distinct beginning or end typically busker provides an entertaining ambience often with an unusual instrument and audience may not stop to watch or form a crowd sometimes a walk by act spontaneously turns into a circle show third form cafe busking is performed mostly in restaurants pubs bars and cafes this type of act occasionally uses public transport as a venue parades parades are held for a range of purposes often more than one whether their mood is sombre or festive being public events that are designed to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences and modern variant motorcade are examples of public processions some people watching parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend while others become part of audience by happenstance whatever their mood or primary purpose parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by occasionally a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space such as trooping colour in 8 and tickets are sold to physical audience while global audience participates via broadcast one of earliest forms of parade were triumphs grand and sensational displays of foreign treasures and spoils given by triumphant roman generals to celebrate their victories they presented conquered peoples and nations that exalted prestige of victor in summer of 46 bce julius caesar chose to celebrate four triumphs held on different days extending for about one month in europe from middle ages to baroque royal entry celebrated formal visit of monarch to city with a parade through elaborately decorated streets passing various shows and displays annual lord mayor s show in london is an example of a civic parade that has survived since medieval times many religious festivals especially those that incorporate processions such as holy week processions or indian festival of holi have some entertainment appeal in addition to their serious purpose sometimes religious rituals have been adapted or evolved into secular entertainments or like festa del in venice have managed to grow in popularity while holding both secular and sacred purposes in balance however pilgrimages such as roman catholic pilgrimage of way of st james muslim hajj and hindu kumbh mela which may appear to outsider as an entertaining parade or procession are not intended as entertainment they are instead about an individual s spiritual journey hence relationship between spectator and participant unlike entertainments proper is different manner in which kumbh mela for example is divorced from its cultural context and repackaged for western consumption renders presence of voyeurs deeply problematic parades generally impress and delight often by including unusual colourful costumes 7 10 sometimes they also commemorate 5 8 or celebrate 1 4 6 8 9 sometimes they have a serious purpose such as when context is military 1 2 5 when intention is sometimes to intimidate or religious when audience might participate or have a role to play 6 7 10 even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away 9 it is likely to have a strong appeal draw attention of onlookers and entertain them fireworks thumb spectators at bicentennial fireworks in colombia fireworks are a part of many public entertainments and have retained an enduring popularity since they became a crowning feature of elaborate celebrations in 17th century first used in china classical antiquity and europe for military purposes fireworks were most popular in 18th century and high prices were paid for especially skilled italian ones who were summoned to other countries to organise displays fire and water were important aspects of court spectacles because displays inspired by means of fire sudden noise smoke and general magnificence sentiments thought fitting for subject to entertain of his sovereign awe fear and a vicarious sense of glory in his might birthdays name days weddings and anniversaries provided occasion for celebration one of most famous courtly uses of fireworks was one used to celebrate end of war of austrian succession and while fireworks themselves caused a fire accompanying music for royal fireworks written by handel has been popular ever since aside from their contribution to entertainments related to military successes courtly displays and personal celebrations fireworks are also used as part of religious ceremony for example during indian dashavatara kala of temple deity is taken around in a procession with a lot of singing dancing and display of fireworks fire sudden noise and smoke of fireworks is still a significant part of public celebration and entertainment for example fireworks were one of primary forms of display chosen to celebrate turn of millennium around world as clock struck midnight and 1999 became 2000 firework displays and open air parties greeted new year as time zones changed over to next century fireworks carefully planned and choreographed were let off against backdrop of many of world s most famous buildings including sydney harbour bridge

engagement from a crowd of italian sport fans thumb audience engagement by individual south african fans at 2010 fifa world cup sporting competitions have always provided entertainment for crowds to distinguish players from audience latter are often known as spectators developments in stadium and auditorium design as well as in recording and broadcast technology have allowed off site spectators to watch sport with result that size of audience has grown ever larger and spectator sport has become increasingly popular two of most popular sports with global appeal are association football and cricket their ultimate international competitions world cup and test cricket are broadcast around world beyond very large numbers involved in playing these sports they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non players worldwide a comparable multi stage long form sport with global appeal is tour de france unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia being run instead in countryside aside from sports that have worldwide appeal and competitions such as olympic games entertainment value of a sport depends on culture and country where people play it for example in united states baseball and basketball games are popular forms of entertainment in bhutan national sport is archery in new zealand it is rugby union in iran it is freestyle wrestling japan s unique sumo wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history in some cases such as international running group hash house harriers participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves largely independent of spectator involvement where social component is more important than competitive evolution of an activity into a sport and then an entertainment is also affected by local climate and conditions for example modern sport of surfing is associated with hawaii and that of snow skiing probably evolved in scandinavia while these sports and entertainment they offer to spectators have spread around world people in two originating countries remain well known for their prowess sometimes climate offers a chance to adapt another sport such as in case of ice hockey an important entertainment in canada fairs expositions shopping fairs and exhibitions have existed since ancient and medieval times displaying wealth innovations and objects for trade and offering specific entertainments as well as being places of entertainment in themselves whether in a medieval market or a small shop shopping always offered forms of exhilaration that took one away from everyday however in modern world merchandising has become entertainment spinning signs flashing signs thumping music video screens interactive computer kiosks day care cafes by 19th century expos that encouraged arts manufactures and commerce had become international they were not only hugely popular but affected international ideas for example 1878 paris exposition facilitated international cooperation about ideas innovations and standards from london 1851 to paris 1900 in excess of 200 million visitors had entered turnstiles in london paris vienna philadelphia chicago and a myriad of smaller shows around world since world war ii well over 500 million visits have been recorded through world expo turnstiles as a form of spectacle and entertainment expositions influenced everything from architecture to patterns of globalisation to fundamental matters of human identity and in process established close relationship between fairs rise of department stores and art museums modern world of mass consumption and entertainment industry safety some entertainments such as at large festivals whether religious or secular concerts clubs parties and celebrations involve big crowds from earliest times crowds at an entertainment have associated hazards and dangers especially when combined with recreational consumption of intoxicants such as alcohol ancient greeks had dionysian mysteries for example and romans had saturnalia consequence of excess and crowds can produce breaches of social norms of behaviour sometimes causing injury or even death such as for example at altamont free concert an outdoor rock festival list of serious incidents at nightclubs includes those caused by stampede overcrowding terrorism such as 2002 bali bombings that targeted a nightclub and especially fire investigations such as that carried out in us after station nightclub fire often demonstrate that lessons learned regarding fire safety in nightclubs from earlier events such as cocoanut grove fire do not necessarily result in lasting effective change efforts to prevent such incidents include appointing special officers such as medieval lord of misrule or in modern times security officers who control access and also ongoing improvement of relevant standards such as those for building safety tourism industry now regards safety and security at entertainment venues as an important management task industry although kings rulers and powerful people have always been able to pay for entertainment to be provided for them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible attended a live performance technological developments in 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of audience packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry sometimes referred to as show business industry relies on business models to produce market broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms including performances of all types industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study film industry is a part of entertainment industry components of it include hollywood and bollywood film industries as well as cinema of united kingdom and all cinemas of europe including france germany spain italy and others sex industry is another component of entertainment industry applying same forms and media for example film books dance and other performances to development marketing and sale of sex products on a commercial basis amusement parks entertain paying guests with rides such as roller coasters ridable miniature railways water rides and dark rides as well as other events and associated attractions parks are built on a large area subdivided into themed areas named lands sometimes whole amusement park is based on one theme such as various seaworld parks that focus on theme of sea life one of consequences of development of entertainment industry has been creation of new types of employment while jobs such as writer musician and composer exist as they always have people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been new jobs have appeared such as gaffer or special effects supervisor in film industry and attendants in an amusement park prestigious awards are given by industry for excellence in various types of entertainment for example there are awards for music games including video games comics comedy theatre television film dance and magic sporting awards are made for results and skill rather than for entertainment value architecture architecture for entertainment purpose built structures as venues for entertainment that accommodate audiences have produced many famous and innovative buildings among most recognisable of which are theatre structures for ancient greeks architectural importance of theatre is a reflection of their importance to community made apparent in their monumentality in effort put into their design and in care put into their detail green j r theatre of paphos and theatre of alexandria some first thoughts in p 115 romans subsequently developed stadium in an oval form known as a circus in modern times some of grandest buildings for entertainment have brought fame to their cities as well as their designers sydney opera house for example is a world heritage site and o2 in london is an entertainment precinct that contains an indoor arena a music club a cinema and exhibition space bayreuth in germany is a theatre designed and built for performances of one specific musical composition two of chief architectural concerns for design of venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety speed at which venue empty is important both for amenity and safety because large crowds take a long time to disperse from a badly designed venue which creates a safety risk hillsborough disaster is an example of how poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths sightlines and acoustics are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues in 21st century entertainment venues especially stadia are likely to figure among leading architectural genres p xvi however they require a whole new approach to design because they need to be sophisticated entertainment centres multi experience venues capable of being enjoyed in many diverse ways hence architects now have to design with two distinct functions in mind as sports and entertainment centres playing host to live audiences and as sports and entertainment studios serving viewing and listening requirements of remote audience architecture as entertainment sleeping beauty thumb left inauthentic castle in disneyland amusement park architects who push boundaries of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed expectations of public and client and are aesthetically outstanding buildings such as guggenheim museum bilbao designed by frank gehry are of this type becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum other apparently usable buildings are really follies deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical on other hand sometimes architecture is entertainment while pretending to be functional tourism industry for example creates or renovates buildings as attractions that have either never been used or can never be used for their ostensible purpose they are instead re purposed to entertain visitors often by simulating cultural experiences buildings history and sacred spaces are thus made into commodities for purchase such intentional tourist attractions divorce buildings from past so that difference between historical authenticity and contemporary entertainment venues theme parks becomes hard to define p xvii examples include preservation of alcazar of toledo with its grim civil war history conversion of slave dungeons into tourist attractions in ghana such as for example cape coast castle and presentation of indigenous culture in libya specially constructed buildings in amusement parks represent park s theme and are usually neither authentic nor completely functional thumb magazine advertisement for crystal radio 1922 thumb television tower in almaty kazakhstan constructed 1983 effects of developments in electronic media globalisation by second half of 20th century developments in electronic media made possible delivery of entertainment products to mass audiences across globe technology enabled people to see hear and participate in all familiar forms stories theatre music dance wherever they live rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in data storage devices such as cassette tapes or compact discs along with increasing and development of barcodes also made ticketing easier faster and global obsolescence in 1940s radio was electronic medium for family entertainment and information in 1950s it was television that was new medium and it rapidly became global bringing visual entertainment first in black and white then in colour to world by 1970s games could be played electronically then hand held devices provided mobile entertainment and by last decade of 20th century via networked play in combination with products from entertainment industry all traditional forms of entertainment became available personally people could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music film or game they could choose time and place to use it proliferation of portable media players and emphasis on computer as a site for film consumption together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films one of most notable consequences of rise of electronic entertainment has been rapid obsolescence of various recording and storage methods as an example of speed of change driven by electronic media over course of one generation television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown to novel to ubiquitous and finally to superseded one estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in us would own a wii console about same percentage that owned a television in 1953 some expected that halfway through second decade of 21st century online entertainment would have completely replaced television which didn t happen so called digital revolution has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments business industries and individuals as they all try to keep up for example in uk and for example in australia even sports stadium of future will increasingly compete with television viewing in terms of comfort safety and constant flow of audio visual information and entertainment available other flow on effects of shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes where television regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents will need to be replaced by access to internet at same time ongoing need for entertainers as professional engagers shows continuity of traditional entertainment convergence by second decade of 21st century analogue recording was being replaced by digital recording and all forms of electronic entertainment began to converge for example convergence is challenging standard practices in film industry whereas success or failure used to be determined by first weekend of its run today a series of exhibition windows such as dvd pay per view and fibre optic video on demand are used to maximise profits part of industry s adjustment is its release of new commercial product directly via video hosting services media convergence is said to be more than technological convergence is cultural as well it is also result of a deliberate effort to protect interests of business entities policy institutions and other groups globalisation and cultural imperialism are two of cultural consequences of convergence others include fandom and interactive storytelling as well as way that single franchises are distributed through and affect a range of delivery methods greater diversity in ways that signals may be received and packaged for viewer via terrestrial satellite or cable television and of course via internet also affects entertainment venues such as sports stadia which now need to be designed so that both live and remote audiences can interact in increasingly sophisticated ways for example audiences can watch highlights call up statistics order tickets and merchandise and generally tap into stadium s resources at any time of day or night introduction of television altered availability cost variety and quality of entertainment products for public and convergence of online entertainment is having a similar effect for example possibility and popularity of user generated content as distinct from commercial product creates a networked audience model that makes programming obsolete individuals and corporations use video hosting services to broadcast content that is equally accepted by public as legitimate entertainment while technology increases demand for entertainment products and offers increased speed of delivery forms that make up content are in themselves relatively stable storytelling music theatre dance and games are recognisably same as in earlier centuries see also entertainment during great
