rubidium is a chemical element with symbol rb and atomic number 37 rubidium is a very soft silvery white metal in alkali metal group rubidium metal shares similarities to potassium metal and caesium metal in physical appearance softness and conductivity rubidium cannot be stored under atmospheric oxygen as a highly exothermic reaction will ensue sometimes even resulting in metal catching fire rubidium is first alkali metal in group to have a density higher than water so it sinks unlike metals above it in group rubidium has a standard atomic weight of 85 on earth natural rubidium comprises two isotopes 72 is a stable isotope 85rb and 28 is slightly radioactive 87rb with a half life of 49 billion years more than three times longer than estimated age of universe german chemists robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff discovered rubidium in 1861 by newly developed technique flame spectroscopy name comes from latin word meaning deep red color of its emission spectrum rubidium s compounds have various chemical and electronic applications rubidium metal is easily vaporized and has a convenient spectral absorption range making it a frequent target for laser manipulation of atoms rubidium is not a known nutrient for any living organisms however rubidium ions have same charge as potassium ions and are actively taken up and treated by animal cells in similar ways characteristics thumb left partially molten rubidium metal in an ampoule rubidium is a very soft ductile silvery white metal it is second most electropositive of stable alkali metals and melts at a temperature of like other alkali metals rubidium metal reacts violently with water as with potassium which is slightly less reactive and caesium which is slightly more reactive this reaction is usually vigorous enough to ignite hydrogen gas it produces rubidium has also been reported to ignite spontaneously in air it forms amalgams with mercury and alloys with gold iron caesium sodium and potassium but not lithium even though rubidium and lithium are in same group left thumb rubidium crystals silvery compared to caesium crystals golden rubidium has a very low ionization energy of only 406 kj mol rubidium and potassium show a very similar purple color in flame test and distinguishing two elements requires more sophisticated analysis such as spectroscopy compounds thumb left upright 0 5 cluster alt ball and stick diagram shows two regular octahedra which are connected to each other by one face all nine vertices of structure are purple spheres representing rubidium and at centre of each octahedron is a small red sphere representing oxygen rubidium chloride rbcl is probably most used rubidium compound among several other chlorides it is used to induce living cells to take up dna it is also used as a biomarker because in nature it is found only in small quantities in living organisms and when present replaces potassium other common rubidium compounds are corrosive rubidium hydroxide starting material for most rubidium based chemical processes rubidium carbonate used in some optical glasses and rubidium copper sulfate 6h2o rubidium silver iodide has highest room temperature conductivity of any known ionic crystal a property exploited in thin film batteries and other applications rubidium forms a number of oxides when exposed to air including rubidium monoxide rb2o and rubidium in excess oxygen gives superoxide rubidium forms salts with halides producing rubidium fluoride rubidium chloride rubidium bromide and rubidium iodide isotopes although rubidium is monoisotopic rubidium in earth s crust is composed of two isotopes stable 85rb 72 2 and radioactive 87rb 27 8 natural rubidium is radioactive with specific activity of about 670 bq g enough to significantly expose a photographic film in 110 days twenty four additional rubidium isotopes have been synthesized with half lives of less than 3 months most are highly radioactive and have few uses rubidium 87 has a half life of years which is more than three times age of universe of years making it a primordial nuclide it readily substitutes for potassium in minerals and is therefore fairly widespread rb has been used extensively in dating rocks 87rb beta decays to stable 87sr during fractional crystallization sr tends to concentrate in plagioclase leaving rb in liquid phase hence rb sr ratio in residual magma may increase over time and progressing differentiation results in rocks with elevated rb sr ratios highest ratios 10 or more occur in pegmatites if initial amount of sr is known or can be extrapolated then age can be determined by measurement of rb and sr concentrations and of 87sr 86sr ratio dates indicate true age of minerals only if rocks have not been subsequently altered see rubidium strontium dating rubidium 82 one of element s non natural isotopes is produced by electron capture decay of strontium 82 with a half life of 25 36 days with a half life of 76 seconds rubidium 82 decays by positron emission to stable krypton 82 occurrence rubidium is twenty third most abundant element in earth s crust roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more common than copper it occurs naturally in minerals pollucite carnallite and which contain as much as 1 rubidium oxide lepidolite contains between 0 3 and 3 5 rubidium and is commercial source of element some potassium minerals and potassium chlorides also contain element in commercially significant quantities seawater contains an average of 125 ug l of rubidium compared to much higher value for potassium of 408 mg l and much lower value of 0 3 ug l for caesium because of its large ionic radius rubidium is one of incompatible elements during magma crystallization rubidium is concentrated together with its heavier analogue caesium in liquid phase and crystallizes last therefore largest deposits of rubidium and caesium are zone pegmatite ore bodies formed by this enrichment process because rubidium substitutes for potassium in crystallization of magma enrichment is far less effective than that of caesium zone pegmatite ore bodies containing mineable quantities of caesium as pollucite or lithium minerals lepidolite are also a source for rubidium as a by product two notable sources of rubidium are rich deposits of pollucite at bernic lake manitoba canada and rb k found as impurities in pollucite on italian island of elba with a rubidium content of 17 5 both of those deposits are also sources of caesium production although rubidium is more abundant in earth s crust than caesium limited applications and lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limits production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year several methods are available for separating potassium rubidium and caesium fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum cs rb al so4 2 yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum two other methods are reported process and ferrocyanide process for several years in 1950s and 1960s a by product of potassium production called alkarb was a main source for rubidium alkarb contained 21 rubidium with rest being potassium and a small amount of caesium today largest producers of caesium such as tanco mine manitoba canada produce rubidium as a by product from pollucite thumb left upright 0 6 flame test for rubidium history thumb left gustav kirchhoff left and robert bunsen center discovered rubidium by spectroscopy henry enfield roscoe is on right side alt three middle aged men with one in middle sitting down all wear long jackets and shorter man on left has a beard rubidium was discovered in 1861 by robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff in heidelberg germany in mineral lepidolite through flame spectroscopy because of bright red lines in its emission spectrum they chose a name derived from latin word meaning deep red rubidium is a minor component in lepidolite kirchhoff and bunsen processed 150 kg of a lepidolite containing only 0 24 rubidium oxide rb2o both potassium and rubidium form insoluble salts with chloroplatinic acid but those salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water therefore less soluble rubidium hexachloroplatinate could be obtained by fractional crystallization after reduction of hexachloroplatinate with hydrogen process yielded 0 51 grams of rubidium chloride for further studies bunsen and kirchhoff began their first large scale isolation of caesium and rubidium compounds with of mineral water which yielded 7 3 grams of caesium chloride and 9 2 grams of rubidium chloride rubidium was second element shortly after caesium to be discovered by spectroscopy just one year after invention of spectroscope by bunsen and kirchhoff two scientists used rubidium chloride to estimate that atomic weight of new element was 85 36 currently accepted value is 85 47 they tried to generate elemental rubidium by electrolysis of molten rubidium chloride but instead of a metal they obtained a blue homogeneous substance which neither under naked eye nor under microscope showed slightest trace of metallic substance they presumed that it was a subchloride however product was probably a colloidal mixture of metal and rubidium chloride in a second attempt to produce metallic rubidium bunsen was able to reduce rubidium by heating charred rubidium tartrate although distilled rubidium was pyrophoric they were able to determine density and melting point quality of this research in 1860s can be appraised by fact that their determined density differs by less than 0 1 g cm3 and melting point by less than 1 degc from presently accepted values slight radioactivity of rubidium was discovered in 1908 but that was before theory of isotopes was established in 1910 and low level of activity half life greater than 1010 years made interpretation complicated now proven decay of 87rb to stable 87sr through beta decay was still under discussion in late 1940s rubidium had minimal industrial value before 1920s since then most important use of rubidium is research and development primarily in chemical and electronic applications in 1995 rubidium 87 was used to produce a bose einstein condensate for which discoverers eric allin cornell carl edwin wieman and wolfgang won 2001 nobel prize in physics applications thumb left a rubidium fountain atomic clock at united states naval observatory rubidium compounds are sometimes used in fireworks to give them a purple color rubidium has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using magnetohydrodynamic principle where hot rubidium ions are passed through a magnetic field these conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator thereby generating an electric current rubidium particularly vaporized 87rb is one of most commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and bose einstein condensation its desirable features for this application include ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at relevant wavelength and moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures for cold atom applications requiring tunable interactions 85rb is preferable due to its rich feshbach spectrum rubidium has been used for polarizing 3he producing volumes of magnetized 3he gas with nuclear spins aligned rather than random rubidium vapor is optically pumped by a laser and polarized rb polarizes 3he through hyperfine interaction such spin polarized 3he cells are useful for neutron polarization measurements and for producing polarized neutron beams for other purposes resonant element in atomic clocks utilizes hyperfine structure of rubidium s energy levels and rubidium is useful for high precision timing it is used as main component of secondary frequency references rubidium oscillators in cell site transmitters and other electronic transmitting networking and test equipment these rubidium standards are often used with gps to produce a primary frequency standard that has greater accuracy and is less expensive than caesium standards such rubidium standards are often mass produced for telecommunication industry other potential or current uses of rubidium include a working fluid in vapor turbines as a getter in vacuum tubes and as a photocell component rubidium is also used as an ingredient in special types of glass in production of superoxide by burning in oxygen in study of potassium ion channels in biology and as vapor in atomic magnetometers in particular 87rb is used with other alkali metals in development of spin exchange relaxation free serf magnetometers rubidium 82 is used for positron emission tomography rubidium is very similar to potassium and tissue with high potassium content will also accumulate radioactive rubidium one of main uses is myocardial perfusion imaging as a result of changes in blood brain barrier in brain tumors rubidium collects more in brain tumors than normal brain tissue allowing use of radioisotope rubidium 82 in nuclear medicine to locate and image brain tumors rubidium 82 has a very short half life of 76 seconds and production from decay of strontium 82 must be done close to patient rubidium was tested for influence on manic depression and depression dialysis patients suffering from depression show a depletion in rubidium and therefore a supplementation may help during depression in some tests rubidium was administered as rubidium chloride with up to 720 mg per day for 60 days precautions and biological effects rubidium reacts violently with water and can cause fires to ensure safety and purity this metal is usually kept under a dry mineral oil or sealed in glass ampoules in an inert atmosphere rubidium forms peroxides on exposure even to small amount of air diffused into oil and storage is subject to similar precautions as storage of metallic potassium rubidium like sodium and potassium almost always has 1 oxidation state when dissolved in water even in biological contexts human body tends to treat rb ions as if they were potassium ions and therefore concentrates rubidium in body s intracellular fluid i e inside cells ions are not particularly toxic a 70 kg person contains on average 0 36 g of rubidium and an increase in this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons biological half life of rubidium in humans measures 31 46 days although a partial substitution of potassium by rubidium is possible when more than 50 of potassium in muscle tissue of rats was replaced with rubidium rats died see also electron configuration electron
