hurricane howard was a powerful category 4 hurricane which produced large swells along coasts of baja california peninsula and southern california eighth named storm of 2004 pacific hurricane season howard originated out of a tropical wave off coast of mexico on august 30 traveling towards northwest storm gradually strengthened becoming a hurricane on september 1 and reaching its peak intensity following day with winds of 140 mph 220 km h decreasing sea surface temperatures then caused storm to weaken by september 4 howard was downgraded to a tropical storm next day it degenerated into a non convective remnant low pressure area which persisted for another five days before dissipating over open waters although storm never made landfall fringe effects of storm produced significant flooding across baja california peninsula which damaged agricultural land and dozens of homes howard also produced large swells which reached 18 ft 5 4 m along baja coastline and 10 ft 3 m along california coastline about 1 000 lifeguard rescues took place in california due to waves moisture from storm also enhanced rainfall in parts of arizona leading to minor accumulations meteorological history hurricane howard began as a tropical wave that moved off west coast of africa on august 18 wave moved across atlantic ocean and caribbean sea with little associated convection by august 26 wave produced disorganized convection as it moved through western caribbean across central america and entered eastern pacific ocean paralleling southern coast of mexico wave became increasingly organized and it was estimated that tropical wave spawned a tropical depression around 1200 utc on august 30 about 400 mi 645 km south southwest of acapulco mexico classified as tropical depression eleven e system tracked west northwestward under steering currents of a weak mid level ridge in hours after formation depression lacked a concentration of deep convection near center however conditions favored eventual development including warm sea surface temperatures and low amounts of wind shear based on increased organization and formation of banding features it was estimated that cyclone intensified into tropical storm howard at 0000 utc on august 31 a mid level anticyclone located over southern california was steering storm towards northwest early on september 1 national hurricane center nhc stated that howard had an 80 percent chance of undergoing rapid intensification based on further development of storm and a highly favorable environment around cyclone based on formation of an eye feature nhc upgraded howard to a hurricane early on september 1 while storm was located about 420 mi 675 km southwest of manzanillo colima later that day eye of howard became apparent on satellite imagery which organized into a pinhole eye surrounded by a ring of symmetric deep convection at 0600 utc on september 2 howard was upgraded to a major hurricane a storm with winds of 111 mph 178 km h or higher shortly after cyclone reached its peak intensity as a low end category 4 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale with winds of 140 mph 220 km h while located about 410 mi 660 km south southwest of southern tip of baja california sur right thumb hurricane howard weakening on september 3 not long after reaching peak intensity storm moved over cooler waters causing eyewall to deteriorate and cloud tops to warm next day eye of howard disappeared from satellite imagery leading to cyclone being downgraded to a category 2 hurricane continued deterioration of system caused rapid weakening with howard being downgraded to a tropical storm by 1200 utc on september 4 convection associated with storm was separated from center later that day early on september 5 howard was further downgraded to a tropical depression and later degenerated into a non convective remnant low pressure area about 265 mi 425 km west southwest of punta eugenia mexico remnants of hurricane continued towards northwest before turning towards southwest following day as it tracked along southeast side of a ridge of high pressure low continued in this general direction until it dissipated on september 10 about 1 150 mi 1 850 km west of cabo san lucas mexico preparations and impact because howard remained away from land no tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued one ship strong virginian reported sustained winds 42 mph 68 km h at 0600 utc on september 4 along baja california peninsula 16 18 ft 4 8 5 4 m swells were reported all ships were required to remain at port due to rough seas heavy rains in mountainous and pacific coastal areas of baja california produced flooding which washed out several roads in san jose del cabo rains did help increase water levels in some reservoirs in baja california an estimated 2 000 hectares of agricultural land was damaged by storm and 48 households were damaged throughout four communities state and federal authorities purchased temporary homes for those who needed shelter in affected areas state civil protection in mexico provided rehabilitation for a total of 393 homes affected by howard large swells produced by storm resulted in about 1 000 lifeguard rescues in orange county california high temperatures in southern california exceeding 100 degf 37 7 degc in places and cool ocean temperatures led to an estimated 575 000 people going to beaches during labor day weekend one incident required 25 rescues as dozens of people were overwhelmed by 8 10 ft 2 4 3 m waves officials in san bernardino county advised residents to take precautions for possibility of flooding as a result of moisture from remnants of howard following wildfires in 2003 foothills were highly susceptible to flooding residents were advised to have sandbags ready ensure their emergency supplies were stocked and have an evacuation plan despite all preparations undertaken howard did not produced any rainfall in california moisture also enhanced rainfall across portions of arizona this led to minor rainfall accumulations throughout state see also timeline of 2004 pacific hurricane season other tropical cyclones of same name list
