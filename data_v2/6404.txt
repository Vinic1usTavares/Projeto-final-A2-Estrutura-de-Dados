1840 was a 19th century german romantic landscape painter generally considered most important german artist of his generation he is best known for his mid period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies morning mists barren trees or gothic ruins his primary interest was contemplation of nature and his often symbolic and anti classical work seeks to convey a subjective emotional response to natural world friedrich s paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes reducing figures to a scale that according to art historian christopher john murray directs viewer s gaze towards their metaphysical dimension friedrich was born in town of greifswald on baltic sea in what was at time swedish pomerania he studied in copenhagen until 1798 before settling in dresden he came of age during a period when across europe a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality this shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of natural world as artists such as friedrich j m w turner and john constable sought to depict nature as a divine creation to be set against artifice of human civilization friedrich s work brought him renown early in his career and contemporaries such as french sculptor david d angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered tragedy of landscape during an 1834 visit to dresden quoted in nevertheless his work fell from favour during his later years and he died in obscurity as germany moved towards modernisation in late 19th century a new sense of urgency characterised its art and friedrich s contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as products of a bygone age early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty two of his paintings in berlin by 1920s his paintings had been discovered by expressionists and in 1930s and early 1940s surrealists and existentialists frequently drew ideas from his work rise of nazism in early 1930s again saw a resurgence in friedrich s popularity but this was followed by a sharp decline as his paintings were by association with nazi movement interpreted as having a nationalistic aspect it was not until late 1970s that friedrich regained his reputation as an icon of german romantic movement and a painter of international importance life early years and family caspar david friedrich was born on 5 september 1774 in greifswald swedish pomerania on baltic coast of germany pomerania had been divided between sweden and brandenburg prussia since 1648 and at time of caspar david s birth it was still part of holy roman empire napoleon occupied territory in 1806 and in 1815 all of pomerania passed to prussian sovereignty sixth of ten children he was raised in strict lutheran creed of his father adolf gottlieb friedrich a candle maker and soap boiler records of family s financial circumstances are contradictory while some sources indicate children were privately tutored others record that they were raised in relative poverty he became familiar with death from an early age his mother sophie died in 1781 when he was seven family was raised by their housekeeper and nurse mutter heide who had a warm relationship with all of friedrich children a year later his sister elisabeth died and a second sister maria succumbed to typhus in 1791 arguably greatest tragedy of his childhood happened in 1787 when his brother johann christoffer died at age of thirteen caspar david witnessed his younger brother fall through ice of a frozen lake and drown some accounts suggest that johann christoffer perished while trying to rescue caspar david who was also in danger on ice thumb self portrait 1800 is a chalk drawing of artist at 26 completed while he was studying at royal academy in copenhagen royal museum of fine arts copenhagen friedrich began his formal study of art in 1790 as a private student of artist johann gottfried quistorp at university of greifswald in his home city at which art department is now named caspar david friedrich institut in his honour quistorp took his students on outdoor drawing excursions as a result friedrich was encouraged to sketch from life at an early age through quistorp friedrich met and was subsequently influenced by theologian ludwig gotthard who taught that nature was a revelation of god quistorp introduced friedrich to work of german 17th century artist adam elsheimer whose works often included religious subjects dominated by landscape and nocturnal subjects during this period he also studied literature and aesthetics with swedish professor thomas four years later friedrich entered prestigious academy of copenhagen where he began his education by making copies of casts from antique sculptures before proceeding to drawing from life living in copenhagen afforded young painter access to royal picture gallery s collection of 17th century dutch landscape painting at academy he studied under teachers such as christian august lorentzen and landscape painter jens juel these artists were inspired by sturm und drang movement and represented a midpoint between dramatic intensity and expressive manner of budding romantic aesthetic and waning neo classical ideal mood was paramount and influence was drawn from such sources as icelandic legend of edda poems of ossian and norse mythology move to dresden friedrich settled permanently in dresden in 1798 during this early period he experimented in printmaking with etchings and designs for woodcuts which his furniture maker brother cut by 1804 he had produced 18 etchings and four woodcuts they were apparently made in small numbers and only distributed to friends despite these forays into other media he gravitated toward working primarily with ink watercolour and with exception of a few early pieces such as landscape with temple in ruins 1797 he did not work extensively with oils until his reputation was more established landscapes were his preferred subject inspired by frequent trips beginning in 1801 to baltic coast bohemia krkonose and harz mountains mostly based on landscapes of northern germany his paintings depict woods hills harbors morning mists and other light effects based on a close observation of nature these works were modeled on sketches and studies of scenic spots such as cliffs on rugen surroundings of dresden and river elbe he executed his studies almost exclusively in pencil even providing topographical information yet subtle atmospheric effects characteristic of friedrich s mid period paintings were rendered from memory these effects took their strength from depiction of light and of illumination of sun and moon on clouds and water optical phenomena peculiar to baltic coast that had never before been painted with such an emphasis thumb left cross in mountains tetschen altar 1808 115 x 110 5 cm

established when he won a prize in 1805 at weimar competition organised by johann wolfgang von goethe at time weimar competition tended to draw mediocre and now forgotten artists presenting derivative mixtures of neo classical and pseudo greek styles poor quality of entries began to prove damaging to goethe s reputation so when friedrich entered two sepia drawings procession at dawn and fisher folk by sea poet responded enthusiastically and wrote we must praise artist s resourcefulness in this picture fairly drawing is well done procession is ingenious and appropriate his treatment combines a

friedrich s design was logical climax of many earlier drawings of his which depicted a cross in nature s world although altarpiece was generally coldly received it was friedrich s first painting to receive wide publicity artist s friends publicly defended work while art critic basilius von published a long article challenging friedrich s use of landscape in a religious context he rejected idea that landscape painting could convey explicit meaning writing that it would be a veritable presumption if landscape painting were to sneak into church and creep onto altar friedrich responded with a programme describing his intentions in 1809 comparing rays of evening sun to light of holy father this statement marked only time friedrich recorded a detailed interpretation of his own work and painting was among few commissions artist ever received thumbnail rocky landscape in elbe sandstone mountains between 1822 and 1823 following purchase of two of his paintings by prussian crown prince

dresden couple had three children with their first emma arriving in 1820 physiologist and painter carl gustav carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either friedrich s life or personality yet his canvasses from this period including chalk cliffs on rugen painted after his honeymoon display a new sense of levity while his palette is brighter and less austere human figures appear with increasing frequency in paintings of this period which siegel interprets as a reflection that importance of human life particularly his family now occupies his thoughts more and more and his friends his wife and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art around this time he found support from two sources in russia in 1820 grand duke nikolai pavlovich at behest of his wife alexandra feodorovna visited friedrich s studio and returned to saint petersburg with a number of his paintings an exchange that began a patronage that continued for

because they themselves were only looking out for mystic they did not see friedrich s faithful and conscientious study of nature in everything he represented during this period friedrich frequently

towards end of his life he lived in relative poverty he became isolated and spent long periods of day and night walking alone through woods and fields often beginning his strolls before sunrise in june 1835 friedrich suffered his first stroke which left him with minor limb paralysis and greatly reduced his ability to paint as a result he was unable to work in oil instead he was limited to watercolour sepia and reworking older compositions although his vision remained strong he had lost full strength of his hand yet he was able to produce a final black painting seashore by moonlight

personal to be well understood by 1838 his work no longer sold or received attention from critics romantic movement had been moving away from early idealism that artist had helped found after his death carl gustav carus wrote a series of articles which paid tribute to friedrich s transformation of conventions of landscape painting however carus articles placed friedrich firmly in his time and did not place artist within a continuing tradition only one of his paintings had been reproduced as a print and that was produced in very few copies although french sculptor david d angers who visited friedrich in 1834 was moved by devotional issues explored in artist s canvasses he exclaimed to carus in 1834 friedrich only landscape painter so far to succeed in stirring up all forces of my soul

reputation suffered further damage when his imagery was adopted by a number of hollywood directors such as walt disney built on work of such german cinema masters as fritz lang and f w murnau within horror and fantasy genres his rehabilitation was slow but enhanced through writings of such critics and scholars as werner hofmann helmut borsch and sigrid hinz who successfully rejected and rebutted political associations ascribed to his work and placed it within a purely art historical context by 1970s he was again being exhibited in major galleries across world as he found favour with a new

friedrich was a prolific artist who produced more than 500 attributed works in line with romantic ideals of his time he intended his paintings to function as pure aesthetic statements so he was
