pluteus nevadensis is a species of fungus in agaric family pluteaceae described as new to science in 2010 species is known only from subtropical and pine forests in mexico where it grows on rotting pine and oak wood fruit bodies mushrooms have red orange caps up to in diameter with a shape ranging from conic convex or flattened depending on their age silky yellow stems are up to long it is similar in appearance to pluteus aurantiorugosus with which it shares an orange or scarlet colored cap and a yellow stem p nevadensis can be distinguished from this and other superficially similar pluteus species by differences in microscopic characteristics taxonomy species was described by olivia rodriguez in 2010 in journal mycotaxon based on collections made in 1991 holotype material was collected on colima volcano in municipality of zapotlan el grande at an elevation of species was formerly referred to pluteus aurantiorugosus with which it bears a close resemblance after close examination and comparison of two species authors concluded that differences in morphology and dna sequence were sufficient to warrant describing a new species according to rolf singer s infrageneric classification of genus pluteus fungus belongs in section celluloderma species in this section have pleurocystidia that are either absent or non furthermore majority have a cap cuticle comprising short club shaped or somewhat spherical with a stem cells that may or may not be mixed with elongated cystidia like cells other species in celluloderma include p p aurantiorugosus p pulverulentus p and p horakianus molecular analyses of internal transcribed spacer dna sequences supports placement of p nevadensis in celluloderma and further suggest that it has a sister relationship with p specific epithet nevadensis refers to mountain nevado de colima where type material was collected description cap is in diameter conic when young bell shaped to convex or plano convex when mature and cap margin is curved downward even or slightly eroded red orange cap surface is dry to moist and wrinkled towards margin but smooths out as it approaches center sometimes there is white yellowish flesh underneath cap cuticle gills are free from attachment to stem crowded closely together broad to swollen in middle and white or whitish when young to salmon pinkish in age edge of gill is floccose with wool like tufts or fringed and whitish stem which is centrally attached to cap measures by and is roughly equal in width throughout it is smooth to slightly fibrillose covered in small slender fibers or filaments silky and hollow color is yellow or yellowish near top and deep orange or with orange tinges towards base base of stem is covered with cottony whitish mycelia flesh of cap is 1 mm thick or more at center and whitish stem tissue is yellowish or yellow gold fruit bodies of pluteus nevadensis have no distinctive taste or odor color of spore print is pinkish brown smooth spores measure 5 5 7 by 4 5 6 5 um roughly spherical to broadly ellipsoid in shape their walls are thin to slightly thickened and almost translucent basidia spore bearing cells in hymenium are 22 29 by 6 5 7 5 um including sterigmata club shaped and four spored they have contents and are hyaline translucent pleurocystidia cystidia on gill face are 41 8 75 by 11 8 24 um frequent scattered and flask shaped with short or elongated necks some pleurocystidia are somewhat fusiform tapered on each end or somewhat utriform shaped like a leather bottle or flask thin walled and hyaline cheilocystidia cystidia on gill edge are 32 55 by 10 18 5 um crowded and club shaped some are utriform roughly cylindrical or egg shaped thin walled and hyaline gill tissue is convergent meaning that hyphae appear to converge toward center of tissue cap cuticle comprises club shaped or cells that measure 25 6 60 by 13 6 31 2 um these cells typically have a long pedicel stalk with a thin or slightly thickened wall and are hyaline species lacks hyphae filled with oil like contents and clamp connections similar species pluteus aurantiorugosus is very similar to p nevadensis in external appearance and two can only be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics or dna sequence in contrast to latter species former has oblong spores and cystidia that are shorter and less slender p aurantiorugosus is widely distributed in northern hemisphere but rare species pluteus horakianus shares with p nevadensis a fragile fruit body a red cap and similar cystidial morphology it differs in its orange red gill edges red stem and cap cuticle cells that contain pigment other species with a roughly similar appearance including p p p p and p laetus can be distinguished by differences in microscopic characteristics habitat and distribution pluteus nevadensis is known only from subtropical and pine forests in states of guerrero and jalisco mexico where it grows on rotting wood of pine and oak it is one of 34 pluteus species known in mexico see also list of pluteus species references external links nevadensis category fungi of mexico category fungi described in
