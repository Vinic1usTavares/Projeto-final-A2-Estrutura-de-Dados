1804 snow hurricane also known as storm of october 1804 was first tropical cyclone in recorded history known to produce snowfall with hurricane ginny in 1963 and hurricane sandy in 2012 being next such systems to do so an unusual late season storm in 1804 it yielded vast amounts of snow rain and powerful winds across northeastern united states prior to its approach towards east coast of united states it passed through caribbean sea on 4 october and later emerged near georgetown south carolina by early on 9 october a trough near virginia capes turned disturbance toward new england soon thereafter hurricane s abundant moisture clashed with an influx of cold canadian air leading to deepening of resulting pressure gradient and provoking inland intensification while situated over massachusetts it attained its peak intensity of 110 mph 175 km h undergoing an extratropical transition even as it drifted towards canadian maritimes consequently gradually weakening precipitation persisted for another two days before snowstorm finally subsided on 11 october due to its unusual nature both heavy snowfall and strong winds caused a swath of devastation stretching from mid atlantic states to northern new england in middle atlantic region moderate damage occurred at sea but little was noted inland in new england strong gusts inflicted significant damage to numerous churches widespread residential damage in contrast was mostly negligible and had no lasting consequences thousands of trees were knocked over obstructing roads and fiscally damaging timber industry throughout region cold temperatures wet snow and high winds downed numerous branches in fruit orchards froze potato crops flattened dozens of barns and killed over a hundred cattle in general agriculture shipping timber and livestock trades suffered most acutely following passage of snow hurricane while structural damage was widespread but generally inconsequential storm s most severe effects were concentrated at sea and led to a majority of hurricane s deaths winds swept dozens of watercraft and multiple ships ashore while high waters capsized many others several wharves were destroyed subsequently harming local shipping businesses as a consequence snow and rainfall totals varied widely between states with a clear delineation between areas that received frozen precipitation and rainfall in northeast areas of massachusetts received up to of rain in contrast to snow totals upward of measured in vermont in all hurricane caused more than 15 deaths at sea and one inland and also resulted in at least 100 000 1804 usd in damage snow hurricane of 1804 generally described as most severe storm in united states since great colonial hurricane of 1635 nearly 200 years earlier set several major precedents which have only infrequently occurred since it was first known tropical cyclone to generate snowfall and its early and extensive accumulations throughout new england were unprecedented and unusually heavy meteorological history origins of snow hurricane prior to its approach near new england are mostly unknown though a modern study conducted in 2006 traced its origins to north of puerto rico on 4 october 1804 and reports indicated it also passed by dominique and guadaloupe same day little else was known about storm until its approach towards east coast of united states and transit near south carolina chenoweth 2006 p 222 weather historian david ludlum concluded that both hurricane s strength and its abnormally cold environment were derived from influx of unseasonably cold air from north converging upon storm s abundant moisture increasing pressure gradient and leading to intensification ludlum 1966 p 169 he also speculated that storm could have formed non from southern appalachian mountains before arriving on atlantic coast but given meteorological circumstances characteristics and timing it was evaluated that storm was of tropical origin ludlum 1963 p 35 earliest evidence of a disturbance near united states was noted on 8 october when rainfall was recorded in upstate new york precipitated by storm s western periphery in advance of an approaching trough ludlum 1963 p 38 following morning trough s motion near virginia capes area was accompanied by intensifying winds and a change in their direction initially southwesterly force 3 incoming gale s winds rapidly turned towards west northwest escalating to force 6 by afternoon a 2001 study noted unusual orientation of storm s winds although a majority of new england hurricanes induced southeasterly gusts 1804 snow hurricane s in contrast were mostly southwesterly boose et al 2001 p 39 historical records chronicled remainder of storm s track along east coast of united states a dreadful squall occurred near cape henry at noon on 9 october and historical documents confirm it quickly reached chesapeake bay later that morning maintaining west to north winds while gusts in new york city where storm arrived that afternoon initially blew towards southeast they soon shifted towards north northwest and coincided with a rapid drop in atmospheric pressure which bottomed out at 977 mbar 28 87 inhg by early afternoon though barometer at weather station remained at that point for much of afternoon air temperature plummeted rapidly from to during same period ludlum 1963 p 36 a strong westerly circulation encouraged swift eastward movement of through s northern segment steering course of storm northeasterly over new england ludlum 1963 p 37 by evening storm had fully traversed northeastern united states where accounts indicated passage of storm s eye results of 2001 study also suggested atypical strengthening occurred around this time boose et al 2001 p 34 achieving its peak intensity with 1 minute maximum sustained winds of 110 mph 175 km h over massachusetts equivalent to a category 2 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale storm s maximum diameter was estimated to be at its largest point boose et al 2001 p 40 as hurricane weakened throughout night it underwent an extratropical transition evidenced by a passageway of weak winds off of trough s center its eye was consequently distorted as it meandered northward towards canada where it subsequently encountered an area of high pressure though gusts diminished that evening moderate precipitation persisted for another two days before snowstorm finally departed on 11 october perley 1891 p 168 impact and records snow hurricane brought strong gusts copious snow and heavy rain throughout new england and across mid atlantic region high precipitation amounts were observed along storm s trajectory peaking at inches of rain in salem massachusetts and of snow at windsor vermont it was first known tropical cyclone to feature frozen precipitation and remained only instance until a later disturbance in 1841 and hurricane ginny in 1963 which triggered of snow in regions of northern and central maine unusually widespread and severe october snow was seen few times if ever until 2011 halloween nor easter which dropped several feet in new england at its worst similarly hurricane sandy in 2012 brought heavy snow along areas of east coast with its highest depths concentrated in virginia albeit while exhibiting extratropical characteristics in addition a modern survey concluded that 1804 storm was only known hurricane to strike new england with southwesterly winds and it was also one of only two other being 1869 saxby gale confirmed to have intensified while inland over new england in middle atlantic states it caused little injury overall though many boats and ships were capsized to north in new england many churches endured significant damage and shipwrecks led to 15 deaths with one other death owing to a building collapse due to intense gusts hundreds of trees were uprooted and many buildings were unroofed agriculture shipping timber and livestock industries also suffered substantial impairment with considerable injury experienced by barns crops watercraft timber and livestock farther north entire swaths of forest were leveled and heavy snow blocked roads paths and turnpikes fruit orchards and sugar groves endured worst of storm reducing season s harvests private properties generally suffered damage to roofs windows and chimneys several buildings throughout region were reported to have collapsed overall approximately 100 000 in damage and more than 16 deaths were recorded mid atlantic and south though hurricane was reported to have passed by dominique guadaloupe and georgetown south carolina few other details are known and no damage was observed losses in mid atlantic states were much less severe than those in new england but isolated damage was still noted offshore cape henry virginia a vessel weathered through a squall but managed to escape without being capsized to north near chesapeake bay a mail boat was impeded by unrelenting west to northwesterly gusts at havre de grace maryland and consequently was unable to traverse bay a negative storm tide at baltimore grounded multiple boats and farther north at philadelphia an arriving ferry was inundated by a sudden gale in new jersey a ferry was overturned near trenton and another ran ashore within proximity of absecon beach snow hurricane s impact in new york state was largely insignificant though rain totals reached in new york city meanwhile to west in catskill mountains up to of snow accumulated despite reports of fast melting snow at rochester winds at hudson were seemingly more extreme than any other previous storm in region and hudson valley as a whole experienced intense gusts throughout day however there was only a single report of inland damage with houses flattened at newburgh as a result of severe winds shipping was slightly disrupted throughout state of new york with high winds forcing ships to travel with lowered sails also preventing vessels from docking at new york harbor on 10 october southern new england thumb 260px second steeple of old north church which replaced original toppled by 1804 hurricane alt postcard depicting a church in boston devastation was widespread throughout state of massachusetts with high winds and heavy snow averaging causing significant havoc snow 1943 p 93 in boston strong winds described as unprecedented in annals of city were documented during afternoon of 9 october with intense gusts blowing off steeple of old north church steeple was eventually repaired and restored several times yet was blown down by once more in 1954 by hurricane carol and mended once again schofield 1988 p 132 meanwhile roof of king s chapel was tossed from its initial location landing on an adjacent house and crushing two carriages into pieces churches and meetinghouses in salem beverly charlestown and danvers were also seriously impaired a residence in boston caved in killing one person and injuring three others snow 1943 p 94 and consequently was to be demolished all across state storm bent and crumpled structures and also ruined many wharves in dighton and milton winds toppled several homes while shipping was impacted by storm in gloucester property damage throughout state especially to chimneys roofs and windows was generally severe with chimneys even falling onto stage coaches in streets of boston charlestown navy yard was dismantled to prevent its imminent collapse and in peabody more than 30 000 unburnt bricks were wrecked storm uprooted thousands of trees throughout easternmost sections of state in town of lynn storm was reportedly most severe since great colonial hurricane of 1635 with roofs torn off structures fences and chimneys toppled and orchards bearing brunt of formidable destruction chimney of local schoolhouse collapsed into roof and a bench was thrown into cellar intense winds uprooted thousands of trees of which many sank into local marshes at plum island gusts toppled trees and fences yet no residential damage was observed close by at plymouth however winds wrecked several houses and overturned numerous boats at rehoboth winds brought down at least 80 trees and in nearby quincy a few houses roofs were torn away more than a dozen barns were demolished and gusts killed numerous cows with similar damage noted at taunton many ornamental and fruit trees also endured significant damage high winds blew away many roofs chimneys and fences meanwhile at dedham more than 130 trees toppled onto fifth massachusetts turnpike and many forests were razed throughout other parts of region making roads impassable remarkably endicott pear tree in danvers survived to later weather through three other hurricanes in 1815 1843 and 1934 dolan 2009 p 20 approximately of rain was measured during day in salem while an additional fell that evening apparently a greater quantity than has ever been known in same space of time at least 27 vessels were damaged by hurricane in boston with six watercraft having struck south boston bridge resulting in one death winds propelled several boats off of gloucester out to sea and their company was presumed to be lost ships elsewhere also withstood hurricane s powerful gusts without much success dove capsized at ipswich bar killing seven people captain of hannah drowned at and vessel mary was also beached but latter craft s crew survived at cape cod protector was swept inland near highland light losing 100 000 1804 usd in goods and leading to one death while john harris capsized nearby its crew perishing with it perley 1891 p 171 three bodies were also washed ashore at plymouth apparently from drowning at sea perley 1891 p 172 dozens of watercraft were driven aground at salem cape ann and marblehead causing significant damage at abington storm s effects to local shipping activities were detrimental with many vessels shipwrecked by high winds hobart 1866 p 259 despite being heavily occupied port at new bedford experienced no losses of ships or boats powerful winds induced substantial destruction throughout other portions of state diary of william bentley featured an account on hurricane describing destruction of two barns in salem and death of a horse property of paul revere and bentley s own house suffered considerable injury and in nearby nahant many buildings roofs were hurled away by intense gusts bentley also observed unusual abundance of seaweed which was swept inland during aftermath of storm where snow fell it was mainly heavy with reports of snowfall totaling in berkshires and up to near stockbridge however no accumulation was measured in boston and worcester due to higher than optimal temperatures ludlum 1966 p 170 in abington hurricane not only impacted shipping industry but also inflicted severe damage to oak and pine forests severe damage was inflicted to crops as a result of storm with potatoes freezing apples tossed from branches perley 1891 p 169 and stacks of hay ruined livestock also encountered noteworthy losses with large numbers of cattle sheep and fowl having died near walpole newbury and topsfield over a hundred cattle died at topsfield alone while reports of snowfall were generally sporadic in massachusetts snowfall was copious in connecticut more than of snow accumulated at litchfield while over was recorded at goshen moderate snowfall also accrued at woodbridge and other regions of state received up to however delineation between areas of rain and snow was clearly evident with more than of rain measured in nearby new haven devastation was also widespread in rhode island with numerous houses damaged at newport and providence in newport many ships were damaged perley 1891 p 170 and several deaths were recorded trees of immense size were also uprooted in both towns and fence boards were scattered by strong gusts in providence many ships were grounded a brick house was impaired and various other structures chimneys collapsed hurricane was described as severest storm and gale of wind within recollection of any of its inhabitants although little else was known about its impacts in rhode island despite high wind speeds and proximity to other snow receiving areas none fell in providence as a result of warmer temperatures northern new england and canada although winds in new hampshire along hurricane s northern edge were less severe higher snowfall totals were recorded in portsmouth damage was minimal and mainly confined to fences on 10 october thundersnow was observed in walpole as precipitation changed due to sinking temperatures which soon followed by a period of high winds though average snowfall amount in connecticut river valley was estimated to be near much of it quickly melted leaving only left by snowstorm s departure still heavy weight of unusually early wet snow snapped many tree branches still in full bloom ruining fruit orchards and sugar groves as a result production of cider already in low supply was reduced even further damages to one orchard alone reached 300 1804 usd due to snow obstructed roads post was delivered on horseback and at hurricane was so intense that a group of men traveling toward keene were forced to return due to blocked roads smothered with over of snow timber industry suffered blizzard s detrimental effects worst blow to trade since its formation in new hampshire in addition several barns were obliterated totals reached at hanover at goffstown and over in green mountains meanwhile in southern portions of state of ice accrued upon accumulations already on ground storm s damage radius was estimated to be at least and encompassed towns of peterborough lyme and amherst each received of frozen precipitation at rye beach a woman swept to sea on a stranded ship was found dead with an infant in her hands and amity was also wrecked along its shores causing an additional death in contrast to higher precipitation totals found in new hampshire accumulations merely averaged in vermont even so a source detailed snowfall depths of within vicinity of by time hurricane s precipitation subsided and reported higher depths of in other regions of state in vicinity of windsor up to of snow may have fallen during course of snowstorm snow was deep enough to cover entire heights of corn stalks and potato crops impeding impending harvest while massive drifts in state s hills obstructed roads even farther north in maine snowstorm s effects remained disastrous following its passage a timber lot at was nearly entirely uprooted clearing a massive forested area and making towns from great distances away previously obstructed suddenly visible effect of storm was so pronounced that according to sidney perley people felt as if they were in a strange place storm was particularly severe on atlantic coast especially in kennebec berwick kittery and york causing moderate destruction and killing several cattle however at portland hurricane was less severe and its impact was minimal precipitation arrived in canada on 9 october and persisted through following day without triggering any recorded damage records due to its unusual nature snow hurricane of 1804 set several major precedents which have only rarely occurred since then having defied many behaviors normally exhibited by new england hurricanes cyclone described as most severe in united states since great colonial hurricane of 1635 was not only unique in its production of snow but also in its meteorological characteristics and unusual timing though disturbance developed within confines of atlantic hurricane season its widespread early season snowfall was unprecedented with few comparable storms since among them being 2011 halloween nor easter producing several feet of snowfall in many areas similar circumstances occurred in 2012 with arrival of hurricane sandy which had a comparable track to 1804 snowstorm though it was extratropical by time it made landfall storm was also first known instance of snow instigated by a tropical cyclone until a later storm in 1841 since that time there has been only one other confirmed snowfall event as a result of a tropical cyclone while still considered to be tropical which was caused by hurricane ginny in 1963 generating accumulations of in maine storm also displayed abnormal meteorological characteristics which went against conventional understanding winds prevailed toward southwest only known example of a northeastern hurricane producing winds in that direction most generally yielded southeasterly gusts in addition it was one of only two systems to have strengthened while inland other being 1869 saxby gale see also 1804 antigua charleston hurricane 1804 atlantic hurricane season list of new
