critics agreed that game s 49 99 price point was too high considering reduced soundtrack gamespot criticized number of songs with regard to game s price reviewer commented that thirty songs for 50 is a lousy value any way you slice it and game feels like a quick and dirty cash in reviewer also commented that soundtrack was eclectic but solid other reviewers including 1up com ign and electronic gaming monthly criticized game for its musical selection gamesetwatch compared game to lou reed s metal machine music saying that game is totally harmonix s contractual obligation game due to bare minimum of changes made from guitar hero ii lawsuit on november 21 2007 rock group romantics filed a lawsuit against activision redoctane harmonix and wavegroup sound over cover of song what i like about you used in rocks 80s while game developers did secure appropriate rights to cover song in game romantics claim that cover is virtually indistinguishable from authentic version and thus would confuse consumers into believing that band actually recorded music and endorsed product lawsuit requested cessation of sales of game and monetary damage on december 20 2007 activision was awarded a preliminary injunction to prevent blockage of sales of game a summary judgment hearing was held on july 9 2008 and case was dismissed next month with a u s district court judge stating that activision
