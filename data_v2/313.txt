quatermass memoirs is a british radio drama documentary originally broadcast in 5 episodes on bbc radio 3 in march 1996 written by nigel kneale it was born out of his quatermass series of films and television serials which had first been broadcast in 1950s idea for show appeared as bbc radio intended to create a season of programming looking back at 1950s and it was final piece of writing kneale completed relating to character show is centered on character of professor bernard quatermass who albeit older than in previous series is same very concerned scientist but worried about his previous decisions andrew keir who had played quatermass in 1967 film quatermass and pit was chosen to voice character later nigel kneale himself became dismissive of serial but critics gave production relatively positive reviews overview series mixes three different strands a new monologue by kneale in which he discusses genesis and development of quatermass serials and their main character archival material from television productions and from documentary and newsreel coverage of key events of times in which they were made such as cold war advent of nuclear weapons and embryonic space race and dramatised strand in which professor discloses his reasons for and discusses his demons with a persistent reporter who invades his hermitage and ultimately becomes his friend this third element is set several years after events of third serial quatermass and pit 1958 59 and shortly before those of fourth and final serial quatermass 1979 continuity is maintained with 1979 serial by presenting quatermass living in seclusion in scottish highlands while final episode reveals that social collapse foreshadowing events of final story has already begun production kneale had brought quatermass s story to a close in 1979 serial quatermass and for many years saw no reason to revisit character pixley viewing notes p 40 however in 1995 he was approached by bbc radio producer paul quinn with an idea for creating a drama documentary about character as part of a season of bbc radio programming looking back at 1950s quinn told magazine for many people who remember seminal experience of hiding behind sofa when quatermass serials came on television quatermass was 1950s his adventures have gone down in popular cultural history kneale was intrigued by idea and agreed to write new dramatic material of quatermass relating his memories which quinn could then combine with archive clips from existing episodes of various quatermass television serials murray pp 176 177 kneale saw older quatermass of this new serial as same very concerned scientist who is now in retrospect horribly worried about what he may have done to world through his encounters with various lifeforms that were better not contacted it was kneale s first radio work since he had written play you must listen for bbc in 1952 and his first work for bbc in any medium since mid 1970s programme was commissioned in july 1995 with original working title of quatermass and ultimate conspiracy pixley sleeve notes pp 4 5 when quinn discovered that some of soundtracks of quatermass episodes were considered to be of too poor a quality to use idea for series was re shaped to add new elements of kneale s monologue and archive news reports kneale however later denied that any of news stories which quatermass memoirs suggested had inspired parts of his work had ever been in his mind at time he said that he had used a degree of creative licence when explaining these apparent inspirations in his monologue sections a further problem for quinn was that none of actors who had played quatermass for bbc television in 1950s were still alive this was solved by employing andrew keir who had played quatermass in hammer film productions version of quatermass and pit in 1967 a performance which kneale had liked keir was happy to take part but somewhat concerned about only being used as a link man and not in a fully dramatic role clips that were used from original bbc episodes were all carefully edited so that actors playing quatermass were never heard and thus differences between their voices and keir s would not confuse audience also in cast were emma gregory as journalist mandy and zulema dene as quatermass s housekeeper maire five episodes each of approximately twenty minutes were broadcast across one week from 4 to 8 march 1996 as part of fifties season of programming pixley sleeve notes p 3 serial was promoted in listings magazine radio times with an article by kneale about quatermass and his opinion of other science fiction programmes episode one was transmitted at 10 on monday originally scheduled for 10 05pm but delayed by a live concert broadcast beforehand episode two at 9 30pm on tuesday episode three 9 00pm on wednesday episode four 10 15pm on thursday and episode five at 9 on friday production was made and transmitted in stereo it was andrew keir s final professional performance he died following year digital radio station bbc7 repeated series on several occasions from october 2003 in 2006 it was released on cd by bbc audio as part of their classic radio sci fi range with cover artwork by chris reception nigel kneale himself was largely dismissive of serial in years following its broadcast god knows it wasn t a very important sort of thing he told his biographer bbc didn t care tuppence about what they were doing because they really don t know what they re doing certainly not in radio andrew keir must have been pretty ill when this nonsense was going on reviewing first episodes of both quatermass memoirs and in fifties another programme running as part of fifties season timess reviewer peter barnard was impressed despite thinking that such a season of programming was a necessarily premature commemoration he felt that both series had demonstrated how radio s better moments often take conventional pegs and hang some original clothing on them independents radio critic robert hanks was unimpressed with kneale s script for dramatic sections but praised performance of andrew keir in title role lesser actors would treat kneale s downbeat script with a certain detachment but keir is prepared to charge even most banal lines with a terror that s both a treat and a lesson hanks also felt that fifties season as a whole as demonstrated by quatermass memoirs had a somewhat misleading focus you get sense that a vogue for science fiction is being interpreted as spirit of fifties with emphasis being put on a handful of sci fi films if you really wanted to read age through its movies you d have to include dean martin and jerry lewis late ealing and early norman wisdom marilyn monroe and elvis presley it s a lot to accommodate perhaps sticking to terror is just less intimidating references general specific external links quatermass org uk nigel kneale quatermass appreciation site quatermass trilogy a
