armored cruisers after dupuy de lome culminating in two edgar quinet class ships design for these last two ships was based heavily on their predecessor and like ernest renan design was repeatedly reworked during construction which produced very lengthy construction times edgar were most powerful armored cruisers built by france but they entered service two years after british battlecruiser
