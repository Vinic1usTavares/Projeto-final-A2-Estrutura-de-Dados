during first half of 19th century background thumb thomas jefferson principal author of declaration by time that declaration of independence was adopted in july 1776 thirteen colonies and great britain had been at war for more than a year relations had been deteriorating between colonies and mother country since 1763 parliament enacted a series of measures to increase revenue from colonies such as stamp act of 1765 and townshend acts of 1767 parliament believed that these acts were a legitimate means of having colonies pay their fair share of costs to keep them in british empire christie and labaree empire or independence 31 many colonists however had developed a different conception of empire colonies were not directly represented in parliament and colonists argued that parliament had no right to levy taxes upon them this tax dispute was part of a larger divergence between british and american interpretations of british constitution and extent of parliament s authority in colonies bailyn ideological origins 162 orthodox british view dating from glorious revolution of 1688 was that parliament was supreme authority throughout empire and so by definition anything that parliament did was constitutional bailyn ideological origins 200 02 in colonies however idea had developed that british constitution recognized certain fundamental rights that no government could violate not even parliament bailyn ideological origins 180 82 after townshend acts some essayists even began to question whether parliament had any legitimate jurisdiction in colonies at all middlekauff glorious cause 241 anticipating arrangement of british commonwealth bailyn ideological origins 224 25 by 1774 american writers such as samuel adams james wilson and thomas jefferson were arguing that parliament was legislature of great britain only and that colonies which had their own legislatures were connected to rest of empire only through their allegiance to crown middlekauff glorious cause 241 42 writings in question include wilson s considerations on authority of parliament and jefferson s a summary view of rights of british america both 1774 as well as samuel adams s 1768 circular letter congress convenes issue of parliament s authority in colonies became a crisis after parliament passed coercive acts known as intolerable acts in colonies in 1774 to punish colonists for gaspee affair of 1772 and boston tea party of 1773 many colonists saw coercive acts as a violation of british constitution and thus a threat to liberties of all of british america so first continental congress convened in philadelphia in september 1774 to coordinate a response congress organized a boycott of british goods and petitioned king for repeal of acts these measures were unsuccessful because king george and ministry of prime minister lord north were determined to enforce parliamentary supremacy in america as king wrote to north in november 1774 blows must decide whether they are to be subject to this country or independent middlekauff glorious cause 168 ferling leap in dark 123 24 most colonists still hoped for reconciliation with great britain even after

state house in philadelphia in may 1775 and some delegates hoped for eventual independence but no one yet advocated declaring it middlekauff glorious cause 318 many colonists no longer believed that parliament had any sovereignty over them yet they still professed loyalty to king george who they hoped would intercede on their behalf they were disappointed in late 1775 when king rejected congress

monarchy and hereditary rule christie and labaree empire or independence 270 maier american scripture 31 32 common sense made a persuasive and impassioned case for independence which had not yet been given serious intellectual consideration in american colonies paine connected independence with protestant beliefs as a means to present a distinctly american political identity thereby stimulating

effectively declared american independence before congress had been able to adams labeled prohibitory act act of independency calling it a compleat dismemberment of british empire hazelton declaration history 209 maier american scripture 25 27 support for declaring independence grew even more when it was confirmed that king george had hired german mercenaries to use against his american subjects friedenwald interpretation 67 despite this growing popular support for independence congress lacked clear authority to declare it delegates had been elected to congress by 13 different governments which included extralegal conventions ad hoc committees and elected assemblies and they were bound by instructions given to them regardless of their personal opinions delegates could not vote to declare independence unless their instructions permitted such an action friedenwald interpretation 77 several colonies in fact expressly prohibited their delegates from taking any steps towards separation from great britain while other delegations had instructions that were ambiguous on issue maier american scripture 30 consequently advocates of independence sought to have congressional instructions revised for congress to declare independence a majority of delegations would need authorization to vote for it and at least one colonial government would need to specifically instruct its delegation to propose a declaration of independence in congress between april and july 1776 a complex political war maier american scripture 59 was waged to bring this about jensen founding 671

as halifax resolves of april 12 with which north carolina became first colony to explicitly authorize its delegates to vote for independence jensen founding 678 79 others were legislative acts that officially ended british rule in individual colonies such as rhode island legislature renouncing its allegiance to great britain on may 4 first colony to do so jensen founding 679 friedenwald interpretation 92 93 many declarations were resolutions adopted at town or county meetings that offered support for independence a few came in form of jury instructions such as statement issued on april 23 1776 by chief justice william henry drayton of south carolina law of land authorizes me to declare that george third king of great britain has no authority over us and we owe no obedience to him maier american scripture 69 72 quoted on 72 most of these declarations are now obscure having been overshadowed by declaration approved by congress on july 2 and signed july 4 maier american

year before other local declarations maier american scripture 174 some colonies held back from endorsing independence resistance was centered in middle colonies of new york new jersey maryland pennsylvania and delaware jensen founding 682 advocates of independence saw pennsylvania as key if that colony could be converted to pro independence cause it was believed that others would follow on may 1 however opponents of independence retained control of pennsylvania assembly in a special election that had focused on question of independence jensen founding 683 in response congress passed a

resolution met with resistance in ensuing debate opponents of resolution conceded that reconciliation was unlikely with great britain while arguing that declaring independence was premature and that securing foreign aid should take priority jensen founding 689 90 maier american scripture 42 advocates of resolution countered that foreign governments would not intervene in an internal british struggle and so a formal declaration of independence was needed before foreign aid was possible all congress needed to do they insisted was to declare a fact which already exists jensen founding 689

weeks maier american scripture 42 43 friedenwald interpretation 106 until then congress decided that a committee should prepare a document announcing and explaining independence in event that lee s

would not be authorized to declare independence until after congress had made its decision friedenwald interpretation 119 20 draft and adoption political maneuvering was setting stage for an official declaration of independence even while a document was being written to explain decision on june 11 1776 congress appointed a committee of five to draft a declaration consisting of john adams of massachusetts benjamin franklin of pennsylvania thomas jefferson of virginia robert r livingston of new york and roger sherman of connecticut committee took no minutes so there is some uncertainty about how drafting process proceeded contradictory accounts were written many years later by jefferson and adams too many years to be regarded as entirely reliable although their accounts are frequently cited maier american scripture 97 105 boyd evolution 21 what is certain is that committee discussed general outline which document should follow and decided that jefferson would write first draft boyd evolution 22 committee in general and jefferson in particular thought that adams should write document but adams persuaded them to choose jefferson and promised to consult with him personally considering congress s busy schedule jefferson probably had limited time for writing over next 17 days and he likely wrote draft quickly maier american scripture 104 he then consulted others and made some changes and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations committee presented this copy to congress on june 28 1776 title of document was a declaration by

delegation for each colony numbered from two to seven members and each delegation voted among themselves to determine colony s vote pennsylvania and south carolina voted against declaring independence new york delegation abstained lacking permission to vote for independence delaware cast no vote because delegation was split between thomas mckean who voted yes and george read who voted no remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence which meant that resolution had been approved by committee of whole next step was for resolution to be voted upon by congress itself edward rutledge of

sections but it is often discussed as consisting of five parts introduction preamble indictment of king george iii denunciation of british people and conclusion introduction asserts as a matter of natural law ability of a people to assume political independence acknowledges that grounds for such independence must be reasonable and therefore explicable and ought to be explained when in course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among powers of earth separate and equal station to which laws of nature and of nature s god entitle them a decent respect to opinions of mankind requires that they should declare causes which them to separation preamble outlines a general philosophy of government that justifies revolution when government harms natural rights we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from consent of governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is right of people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are than to right themselves by abolishing forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security indictment a bill of particulars documenting king s repeated injuries and usurpations of americans rights and liberties such has been patient of these colonies and such is now necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government history of present king of great britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world he has refused his assent to laws most wholesome and necessary for public good he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them he has refused to pass other laws for accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish right of representation in legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only he has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from depository of their public records for sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness of his invasions on rights of people he has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby legislative powers incapable of annihilation have returned to people at large for their exercise state remaining in meantime exposed to all dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within he has endeavoured to prevent population of these states for that purpose obstructing laws for naturalization of foreigners refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither and raising conditions of new appropriations of lands he has obstructed administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers he has made judges dependent on his will alone for tenure of their offices and amount and payment of their salaries he has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance he has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without consent of our legislatures he has affected to render military independent of and superior to civil power he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us for protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on inhabitants of these states for cutting off our trade with all parts of world for imposing taxes on us without our consent for depriving us in many cases of benefit of trial by jury for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences for abolishing free system of english laws in a neighbouring province establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing same absolute rule into these colonies for taking away our charters abolishing our most valuable laws and altering fundamentally forms of our governments for suspending our own legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever he has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us he has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burnt our towns and destroyed lives of our people he is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty perfidy scarcely paralleled in most barbarous ages and totally unworthy head of a civilized nation he has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on high seas to bear arms against their country to become executioners of their friends and brethren or to fall themselves by their hands he has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavoured to bring on inhabitants of our frontiers merciless indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions in every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in most humble terms our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be ruler of a free people denunciation this section essentially finishes case for independence conditions that justified revolution have been shown nor have we been wanting in attentions to our british brethren we have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an jurisdiction over us we have reminded them of circumstances of our emigration and settlement here we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence they too have been deaf to voice of justice and of consanguinity we must therefore acquiesce in necessity which denounces our separation and hold them as we hold rest of mankind enemies in war in peace friends conclusion signers assert that there exist conditions under which people must change their government that british have produced such conditions and by necessity colonies must throw off political ties with british crown and become independent states conclusion contains at its core lee resolution that had been passed on july 2 we therefore representatives of united states of america in general congress assembled appealing to supreme judge of world for rectitude of our intentions do in name and by authority of good people of these colonies solemnly publish and declare that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states that they are absolved from all allegiance to british crown and that all political connection between them and state of great britain is and ought to be totally dissolved and that as free and independent states they have full power to levy war conclude peace contract alliances establish commerce and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do and for support of this declaration with a firm reliance on protection of divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor signatures first and most famous signature on engrossed copy was that of john hancock president of continental congress two future presidents thomas jefferson and john adams and a father and great grandfather of two other presidents benjamin harrison v were among signatories edward rutledge age 26 was youngest signer and benjamin franklin age 70 was oldest signer fifty six signers of declaration represented new states as follows from north to south influences and legal status thumb english political philosopher john locke 1632 1704 historians have often sought to identify sources that most influenced words and political philosophy of declaration of independence by jefferson s own admission declaration contained no original ideas but was instead a statement of sentiments widely shared by supporters of american revolution as he explained in 1825 neither aiming at originality of principle or sentiment nor yet copied from any particular and previous writing it was intended to be an expression of american mind and to give to that expression proper tone and spirit called for by occasion jefferson s most immediate sources were two documents written in june 1776 his own draft of preamble of constitution of virginia and george mason s draft of virginia declaration of rights ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in declaration of independence malone jefferson virginian 221 maier american scripture 125 26 they were in turn directly influenced by 1689 english declaration of rights which formally ended reign of king james ii maier american scripture 126 28 during american revolution jefferson and other americans looked to english declaration of rights as a model of how to end reign of an unjust king maier american scripture 53 57 scottish declaration of arbroath 1320 and dutch act of abjuration 1581 have also been offered as models for jefferson s declaration but these models are now accepted by few scholars maier found no evidence that dutch act of abjuration served as a model for declaration and considers argument unpersuasive american scripture p 264 armitage discounts influence of scottish and dutch acts and writes that neither was called declarations of independence until fairly recently global history pp 42 44 for argument in favor of influence of dutch act see stephen e lucas van a neglected model for american declaration of independence in and johanna c eds connecting cultures netherlands in five centuries of transatlantic exchange amsterdam 1994 189 207 and barbara wolff was declaration of independence inspired by dutch university of wisconsin madison news june 29 1988 http www news wisc edu accessed july 3 2013 jefferson wrote that a number of authors exerted a general influence on words of declaration boyd evolution 16 17 english political theorist john locke is usually cited as one of primary influences a man whom jefferson called one of three greatest men that have ever lived in 1922 historian carl l becker wrote most americans had absorbed locke s works as a kind of political gospel and declaration in its form in its phraseology follows closely certain sentences in locke s second treatise on government becker declaration of independence 27 extent of locke s influence on american revolution has been questioned by some subsequent scholars however historian ray forrest harvey argued in 1937 for dominant influence of swiss jurist jean jacques burlamaqui declaring that jefferson and locke were at two opposite poles in their political philosophy as evidenced by jefferson s use in declaration of independence of phrase pursuit of happiness instead of property ray forrest harvey jean jacques burlamaqui a liberal tradition in american constitutionalism chapel hill north carolina 1937 120 other scholars emphasized influence of republicanism rather than locke s classical liberalism a brief online overview of classical liberalism vs republicanism debate is alec ewald american republic 1760 1870 2004 in a similar vein historian robert middlekauff argues that political ideas of independence movement took their origins mainly from eighteenth century radical whig ideology which in turn drew on political thought of john milton james harrington and john locke see robert middlekauff 2005 glorious cause pp 3 6 51 52 136 historian garry wills argued that jefferson was influenced by scottish enlightenment particularly francis hutcheson rather than locke wills inventing america especially chs 11 13 wills concludes p 315 that air of enlightened america was full of hutcheson s politics not locke s an interpretation that has been strongly criticized hamowy jefferson and scottish enlightenment argues that wills gets much wrong p 523 that declaration seems to be influenced by hutcheson because hutcheson was like jefferson influenced by locke pp 508 09 and that jefferson often wrote of locke s influence but never mentioned hutcheson in any of his writings p 514 see also kenneth s lynn falsifying jefferson commentary 66 oct 1978 66 71 ralph luker in garry wills and new debate over declaration of independence virginia quarterly review spring 1980 244 61 agreed that wills overstated hutcheson s influence to provide a communitarian reading of declaration but he also argued that wills s critics

broadsides of which 26 are known to survive 26th copy was discovered in national archives in england in 2009 in 1777 congress commissioned mary katherine goddard to print a new broadside that listed

wrote prior to this one and how much of text was contributed by other committee members in 1947 boyd discovered a fragment of an earlier draft in jefferson s handwriting boyd papers of jefferson 1 421 jefferson and adams sent copies of rough draft to friends with slight variations during writing process jefferson showed rough draft to adams and franklin and perhaps to other members of drafting committee who made a few more changes franklin for example may have been responsible for changing jefferson s original phrase we hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable to we hold these truths to be self evident becker declaration of independence 142 note 1 boyd papers of jefferson 1 427 28 casts doubt on becker s belief that change was made by franklin jefferson incorporated these changes into a copy that was submitted to congress in name of committee copy that was submitted to congress on june 28 has been lost and was perhaps destroyed in printing process boyd lost original 448 50 boyd argued that if a document was signed on july 4 which he thought unlikely it would have been fair copy and probably would have been signed only by hancock and thomson or destroyed during debates in accordance with congress s secrecy rule ritz from here speculates that fair copy was immediately sent to printer so that copies could be made for each member of congress to consult during debate all of these copies were then destroyed theorizes ritz to preserve secrecy on april 21 2017 it was announced that a second engrossed copy had been discovered in archives at west sussex county council in chichester england named by its finders sussex declaration it differs from national archives copy which finders refer to as matlack declaration in that signatures on it are not grouped by states how it came to be in england is not yet known but finders believe that randomness of signatures points to an origin with signatory james wilson who had argued strongly that declaration was made not by states but by whole people legacy declaration was given little attention in years immediately following american revolution having served its original purpose in announcing independence of united
