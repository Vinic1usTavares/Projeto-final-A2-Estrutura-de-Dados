kritosaurus is an incompletely known genus of hadrosaurid duck billed dinosaur it lived about 74 5 66 million years ago in late cretaceous of north america name means separated lizard referring to arrangement of cheek bones in an incomplete type skull but is often mistranslated as noble lizard in reference to presumed roman nose in original specimen nasal region was fragmented and disarticulated and was originally restored flat history of discovery thumb left barnum brown s initial reconstruction of skull of k navajovius 1910 in 1904 barnum brown discovered type specimen amnh 5799 of kritosaurus near ojo alamo formation san juan county new mexico united states while following up on a previous expedition he initially could not definitely correlate stratigraphy but by 1916 was able to establish it as from what is now known as late campanian age de na zin member of kirtland formation when discovered much of front of skull had either eroded or fragmented and brown reconstructed this portion after what is now called edmontosaurus leaving out many fragments however he had noticed that something was different about fragments but ascribed differences to crushing he initially wanted to name it but found out that this name was already in use jan who had visited brown before change inadvertently leaked previous choice he kept specific name though leading to combination k navajovius 1914 publication of arch snouted canadian genus gryposaurus changed brown s mind about anatomy of his dinosaur s snout going back through fragments he revised previous reconstruction and gave it a gryposaurus like arched nasal crest he also synonymized gryposaurus with kritosaurus a move supported by charles gilmore this synonymy was used through 1920s william parks s designation of a canadian species as kritosaurus incurvimanus now considered a synonym of gryposaurus notabilis and became standard after publication of richard swann lull and nelda wright s 1942 monograph on north american hadrosaurids from this time until 1990 kritosaurus would be composed of at least type species k navajovius k incurvimanus and k notabilis former type species of gryposaurus poorly known species hadrosaurus breviceps marsh 1889 known from a dentary from campanian age judith river formation of montana was also assigned to kritosaurus by lull and wright but this is no longer accepted by late 1970s and early 1980s hadrosaurus had entered discussion as a possible synonym of either kritosaurus gryposaurus or both particularly in semi technical dinosaur dictionaries david b norman s illustrated encyclopedia of dinosaurs uses kritosaurus for canadian material gryposaurus but identifies mounted skeleton of k incurvimanus as hadrosaurus synonymization of kritosaurus and gryposaurus that lasted from 1910s to 1990 led to a distorted picture of what original kritosaurus material represented because canadian material was much more complete most representations and discussions of kritosaurus from 1920s to 1990 are actually more applicable to gryposaurus this includes for example james hopson s discussion of hadrosaur cranial ornamentation and adaptation of this for public in illustrated encyclopedia of dinosaurs formerly assigned species and material in 1984 argentine paleontologist jose bonaparte and colleagues named kritosaurus australis for hadrosaur bones from late campanian early maastrichtian los alamitos formation of rio negro patagonia argentina this species is now thought to be a synonym of secernosaurus in 1990 jack horner and david b weishampel once again separated gryposaurus citing uncertainty associated with latter s partial skull horner in 1992 described two more skulls from new mexico that he claimed belonged to kritosaurus and showed that it was quite different from gryposaurus but following year adrian hunt and spencer g lucas put each skull in its own genus creating anasazisaurus and naashoibitosaurus adrian hunt and spencer g lucas american paleontologists named anasazisaurus horneri in 1993 name was derived from anasazi an ancient native american people and greek word sauros lizard anasazi were famous for their cliff dwellings such as those in chaco canyon near location of fossil anasazisaurus remains term anasazi itself is actually a navajo language word enemy ancestors species was named in honor of jack horner american paleontologist who first described skull in 1992 holotype skull and only known specimen was collected in late 1970s by a brigham young university field party working in san juan county and is housed at byu as byu thumb unnamed specimen from sabinas basin in mexico assigned to kritosaurus sp by kirkland et al 2006 but considered an indeterminate saurolophine by prieto marquez 2013 horner originally assigned anasazisaurus skull to kritosaurus navajovius but hunt and lucas could not find any diagnostic features in limited material of kritosaurus and judged genus to be a nomen dubium since anasazisaurus skull did have diagnostic features of its own and did not appear to them to share any unique features with kritosaurus it was given new name anasazisaurus horneri an opinion which was supported by some later authors not all authors have agreed with this thomas e williamson in particular defending horner s original interpretation and several subsequent studies recognized both distinct genera a comprehensive study of known kritosaurus material published by albert prieto marquez in 2013 upheld status of naashoibitosaurus as a distinct genus but found that type specimens of kritosaurus and anasazisaurus were indistinguishable when comparing overlapping elements i e only those bones preserved in both specimens prieto marquez therefore regarded anasazisaurus as a synonym of kritosaurus but retained it as distinct species k horneri prieto marquez a 2013 skeletal morphology of kritosaurus navajovius dinosauria hadrosauridae from late cretaceous of north american south west with an evaluation of phylogenetic systematics and biogeography of kritosaurini journal of systematic palaeontology advance online publication a partial skeleton from sabinas basin in mexico was described as kritosaurus sp by jim kirkland and colleagues but considered an indeterminate saurolophine by prieto marquez 2013 this skeleton is about 20 larger than other known specimens around 11 meters 36 ft long and with a distinctively curved ischium and represents largest known well documented north american saurolophine unfortunately nasal bones are also incomplete in skull remains from this material description thumb left size comparison type specimen of kritosaurus navajovius is only represented by a partial skull and lower jaws and associated postcranial remains greater portion of muzzle and upper beak are missing length of skull is estimated at 87 centimeters 34 in from tip of upper beak to base of quadrate that articulates with lower jaw at back of skull potential diagnostic characteristics of kritosaurus include a predentary lower beak without tooth like crenulations a sharp downward bend to lower jaws near beak and a heavy somewhat rectangular maxilla upper tooth bearing bone based on skull originally referred to anasazisaurus form of complete crest is that of a tab or flange of bone from nasals that rises between and above eyes and folds back under itself this unique crest allows it to be distinguished from similar hadrosaurs like gryposaurus top of crest is roughened and maximum preserved length of skull is 90 centimeters 35 in thumb k navajovius life restoration according to prieto marquez who re diagnosed this genus in 2013 kritosaurus can be distinguished based on following characteristics length of dorsolateral margin of maxilla is extensive jugal features an orbital constriction that is deeper than infratemporal one infratemporal fenestra is greater than orbit and has a dorsal margin that is greatly elevated above dorsal orbital margin in adults frontal bone is participating in orbital margin presence of paired caudal parasagittal processes of nasals resting over frontal bones in 2016 paul estimated its length at 9 meters 30 feet paul g s 2016 princeton field guide to dinosaurs second edition princeton university press p 340 holtz 2011 gives same length https www umd edu pdf classification kritosaurus was a hadrosaurine hadrosaurid a flat headed or solid crested though many species and specimens have been referred to genus in past most of them do not show shared distinguishing characteristics to allow them to be considered part of genus or have been synonymized with other genera of hadrosaurs closest relative of kritosaurus navajovius is anasazisaurus horneri or kritosaurus horneri which together with close relatives such as gryposaurus and secernosaurus form a clade called kritosaurini within larger clade location and time separate kritosaurus and slightly older primarily canadian gryposaurus along with some cranial details thumb cast of an assigned egg following is a cladogram based on phylogenetic analysis conducted by prieto marquez and wagner in 2012 showing relationships of kritosaurus among other kritosaurini paleobiology nasal crest of kritosaurus whatever its true form may have been used for a variety of social functions such as identification of sexes or species and social ranking there may have been inflatable air sacs flanking it for both visual and auditory signaling diet and feeding thumb lower jaw in inner view as a hadrosaurid kritosaurus would have been a large bipedal quadrupedal herbivore eating plants with a sophisticated skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing its teeth were continually replacing and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth only a relative handful of which were in use at any time plant material would have been cropped by its broad beak and held in jaws by a cheek like organ feeding would have been from ground up to 4 meters 13 ft above if it was a separate genus how it would have partitioned resources with similar and contemporaneous naashoibitosaurus is unknown paleoecology thumb

skull additionally a partial skull from coahuila mexico has been referred to k navajovius since 1930s barnum brown described that an species of kritosaurus most likely candidate being kritosaurus navajovius had inhabited late maastrichtian ojo alamo formation javelina formation in texas and el formation which was a flood plain type environment at time of cretaceous these fossils might be of an unknown species of hadrosaur or an undescribed specimen of kritosaurus this genus lived alongside numerous species of dinosaurs including sauropod alamosaurus ceratopsians torosaurus and a possible species of hadrosaurs which included a possible species of edmontosaurus annectens saurolophus and gryposaurus and armored nodosaur theropods from this environment which included tyrannosaurus smaller theropods like a species of troodon and richardoestesia oviraptorid indeterminate ornithomimids and dromaeosaurs non dinosaur species that had shared same environment with kritosaurus included giant
