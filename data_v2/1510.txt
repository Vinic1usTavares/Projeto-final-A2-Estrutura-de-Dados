1995 pacific grand prix formally ii pacific grand prix was a formula one motor race held on 22 october 1995 at ti circuit aida japan it was fifteenth round of 1995 formula one season 83 lap race was won by michael schumacher for benetton team after starting from third position david coulthard who started grand prix from pole position finished second in a williams car with damon hill third in other williams schumacher s win confirmed him as 1995 drivers champion as hill could not pass schumacher s points total with only two races remaining this was also last race for jean christophe boullion hill started race alongside coulthard on front row amidst pressure from british media for not being forceful enough in battles schumacher attempted to drive around outside of hill at first corner but hill held schumacher off as jean alesi driving for ferrari got past both on inside line to take second position as a result hill dropped down to third and schumacher dropped down to fifth behind gerhard berger schumacher managed to get past alesi and hill during first of three pit stops this allowed him on a new set of slick tyres to close on coulthard who was on a two stop strategy schumacher opened up a gap of 21 seconds by lapping two seconds faster per lap than coulthard so that when his third stop came he still led race report background race originally scheduled to be held as third round of season on 16 april 1995 was moved to october as local infrastructure and communications were badly damaged from great hanshin earthquake heading into 15th race of season benetton driver michael schumacher was leading drivers championship with 82 points williams driver damon hill was second on 55 points 27 points behind schumacher a maximum of 30 points were available for remaining three races which meant that hill could still win title schumacher only needed a fourth place finish to become drivers champion as even if hill won schumacher would be more than 20 points ahead of hill with two races remaining behind hill and schumacher in drivers championship david coulthard was third on 43 points in a williams with johnny herbert and jean alesi both on 40 points in constructors championship benetton were leading on 112 points and williams were second on 92 points with a maximum of 48 points available in two weeks leading up to race there was heavy criticism towards damon hill with pundits feeling that hill had not been forceful enough in his battle at european grand prix against schumacher in an interview leading up to race part time ligier driver martin brundle said thumb upright damon hill who was criticised by pundits leading into race schumacher his title rival said that hill made half hearted attempts to overtake which led to him getting into trouble comments were prompted after a series of battles between hill and schumacher in previous race meetings most notably at belgian grand prix where hill accused schumacher of blocking him at a federation internationale de l automobile fia world motor sport council meeting on october 19 to discuss driver etiquette they opted against introducing new rules on issue formula one s governing body emphasised that international sporting code would be enforced on basis that drivers are free to drive as they wish provided they do not deliberately endanger another driver or repeatedly obstruct him on a straight following incidents during year involving hill and schumacher williams were favourites to win race due to nature of track their williams car was more suited to high downforce tracks like aida and thus had advantage over benetton in an attempt to match pace of williams cars benetton introduced a revised rear suspension geometry to benetton b195 for race there were five driver changes heading into race having been in one of two ligier cars since tenth race of season at germany martin brundle was replaced by aguri suzuki as part of two sharing drive for season jan magnussen was drafted into mclaren team to replace mika hakkinen because of finn s operation for appendicitis third driver change was ukyo katayama s return to tyrrell after missing european grand prix due to a crash at portuguese grand prix gianni morbidelli returned to footwork team replacing max papis while at pacific bertrand gachot came back to replace jean denis deletraz both men having driven for these teams at start of season deletraz was replaced as he had not made agreed payment instalments to pacific team for privilege of drive pacific had originally intended to run local driver katsumi yamamoto in place of deletraz but he was not granted an fia super licence and so gachot retook seat similarly forti team s plans to replace roberto moreno with hideki noda came to nought for same reason even though noda had started three grands prix for team previous year practice and qualifying two practice sessions were held before race first was held on friday morning and second on saturday morning both sessions lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes with weather conditions dry throughout schumacher set fastest time in first session posting a lap of 1 16 057 three tenths of a second quicker than hill and coulthard in second and third places respectively ferrari cars were fourth and fifth fastest gerhard berger ahead of jean alesi with mclaren driver mark blundell rounding out top six coulthard lapped faster than schumacher in second practice session with a time of 1 15 730 hill was second in williams three tenths of a second behind coulthard eddie irvine in jordan car was fourth seven tenths behind coulthard he was split by ferrari cars who were third and fifth alesi in front of berger benetton cars were sixth and seventh schumacher in front of herbert heinz harald frentzen and jean christophe boullion were eighth and tenth in sauber cars with rubens barrichello ninth in jordan two seconds off pace thumb left upright david coulthard who took pole position in his williams car picture taken in while driving at red bull racing qualifying session was split into two one hour sessions first was held on friday afternoon with second held on saturday afternoon fastest time from either sessions counted towards their final grid position coulthard clinched his fourth consecutive pole position in his williams with a time of 1 14 013 he was joined on front row by teammate hill who was two tenths of a second behind schumacher was third in benetton edging closer to williams drivers throughout both days of qualifying by steadily reducing downforce on his car his last run right at end of second session pressured coulthard into leaving pit lane to cover german pole position man thus used an additional set of slick tyres meaning that out of allocation of seven sets of slick tyres as set out by fia he had only two sets of brand new rubber for race whereas schumacher had advantage of three sets of new rubber hill concerned about starting from dirty side of track side of track that is opposite to racing line had only two sets of brand new tyres for race berger took fourth despite going off into gravel late in second part of qualifying berger s teammate alesi was fifth with irvine completing top six for his best qualifying position of season rookie magnussen qualified 12th only two places behind teammate blundell after not making a mistake in either of two sessions returning drivers suzuki katayama morbidelli and gachot qualified 13th 17th 19th and 24th respectively with grid covered by 7 392 seconds race conditions for race were dry with air temperature drivers took to track at 09 30 jst gmt 9 for a 30 minute warm up session both williams cars maintained their good performance from qualifying coulthard had fastest time of 1 16 831 hill was third in other williams car boullion split them in sauber for second position olivier panis completed top four in a ligier car eight tenths of a second behind hill hill drove spare williams car along inside of start finish straight in an effort to clean up his grid position on dusty side of track schumacher finished session in eighth despite going off track damaging his race car in process remote and inaccessible nature of circuit and fact that japanese grand prix took place just one week later resulted in a meagre race day crowd of only 15 000 spectators race started at 14 00 jst coulthard from pole position on grid held onto lead into first corner hill who started alongside coulthard had a bad start schumacher attempted to go around outside of hill at first corner but hill held schumacher off both drivers ran off racing line in process allowing alesi through into second place at end of lap one coulthard led alesi by 2 8 seconds with hill a further three tenths back berger was fourth with schumacher demoted to fifth information from on screen rundown of lead positions at end of lap one bertrand gachot in pacific became first person to retire from race with a gearbox problem on lap two he was followed by suzuki and boullion who both spun off track and were unable to continue boullion blamed his spin on minardi driver pedro lamy whom he accused of weaving in front of him schumacher passed berger for fourth position on lap five and immediately began closing on hill in third who himself was only a few tenths behind alesi schumacher attempted to pass hill on lap 11 for third place at hairpin but hill held him off as hill and schumacher were held up by slower ferrari cars coulthard pulled away by more than a second a lap in first eight laps by lap 18 coulthard s gap to second place was 14 seconds and it appeared that he would win race comfortably thumb right upright michael schumacher who was crowned 1995 formula one drivers champion as a result of his win pictured in 1994 alesi hill and schumacher all made pit stops for their first of three stops on lap 18 benetton pitcrew made a quick stop for schumacher allowing him to get out ahead of alesi and hill hill lost additional time with a sticking refuelling valve causing his stop to last almost twice as long as schumacher s schumacher exited pit stop in fourth place behind coulthard and yet to stop berger and herbert with alesi in seventh place split from schumacher by irvine and hill in tenth place separated from alesi by frentzen and blundell with alesi and hill held up by slower runners on two stop strategies in front schumacher pulled away and closed in on coulthard blundell made a pit stop on next lap and hill passed frentzen on lap 22 on following lap alesi passed irvine at hairpin hill tried to follow alesi through but his front wing hit rear of irvine s car causing minor damage irvine made a pit stop at end of lap 25 allowing hill to resume his chase of alesi unimpeded like his teammate coulthard was scheduled to make three stops but his pit strategy was changed to make only two by staying out six laps longer than originally scheduled and then taking onboard more fuel than first planned at his first stop on lap 24 as a result of a lighter fuel load for schumacher because of different strategies schumacher began to consistently lap faster than scotsman schumacher made his second stop on lap 38 and came out of pit lane just in front of third placed alesi but over twenty seconds behind coulthard schumacher immediately began setting fastest laps and began to close in on coulthard once more hill managed to move up to third in front of alesi during their second pit stops on laps 38 and 39 respectively ferrari of alesi then dropped further back as teammate berger passed him at hairpin for fourth position on lap 45 coulthard made his second and final stop for new tyres on lap 49 exiting 14 seconds behind schumacher who continued to extend margin between two coulthard was unable to capitalise on performance advantage offered by new tyres after stop due to lapped traffic getting in his way german made his third and final pit stop on lap 60 with a 21 second advantage exiting in front of coulthard to lead race schumacher opened gap to 15 seconds and won race after 83 laps to secure his eighth victory of season in a time of 1 48 49 schumacher was crowned 1995 drivers champion as hill could not catch his points total with two races remaining he also became youngest double drivers champion in formula one history coulthard finished second in his williams 14 seconds behind schumacher with teammate hill third ferrari cars of berger and alesi were fourth and fifth respectively but off pace as schumacher lapped them both in closing stages berger suffered from a misfiring engine throughout race herbert took final point in sixth place for benetton ahead of frentzen panis and blundell throughout race barrichello and magnussen engaged in a battle for tenth and eleventh positions with magnussen keeping barrichello behind until lap 37 when brazilian managed to overtake him into hairpin magnussen finished in tenth place but barrichello subsequently retired on lap 67 with an engine problem magnussen s first race was described as highly accomplished by year s annual after his impressive qualifying performance irvine was heading for eighth place but made an unscheduled pit stop on lap 72 and dropped to eleventh attrition rate was low with 17 of 24 starters finishing race post race after race it was revealed that schumacher endured a problem after his final stop and that he was lucky to complete final lap as warning lights had activated on his steering wheel schumacher praised his pitcrew for doing a perfect first stop which helped him move in front of alesi and hill he said he never saw anything like this team and its ability to come up with strategies and that they never made one mistake this season off camera while going through parc ferme schumacher and hill renewed their argument from belgian grand prix over what degree of blocking was acceptable after their first corner incident schumacher told hill that he was unhappy with hill s driving throughout race most notably during schumacher s overtaking attempts on lap one and lap eleven where schumacher felt hill had brake tested him hill refuted schumacher s claims saying despite hill s comments he endured continued criticism by british media after poor performance speculation brewed that williams were going to replace him with frentzen for 1996 season despite rumours williams team boss frank williams gave hill an unequivocal vote of confidence heading into next race japanese grand prix schumacher subsequently changed his opinion of incident after watching video footage prior to japanese race and no longer blamed hill for it during an interview coulthard who finished second revealed that it was his decision to change to a two stop strategy from a three stop strategy telling williams pitcrew to delay his stop afterwards he said that in hindsight he would have stayed on a three stop strategy and wished he could blame someone else for this decision but i can t 1995 race was last held at aida circuit and last formula one race to date held under pacific grand prix banner with manager of ti circuit unable
