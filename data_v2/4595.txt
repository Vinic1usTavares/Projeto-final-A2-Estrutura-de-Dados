tax protesters in united states advance a number of constitutional arguments asserting that imposition assessment and collection of federal income tax violates united states constitution these kinds of arguments though related to are distinguished from statutory and administrative arguments which presuppose constitutionality of income tax as well as from general conspiracy arguments which are based upon proposition that three branches of federal government are involved together in a deliberate on going campaign of deception for purpose of defrauding individuals or entities of their wealth or profits although constitutional challenges to u s tax laws are frequently directed towards validity and effect of sixteenth amendment assertions that income tax violates various other provisions of constitution have been made as well first amendment some protesters argue that imposition of income taxes violates first amendment freedom of speech because it requires subject of tax to write information on a tax return this argument can be rejected as specious because what first amendment protects is right to communicate and does not in any manner provide any right not to say anything

pending and inoperative titles of nobility amendment proposed as an amendment to constitution by 11th congress in 1810 it would if ratified by required number of states strip united states citizenship from any citizen who accepted a title of nobility from a foreign government contention here is that this amendment was in fact ratified by required number of states in 1810s to have become an operative part of constitution and that because this is so actions taken by lawyers and judges who use title esquire asserted to be a title of nobility and monarchical are unconstitutional in fact use of esquire by lawyers and judges is merely an informal custom in united states not a title with any legal standing tussle over titles aba journal this contention rarely raised before courts was most

mined as depreciation within meaning of 1909 act stratton case involved income taxation of a corporation not of individuals court in stratton case did not rule any corporate or individual income tax as unconstitutional doyle v mitchell bros co some tax protesters have cited doyle v mitchell bros co for proposition that income of individuals cannot be taxed this was argument raised unsuccessfully

2 u s tax cas cch p 50 935 d mass 1999 following language is sometimes cited by protesters above verbiage is immediately followed in text of case by this sentence in doyle taxpayer was a corporation engaged in manufacture of lumber in 1903 taxpayer purchased certain timber land at a cost of about as of december 31 1908 value of land had increased to about corporation excise tax act of 1909 was enacted on august 5 1909 and was effective retroactively to january 1 1909 for years 1909 through 1912 taxpayer filed tax returns under 1909 act showing gross receipts from sale of manufactured lumber and in arriving at amount of net income subject to tax under 1909 act deducted an amount based on 40 per acre value rather than actual cost of about 20 per acre commissioner of internal revenue argued that taxpayer should be able to deduct only an amount based on taxpayer s historical cost basis of 20 rather than 40 fair market value at time 1909 act became effective essentially if taxpayer were allowed to use 40 per acre value as its basis rather than actual 20 historical cost basis a portion of taxpayer s gain increase in value from 1903 to december 31 1908 would go untaxed u s supreme court ruled that under 1909 act which had become effective january 1 1909 taxpayer should be taxed only on increase in value after 1908 increases in value prior to effective date of statute were not to be taxed under terms of that statute thus taxpayer was entitled to deduct from its gross receipts from sale of finished lumber a basis amount computed with reference to 40 per acre value as of december 31 1908 doyle is a case involving statutory not constitutional interpretation in this case court was interpreting 1909 statute although some tax protesters cite this case for an argument about constitutional definition of income as excluding income of individuals no issues involving constitutional definition of income or of income under any other tax statutes were presented to or decided by court case is also notable for fact that it involved a retroactively imposed tax taxpayer did not argue and court did not rule that as a general proposition taxes could not be imposed retroactively indeed tax in this case was imposed retroactively statute was enacted in august 1909 but was made effective retroactively to january 1 1909 corporate profits one argument repeatedly made by tax protesters is that income of individuals is not taxable because income should mean only corporate profits or corporate gain this is merchants loan argument named after case of merchants loan trust company as trustee of estate of arthur ryerson deceased plaintiff in error v julius f formerly united states collector of internal revenue for first district of state of illinois 255 u s 509 1921 argument is essentially that income for federal income tax purposes means only income of a corporation not income of a non corporate taxpayer because united states supreme court in that case in discussing meaning of income mentioned a statute enacted in 1909 that taxed income of corporations court in merchants loan was specifically interpreting a 1916 statute imposing income taxes on individuals and estates among other kinds of entities and not 1909 corporate tax statute taxpayer in merchants loan was not a corporation but was estate of arthur ryerson deceased court was not presented with and did not decide any issue involving taxability of corporate profits or corporate gains or any other kind of income except gain on sale of stock by estate of arthur ryerson deceased terms corporate profit and corporate gain are not found in text of court s decision in merchants loan in merchants loan supreme court ruled that under sixteenth amendment to united states constitution and 1916 tax statute applicable at time a gain on a sale of stock by estate of a deceased person is included in income of that estate and is therefore taxable to that estate for federal income tax purposes merchants loan argument has been litigated by tax protesters several times and courts have uniformly rejected argument that income consists only of corporate profits see for example cameron v

have lost every case using merchants loan for theory that only corporate profits could be taxable are citing a case where u s supreme court ruled that income of a non corporate taxpayer is taxable neither united states supreme court nor any other federal court has ever ruled that under internal revenue code term income means only income of a corporation for federal income tax purposes some tax protesters have cited supreme court case of flint v stone tracy co for argument that only corporate profits or income can be taxed using following quotation in flint v stone tracy co u s supreme court ruled that corporation tax act of 1909 did not violate constitutional requirement that revenue measures originate in u s house of representatives court did not rule that excise taxes consisted only of taxes on corporations and corporate privileges to exclusion of taxes on individuals natural persons issue of validity of an income tax imposed on individuals was neither presented to court nor decided by court courts have rejected argument that flint v stone tracy co can be used to avoid taxation of wages for example in parker v commissioner a case where a taxpayer unsuccessfully argued that wages were not taxable united states court of appeals for fifth circuit stated in part argument that only corporations are subject to federal income tax and variations of this argument have been officially identified as legally frivolous federal tax return positions for purposes of 5 000 frivolous tax return penalty imposed under internal revenue code section 6702 a cases indicating definition of income is irrelevant at least two federal courts have indicated that congress may constitutionally tax an item as income regardless of whether that item is income within meaning of sixteenth amendment in penn mutual indemnity co v commissioner united states court of appeals for third circuit stated in murphy v internal revenue serv united states court of appeals for district of columbia circuit ruled

progressive taxation one argument that has been raised is that because federal income tax is progressive i e because marginal tax rates increase or progress as level of taxable income increases discriminations and inequalities created by tax should render tax unconstitutional this argument was rejected by united states supreme court in two companion cases with respect to income tax on

cover earnings from labor see e g united states v lawson 670 f 2d 923 82 1 u s tax cas cch p 10th cir 1982 see also coleman v commissioner 791 f 2d 68 86 1 u s tax cas cch p 9401 7th cir 1986 where

income tax charges july 13 2007 shreveport times at argued that law does not tax a person s wages and that federal government cannot tax m oney that you earned and paid for with your labor and industry because constitution does not allow federal government to tax those earnings referring to wages salaries and fees that a person earn s for himself see arguments about taxability of compensation for personal services whether called wages salary or some other term may be either constitutional arguments as in united states v connor see below 898 f 2d 942 90 1 u s tax cas cch p 50 166 3d cir 1990 or statutory arguments as in cheek v united states depending on details of argument for purposes of presentation these arguments are summarized here rather than in article tax protester statutory arguments rest of this section explains these arguments in more detail evans v gore some protesters include false quotations in their arguments radio personality dave champion contends that following verbiage is a quotation from case of evans v gore in his own arguments on internet about federal income taxes quoted material by dave champion is false it does not appear in court s decision in evans v gore u s supreme court actually did rule that a federal income tax on certain income of federal judges was unconstitutional evans v gore ruling has been interpreted as barring application of federal income tax to a federal judge who had been appointed prior to enactment of tax see u s supreme court s interpretation of evans v gore in this was court s year 1920 interpretation of compensation clause rule that federal judges shall at stated times receive for their services a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office under article iii section 1 of u s constitution decision in evans v gore was eviscerated in 1939 u s supreme court decision of o malley v and was expressly overruled by u s supreme court itself in 2001 in case of united states v hatter see also in hatter supreme court stated we now overrule evans insofar as it holds that compensation clause forbids congress to apply a generally applicable tax to salaries of federal judges whether or not they were appointed before enactment of tax neither supreme court nor any other federal court has ever ruled that sixteenth amendment or any other part of constitution does not authorize a federal income tax on compensation for personal services southern pacific co v lowe another united states supreme court case frequently cited by tax protesters is southern pacific co v lowe tax protesters attribute following quotation to court in this case income as used in statute should be given a meaning so as not to include everything that comes in quotation does not appear in text of supreme court decision this case began in united states district court for southern district of new york in decision in that court trial court judge stated i do not think that income as used in statute should be given a meaning so as to include everything that comes in southern pacific co v lowe 238 f 847 850 s d n y 1917 case did not involve compensation for labor or services instead case involved federal income tax treatment of dividends paid by central pacific railway company to its parent company southern pacific company which owned 100 of stock of central pacific railway company district court ruled that dividends were taxable to southern pacific company this decision was reversed by supreme court what u s supreme court actually said was in southern pacific company v lowe supreme court ruled that where a shareholder receives a dividend representing earnings of a corporation realized by corporation prior to january 1 1913 dividend is not in gross income of shareholder for purposes of federal income tax act of 1913 ch 16 38 stat 114 oct 3 1913 no issues involving definition of income with respect to wages salary or other compensation for labor were decided by court colonial pipeline co v traigle another case that has been cited for argument that wages are not taxable is united states supreme court decision in colonial pipeline co v traigle an individual named william dixon at a web site called claims that following is a statement by u s supreme court in that case this material alleged to be a quotation does not appear in text of case at all also words wages and salaries are not found anywhere in text and there is no ruling in that case that federal income tax statutes apply only to corporations colonial pipeline case actually involved louisiana corporate franchise tax not a federal tax validity of louisiana franchise tax was upheld by u s supreme court in this case no issues involving validity or applicability of federal income taxes were presented to mentioned by or decided by supreme court in colonial pipeline case lucas v earl for argument that wages are not taxable some tax protesters including convicted tax offender irwin schiff incorrectly attribute to u s supreme court following language in connection with leading tax case of lucas v earl this language is not from court s opinion in lucas v earl instead it is an almost direct quotation from page 17 of taxpayer s brief filed in case guy c earl was taxpayer and brief was written by earl s attorneys warren olney jr j m jr and henry d costigan in some printed versions of case this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8 10 14 15 17 and 18 of taxpayer s brief are re printed as a headnote or syllabus above opinion of court respondent s taxpayer s brief is available in pdf format at web site for college of law of university of cincinnati see file pdf in case reprints that include this headnote and many of them do not even show it these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from taxpayer s brief a person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage like any headnote or syllabus is not part of court s opinion perhaps leading to confusion about source of quotation as explained below supreme court rejected arguments in quotation and taxpayer lost case lucas v earl is a leading case in area of u s income taxation and stands for anticipatory assignment of income doctrine in case mr earl was arguing that because he and his wife in year 1901 had made a legally valid assignment agreement for state law purposes to have his then current and after acquired income which was earned solely by him be treated as income of both him and his wife as joint tenants with right of survivorship assignment agreement should also determine federal income tax effect of income he earned i e only half income should be taxed to him u s supreme court rejected that argument essentially ruling that under federal income tax law all future income earned by mr earl was taxable to him at time he earned income even though he had already assigned part of income to his wife and regardless of validity of assignment agreement under state law court in lucas v earl did not rule that wages are not taxable coppage v kansas one case frequently cited by tax g see peter e hendrickson at his web site see also robert schulz at and dave champion at intent org edu php for wages are not taxable argument is coppage v kansas with respect to following quotation coppage was a criminal case involving a defendant convicted under a kansas statute of firing an employee for refusing to resign as a member of a labor union no issues of taxation were presented to or decided by court and word tax is not found in text of court s decision truax v corrigan tax protesters also cite or quote see e g tom cryer at from case of truax v corrigan for argument that an income tax should not be imposed on labor and at least arguably relating labor to a right of property truax case involved a mr william truax who owned a restaurant called english kitchen in bisbee arizona a mr michael corrigan and others were former cooks and waiters at restaurant corrigan and others allegedly instituted a boycott of restaurant after a dispute arose over terms and conditions of employment a strike was allegedly ordered by a local union with respect to certain union members employed at restaurant restaurant s business was allegedly harmed and mr truax sued various parties on a variety of grounds lawsuit was thrown out by trial court before case could be heard on theory that mr truax was incorrect as a matter of law mr truax appealed and case eventually ended up in u s supreme court u s supreme court ruled that trial court should not have thrown out lawsuit but should have heard mr truax s case case was sent back to trial court so that a trial could take place truax was not a tax case no issues involving taxation were presented to or decided by court butchers union co v crescent city co tax protesters also citesee e g posting of we people foundation at u s supreme court case of butcher s union co v crescent city co for argument that an income tax should not be imposed on labor sometimes quoting following language butchers union co was a case involving interpretation of louisiana constitution and certain ordinances of city of new orleans court ruled that louisiana constitution and new orleans ordinances did not impermissibly impair a pre existing obligation under a contract when those laws effectively ended a slaughter house business monopoly by crescent city company no issues regarding power to tax incomes from businesses vocations or labor were presented to or decided by court and word tax does not appear in text of decision murdock case tax protesters also citesee e g case of murdock v pennsylvania also known as jones v city of opelika murdock or jones v city of opelika was a case involving validity of a city ordinance in jeannette pennsylvania worded as follows a group of people who were jehovah s witnesses went from door to door distributing literature in town they failed to obtain license under ordinance case ended up in court and went all way to u s supreme court which stated protester argument appears to be that federal government should not be able to tax income from labor because it would be a tax on an exercise of freedoms mentioned in quotation tax in this case was in effect a license fee imposed on door to door sales people under a city ordinance city was trying to exact fee from jehovah s witness members who were going door to door questions about validity of federal income taxes were neither presented to nor decided by court redfield v fisher some tax protesters cite or e g from redfield v fisher 135 or 180 292 p 813 1930 argument seems to be that because individual s rights to live and own property are arguably rights against which an excise cannot be imposed federal income tax on income from labor should therefore be unconstitutional however redfield v fisher is an oregon supreme court case not a federal case no issues involving validity of federal income tax laws were decided by court conner v united states some tax protesters cite a case called conner v united states 303 f supp 1187 s d tex 1969 aff d in part and rev d in part 439 f 2d 974 5th cir 1971 with a quotation that congress has taxed income not compensation for argument that wages are not taxable this was case cited unsuccessfully by sumter before u s court of federal claims in case of sumter v united states 61 fed cl 517 2004 2 u s tax cas cch p 50 375 2004 conner case involved taxability of compensation paid by an insurance company to a policy holder whose house had burned down insurance company was reimbursing homeowner for costs of renting a place to stay after home burned down under terms of insurance policy insurance company was not paying wages court was not presented with and did not decide any issue involving taxability of wages eisner v macomber some tax protesters have cited u s supreme court decision in case of eisner v macomber for theory that wages are not taxable robert clarkson at or for theory that dividends are not taxable see e g case dealt with a stock dividend on stock that was essentially equivalent to a stock split as opposed to a cash dividend on stock in case of this kind of dividend stockholder does not receive anything or realize any additional value for example if a stockholder owns 100 shares of stock having a value of 4 per share total value is 400 if corporation declares say a two for one stock dividend that is essentially similar to a stock split and corporation distributes no money or other property stockholder now has 200 shares with a value of 2 each which is still 400 in value i e no increase in value and no income pie is still same size but it s sliced into more pieces each piece being proportionately smaller more directly to point there has been no sale or other disposition of stock taxpayer still owns same asset i e same interest in corporation he owned prior to stock dividend so even if his basis amount generally amount he originally paid for stock is less than 400 value i e even if he has an unrealized or potential gain he still has not yet realized gain court ruled that this kind of stock dividend is not treated as income to a shareholder court in this case did not rule on any issue involving taxability of labor or income from labor or wages salary or ordinary cash dividends where stockholder actually receives a check from company etc indeed terms wage and salary do not appear in text of decision in eisner v macomber cases where wages or labor ruled taxable provisions of u s constitution authorizing congress to impose taxes duties imposts and excises contain no express exceptions for taxes on wages or labor or for taxes on income from labor courts have consistently rejected arguments that wages or labor whether denominated as labor property or not cannot be taxed under internal revenue code united states court of appeals for eighth circuit has stated taxpayers argument that compensation for labor is not constitutionally subject to federal income tax is without merit there is no constitutional impediment to levying an income tax on compensation for a taxpayer s labors funk v commissioner 687 f 2d 264 8th cir 1982 per curiam at see also united states v connor tax evasion conviction under affirmed by united states court of appeals for third circuit taxpayer s argument that because of sixteenth amendment wages were not taxable was rejected by court taxpayer s argument that an income tax on wages is required to be apportioned by population also rejected at parker v commissioner taxpayer s argument that wages are not taxable was rejected by united states court of appeals for fifth circuit taxpayer charged double costs for filing a frivolous appeal at perkins v f 2d 1187 84 2 u s tax cas cch p 6th cir 1984 ruled by united states court of appeals for sixth circuit to be in full accordance with congressional authority under sixteenth amendment to constitution to impose taxes on income without apportionment among states taxpayer s argument that wages paid for labor are non taxable was rejected by court and ruled frivolous at sisemore v united f 2d 268 86 2 u s tax cas cch p 6th cir 1986 per curiam cert denied 107 s ct 274 1986 united states court of appeals for sixth circuit ruled that federal district court properly dismissed taxpayer s frivolous lawsuit based on taxpayer s tax return position that wages do not represent a taxable gain because wages are a source of income and are received in equal exchange for labor at white v united 1 u s tax cas cch p 50 289 6th cir 2004 cert denied u s 2005 taxpayer s argument that wages are not taxable was ruled frivolous

s tax cas cch p 11th cir 1985 taxpayer s argument that income taxation of wages is unconstitutional was rejected by united states court of appeals for eleventh circuit taxpayer required to pay damages for filing frivolous suit at related tax protester arguments with respect to wages paid by employers to employees are 1 that only federal officers federal employees elected officials or corporate officers are employees for purposes of federal income tax 2 that inclusion of united states government within definition of term employer operates to exclude all other employers from definition and 3 that with respect to compensation tax is imposed only on compensation paid to federal government employees these arguments have been rejected in court rulings see e g mckinley v united states 92 2 u s tax cas cch p 50 509 s d ohio 1992 another tax protester argument is that income from labor should not be taxable because any amount worker receives in exchange for his or her labor is received in an exchange of equal value although an exchange in any true arm s length fair market value transaction is essentially by definition an exchange of equal value see for example decision of united states court of appeals for ninth circuit in united states v buras 633 f 2d 1356 81 1 u s tax cas cch p 9126 9th cir 1980 in which taxpayer s theory that wages were not taxable because 1 only profit or gain such as that from sale of a capital asset constituted income subject to federal tax and 2 w ages could not constitute gain or profit because wages merely represent an equivalent exchange for one s labor was rejected see also decision of united states tax court in link v commissioner cch dec 56 565 m t c memo 2006 146 2006 where taxpayer s argument that pension income is labor property and that when taxpayer receives his pension income from his former employer for whom he once performed services or labor any amount he receives in exchange for his labor is a exchange of equal value was rejected in boggs v commissioner a penalty of 8 000 was imposed by united states court of appeals for sixth circuit on taxpayers for filing a frivolous appeal using argument that a portion of a wage amount was not taxable as a return on human capital boggs v commissioner case no 1836 06 6th cir june 10 2009 further under u s federal tax laws even if labor were considered property gain or income from labor property would be defined as excess of amount realized for example money received by taxpayer over amount of taxpayer s adjusted basis in property see since taxpayer can have only a zero basis amount in his or her own labor v commissioner 77 t c m cch 1192 t c memo 1999 2 cch dec 53 203 m 1999 personal living expenses incurred to generate labor being both non and under non deductible gain would thus be equal to amount of compensation received by taxpayer compare carter v commissioner 784 f 2d 1006 86 1 u s tax cas cch p 9th cir 1986 where united states court of appeals for ninth circuit stated assertion that proceeds received for personal services cannot be given a zero basis for purpose of assessment of taxation is frivolous this is a variation of wages are not income theme which has been rejected repeatedly by this court see also reading v commissioner taxpayer s argument that gain from labor of self employed individual cannot be determined until cost of doing labor has been subtracted from amount received was rejected validity of disallowing deductions for personal living expenses was upheld 70 t c 730 cch dec 35 354 1978 aff d per curiam 614 f 2d 159 80 1 u s tax cas cch p 8th cir 1980 see also burnett v commissioner taxpayer s argument that wages represent an equal exchange of property and therefore are not taxable income was rejected 68 t c m cch 811 t c

tax on wages and salaries but only on gain or profit cheek 498 u s at 196 monetary penalties for asserting argument on tax return argument that wages tips and other compensation received for
