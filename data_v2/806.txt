suspicious looks production mountain of madness was written by john swartzwelder although script underwent many rewrites according to josh weinstein a swartzwelder script is like a finely tooled crazy german machine and if you have wrong engineers try to fix it it blows up and that s thing cause it had great jokes but we sort of changed story and went through a bunch of drafts story was completely rewritten and as a result plot became odder and quirkier with scenes of paranoia deriving from this original script was really crazy but a lot of more insane material was cut however most of rewrites were done during script writing and did not require any major animation changes one change was ending which was added after animatic episode features several pairings of established characters who had previously interacted little such as waylon smithers with bart and lisa weinstein feels that this was one of first episodes to really feature duo of lenny leonard and carl carlson and developed them more episode was directed by mark kirkland and a lot of new designs and backgrounds had to be created for wilderness scenes backgrounds were designed by animator debbie silver design of forest ranger was based on then vice president al gore in episode marge watches an old film which includes a comment from naturalist john muir impression of muir was done by dan castellaneta who originally based voice on an impersonator he met at yosemite national park however producers asked him to make voice older and crazier reception in its original broadcast mountain of madness finished 38th in ratings
