action of 18 october 1806 was a minor naval engagement during napoleonic wars fought between british royal navy frigate hms caroline and a dutch squadron at entrance to batavia harbour on java in dutch east indies during battle dutch frigate maria riggersbergen was left unsupported by remainder of squadron and isolated was forced to surrender captain peter rainier british commander was subsequently free to remove his prize from within sight of dutch port when remainder of dutch squadron refused to engage caroline and their crews deliberately grounded ships to avoid capture he also returned many prisoners taken previously in a captured brig action and that of with earlier action of 26 july 1806 demonstrated weakness of dutch squadron in east indies and convinced rear admiral sir edward pellew to lead an operation against batavia to eliminate remainder of dutch squadron in november 1806 this second raid was only partially successful and was followed a year later by a raid on harbour of griessie in which last dutch warships in east were eliminated background by 1806 french squadron under rear admiral charles linois departed for atlantic ocean and a british expeditionary force captured cape of good hope rear admiral sir edward pellew commander of british royal navy in eastern half of indian ocean at madras in british india in eastern half of indian ocean was now able to concentrate on a major threat to british shipping in region dutch squadron based in dutch east indies specifically on java at port of batavia dutch squadron which consisted of a number of old ships of line three frigates and a number of smaller warships was primarily an anti piracy force however their presence so close to straits of malacca a major british trade route was of concern to pellew particularly following battle of pulo aura in 1804 when linois s squadron intercepted a vital british convoy in strait using batavia both as a base to launch operation and repair damage afterwards clowes p 336 determined to eliminate dutch squadron pellew despatched frigates to region in spring of 1806 under orders to disrupt trade and reconnoitre dutch harbours and bases in july 1806 frigate hms greyhound cruised molucca islands and captured a dutch frigate and convoy at action of 26 july 1806 off celebes encouraging further expeditions james p 252 in october 1806 a second frigate 36 gun hms caroline under captain peter rainier nephew of admiral peter rainier whom pellew had replaced cruised in java sea caroline had a successful start to operation discovering that dutch ships of line had left batavia harbour and sailed eastwards he had also captured a number of dutch ships so that by mid october 57 of rainier s crew more than a fifth were aboard prizes on journey back to india leaving caroline with just 204 men and a large number of prisoners carried below decks henderson p 79 battle on 18 october rainier was cruising in java sea when he encountered and captured a small dutch brig sailing from bantam from prisoners removed from this ship rainier learned that dutch frigate phoenix was undergoing repairs at small island of onrust in thousand islands deciding that phoenix was lying in an exposed position and could be easily attacked rainier sailed caroline towards onrust but was spotted in passage between and amsterdam islands by two small dutch warships rainier attacked small vessels seizing 14 gun brig zeerop without a shot fired other vessel zee ploeg escaped into shallow coastal waters where deeper drafted frigate could not follow delay allowed phoenix to sail to batavia ahead of caroline s pursuit as caroline neared batavia phoenix entered well defended harbour making further pursuit impossible however rainier then sighted a second frigate lying at anchor in batavia roads accompanied only by 14 gun corvette william elusive brig zee ploeg and 18 gun ship patriot that belonged to dutch east india company prisoners from zeerop identified this ship as 36 gun maria riggersbergen under captain claas jager although this force was significantly stronger than caroline and could call on support of approximately 30 gunboats anchored closer inshore rainier immediately gave orders to advance on dutch frigate in his preparations for battle rainier ordered that springs be placed on his anchor cables giving his ship ability to easily turn at anchor to face new threats once engaged with maria riggersbergen james p 266 as caroline approached captain jager ordered his men to open fire on british frigate at extreme range also calling on support from other dutch vessels anchored nearby in response rainier gave orders for his men to hold fire enduring dutch guns until his frigate was just away before unleashing a full broadside jager responded but british fire was too strong and within half an hour dutch flag was struck taking possession of dutch frigate lieutenant lemage discovered that 50 of 270 men aboard had been killed or wounded and that ship had suffered moderate damage to its masts and rigging james p 267 british casualties in engagement were three killed outright and eighteen more wounded six of whom subsequently died also killed were four dutch prisoners who had been sheltering in hold while lemage was boarding maria riggersbergen rainier had turned his attention to other ships in bay however sea was shallow and crossed by shoals that prevented further advance without proper charts which caroline lacked although they had fired a number of shots at long range interference by smaller dutch vessels during battle had been negligible following surrender of maria riggersbergen most of shipping in bay including all seven of merchant vessels three small warships and phoenix had deliberately beached themselves to avoid capture abandoning idea of further operations off batavia as too risky rainier ordered his ships to sail placing most of dutch prisoners including wounded and sick into first brig captured that morning and ordering ship to return to batavia as a cartel with officers placed under parole restrictions with most of his prisoners removed rainier then ordered maria riggersbergen and zeerop to return to madras aftermath ranier s action against what appeared to be superior power and numbers exposed poor quality of dutch squadron at batavia pellew determined to make a decisive attack on capital of dutch east indies during 1806 in november he led a powerful squadron to harbour once again forcing dutch to their squadron ashore where it was burnt by boarding parties led by admiral pellew s son captain fleetwood pellew gardiner p 82 following year admiral pellew returned in search of missing ships of line discovering them at griessie and causing dutch to destroy them too with dutch squadron eliminated threat to british trade routes was removed and attention returned to french bases in indian ocean british waiting until 1811 to force surrender of remaining dutch colonies in east indies gardiner p 107 maria riggersbergen was recommissioned into royal navy as hms java under captain george pigot in his report after battle rainier described dutch frigate as launched in 1800 and is a fast sailing ship journey to madras had revealed that she was in fact much older and very unstable at sea java and all hands disappeared six months later in a february 1807 hurricane in west indian ocean while in convoy with flagship of sir thomas troubridge hms blenheim during a hurricane in western indian ocean grocott p 233 rainier remained in pacific for some time capturing valuable spanish ship san raphael in january 1807 but ultimately his career stalled on his return to europe henderson p 82 notes references bibliography category naval battles involving
