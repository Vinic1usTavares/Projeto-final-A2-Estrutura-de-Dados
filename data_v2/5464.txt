1949 american edition like his forebears in genre hyde had a left wing agenda that he expressed in his art when southern cross appeared genre had been out of public eye for so long that hyde included

execution by gunfire frans masereel s passionate journey 1919 and other wordless novels influenced hyde in a talk with cbc in 1952 literary critic northrop frye praised hyde s visual skills but said there s no point in getting book for your library unless you like engravings themselves as separate works of art he found book a quick read in contrast to time it took to make it and called its continuity a weak point he considered visualization of bomb s destruction of living things strongest justification for work comics critic sean rogers praised work particularly pacing and action sequences but felt it had less impact than such earlier works as masereel s passionate journey 1919 or ward s vertigo 1937 rogers found anti nuclear message less effective than that of later comics such as keiji nakazawa s barefoot gen or gary panter s jimbo comics scholar roger sabin found book unconvincing a well meaning but facile piece of agit prop reviewer erik hinton praised artwork while calling story progeny of historical lip service and hot button anxiety of of modern warfare and considered ward and others of hyde s predecessors more proficient at medium southern cross has gained appreciation in comics circles as a precursor to graphic novel in canada though it had no direct influence on canadian comics it was marketed to book connoisseurs a world far removed from that of consumers of cheap entertainment that comics served in 1950s copies of southern cross joined collections of national gallery of canada in 1952 and burnaby art gallery in 1987 book received an mention
