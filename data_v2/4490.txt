united states battleship division nine was a division of four later five dreadnought battleships of united states navy s atlantic fleet that constituted american contribution to british grand fleet during world war i although u s entered war on 6 april 1917 hesitation among senior officers of u s navy as to wisdom of dividing american battle fleet prevented immediate dispatch of any capital ships for service in war zone following a direct request from british admiralty and a series of high level staff meetings american opinion changed and battleship division nine joined grand fleet on 7 december 1917 within that organization division served as sixth battle squadron while serving with grand fleet battleship division nine was forced to adapt quickly to unfamiliar british methods and standards new signals and maneuvers were adopted relatively smoothly while more stringent gunnery standards proved more difficult to achieve on a personal level relations between american and british officers and men were notably cordial throughout 1918 division participated in all major grand fleet exercises and deployments as well as conducting several detached convoy missions in north sea following signing of armistice on 11 november 1918 battleship division nine was present for surrender of german high seas fleet on 21 november 1918 on 1 december 1918 division departed from grand fleet to return to u s although battleship division nine s service was limited mainly to convoy duty and maintenance of blockade of german coast its presence greatly augmented strength of grand fleet thus making major combat between british and german fleets even more unlikely in 1918 by helping to keep high seas fleet effectively blockaded in port battleship division nine played a role in ensuring allied control of oceans background when u s entered world war i on side of allies on 6 april 1917 war at sea was hanging in balance having resumed unrestricted submarine warfare in february 1917 germany had quickly inflicted staggering losses on british merchant marine to an extent completely unknown to american government or indeed to anyone but a select few at british admiralty at first meeting between representatives of two navies in april 1917 british first sea lord admiral sir john jellicoe had astonished new american naval envoy rear admiral william s sims by informing him that allied shipping losses had recently surpassed per month and that admiralty did not see any immediate solution to problem jellicoe announced that at present loss rates britain would be effectively starved into submission by november 1917 after a meeting at scapa flow later in july between sims jellicoe and admiral david beatty commander of grand fleet admiralty requested that u s navy send four dreadnoughts and six destroyers to join grand fleet admiralty intended that arrival of american dreadnoughts would allow it to decommission five ships of pre dreadnought freeing up four thousand officers and ratings to serve on new light cruisers destroyers and submarines then under construction despite endorsement of admiral sims navy department initially rejected british request like other navies of late 19th and early 20th centuries u s navy rigidly adhered to doctrine of alfred thayer mahan whose first tenet was that under no circumstances should a battle fleet be divided u s chief of naval operations admiral william s benson and admiral henry t mayo commander of u s atlantic fleet were particularly worried that if britain fell as developments at sea suggested it might u s navy would be left to face german high seas fleet completely on its own having already released precious destroyers for convoy duty they were unwilling to further weaken ability of u s to defend itself through scattering of all important battle fleet furthermore admiral benson was uneasy about prospect ever present in early 20th century of a second war breaking out with japan for moment u s navy would send destroyers to europe but no battleships thumb 200px rear admiral hugh rodman a series of high level meetings in london beginning with admiral mayo s visit in august 1917 and culminating in a naval mission led by admiral benson in november proved decisive in changing viewpoint of navy department despite admiral sims s frequent warnings of severity of british losses to u boat campaign it was not until both men had seen things with their own eyes that they truly understood of situation on 10 november 1917 admiral benson cabled secretary of navy josephus daniels recommending dispatch of four dreadnoughts for service with grand fleet noting if in any encounter it should be indicated that outcome would have been more favorable or more decisive had more allied forces been available it would be difficult to satisfactorily explain absence of our ships on advice of his trusted aide secretary daniels agreed to dispatch ships question now came down to which battleships to send admiralty requested that americans send coal burning dreadnoughts as due to submarine blockade british were extremely short of oil needed to fuel latest classes of american dreadnoughts oil burning and ships as a result secretary daniels decided to send battleship division nine made up of coal burners and though they were not newest american ships they were still formidable each was capable of a maximum speed and armed with ten or twelve or guns furthermore they were commanded by an experienced and highly capable officer in rear admiral hugh rodman a 37 year veteran who had been commended for valor at battle of manila bay and was known both as an expert seaman and an extremely affable man both of these characteristics would serve him in good stead in his new role as joint admiral and diplomat after nearly five months of hesitation departure of division was finally set for last week of november crossing atlantic four ships of battleship division nine accompanied by destroyer got underway from lynnhaven roads virginia on 25 november 1917 bound for anchorage of grand fleet at scapa flow in orkney islands what should have been an uneventful transit was complicated by weather that began badly and only got worse as voyage progressed after battling a vicious that brought sleet hail and snow division was further buffeted by a severe gale off grand banks that began on 29 november captain henry wiley of wyoming would later recall of that storm at height of gale it blew as hard as i have ever seen it and seas were worst i could recollect severe storm damage allowed over of seawater to flood forward compartments of new york lowering her bow to point where she was in danger of foundering in heavy seas three days of continuous bailing were required to help keep her afloat to make matters worse high winds reportedly gusting to carried away topmasts on all four battleships rendering radio communication impossible thumb 250px battleship division nine arriving at scapa flow 7 december 1917 taken from hms queen elizabeth sheer force of gale drove delaware florida and manley off station in night of 30 november though florida eventually rejoined flagship when storm blew itself out delaware sailed on alone to scheduled rendezvous with british light cruiser off cape wrath scotland where division would reassemble in early hours of 7 december manley short of fuel after her fight with sea could not rejoin rest of force and proceeded directly to her ultimate destination naval base at queenstown ireland battered battleship division nine steamed into anchorage of grand fleet later that day to tremendous cheering of men on assembled british warships wasting no time admiral rodman called upon commander of grand fleet admiral sir david beatty to offer services of himself his men and his ships to allied cause with beatty s acceptance american battleships while retaining their american designation of battleship division nine officially became sixth battle squadron of grand fleet new standards from beginning battleships of division nine faced a hard task in adapting to new methods and practices they encountered in grand fleet any difficulties however that might have arisen from this transition based on national pride or rivalry were dissipated in large part by professional example set by admiral rodman himself as he would later note of his squadron s assimilation i realized that british fleet had had three years of actual warfare and knew game from ground floor up that while we might know it theoretically there would be a great deal to learn practically there could not be two independent commands in one force if our work was to be harmonious and only logical course was to amalgamate our ships and serve under command of british commander in chief this cooperative attitude trickled down through division and elicited admiration and appreciation of british first task facing americans was adoption of an entirely new set of signals radio codes and cipher methods although americans had studied general british code while crossing atlantic it was some time before they could use it with anything like proficiency of other ships in grand fleet to help in transition signalmen and radio operators from royal navy were posted to american battleships to aid their u s navy counterparts though learning an entirely new system of signals was as admiral rodman put it almost same as if in reading we had substituted a new set of letters within three days of their arrival ships of battleship division nine were able to take part in fleet maneuvers in north sea with no apparent difficulty thumb 250px at battle practice less successful at first were efforts of american battleships to match their british counterparts in excellence of gunnery having provided numerous veteran gun crews to serve aboard armed merchantmen in previous months gunnery complements of division nine were badly depleted and filled with inexperienced officers and recent recruits inevitable effect of this loss of talent became apparent when on 17 december 1917 battleship division nine conducted its first full caliber target practice in nearby pentland firth results were relatively poor where british battleships by end of 1917 generally managed a rate of fire per salvo of 40 seconds or less and an average spread that is distance measured between closest and furthest shots in a salvo of four ships of american squadron proved both slow and inaccurate rate of fire of delaware with an acceptable spread of was 108 seconds and wyoming and floridas average spreads were respectively only flagship new york managed to match british practice in both categories in admiral beatty s words results were distinctly poor and disappointing and led him to initial conclusion that he could not consider american division equivalent of a british one americans worked to catch up however and with every target practice registered improved results by end of june 1918 admiral rodman was able to report that firing was exceptionally fine most encouraging and much better than we have ever done previously operations within days of their arrival at scapa flow battleship division nine began participating in frequent maneuvers and drills that typified day to day existence of grand fleet it has been said that because of good condition and high speed of american battleships admiral beatty assigned them to be one of two divisions of fast battleships that operated at either ends of grand fleet when it was steaming in battle line formation speed claim is odd because american ships had no theoretical speed advantage and new york and delaware and later texas had vertical triple expansion engines less suited to sustained high speed running than turbine engines on all of british battleships as stipulated by grand fleet battle orders sixth battle squadron was to take station at rear of line where its duty was to engage rear division of german battleships however should fleet execute a sudden turnaround maneuver american ships would become van squadron meaning they would lead into battle position was an important one and americans were particularly proud of it tasked with this assignment americans got their first true practice in their new role at end of january 1918 when entire grand fleet went to sea for four days of war games under admiral beatty s direction fleet divided into two opposing forces with blue fleet representing german high seas fleet and red fleet including sixth battle squadron playing role of royal navy at a prearranged point in middle of north sea two sides converged for battle during one of these exercises american sailors were treated to their first encounter with an enemy warship when a german u boat s conning tower was sighted by two british battleships directly ahead of new york although one of british battleships attempted to ram it and destroyers rushed to drop depth charges u boat managed to escape though maneuvers were otherwise unremarkable they proved a valuable learning tool for americans who got a chance not only to experience british methods but violent conditions of north sea as well as admiral rodman noted upon returning from exercise i have seen largest battleships apparently sucked under until only superstructures on upper deck were visible when they would slowly rise from their submergence and water pour off their decks as it might from some huge turtle coming to surface convoy duty hard as americans worked to incorporate themselves into grand fleet they had yet to shake a belief among veteran british that they were amateurs merely playing at war in writing to his american born wife following maneuvers admiral beatty noted that american squadron enjoyed themselves greatly while we were out and did well and will do better next time i am sending old rodman out on an operation of his own which pleases him and gives them an idea that they are really taking part in war i trust they will come to no harm thumb 250px admirals beatty and rodman 1917 despite qualified nature of this comment operation beatty had in mind was both important and potentially dangerous on 6 february 1918 battleship division nine stood out of scapa flow to guard high value scandinavian convoy to and from norway twice in previous year this convoy with its essential cargos of iron ore nitrates and other chemicals had been raided by german cruisers and destroyers with loss of 15 allied freighters to avoid a repeat of these attacks british had taken to escorting convoys with dreadnought squadrons still possibility existed that germans would send out their entire fleet to cut off and annihilate overmatched battleship squadron with severe strategic effect with this possibility in mind american battleships set out accompanied by ships of british third light cruiser squadron and two flotillas of destroyers all under command of admiral rodman this marked first time in history that british warships had ever served under command of a sea going american admiral although outbound trip to norway was uneventful things began to heat up for escort force on 8 february as they waited just outside norwegian territorial waters for return convoy to assemble shortly before 14 00 both florida and delaware reported sighting numerous torpedoes running in water and began maneuvering sharply to avoid being struck delaware also fired a shell at what appeared to be a conning tower about distant and escorting destroyers dropped depth charges with no apparent success after convoy returned to scapa flow on 10 february rodman officially reported to admiral beatty that two torpedoes had been fired at florida and two at delaware and that only skillful handling of both ships had saved them from harm however post war examination of german war records revealed that no german submarines had made any attacks that day it is likely two ships had instead seen wakes of porpoises frolicking in waves as captain wiley of wyoming noted such misidentifications were common for inexperienced ships new ships arriving in war zone usually did a good deal of shooting at submarines which were not submarines with experience they saw fewer less than a week after their return battleship division nine was once again called upon to protect scandinavian convoy as part of a general grand fleet response to intelligence reports suggesting german battlecruisers were loose in north sea mission took place in a strong gale that caused damage to ships throughout fleet delaware suffered damage to her ventilators that caused generators to stop working cutting electrical power throughout ship and forcing a reduction in speed to for nearly an hour on new york strong seas carried a man overboard who could not be rescued one of 12 or more men lost throughout fleet that day to make matters worse grand fleet failed to find german battlecruisers and was forced to return to scapa flow empty handed in march april 1918 battleship division nine escorted scandinavian convoy two more times both missions were hampered by storms that made going particularly slow but were otherwise uneventful still confidence in wisdom of using battleships as an escort was fading at admiralty and admiral beatty in particular was opposed to it when american ships returned to new grand fleet base at rosyth at end of second mission on 20 april it was last time they were used to escort scandinavian convoy thumb upright admiral reinhard scheer commander of german high seas fleet just days later however on 24 april 1918 battleship division nine joined grand fleet in one last attempt to bring high seas fleet to battle german admiral reinhard scheer aware of strategic potential of destroying a squadron of british battleships had finally decided to make an attempt on scandinavian convoy using overwhelming force of his entire fleet under strict radio silence high seas fleet sailed on morning of 23 april to attempt an intercept leaving british completely unaware that they had left their base it was not until an engine malfunction aboard german battlecruiser forced it to break radio silence to ask for assistance that british became aware of presence of germans in north sea a recent change in sailing schedule of scandinavian convoy however meant there was no exposed squadron of battleships in danger of being overwhelmed that day alerted by enemy wireless transmissions entire grand fleet sortied to find high seas fleet offering prospect of decisive battle of war however with moltke crippled admiral scheer decided to return to base though scouting units of grand fleet made brief contact with germans on morning of 25 april no action followed and high seas fleet made it home without incident at one point in chase however a reversal of course by germans meant that entire grand fleet was forced to reorient itself in opposite direction placing battleship division nine in van result was that if an encounter between two fleets had occurred american battleships would have led british fleet into what could have been largest naval battle of war years later admiral rodman wrote in his memoir that he often thought what a glorious day it would have been for ships of our country to have led grand fleet into action it was not to be however nor would another chance present itself german fleet did not sail as a unit again in world war i new arrivals through first months of 1918 composition of battleship division nine changed to reflect lessons learned from operating in a war zone with grand fleet it soon became apparent that with only four ships division could not maintain level of preparedness required by constant need to be ready to sail at limited notice inevitable result was machinery breakdowns that reduced squadron to three ships a development considered unacceptable given division s important position at tail end of battle line british faced with same problem responded by allocating a spare battleship to each of their squadrons in this way each squadron always remained at full strength even when a ship was being repaired thumb 250px and together 1919 recognizing practicality of this solution admiral rodman requested that navy department send another battleship to operate with his division specifically rodman requested ship be new yorks sister ship to better match grand fleet policy which encouraged use of matched pairs to aid in rangefinding although there was some grumbling at navy department that a five ship division was counter to u s navy policy they eventually agreed and on 11 february 1918 texas arrived at scapa flow this arrangement however left wyoming third most powerful ship of division as spare ship because she lacked a matched pair as a result rodman requested that delaware oldest ship in division be replaced with sister ship leaving florida as spare arkansas however did not join battleship division nine until 29 july 1918 delaware sailed from scapa flow for united states next day northern mine barrage in late june 1918 battleship division nine began escorting american mine laying craft participating in setting of northern mine barrage a gargantuan project spearheaded by u s navy designed to close north sea passage between scotland and norway to u boat traffic a novel attempt to end submarine menace relying heavily on american industrial capacity barrage called for more than 70 000 mines to be placed across a stretch of water wide because minelayers were operating within range of german surface raiders american battleships were detailed to provide an escort for them along with other units of grand fleet for most part these expeditions proved uneventful but on two occasions on 30 june and again on 8 august lookouts on battleships reported seeing u boats or torpedoes in water forcing division to maneuver accordingly like previous sightings made while escorting scandinavian convoy subsequent review of german war records revealed that both cases were false alarms just days after second incident however battleship division nine was called to more serious action having received intelligence that german vessels were loose in north sea division sortied from scapa flow on 12 october in company with british second battlecruiser squadron and third light cruiser squadron in hope of engaging enemy raiders from beginning autumn weather was particularly rough impeding progress and making any chance of sighting german ships unlikely although division was not aware at time report that german raiders were at sea was false thus weather was not only reason why they failed to sight any enemy warships see jones jerry 1998 u s battleship operations in world war i p 66 thumb 250px a ub iii type submarine similar to one believed sunk by new york on evening of 14 october as new york led force back into pentland firth she was rocked by a violent underwater collision on her starboard side followed shortly after by another to stern that broke off two of her propeller blades reducing ship to one engine and a speed of it was immediately clear to men on board that she had struck an underwater object but depth of channel meant it could not have been a shipwreck both admirals rodman and beatty concluded that new york must have accidentally collided with a submerged german u boat they agreed that submarine had rammed its bow into ship s side then been struck moments later by ship s propeller in their opinion damage would have been fatal to german craft postwar examination of german records revealed that submarine lost may have been or this strange and accidental encounter marked only time in all of battleship division nine s service with grand fleet that one of its ships sank a german vessel new yorks ordeal was not over however badly damaged by loss of a propeller ship sailed to rosyth under heavy escort for repairs on 15 october at 01 00 next morning a u boat launched three torpedoes at damaged vessel all of which passed ahead of her unlike in previous cases sufficient evidence existed to suppose that this torpedo attack was not a false alarm a number of officers and men aboard new york clearly saw wakes of torpedoes in full moonlight and a submarine was spotted in immediate vicinity by a patrol shortly after attack jones notes in his dissertation that german records do not contain any report of a torpedo attack upon a battleship on 16 october 1918 he states that attack may have come from one of u boats that were sunk in area around that time however see jones jerry 1995 u s battleship operations in world war i 1917 1918 p 139 battleship s wounded condition is possibly what saved her although standard procedure was to steam at new york could make only on her one operable propeller due to this historian jerry jones believes that german u boat captain misjudged ship s speed with no further damage however battleship was able to safely arrive at drydock in rosyth as water dropped in drydock a large dent commensurate with a submarine bow was found in her hull as war began to draw to a close ships of battleship division nine remained busy with frequent gunnery drill ships showed marked improvement in performance compared to early days with fleet average spread for whole division including newcomers texas and arkansas was now less than which was much better than previously if still not as good as british average maneuvers and war games continued as well during exercises in late september 1918 grand fleet once again divided into red and blue fleets engaged each other at ranges as extreme as a battle distance unimagined prior to world war i rest of division s time was spent in escorting minecraft on northern barrage though a monumental endeavor barrage proved largely ineffective after an investment of 70 263 mines and more than 40 million equivalent of 572 million in 2009 only six submarines were confirmed as sunk by barrage life in grand fleet throughout battleship division nine s time with grand fleet combating boredom was a constant difficulty located at northeastern tip of scotland islands surrounding scapa flow were little more than barren cold windswept specks of land devoid of trappings of civilization due to efforts of officers to keep their men entertained however morale remained high throughout war british worked hard to turn anchorage into a more inviting place central to these efforts were sporting events fleet held numerous inter ship competitions including soccer rugby rowing track and boxing which were followed with intense interest by men of respective ships thumb 250px sailors aboard participating in ship s theatrical revue when americans arrived british made every effort to include them in athletics space was allotted on sports fields to provide a football field and a baseball diamond in short order division developed a baseball league that played 17 games during summer of 1918 texas won division championship but lost to a visiting team from american naval headquarters in london football games occurred throughout fall american sailors participated in fleet sporting events as well giving excellent account of themselves at fleet track meet battleship division nine finished second and did even better at annual boxing championships pinnacle of grand fleet sporting year an from florida won lightweight title a chief carpenter s mate from new york won middleweight title and a fireman from same ship reached heavyweight finals men found other ways to keep busy besides sports throughout year every ship in squadron produced theater productions and motion pictures were shown whenever possible furthermore leave was granted to men on a frequent basis whenever ships were in rosyth for repairs on 4 july 1918 admiral beatty provided a special treat for men of battleship division nine by granting them a few days off from all drills and maneuvers in order to celebrate what he termed this greatest of liberty days on 22 july ships of grand fleet received a visit from king george v after inspecting fleet from decks of destroyer king presided over an investiture ceremony on board admiral beatty s flagship king george presented numerous decorations but first recipient was admiral rodman himself invested as a knight commander of order of bath rodman received highest honor awarded that day thumb 250px king george v and prince of wales with admirals beatty rodman and sims after lunch aboard queen elizabeth king visited admiral rodman s flagship new york where he inspected ship king george visited her engine and fire rooms remarking with admiration to rodman admiral your fire room is as clean as a dining room after inspection pair retreated to rodman s cabin for coffee a smoke and casual conversation something rodman noted king seemed to particularly enjoy following his departure from grand fleet king had a message sent to officers and men of ships he had just left it began with a warm reference to american squadron i am happy to have found myself once more with grand fleet and this pleasure has been increased by opportunity i have had of seeing splendid ships of united states in line with our own and of meeting admiral rodman together with officers and men under him we value their comradeship and are proud of their achievements to this admiral beatty replied we are glad that your majesty should have been able personally to observe our complete accord with united states squadron and firm friendship which binds their officers and men to your own these expressions accurately reflected goodwill that existed between officers and men of two organizations admiral rodman for instance later wrote that he came away from his service in grand fleet as probably most anglophile officer in u s navy and many a relationship was forged among junior officers that served both nations well in world war ii despite being located in remote scapa flow battleship division nine was unable to avoid a global killer that struck just as world war i was coming to a close spanish influenza which killed millions worldwide in 1918 1919 did not spare grand fleet by late fall an average of seven men per day were dying of virus throughout fleet and some ships were so badly affected that they were practically unmanageable though they were not as badly hit as some of british vessels american battleships were not immune by early november only florida was not in quarantine and arkansas had 259 cases with 11 deaths armistice though situation in north sea in late 1918 remained much as it had been for previous four years with grand fleet maintaining its endless watch over high seas fleet war on western front was rapidly drawing to a close operation michael last german offensive had been stopped in late summer and with aid of hundreds of thousands of american doughboys allies had begun to overwhelm german army on 3 october prince max of baden replaced georg von hertling as chancellor of germany and immediately asked president woodrow wilson to arrange an armistice to naval leaders of high seas fleet however there appeared to be no reason for an armistice in their eyes german imperial navy remained unbeaten determined not to go down without a fight admiral scheer by this time head of german admiralty ordered new commander of high seas fleet admiral franz hipper to prepare for a final sortie against grand fleet even if it should become a death struggle accordingly hipper developed plan 19 which called for destroyer strikes against thames estuary and flanders to draw grand fleet south where a waiting line of u boats would attempt to even odds at this point high seas fleet would emerge to engage its opponent in one last titanic encounter admirals however were reckoning without their sailors enlisted men of high seas fleet aware that germany had lost war had no interest in dying for sake of navy s honor when details of plan 19 were leaked to fleet a mutiny almost instantly broke out with sailors raising red flag of revolution and refusing to obey their officers faced with a complete breakdown of discipline within his fleet admiral hipper had no choice but to disperse his ships to their in early november days later on 11 november 1918 world war i came to an end thumb 250px german battlecruisers sailing into firth of forth for internment 21 november 1918 with defeat of germany question became what to do with ships of high seas fleet because no neutral nation wanted to host rebellious sailors of mutinous armada allies eventually decided to have force interned at scapa flow with guns of grand fleet s ships nearby in case of any attempt at a break out on 15 november beatty met with hipper s representative rear admiral hugo meurer to arrange surrender of german ships meurer agreed to surrender to beatty in firth of forth from there german vessels would proceed to scapa flow until their ultimate fate was decided by paris peace conference surrender of german fleet on 21 november ships of battleship division nine joined rest of grand fleet to witness operation zz surrender of german fleet grand fleet composed of 370 ships and 90 000 men formed two columns through which defeated german ships passed despite magnitude of occasion it was a bittersweet moment for men of grand fleet for four years british later joined by americans of battleship division nine had tried constantly to bring high seas fleet to a decisive battle to see them coming to surrender as admiral beatty put it like sheep being herded by dogs to their folds left many feeling cheated after ceremony had concluded beatty declared fleet my fleet is brokenhearted in a similar vein admiral rodman wrote it was hard to realize that ships which we had expected and hoped to engage would all be given up without a struggle or fleet action and surrender without a fight though such statements reflected fact that grand fleet had not won great battle its officers had sought peaceful surrender of high seas fleet served as testimony to strength grand fleet had maintained continuously through four years of war significance with war over ships of battleship division nine departed from grand fleet on 1 december almost exactly one year after joining it though fact that american battleships never had opportunity to confront their german opposites dampened sense of their achievements they nonetheless played an important part in winning of war at sea presence of american squadron augmented strength of grand fleet to point where any confrontation attempted by germans would likely have been futile admiral beatty put it best in his farewell speech to american sailors on 1 december see also british pacific fleet an analogous situation in world war ii where a british and commonwealth force was amalgamated into united states
