had been angry with andy ever since and andy had been desperately trying to win her back culminating with events in media blitz schur called it a key moment for april and andy and said it s almost like andy s a knight of round table and he s got a lot of different obstacles that he s got to overcome in order to win love of a fair maiden episode also continued a development of ron swanson s character as more of a father figure to his employees particularly andy and april even though ron himself outwardly claims not to care about affairs this began in episode flu season where ron offered

previous week of 6 percent 13 percent and 12 percent respectively reviews media blitz received generally positive reviews with several commentators particularly praising performance of adam scott although some said subplot with chris and ann was less effective tv guide writer damian holbrook wrote party down vet absolutely stole show on parks and recreation scott was a machine of mania a dork gone wild who gave rapidly unraveling ben just right amount of crazy while completely cracking us up hollywood com writer eric sundermann said media blitz continue a long period of excellent parks and recreation episodes although he said problems were resolved too quickly at end of episode sundermann said scott s slightly over top performance was made especially funny because he is normally such a straight man character alan sepinwall of hitfix praised scott for his ability to be both a straight man and a more outrageously funny character as during his in media interviews sepinwall also complimented aubrey plaza s performance and said overall episode was very funny but that main storyline was resolved too quickly time magazine writer james poniewozik said episode continued development of town of pawnee which he said was like a character itself and compared it to simpsons springfield poniewozik said media blitz also showed how well integrated scott has become with cast and called crazy ira and douche interview maybe most perfect scene p r has put together yet likewise steve heisler of a v club called ben s interview with perd hapley one of best scenes parks rec has ever done heisler enjoyed how series gradually built up ben wyatt s backstory throughout season then took it way over top however he expressed disappointment that ann and chris subplot ended with no resolution zap2it writer rick porter called episode a great showcase for scott s deadpan gifts and wrote this show hasn t had a real miss yet this season porter said april and andy subplot was less interesting but he enjoyed scenes between ron and andy steve kandell of new york magazine praised episode for bringing scott s character to forefront as well as for providing satire on small town politics without coming across as preachy kandell said of april and andy story if their kiss at shoeshine stand as expected and inevitable as it may have been didn t make your heart soar just a little bit then you re dead inside and probably just turned on nbc for outsourced a few minutes early joel keller of tv squad complimented scott calling him a current generation bob newhart and one of those actors who can just give someone a look and it conveys everything you need to know about what his character is thinking keller said he also enjoyed seeing april and andy reconcile but felt crazy ira and douche scene was ineffective because regarding morning zoo radio shows it s hard to parody something that s already a parody of itself atlantic writer scott meslow praised scott s performance as well as how writers have smartly underplayed relationship between leslie and ben meslow also liked that april andy subplot was now resolved as he called it weakest plotline of season but he felt scenes between chris and ann in media blitz were a rehash of previous episode matt richenthal of tv fanatic praised scott s performance calling him a master at straight man role but said he was funnier previous week in ron tammy part two laughs weren t as loud on media blitz as it was more of a squirm inducing half hour of television matt fowler of ign called it a fine episode that was dominated in a good way by its softer sweeter moments particularly kiss between andy and april which he said was so damn sweet that i just couldn t resist it although he enjoyed perd hapley interview fowler said he did not find scott s performance otherwise especially funny entertainment weekly writer hillary busis also praised scott s performance adding did anyone else s heart melt just a little bit at proud smile that crept across leslie s face when ben found his voice busis also said she was glad april and andy reconciled as april s constant mistreatment of andy was making it harder and harder to like her character busis criticized ann and chris subplot of which she said wake me up when something actually happens references external links media blitz at official parks and recreation
