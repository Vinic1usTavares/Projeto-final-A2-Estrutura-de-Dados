donald ross getty august 30 1933 february 26 2016 was a canadian politician who served as 11th premier of alberta between 1985 and 1992 a member of progressive conservatives he served as energy minister and federal and intergovernmental affairs minister in government of peter lougheed before leaving politics for private sector in 1979 he returned to politics six years later to contest leadership contest resulting from lougheed s retirement he defeated two other candidates and became premier november 1 1985 as premier getty was faced with an economic slowdown and falling energy prices which hit alberta s petroleum dominated economy hard faced with mounting government deficits and increasing unemployment he cut social spending and intervened with government money to prevent businesses from failing several of these interventions backfired in high profile fashion failing at their intended objective and costing scarce public funds as well while some analysts argue that getty s fiscal program laid groundwork for ralph klein s later balancing of provincial budget on getty s departure from office government s debt had reached 11 billion setting stage for his successor to characterize getty years as an era of wasteful and excessive spending his efforts at strengthening alberta s presence in canada initially appeared more successful as he won agreement of canada s other first ministers in including elements of senate reform in meech lake and charlottetown accords but these efforts came to naught when both accords were rejected second by canadian public including a majority of albertans getty was also facing political problems within alberta including a defeat in his home riding of edmonton whitemud in 1989 election leading to a successful by election in stettler vacated by a p c mla and leadership machinations from some of his own ministers in light of this he resigned premiership in 1992 before entering politics getty had been a quarterback for edmonton eskimos of canadian football league he passed for more than eight thousand yards over his ten year career and was put on team s wall of fame in 1992 early life don getty was

ottawa london and agincourt sharing a three room apartment with his seven member family in last returning for london in time for high school he became an accomplished athlete drinking eggnog to gain enough weight to play football and was elected students council president sports were his passion and he was an especially great fan of montreal canadiens and toronto argonauts running back royal copeland football after graduating getty enrolled to study business administration at university of western ontario where he became a football star and a member of kappa alpha society he quarterbacked western ontario mustangs to eastern collegiate union championships in 1954 and 1955 and was awarded claude brown memorial trophy as outstanding athlete at in 1955 he also played basketball and was part of championship teams in that sport in 1952 1953 and 1954 a week after his 1955 graduation he married margaret mitchell his high school sweetheart edmonton eskimos had offered getty a professional contract so newlyweds drove out west in an old blue buick while still playing football getty was hired by imperial oil in 1955 he worked for midwestern industrial gas limited beginning in 1961 as lands and contracts manager with a promotion to assistant general manager following in 1963 in 1964 he founded his own company oil and gas company before entering world of finance as a partner with doherty roadhouse and investments in 1967 mla and cabinet minister in 1965 getty was approached by fellow eskimos veteran and progressive conservative leader peter lougheed to run in 1967 provincial election getty agreed to run in strathcona west and defeated incumbent social crediter randolph mckinnon by more than one thousand votes he entered legislative assembly of alberta as one of six newly elected p c s four years later in 1971 election getty was re elected by more than 3 500 votes in new riding of edmonton whitemud and was appointed minister of federal and intergovernmental affairs in new lougheed majority government with getty and government both re elected by increasing margins in 1975 election lougheed appointed him minister of energy in this capacity getty partially continued his responsibility for relations with federal government as energy policy was a major sticking point between two governments at one point federal energy minister donald macdonald called getty dripping with venom getty did not seek re election in 1979 election hiatus from politics and leadership fight while out of politics getty became head of an investment firm and sat on boards of a number of corporations including royal bank of canada and celanese canada however when lougheed stepped down from progressive conservative leadership in 1985 getty entered contest to replace him and immediately became favourite at an october convention getty won a second ballot victory against minister of municipal affairs julian and former legislator ron ghitter premier getty was appointed premier november 1 1985 he returned to legislature just over a month later winning a by election in his old riding of edmonton whitemud as premier for nearly seven years getty presided over some of alberta s toughest economic times his time in office was characterized by attempts to reduce government s budget deficit and interventions calculated to stabilize economy during recession of 1980s when getty became premier he left his predecessor s cabinet completely intact budget deficit after getty won party leadership lougheed told him to expect a budget deficit of 2 5 billion in his first year in office though figure turned out to be 2 1 billion things got worse next year as a drop in energy prices led to oil rich province running a deficit of 3 4 billion as energy revenues fell by 3 billion getty s treasurer dick johnston reacted by raising taxes by 1 billion and cutting program spending by 6 3 including decreases of 3 in grants to schools universities municipalities and hospitals in 1990 due to these measures johnston predicted that government would be in surplus by 1995 fiscal year by 1992 program spending was growing at a rate of 2 3 annually among lowest rates in canada in fact when adjusted for population growth and inflation government spending fell over getty s term in office with non health care program spending 40 lower in 1993 than it had been in 1986 health spending had remained approximately constant over same period even so getty entered premiership with no public debt and left with public debt at 11 billion economic intervention getty s government was faced with a combination of a general economic malaise and falling oil prices slowdown in energy sector contributed to a decrease in capital spending which reduced demand for labour in construction industry by 50 between 1980 and 1985 many workers left province which suppressed real estate prices and hurt financial institutions two albertan banks canadian commercial bank and bank failed in september 1985 credit unions were facing similar troubles and lougheed government had in its last days injected 100 million into industry getty s response to these issues was interventionist during his first budget he targeted spending at province s struggling agricultural sector including a 2 billion loan program meant to address high interest rates his government tried to stimulate energy sector by making loan guarantees to husky oil 380 million and syncrude 200 million for new and expanded capital projects government also provided a 55 million guarantee in addition to a 20 million loan to peter pocklington s gainers meat packing plant when pocklington defaulted on loan government seized and eventually closed plant this incident and others contributed to a perception that getty s administration was willing to spend public money to support large businesses but that it was indifferent to struggles of labour gainers loan had initially been made after government brokered a labour settlement favourable to plant s management in 1986 price of oil bottomed at a barrel getty responded by providing oil industry with 250 million in incentives and royalty cuts by end of 1986 alberta had granted another nine month cut from 12 to 1 in royalties at suncor oilsands most damaging to government s reputation was failure of principal group an edmonton based trust company its investment subsidiaries were ordered shut down june 30 1987 by court orders obtained at instigation of provincial treasurer dick johnston parent company went bankrupt august 10 amid accusations of fraud a court ordered investigation led by bill code found that company was in trouble as early as 1980 and though subsequent economic downturns hurt it it would not have been profitable in any event it also found that consumer and corporate affairs minister connie osterman had disregarded 1984 warnings from a regulator in her department that company was likely insolvent though osterman was fired shortly after report s release getty s immediate offer of an 85 million settlement to investors further hurt government s reputation in areas of business a similar incident stemmed from 1992 privatization of alberta government telephones agt novatel a cellular subsidiary of agt had made a number of financing deals with local companies in late 1980s and many of these deals were collapsing just as government was prepared to sell agt at last moment government removed novatel from agt share offering novatel s liabilities eventually cost government more than 600 million intergovernmental and constitutional affairs as a former minister of federal and intergovernmental affairs getty had strong views about constitutional matters and about senate reform in particular he made cause centrepiece of alberta s constitutional policy going into meech lake accord discussions accord s final version included a provision whereby prime minister would continue to recommend senatorial appointments to governor general but would have to make their recommendations from lists provided by provincial governments once it became apparent that meech lake accord would fail getty s government introduced senatorial selection act which provided for an election process whenever there was a vacant senate seat for alberta however getty s favoured candidate progressive conservative bert brown was soundly defeated by stan waters of upstart reform party of canada which opposed meech lake and favoured aggressive senate reform though prime minister brian mulroney opposed legislation he eventually recommended waters for appointment to senate getty was still more successful at pursuing senate reform during negotiations for charlottetown accord when he won addition of a triple e senate to package against mulroney s opposition however charlottetown accord failed after a national referendum in which a majority of canadians including 60 2 of albertans rejected it in 1991 getty s progressive conservatives formally severed ties with progressive conservative party of canada which was becoming increasingly unpopular under mulroney getty also broke with mulroney on a number of issues other than senate reform including new federal goods and services tax which he fought unsuccessfully against implementing his government also implemented legislation against mulroney s express wishes that made english only official language of alberta despite these steps getty remained a supporter of federal conservatives and not reform party to which many provincial p c s were defecting whose unpopularity rubbed off on him getty s government also made progress on aboriginal land claims in northern part of province in addition to creating canada s first metis land base in 1989 getty took lead in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to negotiate a settlement between federal government and cree political style in contrast to his predecessor who was actively involved in most elements of his government getty preferred to set government s broad direction and leave lower level details to his ministers ralph klein while serving as environment minister under getty commented that if you are a minister you run that portfolio yourself and expressed an appreciation for freedom that premier gave his cabinet al adair who served in two different portfolios under getty described this approach in his memoirs as you make decisions you run your department but make mistakes and you re gone lisac credits him for knowing when to intervene and when not to but adair felt that his approach led to ministers working too much in isolation getty was a private reserved person which combined with his tendency to delegate to ministers sometimes gave impression of an uncaring aloofness during principal group affair which he left primarily in hands of treasurer dick johnston and consumer and corporate affairs minister elaine mccoy a photographer captured a shot of getty playing golf while his press secretary had said that he was working out of office this was typical of his strained relationship with media which adair attributed to premier s awkwardness and media s unfairness adair 163 although getty governed with fairly large majorities during his tenure they were nowhere near as large as ones lougheed enjoyed his first election as premier saw return of provincial liberals to legislature after being shut out for 15 years that same election saw alberta ndp pick up 16 seats in legislature in contrast during his last two terms lougheed never faced more than six opposition mlas in total decline and retirement getty called 1989 election less than three years into his 1986 mandate to take advantage of economic optimism prevalent in province partly as a result of canada u s free trade agreement while p c s made spending promises including paving all of province s secondary highways liberals under new leader laurence decore stressed dealing with deficit overall end result was respectable for government as it won a sixth term in government with a net loss of only two seats however getty was defeated in his own riding by liberal percy wickman brian c downey resigned his seat in rural central alberta riding of stettler to allow getty to run in a by election which he won handily he built a home in riding on buffalo lake and was later accused of arranging for lake to be risen so it would be better suited for fishing though adair claimed that arrangements had been in place since 1979 when he had been minister of recreation parks and wildlife getty s relationship with his own party was often stormy shortly after he lost his riding in 1989 a group of calgary conservatives including party budget director jack major and getty s old leadership rival ron ghitter began making plans to force party renewal with or without getty they felt that party was perceived as being tired directionless arrogant and deaf to urban concerns and that it was in political trouble in crucial battleground of calgary at 1989 party convention recently retired cabinet minister marvin moore who had organized ghitter s 1985 leadership campaign advocated for a leadership review after a speech by getty convention voted to refer recommendation to a committee for months of study cabinet ministers including treasurer dick johnston and education minister jim dinning began to consider leadership bids in event that getty retired or was pushed out in 1992 as national referendum on charlottetown accord and release of a report on novatel incident loomed getty decided to leave politics in his last months he deliberately refrained from taking measures that he knew would be popular such as shrinking cabinet in order to leave them for his successor after a party leadership election chose ralph klein to succeed him getty resigned as party leader december 5 and as premier several days later political legacy as premier klein positioned himself in contrast to getty asserting that government had a spending problem barrie 262 and stating that he had become premier at a time of uncontrolled spending taft 25 given klein s aggressive spending cuts which shaped political climate of alberta for much of 1990s getty s legacy with respect to public finances has been criticized however kevin taft writing four years before entering politics challenged this view asserting that getty was running tightest government in canada taft 23 besides its management of deficit getty s government is remembered for creation of family day for most part however getty dropped quickly from public view and public memory lisac suggests that this is because unlike his predecessor and successor he lacked a central message professional football career getty played 10 seasons with edmonton eskimos as a quarterback for first part of his career he backed up jackie parker and filled in for him when he was moved to running back eskimos coach pop ivy surprised many observers when he started getty at quarterback in third game of 1956 western final which was a three game series at time during 44th grey cup with parker at running back however it bore results as parker tied record for most touchdowns scored in a grey cup game at three getty also handed ball to johnny bright for two touchdowns and scored two himself on quarterback keeps from one yard line as eskimos won their third consecutive championship over montreal alouettes by a score of 50 27 he continued with eskimos until 1963 and also made three appearances in 1965 season getty was one of most successful canadian born quarterbacks in history of canadian football league and sits at third on all time passing yardage list of canadian quarterbacks behind russ jackson and gerry with nearly nine thousand yards he was declared outstanding canadian player in western interprovincial football union in 1959 and was runner up to jackson for schenley award as league s most outstanding canadian player same year he was placed on eskimos wall of honor in 1992 career statistics 6 9 24 2 0 1 15 0 3 6 2 6 8 1 4 1 2 4 7 8 1118 and including 1958 season a tackle for a loss on a passing play was registered as a rushing attempt retirement and death getty kept a low profile after leaving politics he assumed several corporate directorships and spent time with his grandchildren unlike lougheed he rarely commented on political matters he was appointed as an officer to order of canada in 1998 in july 2008 after ed stelmach announced 2 billion in funding to industry to develop carbon capture technology getty s company sought some of funding to bury carbon dioxide in salt caverns near two hills on february 26 2016 getty died of heart failure at age of 82 in edmonton following years of declining health honours he was appointed as an officer of order of canada on 21 october 1998 he was appointed as a member of alberta order of excellence in 1999 also received canadian version of
