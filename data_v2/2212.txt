arising from 80 burns after she was deliberately set on fire on 14 december before her death capper related that she had previously been kidnapped and kept prisoner for seven days at a house in moston manchester where she was beaten and tortured she was taken from house by car driven into countryside and forced out of car virtually naked into a wood at werneth low where petrol was poured over her and she was set alight torture and murder arose from avenging of trivial grievances a sexual insult infection with pubic lice and loss of a pink duffel coat detectives conducting inquiry said that for sheer mindless brutality crime ranked alongside torture inflicted on children by moors murderers case went to trial in november 1993 but received comparatively little publicity as it coincided with trial of robert thompson and jon venables for murder of james bulger on 17 december 1993 jean powell aged 26 her ex husband glyn powell aged 29 and bernadette mcneilly aged 24 were sentenced to life imprisonment for their parts in murder jeffrey leigh aged 27 was jailed for twelve years for false imprisonment jean powell s brother clifford pook aged 18 was sentenced to fifteen years in a young offenders institution for false imprisonment and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm anthony michael dudson who was 16 years old at time of murder was also found guilty of murder and sentenced to be detained at her majesty s pleasure under section 53 1 of children and young persons act 1933 background capper described as a gentle and easily influenced girl had been babysitting for jean powell since she was ten years old in 1990 she had spent time in care of local authority after her mother elizabeth capper and her stepfather separated after which suzanne and her older sister michelle stayed with their stepfather around this time capper began to truant from moston brook high school and her attendance during final two years of schooling was described as erratic capper increasingly spent her time at powell s house powell lived at 97 langworthy road moston a small victorian terraced house where she also dealt drugs and was involved with handling of stolen motor vehicles michelle capper had briefly lived with powell but moved out in august 1992 because she did not like evil new friends powell was associating with particularly bernadette mcneilly who had recently moved in three doors away at number 91 mcneilly who had three children subsequently moved in with powell and her three children where two shared a bed in downstairs dining room because bedrooms were full of children capper continued to stay regularly even though powell and mcneilly frequently bullied her her sister said it was not that she was scared of them it s just that she would do anything for them she pampered their every whim powell was separated from her husband glyn although two remained friendly and he would visit regularly from his nearby home mcneilly s boyfriend was 16 year old anthony dudson who was also having sexual intercourse with powell powell was sexually involved with jeffrey leigh a regular visitor to house as a purchaser of amphetamines another frequent visitor to house was powell s younger brother clifford pook events leading to murder kidnap at trial it emerged that capper had been kidnapped for insubstantial even trivial reasons jean powell claimed that capper had tried to persuade her to sleep with a man for money mcneilly and dudson had contracted pubic lice which they believed were from a bed that capper had also used and mcneilly believed that she had taken a pink duffle coat that belonged to her in november 1992 when dudson had contracted pubic lice and had his pubic hair shaved mcneilly told him she thought that he had caught them from capper dudson believed otherwise and said later i told jean powell i thought i got them from bernie mcneilly on 7 december 1992 capper was lured to jean powell s home where glyn powell and dudson were already waiting she was grabbed as soon as she arrived and held down while glyn powell shaved her head and her eyebrows and then made her clean up hair and place it in a bin then he placed a plastic bag over her head and walked around her while hitting her on head she was then kicked by jean powell and mcneilly as she lay curled up on floor and both women took turns beating her with a three foot long 1 m wooden instrument and a belt she was then taken to bathroom and forced to shave off her own pubic hair as ritual humiliation in revenge for having caused as they claimed dudson and mcneilly themselves to be shaved afterwards jean powell locked her in a cupboard overnight following morning she was taken upstairs and locked in another cupboard on 8 december she was transferred to mcneilly s house because of concern that powell and mcneilly s six children were disturbed by capper s crying there she was tied to an upturned bed with electrical flex in a downstairs back room torture over next five days capper was subjected to a series of violent acts increasing in severity and brutality as time passed she was regularly beaten and injected with amphetamines burned with cigarettes and had rave music in particular hi i m chucky wanna play by 150 volts featuring samples from movie child s play played at maximum volume through headphones mcneilly would commence each torture session with phrase chucky s coming to play and soon words themselves were enough to make capper scream at some point during week pook and leigh called at house and were shown capper blindfolded and gagged tied to bed by this time capper had been lying in her own urine and feces for several days and was placed in a bath containing concentrated disinfectant and scrubbed with a stiff brush with sufficient force to remove skin pook then used pliers to extract two of her teeth which police later found at his house like some kind of macabre trophy dudson said i was stood at doorway with jeanie powell and bernie mcneilly cliff pook took her gag off he told her to open her mouth he said right i m going to rip your teeth out he started hitting her teeth with pliers he got pliers on and started pulling it out but it just snapped and chipped then he hit them a few more times he put pliers on again and really really pulled he pulled suzanne s head forward until there was a snap and he had tooth in pliers he did same again and he was laughing missed opportunities for rescue david hill 18 was asked to sit in at house and while there heard dudson shout shut up you slag in back room when he asked what was going on leigh had shown him capper he said she had a sort of cloth over her face from just above eyebrows and covering her nose she had a bit of dried blood on her lip she had no hair hill also said he had heard them talking about dentistry work it was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers later he was left alone in house with capper who pleaded with him to untie her he said she asked me if i could help but i told her i couldn t i asked her who she was she said her name was suzanne she asked me if i could untie her i said i couldn t do anything he later claimed that he was too afraid of leigh to intervene or raise alarm saying i thought they would batter me if i d said anything they d all have got me wouldn t they i didn t know what to do i was too shocked to do anything while capper was being held in house leigh and dudson met up with her sister s fiance paul barlow to help him repair his car barlow said they could have told me there and then door would have been kicked down and i would have got suzanne out i did not think they were capable of such savagery now all i want is ten minutes with them in a back room murder thumb left a fiat panda similar to one used by capper s murderers to convey her from moston to werneth low six finally agreed that capper had to be removed from house after michelle capper told them her stepfather was going to report her to police as a missing person in early hours of 14 december 1992 capper was forced into boot of a stolen white fiat panda car and driven 15 miles 25 km to a narrow lane at werneth low near on outskirts of stockport in car were mcneilly powells and dudson mcneilly giggled as they made journey capper was pushed down an embankment into a patch of brambles and then mcneilly poured petrol over her powell stated suzanne was still wobbly and fell over bernie mcneilly said get up bernie pushed her down hill and poured petrol on her when mcneilly had difficulty getting petrol to ignite glyn powell asked dudson for some paper who handed him a folded envelope which powell then attempted to light and use as a taper after three failed attempts dudson said in end he just went up to her with a lighter and lit her he lit her on back she went straight up in flames and was screaming flames lit up whole forest mcneilly began to sing burn baby burn burn baby burn from trammps song disco inferno believing capper to be dead four returned to jean powell s house stopping to buy canned drinks on way both leigh and pook were at house when they arrived and dudson stated cliff pook asked glyn powell have you done it glyn said yes and he was laughing he gave cliff his lighter back naming attackers before death thumb werneth low where capper suffered burns that led to her death capper had not died immediately as her murderers believed and after they left she managed to scramble back up embankment and stagger along lane for approximately a quarter of a mile 400 metres to road before being found at 06 10 by barry sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work she told them over there in field they burnt me they put petrol on me they immediately took her to a nearby house and roused residents michael and margaret coop to call for an ambulance michael coop said both her hands appeared like ash her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred i was struck by how polite victim was she was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance margaret coop said i instinctively went to put my arms around her but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched her head was shaved and there were recent not new cuts to her head her face was almost featureless her hands were red raw and black at fingertips her legs were red from top to bottom she couldn t bear anything near her legs capper drank six glasses of water but was unable to hold glass herself because of injuries to her hands margaret coop said she looked like victim of an attack in vietnam war but i felt she would survive i had this theory that now she had got to somewhere she could be helped she would live capper was rushed to hospital and was able to give names of her six assailants and powell s address before falling into a coma extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb only part of her hands not severely burned she died on 18 december 1992 without regaining consciousness arrests inquiry was led by detective inspector peter wall of greater manchester police at 07 30 on 14 december he instructed officers to attend 97 langworthy road and arrest everyone that they found there jean powell and mcneilly laughed and joked with each other as they were arrested initially all six denied involvement under questioning dudson who had been urged by his father to tell truth began to talk d i wall said of dudson s statement as story began to unfold we just couldn t believe it i kept asking myself how one human being could do this to another police officers wept as extent of suzanne s suffering was revealed and together with civilian staff at station police collected cash to send flowers to her at hospital on 17 december 1992 six accused appeared before magistrates in manchester and were remanded into custody charged with kidnapping and attempted murder following capper s death they were charged with her murder on 23 december 1992 inquest inquest was opened by leonard at manchester coroner s court on 8 january 1993 dr william lawler a home office pathologist testified that capper had suffered 75 80 per cent burns consistent with having had petrol thrown over her and set alight and that her chance of survival had been minimal it was clear from outset that suzanne was unlikely to survive she suffered widespread burns that led to several complications internally death was due to complications caused by these burns coroner said it is clear that this young girl must have suffered a great deal of pain and had no chance of survival but she did fortunately survive long enough to give information which led to people mentioned being charged with her death to capper s mother and stepfather coroner said i offer you not just on my behalf but on behalf of whole nation my very deepest sympathy and condolences at this tragic happening to your young daughter convictions trial commenced on 16 november 1993 and lasted 22 days all six denied murder and in their testimonies each defendant tried to minimise their part in crime

15 years acquitted of murder as sentences were announced two jurors wept and there were cries of yes yes from public gallery which was filled with relatives of victim in a statement to press after sentencing d i wall said psychological reports say that these are absolutely sane individuals it s frightening that they are such ordinary people there is nothing special about any of them appeals leigh appealed against his sentence which was reduced from 12 years to 9 years on 4 november 1994 in 2002 dudson s minimum tariff was cut from 18 years to 16 years dudson appealed again arguing that reduction was insufficient and that lord chief justice had failed to reflect continuing obligation to have regard to dudson s welfare lord justice kennedy and mr justice mackay dismissed this second appeal on 21 november 2003 he was moved to an open prison in 2009 jean powell and mcneilly were granted leave to have lengths of their minimum sentences reviewed at court of appeal in june 2012

released from prison in december 2014 http www dailystar co uk news latest news chucky killer is back on streets with secret new identity reactions social environment there was wide commentary in news media about social situation in and around moston writing in times jon ronson focused on manchester s apparent economic imbalance pointing out that while superficially it is a city of growth hosting international environmental conferences in 1993 and bidding to host 2000 olympic games this could not disguise realities of poor quality of built to collapse housing city council s policy on homelessness poverty street violence and drug culture all of which played parts in events leading up to capper s murder city he said had violent no go areas where you can expect to be mugged created through drug abuse and hopelessness and populated by people who don t work have no money and rarely leave houses that they find themselves living in before dark ronson highlighted a city of contrasts where expensive canal side cafes are springing up faster than you can count them joke around town is that you can sip cappuccino all day and gaze out at corpses floating past david ward writing in guardian similarly drew attention to housing policies and quoted an older moston resident as saying these people are moving in and out every three months they re illiterate half of them just and having kids daily mail in what barker and called ideological overdrive described capper s killers as product of a society that tolerates petty crime break up of families and feckless spending most of suzanne s tormentors were on social security and belong to an underclass which is a grave threat to britain s future author carol anne davis agreed that when looking for answers about how this crime came about one need only look at upbringings of these women who were single parents to three children by their mid twenties had teenage boyfriends who were barely legal and who supported themselves through drug dealing and theft moral panic davis also noted unusual situation in that a gang was involved and that two females were sadistic leaders following convictions of powell and mcneilly there was wider press speculation about girl gangs and rise in violent crime committed by young women and probation service and ex offender organisations found themselves bombarded with requests from journalists seeking out case histories to illustrate this apparent explosion of la style girl gang culture on streets of britain mary a senior probation officer at inner london probation service women s centre dismissed notion saying one woman does something somewhere and immediately there s a great moral panic people think there s an epidemic of it however statistics and research produced by national association of probation officers did show an increase in number of women jailed for offences involving violence association s assistant general secretary harry fletcher said that like women involved in capper murder group is characterised by neglect personal abuse drug or alcohol abuse and low self esteem many have themselves been victim of violence problem needs help rather than incarceration in one of signs of change there was evidence that in 15 17 age group girls are more likely to take pleasure in violence than boys an indication we may face far more female violence in future as these girls grow up despite focus on female perpetrators around time of crime and trial davis pointed out that in cases like this which involved female and male sadists female s role is invariably forgotten over time this was apparent when dudson s appeals were reported in national press manchester newspapers named all of killers involved but most less localised reports simply referred to violent gang he belonged to and it probably wouldn t have occurred to newer readers that this gang included two merciless female sadists who thought that an allegedly stolen duffle coat was an excuse to torture someone to death video nasties moral panic was not confined solely to gender of murderers but also role played by so called video nasties news media immediately made a connection between bulger murder trial and capper murder trial when horror movie child s play 3 look who s stalking was mentioned as part of testimonies d i wall said throughout interviews with accused there was no suggestion that reason suzanne was killed had anything to do with child s play but this was overlooked by more sensationalist headlines demonic doll chucky links horror crimes curse of chucky neither powell or mcneilly owned a video recorder and child s play inspired music that had been used to torture capper was a popular track at time taped direct from manchester s piccadilly radio broadcaster david elstein called video connection a false story branded into consciousness of media and questioned news media s fascination with film there is no reason to believe that suzanne capper would be alive today if audiotape had instead contained torture scene from king lear or a catchphrase from bruce forsyth but child s play hare has been running ever since last day of james bulger murder trial elstein argued that film was simply a scapegoat which press made a three course meal out of guardian reported that 21 000 four to nine year olds watched each of bskyb s two transmissions of child s play 3 but elstein explained figure was simply a projection based on an average of just two actual viewers from barb s reporting panel and that margin of error means even two may have been just one but why spoil a good running story by asking what figures mean in april 1994 professor elizabeth newson published video violence and protection of children newson report which attracted huge media interest due to its claims that it had definitively established long sought for link between screen violence and real life variety and which cited capper murder as an example despite its support by press however report failed to demonstrate any definitive link merely drawing inferences from often highly speculative accounts in press rather than independent first hand research newson was called to give oral evidence to house of commons home affairs select committee on video violence where she asserted suzanne capper case is another example of very explicit imitation of video and use of video and that was child s play 3 chairman of committee sir ivan lawrence had to point out to newson that this was incorrect and that both police and british board of film classification had ruled out any connection between movie and murder link between murders and child s play 3 by news media directly led to delay of release certification for both natural born killers and reservoir dogs see also murder of shanda sharer murder of kelly anne bates murder of james bulger murder of jennifer daugherty sadistic personality disorder references category 1992
