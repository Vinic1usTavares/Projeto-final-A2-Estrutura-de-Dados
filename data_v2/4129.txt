investment manor marussia arrived in melbourne with a car that had passed its mandatory crash tests but had completed no testing formula renault 3 5 series drivers will stevens and roberto merhi were announced as their drivers with merhi signed on a one race deal however team did not participate in any practice sessions and subsequently failed to set a qualifying time leaving field at eighteen cars for race legal action against sauber a week before start of grand prix weekend dutch driver giedo van der garde launched legal action against sauber before supreme court of victoria to enforce a contract he entered into in june 2014 to drive for team during 2015 season this action was based on an award that van der garde obtained on 2 march 2015 through international arbitration in switzerland which he initiated after team announced in november 2014 that their 2015 drivers would instead be marcus ericsson and felipe nasr on wednesday 11 march 2015 van der garde succeeded by obtaining court orders compelling sauber to permit him to drive in melbourne on same day sauber appealed orders made against them and also publicly announced that they would not compromise safety of team or other drivers by putting van der garde in car since c34 chassis had only been tailored to fit ericsson and nasr appeal was heard and dismissed following day thursday 12 march 2015 as part of its legal argument aside from raising safety concerns sauber also submitted that van der garde s contract had been terminated by team in february with approval of federation internationale de l automobile fia s contract recognition board in any event and that van der garde violated confidentiality clauses of contract by discussing it with media lawyers representing ericsson and nasr further argued that van der garde had not followed due process by failing to give their clients prior notice of his legal action court upheld previous orders to permit van der garde to participate in race and adjourned hearing to following day friday 13 march 2015 to hear arguments on contempt of court proceedings launched by van der garde s legal team against sauber s team principal monisha kaltenborn some two hours after court made its initial judgment in favour of van der garde fia published an entry list for australian grand prix that included both nasr and ericsson for sauber following pre event scrutineering despite this neither driver took to circuit during first practice session on friday due to sauber running risk of having team assets seized for not complying with court orders nevertheless based on media speculation about bernie ecclestone s intervention to avoid further negative publicity on sport ericsson and nasr did participate in that afternoon s second practice session on saturday 14 march 2015 dispute reached a temporary resolution thanks to van der garde announcing that he would forego racing in melbourne with a view to finding a more permanent solution in future sauber team and its new drivers for 2015 were thus able to complete saturday s qualifying session and a point scoring race on sunday tyres pirelli announced they would be supplying teams with white banded medium compound tyre as prime selection and yellow banded soft compound as option selection for event free practice per regulations for 2015 season three practice sessions were held two 1

three drivers were eliminated during first session of qualifying q1 all of which was run in dry conditions mclaren cars of jenson button and kevin magnussen struggled as expected following their lack of pre season testing and failed to make it into q2 just as sauber driver marcus ericsson mercedes and williams valtteri bottas were only ones not having to use softer tyres to proceed into next part of qualifying second session saw mercedes drivers doing only one timed run which proved sufficient to proceed while red bull and toro rosso cars were split up with daniil kvyat and rookie max verstappen failing to make it through also eliminated were both force india drivers and second sauber of felipe nasr though in a respectable eleventh place on grid in q3 nico rosberg ran wide at turn 15 on his first flying lap and lost chance to seek areas of improvement for his second run lewis hamilton who was fastest in all three sessions capitalized on his teammate s problem and took pole position by over half a second it was his 39th pole position and his 4th at albert park rest of field was more than a second behind hamilton s time with felipe massa in williams best of rest in third

in qualifying both daniil kvyat s red bull and kevin magnussen s mclaren failed to make it to grid as their cars broke down on out lap kvyat suffering transmission problems and magnussen with an engine failure this left grid with 15 starters lowest number for a season opening race since and lowest overall since infamous 2005 united states grand prix at start hamilton assumed lead while a three car wide tussle at turn one involving kimi raikkonen felipe nasr and pastor maldonado resulted in maldonado crashing out at turn two and race officials deploying safety car next lap romain grosjean s car failed thus taking both lotus cars out of race normal racing resumed on lap four with carlos sainz jr falling back from fifth to his starting position in seventh place after being passed by nasr and daniel ricciardo nasr also lost track position after being ordered by his team to relinquish a position for overtaking while still under safety car conditions hamilton maintained in lead until lap 25 when he made a pit stop for tyres he resumed lead from rosberg after he too had to pit for new tyres during this series of pitstops sebastian vettel gained a position by passing felipe massa for third place on lap 34 max verstappen retired while in a points scoring position after his toro rosso was engulfed by smoke on lap 42 raikkonen also retired at turn four after a botched pitstop caused his left rear tyre to come loose this put jenson button briefly into tenth and final points position but for sergio perez quickly passing mclaren honda driver after a race long battle that begun at start for last position from there order remained relatively constant with hamilton going on to take his 34th grand prix win he was followed by rosberg vettel massa and nasr

making their grand prix debut post race there was satisfaction at mercedes with second placed nico rosberg calling it an awesome start to season for us as a team rosberg praised lewis hamilton s performance in particular saying he drove like a world champion all weekend so couldn t quite beat him but for sure i was trying every single lap all way to maximum and i will do all year dominant performance by mercedes cars sparked controversy in paddock daniel ricciardo issued apologies to australian fans after what he felt was a boring race red bull quarreled with their engine manufacturer renault and lamented dominance of their rivals calling for fia to step in and apply rule changes to level field fearing that public would lose interest in sport if nothing happened mercedes chief toto wolff reacted furiously telling his rivals to get your fucking head down and work to sort it out but later made it clear that he didn t mean f word in relation to him regarding comments by christian horner nico rosberg voiced hopes that their rivals would get closer over course of season saying during post race press conference i hope we can have a good fight that would be awesome this statement caused amusement from sebastian vettel who replied be honest do you really hope so seriously you finished 30 seconds ahead of us and you hope it s going to be closer so you hope you slow down is that what you re saying sauber was delighted by their performance over weekend having picked up 14 points in very first race compared to none in entire previous season because manor marussia failed to notify stewards of their inability to field a car team was summoned by fia to explain why they did not participate in qualifying however hearing provided sufficient evidence to fia s satisfaction that team would have been unable to field their cars even if they had violated curfew despite this ecclestone subsequently announced that manor marussia would have to cover their freight charges to and
