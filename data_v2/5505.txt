hurricane irene olivia was first actively tracked tropical cyclone to move into eastern pacific ocean from atlantic basin it originated as a tropical depression on september 11 1971 in tropical atlantic cyclone tracked nearly due westward at a low latitude passing through southern windward islands and later over northern south america in southwest caribbean sea it intensified to a tropical storm and later a hurricane irene made landfall on southeastern nicaragua on september 19 and maintained its circulation as it crossed low lying terrain of country restrengthening after reaching pacific irene was renamed hurricane olivia which ultimately attained peak winds of 115 mph 185 km h olivia weakened significantly before moving ashore on baja california peninsula on september 30 next day it dissipated in atlantic irene produced moderate rainfall and winds along its path although impact was greatest in nicaragua where it moved ashore as a hurricane a total of 96 homes were destroyed and 1 200 people were left homeless rainfall resulted in widespread flooding killing three people in rivas in neighboring costa rica hurricane irene caused more than 1 million usd in damage to banana crop later remnants of hurricane olivia produced rainfall in southwest united states flooding was reported near yuma arizona which closed a major highway and moisture produced snowfall in higher elevations in rocky mountains meteorological history origins of hurricane were from a tropical wave that exited west african coast on september 7 it moved rapidly westward developing into a tropical depression on september 11 about 800 miles 1300 km east of windward islands it was one of seven active tropical cyclones in atlantic basin that day one of most active single days on record it existed at a fairly low latitude and failed to intensify due to unfavorable combination of hurricane ginger and a long trough to its northwest on september 13 depression passed just south of barbados and subsequently entered caribbean sea interacting with terrain of south america center became broad and ill defined although curacao reported winds of near tropical storm force as it crossed island on september 16 it later moved near or over northern venezuela and colombia as it approached western caribbean depression was able to organize more with less influence from landmass or trough to its north at 0000 utc on september 17 it is estimated depression attained tropical storm status that day it was named irene about 350 miles 560 km east of san andres initially storm was expected to track west northwestward toward northwest caribbean similar to track taken by destructive hurricane edith two weeks prior right thumb surface weather map of irene on september 17 tropical storm irene gradually intensified as it continued across southwestern caribbean sea late on september 18 storm attained hurricane status a short distance off coast of central america with 80 mph 130 km h winds its peak intensity in atlantic ocean as it strengthened it developed an eye and spiral rainbands that extended across panama into pacific ocean hurricane irene weakened slightly as it approached coast although its pressure dropped to 989 mbar on september 19 hurricane made landfall in nicaraguan south caribbean coast autonomous region it was first tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity since 1911 to strike nicaragua south of bluefields irene quickly weakened deteriorating to tropical depression status within 18 hours of moving ashore circulation remained organized over low lying terrain of southern nicaragua possibly due to it crossing lake nicaragua after reaching pacific ocean on september 20 depression restrengthened to attain tropical storm status upon doing so it was re designated by a new name olivia it was first time an atlantic hurricane was tracked as a tropical cyclone while crossing central america into pacific ocean subsequent research indicated there were earlier storms that accomplished feat although they were not known at time as an eastern pacific tropical cyclone olivia maintained well defined outflow and inflow it gradually intensified as it paralleled southern central america coastline late on september 21 a hurricane hunters flight reported winds of 80 mph 130 km h and an eye 23 miles 37 km in diameter based on readings olivia was upgraded to hurricane status for several days olivia moved west to west northwestward off coast of mexico although its exact intensity fluctuations were unknown due to lack of significant observations on september 25 eye became very pronounced on satellite imagery and based on a report from hurricane hunters it is estimated olivia reached peak winds of 115 mph 185 km h about 245 miles 395 km southwest of manzanillo colima hurricane hunters also reported a pressure of 948 mbar which was lowest reported pressure during 1971 pacific hurricane season intensity of hurricane olivia fluctuated for two days as it turned westward away from land due to a blocking ridge over northwestern mexico early on september 26 it weakened to winds of about 105 mph 165 km h before it quickly restrengthened to its previous peak intensity subsequently dry air became entrained in circulation and olivia began to weaken as it moved over cooler waters eye became disorganized and eventually dissipated late on september 28 it weakened to tropical storm status after beginning a turn to northwest and later to north about 24 hours later olivia weakened to tropical depression status as it approached coastline of baja california peninsula most of thunderstorm activity dissipated by time depression moved ashore on september 30 next day olivia dissipated near border of baja california and baja california sur impact and records left thumb hurricane irene near its central america landfall as a tropical depression cyclone produced a wind gust of 43 mph 69 km h in barbados system also dropped 3 35 inches 85 1 mm of rainfall in trinidad prior to its arrival officials noted potential for depression to bring flash flooding to northern venezuela as well as heavy rainfall to abc islands later as a tropical storm irene brushed san andres island in western caribbean with gale force winds no major damage was reported there prior to hurricane s landfall in nicaragua country s army evacuated about 500 people from a settlement near bluefields and along coastline boats were advised to remain at port when it moved ashore hurricane produced sustained winds of 46 mph 74 km h in bluefields winds destroyed 27 houses in region observations were not available in sparsely populated region near where irene moved ashore although winds were believed to have reached hurricane force there reconnaissance planes reported heavy structural and tree damage in southeastern nicaragua satellite imagery suggested that heavy rainfall occurred from panama through honduras and one location in nicaragua reported more than 6 3 inches 160 mm of precipitation rainfall caused flooding in many communities killing three people in rivas at least five rivers reported flooding along one of rivers 35 houses were inundated and along another floodwaters swept away all of crops and personal belongings of three villages across country hurricane destroyed 96 homes and 1 200 people were left homeless in costa rica irene s passage resulted in more than 1 million usd in damage to banana crop late in its duration hurricane olivia brought increased moisture into southwest united states more than 2 inches 50 mm of rainfall were reported across arizona and new mexico light precipitation was also reported in western texas and southeastern california national weather service issued flash flood warnings throughout region near yuma arizona thunderstorms caused three major power outages and produced flooding that resulted in closure of a portion of u s route 95 in navajo and pinal counties rainfall damaged roads bridges sewers and homes which amounted to about 250 000 in repair work for state of arizona storm s moisture also produced locally heavy snowfall in higher elevations in rocky mountains irene olivia is unusual in that it survived passage from atlantic to pacific ocean only nine other named storms are known to have done so irene was first of three atlantic to pacific crossover tropical cyclones in 1970s all three of which took eastern pacific names starting with letter o see also hurricane joan miriam of 1988 list of atlantic pacific crossover hurricanes list of south america cyclones other
