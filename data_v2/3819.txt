unimpressed with popular family sitcoms that were airing at time some of which often depicted children talking back to and disrespecting their parents without suffering serious consequences cosby intended for cosby show s children to remain intelligent while emphasizing that their parents were always smarter and most importantly in charge originally denise was intended to be eldest of huxtable family s four children however cosby also wanted show to feature a character who was an example of parents cliff and clair having already successfully raised a college educated child successfully so writers introduced eldest sibling sondra a princeton university graduate in second episode while denise was relegated to role of huxtable s second eldest child instead cosby himself is father of five children four daughters and one son much like his character cliff on show all five of huxtable children are based on cosby s own denise in particular was based on creator s daughter erinn who was approximately denise s same age when series began in 1984 according to cosby his life and times author mark whitaker cosby conceived denise as a hip fashion conscious and a bit flaky character early storylines included denise fighting with younger sister vanessa over latter borrowing a sweater from her without her permission getting her braces removed announcing her decision to attend college away from home promising younger brother theo that she is capable of sewing him a replica of an expensive designer shirt he had purchased and tricking her parents into believing she had spent a night at a male friend s house to prove a point about their parenting style an episode entitled jitterbug break was written to explore cosby s interest in ways in which different generations dance when denise s parents deny her permission to attend a concert some of her friends are invited into their living room which has been converted into a dance floor by rearranging some of furniture allowing them room to break dance they are eventually joined by a pair of cliff and clair s swing dancing friends and a dance battle ensues between younger and older dancers in one of show s more serious episodes denise struggles with reality that a teenage friend of hers is pregnant several episodes revolving around denise explore her boyfriends and dating life casting and portrayal denise is portrayed by american actress lisa bonet whose professional acting experience prior to cosby show had been limited to television commercials for barbie and mcdonald s and a guest appearance on medical drama st elsewhere casting role of denise who was still intended to be huxtable s eldest child at time was a relatively quick process bonet first auditioned for show s directors followed by its producers then finally cosby himself and network executives cosby immediately became interested in then 15 year old bonet because she was wearing makeup on only one side of her face already demonstrating some of quirky characteristics cosby had envisioned for character simply by being herself impressed by young actress strong sense of self producer marcy carsey recalled that bonet attended her audition wearing braces a real kid hairstyle and an off center sense of fashion that was very similar to what show s creators had envisioned for denise they soon labelled bonet a young woman who refuses to be anything but herself after actress read for role quite naturally as though she were just doing life according to people denise didn t fit into any mold a role that seemed made for lisa bonet actors were eventually narrowed down to three top choices for each child character including bonet for denise although she felt discouraged after overhearing one of other two actresses vying for same role say she ll never get it because she has braces after bonet learned that she had in fact been chosen for role from director jay sandrich she met with cosby one more time who admitted to liking her braces according to cosby his life and times author mark whitaker cosby enjoyed naturalness of bonet s delivery which he found refreshing in comparison to stagey quality most child actors who auditioned for role tended to rely upon in addition to her exotic beauty which he likened to that of singer lena horne once bonet was cast writers began to incorporate some aspects of her personality into her character although her own fashion sense and behavior is viewed as more outlandish than denise s at cosby s request costume designer sarah lemire was granted a weekly budget of 3000 to outfit show s characters and frequently took significant risks with bonet s wardrobe however costume designer did have some restrictions lemire would have liked to have been more outrageous with bonet s hair and hats but limited herself because she had little control over actress hair praising bonet s own taste in clothing lemire likened costuming her to dressing myself if i was 20 years younger bonet often selected her character s outfits herself with little input from wardrobe department denise was bonet s first major television role being of mixed ethnicity her character s upbringing as a teen ager in a well adjusted upper middle class black family is remarkably different from how bonet herself grew up which took some time for actress to adjust to she never knew her father and was raised by her mother in a lower middle class mostly white neighborhood however bonet credits her role on cosby show with helping resolve her own identity crisis bonet described show s environment in 1987 as perfect family where you go to work you get tired of them and you go home and at time likened working alongside cosby to learning from a master from whom she often sought both professional and personal advice actress phylicia rashad who portrays bonet s on screen mother clair described bonet as one of best young actresses today she is phenomenal for someone of her years creative conflicts and a different world bonet had a tense relationship with both cosby and show s producers throughout most of her time on series although co stars are believed to have gotten along well during her first three seasons on show their dispute first became public in 1987 according to kara kovalchik of mental floss bonet s alleged unprofessionalism consistently aggravated cosby reportedly being constantly argumentative on set late for tapings and sometimes neglecting to attend tapings altogether bonet first expressed interest in pursuing a career as a dramatic film actress midway through show s first season originally intending to leave series after only two years aged 19 at time she decided to make her film debut as epiphany proudfoot in controversial horror film angel heart 1987 a role that required bonet to film a sex scene with actor mickey rourke by this time denise had already become show s most popular character while bonet s fame increased exponentially when film was initially assigned an x rating for its graphic content although her role shocked several of bonet s fans and cosby himself cosby claims that he did not mind actress decision to appear in film explaining to her if this is something you want to do fine you have my blessings and maintaining that he and bonet have a good relationship in which he would have voiced his disapproval if he had felt otherwise bonet confirmed that she sought cosby s advice when she was first offered role because he s a generous enough man to see beyond cosby show and to see my career as what it is and what it could be despite granting her his approval cosby refused to see film show s producers and nbc executives declined to comment on bonet s decision citing what bonet did off cosby set was her business

doing and making decisions on her own and she is deeply loved in my heart media continued to circulate bonet s photographs heavily which is believed to have instigated a highly publicized dispute between actress and cosby towards end of 1980s cosby expressed concern over how photographs would affect cosby show s younger audience and bonet s younger cast mates although producers felt that scandal would disturb squeaky clean huxtable image cosby eventually decided to provide bonet with her own television series a spin off of cosby show entitled a different world network agreed that bonet was ready to star in her own series a revelation by which she was surprised a different world originally revolved around an entirely different premise and main character starring actress meg

consulted with producer debbie allen who suggested that they approach cosby about pregnancy together allen suggested that bonet s pregnancy be written into series explaining that it would be a great thing to see a girl who s upper class kid having a baby not married because she didn t want to be married and girls could root for her although cosby listened to allen s ideas he and some of show s other producers did not want to explore teen pregnancy via a different world s main character fearing that depicting a popular well behaved character like denise pregnant at such a young age would offer wrong message to audiences cosby in particular was strongly opposed to idea of a huxtable child experiencing an unplanned pregnancy and becoming an unwed mother concluding lisa bonet is pregnant not denise and rejecting allen s proposal allen was reportedly upset with cosby over his decision but understood that he just wanted her back and denise s pregnancy would alter cosby s creative vision
