there s this one song we taking it back to you must be my luck eee remember ugly by bubba sparxxx i got a beat similar to that hook is no words it s saying stuff named after coffee name of song is la la pharrell did a hot one for her too called candy shop timbaland finished off by saying that title of album was not decided then but he had to reconvene with madonna to complete record by september 2007 mtv described new album as moving in an urban direction it had initially been defined as having a lot of producers from a lot of genres in there pet shop boys were originally asked by warner to write and produce some songs for album timbaland referred to album as being like holiday with an r b groove recording hard candy features additional vocals by timberlake timbaland pharrell williams and kanye west and production by madonna timbaland timberlake neptunes and nate danja hills previously madonna had worked with relatively unknown producers like william orbit mirwais ahmadzai and stuart price however for hard candy madonna decided to collaborate with producers and artists who were already well known talking to mtv madonna explained her decision to collaborate with well known producers because they re good and i like their shit i mean i don t like to repeat myself and i was sitting around thinking what music do i love right now and it was actually timberlake s record futuresex lovesounds i was listening to it obsessively madonna had already started work on album with williams and during one of her breaks from recording her manager guy oseary spoke to timberlake suggesting that it would be cool if he recorded some songs with her timberlake commented that would be awesome but i thought that ll never happen but it s a testament to pharrell he had already laid groundwork where she was going with it she played candy shop for me and a couple of other songs and i thought what a cool direction i thought she could essentially do whole record with pharrell if she wanted to and i asked tim how do we fit in and it basically came down to how we did my record co producing and just throwing madonna in mix first track recorded by madonna and timberlake was devil wouldn t recognize you timberlake felt that song which madonna had been working on for years before hard candy project was comparable to frozen 1998 he wanted to turn line devil wouldn t recognize you but i do into a catchy hook and make it sound like a concept timberlake was impressed by amount of recording material madonna would already have ready he said that he does not normally write down his lyrics since ideas come faster to him but madonna had all these thoughts riddles poems feelings all written in huge notebooks she kept handing them over it was amazing taking these little bits here and there and putting them together like a puzzle for recording miles away timberlake played a guitar riff for madonna and asked how do we want to do this what do we want it to be about what do we want to say madonna decided to have discussions between herself and timberlake to develop other ideas for songs one of ideas they connected on was universality of long distance relationships which they felt was too personal for them but nevertheless used concept in miles away madonna commented on recorded version we put our stuff out there and after we did song everybody in studio was like oh i can relate to that music structure and composition with interview magazine madonna explained her inspirations behind songs and music of hard candy she said that probably in many respects most of songs on hard candy are autobiographical but in more of an unconscious way i don t really think about telling personal stories when i m writing music it just comes and then a lot of times six months later eight months later i go oh that s what i wrote that song about but that s when i play song for lots of people and they all go oh i can totally relate to that candy shop is opening track of album produced by williams song uses word candy as a metaphor for sex williams said we were just in a studio and madonna was like look give me some hot shit i was looking at her like she s saying hot shit she was like what and i m like ok so we just worked and made it first single from album 4 minutes was initially known as 4 minutes to save world song s development was motivated by a sense of urgency to save planet from destruction and how people can enjoy themselves in process according to madonna song inspired her to produce documentary i am because we are song features vocals by timberlake and timbaland an uptempo dance song with an urban hip hop style it also incorporates timbaland s bhangra beats instrumentation used in song includes brass foghorns and cow bells song s lyrics carry a message of social awareness inspired by madonna s visit to africa and human suffering she witnessed in give it 2 me album s second single madonna merged bounce beats and a funky bassline if it s against law arrest me she sings if you can handle it undress me song has a short interlude where madonna continuously repeats words get stupid as williams chants to left to right give it 2 me was written by madonna as an anthemic self manifesto song which although it appears to be about dance and sex is a reference to madonna s career spanning three decades in music industry musically it is an upbeat dance song featuring instrumentation from west african percussion and backing vocals are provided by williams fourth track heartbeat has madonna singing breathlessly and also features an interlude where music changes from its normal rhythm just sound of drums mtv said that miles away third single from album was most deceptively simple track because although it appeared straightforward on surface it had a lot of technical tricks underneath it song departs from dance theme of album and deals with difficulties of long distance relationships miles away is a melancholy electronic ballad which according to madonna is autobiographical and is inspired by her then husband guy ritchie relationship themed lyrics continue in next track she s not me which talks about madonna being emulated by another woman hence she utters line she started dressing like me and talking like me it freaked me out she started calling you up in middle of night what s that about next track incredible starts off like a love song and then transforms into a plea to someone to return to a relationship song changes rhythm at interlude to mimic this change in tone in a promotional interview madonna described song as full of angst and desire and wanting to get back to a feeling of happiness and fulfillment but also containing a feeling of abandonment in a review of album on mtv shift in structure of song reflected madonna s own confusion about how she felt about her lover in song can t get my head around it she sang i i need to think about it beat goes on featuring west has a 70s r b meeting 80s dance vibe and a rap interlude by west williams has commented that madonna s work ethic was different from other artists that he had worked with before that is reflected in songs like spanish lesson where she sings line if you do your homework baby i will give you more it also has influences of spanish music groove inspired music is present in dance 2night which featured timberlake devil wouldn t recognize you was written by madonna before hard candy project started song has a sense of mystery and starts off softly and slowly with a piano introduction it then becomes fast and melancholy with madonna singing your eyes are full of surprises they cannot predict my fate trip hop inspired voices is last track of album consisting of unresolved chords and sweeping strings as lyrics question who is really in control are you walking dog is dog walking you release and artwork thumb left madonna wanted to portray herself as black madonna for cover art but rejected idea alt portrait of a black

album was about incorporating image of a boxer an idea which has been repeated within song give it 2 me according to her give it 2 me is basically opposite in meaning i m not give me all you got kind of person so it s quite a sort of tough stance hence initially madonna decided that title of song was to be used for then unnamed album this was changed following release of a similarly named song by timbaland after that madonna decided to call album black madonna and even shot a photograph for cover art wearing blackface make up with white eyes in a 2009 interview with rolling stone madonna commented i did a photoshoot with steven klein for my last album cover and i painted my face black except for red lips and white eyes it was a play on words have you ever heard of black madonna it has layers of meaning and for a minute i thought it would be a fun title for my record then i thought twenty five per cent of world might get this probably less it s not worth it it happens all time

song on hot dance airplay chart most for any artist critical reception hard candy received generally favorable reviews album received a score of 65 100 on metacritic which indicates generally favorable reviews mark savage from bbc commented on composition of tracks saying if a handful of tracks had been delivered to more producers with a touch more subtlety hard candy could have ranked alongside madonna s best over and over again she subsumes her pop sensibilities to their arsenal of clattering beats hollered raps and over fussy production stephen thomas erlewine from allmusic felt that there s a palpable sense of disinterest in hard candy as if she just handed reins over to pharrell and timba lake trusting them to polish up this piece of stale candy maybe she s not into music maybe she s just running out this last album for warner before she moves onto greener pastures of live nation either way hard candy is as a rare thing a lifeless madonna album tom young from blender gave a positive review saying on hard candy she s like an aging master thief sneaking into temple of pop goodies for one last big score album 11 is good naturedly smutty not confrontationally nasty but it s a veritable filth bath compared to c span sermons and confessional strumming of 2003 s dreadful american life or self actualized club trance of 2005 s confessions on a dance floor kerri mason from billboard complimented new sound and musical direction taken by madonna but felt that she had become a producer s puppet leading her to comment that madonna makes producers producers don t make madonna chris willman from entertainment weekly gave album a b and said madonna makes it work with this surprisingly rejuvenated set mike collett white from reuters reported as parting gifts go madonna s 11th studio album and her last before she exits long term record label warner bros is unusually generous if early reviews are to be believed hard candy scored solidly among rock critics caryn ganz from rolling stone said that hard candy is work of a songwriting team of american chart royalty that helps madonna revisit her roots as an urban disco queen for hard candy she lets top shelf producers make her their plaything ben thompson from guardian commented on music by saying that hard candy is a tough confection offering plenty for listeners to get their teeth into whenever it threatens to get boring something always happens to recapture your interest sarah from times felt that while hard candy is no disaster album s producers have already done same thing with nelly furtado britney spears and gwen stefani andy gill from independent said that album portrayed madonna as how a once diverse talent has ossified into simply satisfying sweet tooth of functional dance pop thomas hausner from popmatters wrote that album is overpopulated with recycled pop that is indistinguishable and artificial something madonna s soothing vocals cannot alleviate tom ewing from pitchfork wondered after listening to album question s still open nobody involved in hard candy is anywhere near their creative peak sal cinquemani from slant magazine was disappointed with album and said madonna hasn t delivered this many vapid floor fillers on one disc since her debut and maybe not even then there are few confessions here nothing political nothing too spiritual no talk of fame war or media it s just what america ordered wilfred young from nme felt that hard candy was a solid enough album by standards of most pop tarts but from mistress of innovation pretty mediocre commercial
