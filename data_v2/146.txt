released by sh k boom records received four out of five stars from allmusic and plaudits from los angeles daily news background alex timbers developed concept and directed play while kyle jarrow wrote accompanying book music and lyrics timbers and jarrow were classmates together at yale university script for play is published by samuel french inc jarrow was motivated to write script by what he saw as a shift in religious teachings from an old model involving hell and retribution to a new system of thought promising money or peace jarrow commented on timbers idea of using children to tell a story about scientology i did a lot of work on cults in college and what i learned is that they sort of turn you into a child by appealing to that part of you that wants to be taken care of and given answers and so it all began to make sense to me he said scientology would be an especially interesting topic for a theater piece because of its criticism of psychiatry relative newness compared to buddhism islam judaism and christianity and practice of requiring that follower take courses which cost significant amounts of money jarrow s script was almost entirely based on hubbard s own writings and church s literature though jarrow was also influenced by critical journalistic accounts he also drew on awkward woodenness of christmas pageants fact that children are often made to say large words that don t sound natural coming out of their mouths timbers said they chose to stick to church of scientology primary source material for background on script because we thought that best way to satirize church of scientology was to let church speak for itself during production creative team worked with cast members to educate them about play s background kids shouldn t just be saying things that they don t understand that s what we re criticizing people who just parrot behavior and language we wanted to have an honest conversation with them jarrow said published version of script says that musical should not be performed by adults jarrow said adults are too jaded and would not be able to portray satire of piece thumb xenu scene 2007 philadelphia production producers wanted musical

finale which includes refrain just don t ask questions and everything is clear musical analysis jarrow incorporated musical themes from road to freedom a 1986 pop album with lyrics by hubbard and performances by john travolta leif garrett frank stallone chick corea and karen black jarrow also incorporated musical themes from 1980s pop saying liturgical music of scientology is 1980s pop which seems strangely appropriate because of science fiction books so that s what we did in show it s a pastiche of synth pop and pageant choir music jarrow said he tried to capture feel of kiddie rock such as free to be you and me and kids incorporated song hey it s a happy day quotes hubbard s scientology a new slant on life songs are set to cheesy synth keyboard backing and feature sublimely clunky dance breaks an electronic score emphasizes musical s loony conviction while sleigh bells give play a feeling of a jazzed up saint s play songs incorporate video game music and beats from a child s

editors from los angeles times received phone calls from scientologists urging them not to write about play in addition parents of one of children from cast received phone calls from members of

angeles church of scientology spokeswoman was quoted as saying this is not litigation material this is nothing in a 2007 interview jarrow commented on church of scientology s history of responses to

play reviews a very merry unauthorized children s scientology pageant received positive reviews from press a review in new york times described musical as having a crude faux naif sensibility and stated that it provides a cult hit blueprint for a young generation that prefers its irony delivered with not a wink but a blank stare a 2003 review in new york city s village voice compared show to resistible rise of arturo ui stating just as ui doesn t explain complex phenomenon of third reich scientology pageant doesn t probe psychology of cults instead both demystify subjects whose appeal stems in no small part from mystique their acolytes have attributed to them though most of media reception of musical was positive new york church of scientology president john carmichael did not have kind words for production carmichael asserted that l ron hubbard was portrayed in play as an authoritarian demagogue whose methods create emotionless followers other critics complained that young members of cast were portraying characters and depicting content that they could not understand los angeles times review in 2004 stated that show found a new york audience willing to move from tongue in cheek children s pageant concept to something that became startlingly adult in a 2004 review in guardian article cited notable quotes from other reviews including new york times village voice and new york observer review stated that audiences have a chance to witness a wide eyed straight faced scrappy and touching telling of story of l ron set to a cheesy electro pop score see great man clad in a white spree style gown wander from inquisitive soul to wounded war veteran to writer of pulp science fiction to leader of world religion sort of of updated 2006 version variety stated that breezy one hour show is equal parts adorable and creepy hilarious and unsettling making it way more compelling than your average holiday entertainment boston globe also reviewed 2006 edition of play and its review spent more time giving background on some of cast and crew particularly writer kyle jarrow stating that jarrow has created a musical about l ron hubbard that is in its own sardonic way much more funny and touching than any of cruise s diatribes against ritalin new york sun described production as an ingenious musical account of l ron hubbard s life and times and compared discomfort produced by watching piece to that produced by 2006 documentary jesus camp 2007 philadelphia production also received favorable reviews and critic wendy rosenfield of philadelphia inquirer wrote somehow production emerges triumphant retaining its innocent sense of inquiry and buoyant good humor while making some pretty serious philosophical points a review in washington post of 2007 washington d c production was more critical peter marks wrote that aside from a weird sci fi back story involving prince xenu a figure from scientology lore incidents playwright relates that shape hubbard s belief system unfold choppily and dryly production received a positive review in by bob anthony in who wrote this is so charming that it rates a must see status show should be extended at another venue manya reviewed 2008 chicago production for chicago tribune and highlighted play s trilling tunes including hey it s a happy day and science of mind two chicago productions in 2009 also
