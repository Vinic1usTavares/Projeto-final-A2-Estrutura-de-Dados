caesium iupac spelling also spelled cesium in american english is a chemical element with symbol cs and atomic number 55 it is a soft silvery golden alkali metal with a melting point of 28 5 degc 83 3 degf which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature caesium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium most reactive of all metals it is pyrophoric and reacts with water even at 116 degc 177 degf it is least electronegative element with a value of 0 79 on pauling scale it has only one stable isotope caesium 133 caesium is mined mostly from pollucite while radioisotopes especially caesium 137 a fission product are extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors german chemist robert bunsen and physicist gustav kirchhoff discovered caesium in 1860 by newly developed method of flame spectroscopy first small scale applications for caesium were as a getter in vacuum tubes and in photoelectric cells in 1967 acting on einstein s proof that speed of light is most constant dimension in universe international system of units used two specific wave counts from an emission spectrum of caesium 133 to co define second and metre since then caesium has been widely used in highly accurate atomic clocks since 1990s largest application of element has been as caesium formate for drilling fluids but it has a range of applications in production of electricity in electronics and in chemistry radioactive isotope caesium 137 has a half life of about 30 years and is used in medical applications industrial gauges and hydrology nonradioactive caesium compounds are only mildly toxic but pure metal s tendency to react explosively with water means that caesium is considered a hazardous material and radioisotopes present a significant health and ecological hazard in environment characteristics physical properties left thumb high purity caesium 133 stored in argon alt y shaped yellowish crystal in glass ampoule looking like branch of a pine tree caesium is softest element it has a hardness of 0 2 mohs it is a very ductile pale metal which darkens in presence of trace amounts of oxygen when in presence of mineral oil where it is best kept during transport it loses its metallic lustre and takes on a duller grey appearance it has a melting point of making it one of few elemental metals that are liquid near room temperature mercury is only elemental metal with a known melting point lower than caesium in addition metal has a rather low boiling point lowest of all metals other than mercury its compounds burn with a blue or violet colour left thumb caesium crystals golden compared to rubidium crystals silvery caesium forms alloys with other alkali metals gold and mercury amalgams at temperatures below it does not alloy with cobalt iron molybdenum nickel platinum tantalum or tungsten it forms well defined intermetallic compounds with antimony gallium indium and thorium which are photosensitive it mixes with all other alkali metals except lithium alloy with a molar distribution of 41 caesium 47 potassium and 12 sodium has lowest melting point of any known metal alloy at a few amalgams have been studied is black with a purple metallic lustre while is golden coloured also with a metallic lustre golden colour of caesium comes from decreasing frequency of light required to excite electrons of alkali metals as group is descended for lithium through rubidium this frequency is in ultraviolet but for caesium it enters blue violet end of spectrum in other words frequency of alkali metals becomes lower from lithium to caesium thus caesium transmits and partially absorbs violet light preferentially while other colours having lower frequency are reflected hence it appears yellowish chemical properties left thumb addition of a small amount of caesium to cold water is explosive alt a person adds a small amount of metal to a petri dish with cold water which produces a small explosion caesium metal is highly reactive and very pyrophoric it ignites spontaneously in air and reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures more so than other alkali metals first group of periodic table it reacts with solid water at temperatures as low as because of this high reactivity caesium metal is classified as a hazardous material it is stored and shipped in dry saturated hydrocarbons such as mineral oil it can be handled only under inert gas such as argon however a caesium water explosion is often less powerful than a sodium water explosion with a similar amount of sodium this is because caesium explodes instantly upon contact with water leaving little time for hydrogen to accumulate gray theodore 2012 elements black dog leventhal publishers p 131 caesium can be stored in vacuum sealed glass ampoules in quantities of more than about 100 grams 3 5 oz caesium is shipped in hermetically sealed stainless steel containers chemistry of caesium is similar to that of other alkali metals in particular rubidium element above caesium in periodic table as expected for an alkali metal only common oxidation state is 1 some small differences arise from fact that it has a higher atomic mass and is more electropositive than other nonradioactive alkali metals caesium is most electropositive chemical element caesium ion is also larger and less hard than those of lighter alkali metals compounds thumb left upright ball and stick model of cubic coordination of cs and cl in cscl alt 27 small grey spheres in 3 evenly spaced layers of nine 8 spheres form a regular cube and 8 of those cubes form a larger cube grey spheres represent caesium atoms center of each small cube is occupied by a small green sphere representing a chlorine atom thus every chlorine is in middle of a cube formed by caesium atoms and every caesium is in middle of a cube formed by chlorine most caesium compounds contain element as cation which binds to a wide variety of anions one noteworthy exception is anion and others are several suboxides see section on oxides below salts of cs are usually colourless unless anion itself is coloured many of simple salts are hygroscopic but less so than corresponding salts of lighter alkali metals phosphate hogan c m 2011 in encyclopedia of earth jorgensen a and cleveland c j eds national council for science and environment washington dc acetate carbonate halides oxide nitrate and sulfate salts are water soluble double salts are often less soluble and low solubility of caesium aluminium sulfate is exploited in refining cs from ores double salt with antimony such as bismuth cadmium copper iron and lead are also poorly soluble caesium hydroxide csoh is hygroscopic and strongly basic it rapidly surface of semiconductors such as silicon csoh has been previously regarded by chemists as strongest base reflecting relatively weak attraction between large cs ion and oh it is indeed strongest base but a number of compounds that do not dissolve in water such as n and sodium amide are more basic a stoichiometric mixture of caesium and gold will react to form yellow caesium auride cs au upon heating auride anion here behaves as a compound reacts violently with water yielding caesium hydroxide metallic gold and hydrogen gas in liquid ammonia it can be reacted with a caesium specific ion exchange resin to produce auride analogous platinum compound red caesium platinide contains platinide ion that behaves as a complexes like all metal cations cs forms complexes with lewis bases in solution because of its large size cs usually adopts coordination numbers greater than 6 number typical for smaller alkali metal cations this difference is apparent in 8 coordination of cscl this high coordination number and softness tendency to form covalent bonds are properties exploited in separating cs from other cations in remediation of nuclear wastes where 137cs must be separated from large amounts of nonradioactive k halides thumb upright monatomic caesium halide wires grown inside double wall carbon nanotubes tem image caesium fluoride csf is a hygroscopic white solid that is widely used in organofluorine chemistry as a source of fluoride anions caesium fluoride has halite structure which means that cs and f pack in a cubic closest packed array as do na and cl in sodium chloride notably caesium and fluorine have lowest and highest respectively among all known elements caesium chloride cscl crystallizes in simple cubic crystal system also called caesium chloride structure this structural motif is composed of a primitive cubic lattice with a two atom basis each with an eightfold coordination chloride atoms lie upon lattice points at edges of cube while caesium atoms lie in holes in centre of cubes this structure is shared with csbr and csi and many other compounds that do not contain cs in contrast most other alkaline halides have sodium chloride nacl structure cscl structure is preferred because cs has an ionic radius of 174 pm and 181 pm oxides thumb left upright 0 7 cluster alt stick and ball diagram shows three regular octahedra which are connected to next one by one surface and last one shares one surface with first all three have one edge in common all eleven vertices are purple spheres representing caesium and at center of each octahedron is a small red sphere representing oxygen more so than other alkali metals caesium forms numerous binary compounds with oxygen when caesium burns in air superoxide is main product normal caesium oxide forms yellow orange hexagonal crystals and is only oxide of anti type it vaporizes at and decomposes to caesium metal and peroxide at temperatures above in addition to superoxide and several brightly coloured suboxides have also been studied these include dark green cso as well as latter may be heated in a vacuum to generate binary compounds with sulfur selenium and tellurium also exist isotopes caesium has 39 known isotopes ranging in mass number i e number of nucleons in nucleus from 112 to 151 several of these are synthesized from lighter elements by slow neutron capture process s process inside old stars and by r process in supernova explosions only stable caesium isotope is 133cs with 78 neutrons although it has a large nuclear spin nuclear magnetic resonance studies can use this isotope at a resonating frequency of 11 7 mhz thumb decay of caesium 137 alt a graph showing energetics of caesium 137 nuclear spin i half life of about 30 years decay with a 94 6 probability it decays by a 512 kev beta emission into barium 137m i 11 2 t 2 this further decays by a 662 kev gamma emission with an 85 1 probability into barium 137 i alternatively caesium 137 may decay directly into barium 137 by a 0 4 probability beta emission radioactive 135cs has a very long half life of about 2 3 million years longest of all radioactive isotopes of caesium 137cs and 134cs have half lives of 30 and two years respectively 137cs decomposes to a short lived 137mba by beta decay and then to nonradioactive barium while 134cs transforms into directly isotopes with mass numbers of 129 131 132 and 136 have half lives between a day and two weeks while most of other isotopes have half lives from a few seconds to fractions of a second at least 21 metastable nuclear isomers exist other than with a half life of just under 3 hours all are very unstable and decay with half lives of a few minutes or less isotope 135cs is one of long lived fission products of uranium produced in nuclear reactors however this fission product yield is reduced in most reactors because predecessor is a potent neutron poison and frequently transmutes to stable 136xe before it can decay to 135cs beta decay from 137cs to 137mba is a strong emission of gamma radiation 137cs and 90sr are principal medium lived products of nuclear fission and prime sources of radioactivity from spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling lasting several hundred years those two isotopes are largest source of residual radioactivity in area of chernobyl disaster because of low capture rate disposing of 137cs through neutron capture is not feasible and only current solution is to allow it to decay over time almost all caesium produced from nuclear fission comes from beta decay of originally more neutron rich fission products passing through various isotopes of iodine and xenon because iodine and xenon are volatile and can diffuse through nuclear fuel or air radioactive caesium is often created far from original site of fission with nuclear weapons testing in 1950s through 1980s 137cs was released into atmosphere and returned to surface of earth as a component of radioactive fallout it is a ready marker of movement of soil and sediment from those times occurrence thumb pollucite a caesium mineral alt a white mineral from which white and pale pink crystals protrude caesium is a relatively rare element estimated to average 3 parts per million in earth s crust it is 45th most abundant element and 36th among metals nevertheless it is more abundant than such elements as antimony cadmium tin and tungsten and two orders of magnitude more abundant than mercury and silver it is 3 3 as abundant as rubidium with which it is closely associated chemically due to its large ionic radius caesium is one of incompatible elements during magma crystallization caesium is concentrated in liquid phase and crystallizes last therefore largest deposits of caesium are zone pegmatite ore bodies formed by this enrichment process because caesium does not substitute for potassium as readily as rubidium does alkali evaporite minerals kcl and carnallite may contain only 0 002 caesium consequently caesium is found in few minerals percentage amounts of caesium may be found in beryl and up to 15 wt cs2o in closely related mineral cs up to 8 4 wt cs2o in rare mineral and less in more widespread only economically important ore for caesium is pollucite which is found in a few places around world in zoned pegmatites associated with more commercially important lithium minerals lepidolite and petalite within pegmatites large grain size and strong separation of minerals results in high grade ore for mining one of world s most significant and richest sources of caesium is tanco mine at bernic lake in manitoba canada estimated to contain 350 000 metric tons of pollucite ore representing more than two thirds of world s reserve base although stoichiometric content of caesium in pollucite is 42 6 pure pollucite samples from this deposit contain only about 34 caesium while average content is 24 wt commercial pollucite contains more than 19 caesium pegmatite deposit in zimbabwe is mined for its petalite but it also contains a significant amount of pollucite another notable source of pollucite is in desert namibia at present rate of world mine production of 5 to 10 metric tons per year reserves will last for thousands of years production mining and refining pollucite ore is a selective process and is conducted on a smaller scale than for most other metals ore is crushed hand sorted but not usually concentrated and then ground caesium is then extracted from pollucite primarily by three methods acid digestion alkaline decomposition and direct reduction in acid digestion silicate pollucite rock is dissolved with strong acids such as hydrochloric hcl sulfuric hbr or hydrofluoric hf acids with hydrochloric acid a mixture of soluble chlorides is produced and insoluble chloride double salts of caesium are precipitated as caesium antimony chloride caesium iodine chloride or caesium after separation pure precipitated double salt is decomposed and pure cscl is precipitated by evaporating water sulfuric acid method yields insoluble double salt directly as caesium alum aluminium sulfate component is converted to insoluble aluminium oxide by roasting alum with carbon and resulting product is leached with water to yield a solution roasting pollucite with calcium carbonate and calcium chloride yields insoluble calcium silicates and soluble caesium chloride leaching with water or dilute ammonia yields a dilute chloride cscl solution this solution can be evaporated to produce caesium chloride or transformed into caesium alum or caesium carbonate though not commercially feasible ore can be directly reduced with potassium sodium or calcium in vacuum can produce caesium metal directly most of mined caesium as salts is directly converted into caesium formate hcoo cs for applications such as oil drilling to supply developing market cabot corporation built a production plant in 1997 at tanco mine near bernic lake in manitoba with a capacity of per year of caesium formate solution primary smaller scale commercial compounds of caesium are caesium chloride and nitrate alternatively caesium metal may be obtained from purified compounds derived from ore caesium chloride and other caesium halides can be reduced at with calcium or barium and caesium metal distilled from result in same way aluminate carbonate or hydroxide may be reduced by magnesium metal can also be isolated by electrolysis of fused caesium cyanide exceptionally pure and gas free caesium can be produced by thermal decomposition of caesium azide which can be produced from aqueous caesium sulfate and barium azide in vacuum applications caesium dichromate can be reacted with zirconium to produce pure caesium metal without other gaseous products 2 2 2 price of 99 8 pure caesium metal basis in 2009 was about us 10 per gram 280 per ounce but compounds are significantly cheaper history thumb gustav kirchhoff left and robert bunsen centre discovered caesium with their newly invented spectroscope alt three middle aged men with one in middle sitting down all wear long jackets and shorter man on left has a beard in 1860 robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff discovered caesium in mineral water from germany because of bright blue lines in emission spectrum they derived name from latin word caesius meaning sky blue bunsen quotes aulus gellius noctes atticae ii 26 by autem caesia est quae ut ait de coeli quasi oxford english dictionary 2nd edition caesium was first element to be discovered with a spectroscope which had been invented by bunsen and kirchhoff only a year previously to obtain a pure sample of caesium of mineral water had to be evaporated to yield of concentrated salt solution alkaline earth metals were precipitated either as sulfates or oxalates leaving alkali metal in solution after conversion to nitrates and extraction with ethanol a sodium free mixture was obtained from this mixture lithium was precipitated by ammonium carbonate potassium rubidium and caesium form insoluble salts with chloroplatinic acid but these salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water and less soluble caesium and rubidium hexachloroplatinate cs rb were obtained by fractional crystallization after reduction of hexachloroplatinate with hydrogen caesium and rubidium were separated by difference in solubility of their carbonates in alcohol process yielded of rubidium chloride and of caesium chloride from initial 44 000 litres of mineral water from caesium chloride two scientists estimated atomic weight of new element at 123 35 compared to currently accepted one of 132 9 they tried to generate elemental caesium by electrolysis of molten caesium chloride but instead of a metal they obtained a blue homogeneous substance which neither under naked eye nor under microscope showed slightest trace of metallic substance as a result they assigned it as a subchloride in reality product was probably a colloidal mixture of metal and caesium chloride electrolysis of aqueous solution of chloride with a mercury cathode produced a caesium amalgam which readily decomposed under aqueous conditions pure metal was eventually isolated by german chemist carl while working on his doctorate with kekule and bunsen in 1882 he produced caesium metal by caesium cyanide avoiding problems with chloride historically most important use for caesium has been in research and development primarily in chemical and electrical fields very few applications existed for caesium until 1920s when it came into use in radio vacuum tubes where it had two functions as a getter it removed excess oxygen after manufacture and as a coating on heated cathode it increased electrical conductivity caesium was not recognized as a high performance industrial metal until 1950s applications for nonradioactive caesium included photoelectric cells photomultiplier tubes optical components of infrared spectrophotometers catalysts for several organic reactions crystals for scintillation counters and in magnetohydrodynamic power generators caesium also was and still is used as a source of positive ions in secondary ion mass spectrometry sims since 1967

duration of 9 192 631 770 cycles of microwave light absorbed or emitted by hyperfine transition of caesium 133 atoms in their ground state undisturbed by external fields applications petroleum exploration largest present day use of nonradioactive caesium is in caesium formate drilling fluids for extractive oil industry aqueous solutions of caesium formate hcoo cs made by reacting caesium hydroxide with formic acid were developed in mid 1990s for use as oil well drilling and completion fluids function of a drilling fluid is to lubricate drill bits to bring rock cuttings to surface and to maintain pressure on formation during drilling of well completion fluids assist emplacement of control hardware after drilling but prior to production by maintaining pressure high density of caesium formate brine up to 2 3 g cm3 or 19 2 pounds per gallon coupled with relatively benign nature of most caesium compounds reduces requirement for toxic high density suspended solids in drilling fluid a significant technological engineering and environmental advantage unlike components of many other heavy liquids caesium formate is relatively environment friendly caesium formate brine can be blended with potassium and sodium formates to decrease density of fluids to that of water 1 0 g cm3 or 8 3 pounds per gallon furthermore it is biodegradable and may be recycled which is important in view of its high cost about 4 000 per barrel in 2001 alkali formates are safe to handle and do not damage producing formation or downhole metals as corrosive alternative high density brines such as zinc bromide solutions sometimes do they also require less cleanup and reduce disposal costs atomic clocks thumb atomic clock ensemble at u s naval observatory alt a room with a black box in

caesium neutralizes space charge near cathode and enhances current flow caesium is also important for its photoemissive properties converting light to electron flow it is used in photoelectric cells because caesium based cathodes such as intermetallic compound have a low threshold voltage for emission of electrons range of photoemissive devices using caesium include optical character recognition devices photomultiplier tubes and video camera tubes nevertheless germanium rubidium selenium silicon tellurium and several other elements can be substituted for caesium in photosensitive materials

2007 cesium fluoride in encyclopedia of reagents for organic synthesis john wiley sons caesium salts sometimes replace potassium or sodium salts in organic synthesis such as cyclization esterification and polymerization caesium has also been used in radiation dosimetry tld when exposed to radiation it acquires crystal defects that when heated revert with emission of light proportionate to received dose thus measuring light pulse with a photomultiplier tube can allow accumulated radiation dose to be quantified nuclear and isotope applications caesium 137 is a radioisotope commonly used as a gamma emitter in industrial applications its advantages include a half life of roughly 30 years its availability from nuclear fuel cycle and having as a stable end product high water solubility is a disadvantage which makes it incompatible with large pool for food and medical supplies it has been used in agriculture cancer treatment and sterilization of food sewage sludge and surgical equipment radioactive isotopes of caesium in radiation devices were used in medical field to treat certain types of cancer but emergence of better alternatives and use of water soluble caesium chloride in sources which could create wide ranging contamination gradually put some of these caesium sources out of use caesium 137 has been employed in a variety of industrial measurement gauges including moisture density levelling and thickness gauges it has also been used in well logging devices for measuring electron density of rock formations which is analogous to bulk density of formations caesium 137 has been used in hydrologic studies analogous to those with tritium as a daughter product of fission bomb testing from 1950s through mid 1980s caesium 137 was released into atmosphere where it was absorbed readily into solution known year to year variation within that period allows correlation with soil and sediment layers caesium 134 and to a lesser extent caesium 135 have also been used in hydrology to measure caesium output by nuclear power industry while they are less prevalent than either caesium 133 or caesium 137 these bellwether isotopes are produced solely from anthropogenic

engines designed for spacecraft propulsion on very long interplanetary or extraplanetary missions fuel was ionized by contact with a charged tungsten electrode but corrosion by caesium on spacecraft

days after accident data from radiochemical manual and wilson b j 1966 radiochemical manual 2nd ed nonradioactive caesium compounds are only mildly toxic and nonradioactive caesium is not a significant environmental hazard because biochemical processes can confuse and substitute caesium with potassium excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia arrhythmia and acute cardiac arrest but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources median lethal dose ld50 for caesium chloride in mice is 2 3 g per kilogram which is comparable to ld50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride principal use of nonradioactive caesium is as caesium formate in petroleum drilling fluids because it is much less toxic than alternatives though it is more costly caesium metal is one of most reactive elements and is highly explosive in presence of water hydrogen gas produced by reaction is heated by thermal energy released at same time causing ignition and a violent explosion this can occur with other alkali metals but caesium is so potent that this explosive reaction can be triggered even by cold water it is highly pyrophoric autoignition temperature of caesium is 116 degc and it ignites explosively in air to form caesium hydroxide and various oxides caesium hydroxide is a very strong base and will rapidly corrode glass isotopes 134 and 137 are present in biosphere in small
