battle of finschhafen was part of huon peninsula campaign during world war ii and was fought between australian and japanese forces fighting took place between 22 september and 24 october 1943 following landing at scarlet beach which was followed by a two pronged advance on finschhafen as australian 20th infantry brigade advanced on town from north while 22nd infantry battalion drove from south having advanced from landing beaches east of lae after capture of finschhafen japanese forces in area withdrew towards sattelberg where they sought to hold australians before launching a counteroffensive which subsequently threatened landing beach this attack was repelled by american and australian forces with heavy casualties being inflicted on japanese in aftermath australians went on offensive capturing sattelberg and then advancing towards wareo plateau background finschhafen had been occupied by imperial japanese army on 10 march 1942 as part of strategic moves to provide protection to lae which they had established as an important air base throughout early 1943 allies had begun offensive operations in salamaua area of new guinea and following landing at nadzab and capture of lae in early september 1943 allies attempted to exploit their success with an advance to finschhafen to begin huon peninsula campaign operation to capture finschhafen was important to capture western cape of vitiaz strait for construction of airfields and naval facilities for upcoming new britain campaign as part of operation cartwheel responsibility for securing huon peninsula was assigned to major general george wootten s australian 9th division on 22 september australian 20th infantry brigade under command of brigadier victor windeyer supported by artillery from 2 12th field regiment as well as a field company of engineers and a field ambulance had landed at scarlet beach about north of finschhafen and proceeded to establish a beachhead there at same time 22nd infantry battalion an australian militia unit that had landed east of lae in early september to relieve troops holding beachhead began pursuing japanese that were withdrawing to east marching from hopoi mission station towards finschhafen with a view to placing pressure on japanese southern flank japanese had expected an allied assault on finschhafen region from around late july 1943 having appreciated its significance in relation to vitiaz and dampier straits japanese eighteenth army commander lieutenant general hatazo adachi had begun moving forces into region majority of these were drawn from 20th division which dispatched a force of about 2 800 men from madang in august these forces consisted of 80th infantry regiment one battalion of 26th field artillery regiment and 7th naval base force in addition following fall of lae elements of 41st division primarily 238th infantry regiment and 51st division s 102nd infantry regiment were also moved to area and were placed under command of major general eizo yamada commander of 1st shipping group total number of japanese in area was around 4 000 to 5 000 although allied intelligence estimated a strength of between 350 and 2 100 yamada s forces were spread out in a series of outposts that were orientated around a main defensive position established at sattelberg an abandoned lutheran mission situated atop a mountain that dominated terrain about north west of finschhafen japanese forces lacked transportation and road network had not been fully developed they were low on ammunition for all calibres of weapons especially artillery and majority of stores had to be carried by combat troops as local carriers had ceased working for japanese in response to allied propaganda following landing at scarlet beach yamada was ordered to launch an attack on australian forces in order to delay them so that further reinforcements could arrive from 20th division battle australian drive on finschhafen thumb right map showing capture of finschhafen after landing australians began establishing a beachhead several kilometres deep during which significant actions were fought around siki cove and katika late in day a large japanese air raid struck allied fleet off shore but this was eventually defeated by a strong us fighter umbrella that was forewarned by allied picket ships following day 23 september 20th brigade s drive on finschhafen began with two battalions commencing advance south 2 13th and 2 15th supported by 2 12th field regiment as well as engineers from 2 3rd field company while 2 17th was split up with two companies advancing as part of brigade s reserve while another remained to secure beachhead from a japanese attack and push it further to north and fourth pushed towards sattelberg 2 3rd pioneer battalion remained in beachhead working to improve roads while 2 8th field ambulance set up a main dressing station which would receive casualties as they were evacuated rearwards from advanced dressing station that was following battalions advancing south in addition to having to split their forces australians also suffered from supply difficulties during advance terrain over southerly approaches was quite difficult being primarily dense jungle with numerous water crossings and rugged features to traverse ground australians had only limited vehicles with each infantry battalion possessing four jeeps with trailers for resupply while engineers and artillery had several trucks and tractors local population which might have been employed to carry stores had abandoned japanese due to allied propaganda and their services were also unavailable to allies at initial stages of campaign as a result a large amount of stores had to be carried by combat soldiers who were diverted to task nevertheless australian advance succeeded in capturing heldsbach plantation and nearby airfield it continued until australians came up against strong resistance around bumi river there a force of around 300 japanese sailors and marines from 85th naval garrison reinforced by elements of 238th infantry regiment established themselves in a blocking position although they were under orders to conform to overall japanese plan of delaying australians and then withdrawing towards sattelberg to carry out a containment operation commander of naval troops resolved to hold position and they subsequently held up australian advance on 26 september until they were overcome through an attack on their flanks by 2 15th infantry battalion in response to concerns about large number of japanese forces in area which had proven to be in larger numbers than allied intelligence had estimated windeyer requested reinforcements these were initially refused as us naval commanders baulked at idea of transporting another brigade to finschhafen due to risks involved and potential naval losses that might be incurred in addition allied higher headquarters under general douglas macarthur was operating under mistaken belief that japanese defending area were only very small in number when in actuality two forces were roughly equal in size with allied strength after landing being around 5 300 after much discussion amongst australian and us commands on 29 30 september 2 43rd infantry battalion arrived to relieve 2 17th south australians from 2 43rd were subsequently tasked with defending beachhead and surrounding areas including heldsbach area and were ordered to prepare for further actions around sisi and sattelberg heavy rain fell around this time and australian brigade commander was compelled to use combat troops to carry stores forward from landing zone to forward areas as motor transport was unable to transit primitive track system due to concerns about their western flank 2 17th extended australian perimeter towards jivevaneng establishing a company there but it subsequently came under attack on sattelberg road and west of katika on 25 and 26 september from japanese 80th infantry regiment which was trying to break through to heldsbach plantation on coast over course of several days company from 2 17th around jivevaneng held off six japanese attacks until relieved by 2 43rd infantry battalion on 30 september meanwhile concerned about their rear due to presence of a large number of japanese troops around sattelberg australians pushed cautiously to kakakog which saw heavy fighting at end of month resulting in around 100 japanese casualties as australians called in artillery fire and air attacks to soften up japanese defences prior to an attack by 2 13th infantry battalion supported by vickers machine guns from 2 15th from south 22nd infantry battalion advanced north against limited opposition on 1 october they crossed mape river adjacent to langemak bay while forward troops from 20th infantry brigade overwhelmed a japanese force around kakakog supported by artillery and air power killing between 80 and 100 defenders following this japanese began withdrawing from finschhafen and next day 20th infantry brigade reached their objective entering finschhafen in afternoon after overcoming limited resistance two forces married up following day as troops from 2 17th contacted 22nd this ended first phase of battle during operations to capture finschhafen australians lost 73 killed 285 wounded sickness also resulted in a further 391 evacuations japanese casualties were reported as heavy but allied intelligence assessed that a large number of japanese forces remained at large and had withdrawn west away from coast in preparation for further fighting in same time us forces from 532nd engineer boat and shore regiment lost eight killed and about 42 wounded mainly during landing operations around scarlet beach japanese counterattack following capture of finschhafen main part of australian 20th infantry brigade returned to scarlet beach due to intelligence that japanese were about to attack 2 13th and 22nd infantry battalions were left around finschhafen while 2 15th and 2 17th infantry battalions were re orientated to defend approaches to scarlet beach around jivevaneng east of sattelberg 2 43rd had taken up a blocking position and in early days of october fought a japanese attack by a battalion from 80th infantry regiment along coast road to a halt in an effort to shore up their western flank australian 2 17th infantry battalion pressed towards kumawa which was met with a fierce response from japanese on 5 october when their line of communication from west was threatened battalion continued to fight around jivevaneng and on 10 october they secured a piece of high ground called knoll by australians who subsequently defeated 12 attacks to take it back thumb left a machine gun team from australian 2 2nd machine gun battalion around scarlet beach october 1943 alt troops manning a vickers machine gun on a ridge overlooking a creek amidst a jungle setting on 10 11 october as it became apparent to allies that japanese were preparing for a major assault wootten and his headquarters landed at finschhafen along with remainder of brigadier bernard evans 24th infantry brigade that day bulk of japanese 20th division under shigeru katagiri arrived in area as size of japanese force facing australians increased to 12 000 nevertheless katagiri decided to hold off on launching his counterattack until stores and ammunition could be stockpiled in sufficient quantities meanwhile australian 24th infantry brigade was subsequently given responsibility for defence in depth around heldsbach plantation and arndt point while 20th infantry brigade defended around sattelberg road and mape river with 22nd infantry battalion on their southern flank around dreger harbour as troops from 20th infantry brigade attempted to push towards sattelberg 24th began patrol actions towards bonga during one of these patrols allies gained a significant intelligence boon when they discovered a japanese briefcase containing an operational order detailing plans for a coming counterattack in addition allies intercepted several japanese radio transmissions and deduced their intentions based upon reports of troop and ship movements this allowed australians to switch to a defensive strategy instead of continuing to push on towards sattelberg main japanese counterattack began on 16 october signalled by a large bonfire on sattelberg attack was conceptualised as a three pronged action involving a diversionary attack by elements of 79th infantry regiment to north from bonga a company level attack on scarlet beach from sea by elements of 79th with sugino craft raiding unit and a drive from sattelberg by remainder of 79th and 80th infantry regiments orientated upon two lines of advance one towards scarlet beach conforming with song river and other striking towards heldsbach advancing astride sattelberg road if successful it was intended that following a regrouping two infantry regiments would then clear finschhafen and langemak bay but japanese plans went awry from beginning northern diversion was easily overcome and failed to confuse australians into committing their reserves while central drive was launched too early in fact day before assault was scheduled to begin consequently undermining japanese attempts to achieve sufficient weight of forces to overcome defenders seaborne landing also suffered a significant setback when more than half of seven landing craft were destroyed by pt 128 and pt 194 on night of 8 9 october while on their way to landing beach they subsequently suffered heavy casualties during assault around beach with us and australian troops there mounting a stubborn defence beach was guarded by a bofors 40 mm gun of 10th light anti aircraft battery 2 pounder anti tank guns and machine guns of 2 28th and two 37 mm guns and two 50 calibre machine guns manned by us 532nd engineer boat and shore regiment one of 50 calibre machine guns manned by private nathan van noy assisted by corporal stephen popa engaged a group of japanese led by a bugler and two men with flame throwers a japanese hand grenade landed in their weapon pit shattering one of van noy s legs and wounding popa but they continued to fire another japanese grenade silenced them van noy was subsequently awarded medal of honor australians managed to hold key terrain around jivevaneng and katika from where allies employed their direct and indirect fire support to inflict heavy casualties nevertheless japanese achieved a degree of tactical success albeit briefly on 18 october a party of japanese broke through to siki cove where australian anti aircraft gunners and artillerymen were forced to fire over open sights and fight back with small arms after coming under fire from troops that had gotten under guns that night japanese cut 2 17th infantry battalion s supply route establishing a road block astride jivevaneng sattelberg road and cutting off australians defending jivevaneng 2 17th and a number of other australian units such as most of 2 3rd pioneer battalion as well as part of 2 28th became isolated behind japanese lines in order to keep them supplied emergency air drops of ammunition were flown in by pilots of no 4 squadron raaf presented with ambiguity of situation commander of 2 3rd pioneer battalion withdrew one of his outposts while brigadier bernard evans commander of 24th infantry brigade also contracted his position around beachhead and in doing so subsequently granted japanese prime position of katika australian divisional commander wootten was enraged by decision and subsequently lambasted his commander via radio in response 2 13th infantry battalion detached two companies from rear area security and sent them north while 2 28th infantry battalion launched a counterattack against japanese around katika which supported by artillery successfully regained position nevertheless largely fighting went in favour of allies and finally japanese assault ground to a halt despite forcing a contraction of australian forces defending beachhead on 21 october japanese withdrew from siki cove although fighting around katika continued for four more days as japanese attempted to retake it fierce resistance from 2 28th halted them and eventually attack was called off on 24 october with japanese having suffered heavily due to tactical deficiencies poor co ordination and operational security and a lack of artillery meanwhile allied response was hampered by poor working relationships at some of highest levels between australian and us commanders particularly between i corps commander lieutenant general edmund herring and vii amphibious force commander rear admiral daniel e barbey lack of a unified command structure over amongst naval staff and a poor appreciation of overall japanese strength and intentions by highest level of allied command who failed to send reinforcements until it was almost too late casualties during attack amounted to at least 679 japanese killed with another 821 estimated as wounded while australians lost 49 killed and 179 wounded aftermath thumb wrecked japanese barges at scarlet beach following a failed japanese attack 17 october 1943 alt two soldiers walk along a beach beside wrecked remains of a number of barges following conclusion of fighting around finschhafen and defeat of japanese counterattack allies began preparing for a concerted assault on japanese main defensive position around sattelberg in wake of japanese counterattack members of australian and american staff began working more closely together and reinforcements were quickly approved in form of 26th infantry brigade under command of brigadier david whitehead as well as a squadron of matilda tanks from 1st tank battalion whose presence australians sought to keep secret for as long as possible which were landed at langemak bay supplies were landed by us troops from 532nd engineer boat and shore regiment and then brought up and cached around jivevaneng and kumawa but heavy rain hampered australian efforts until mid november australians subsequently were able to reduce and then secure japanese strong hold around sattelberg against determined resistance following a hard slog through dense jungle working in concert with matilda tanks elsewhere further actions were planned with 7th division preparing to advance through markham and ramu valleys as part of inland advance towards shaggy ridge and then north coast in order to cut off japanese withdrawal route from huon peninsula this drive would ultimately be unsuccessful in preventing bulk of japanese forces on huon peninsula from escaping at same time once sattelberg was secured a simultaneous drive was undertaken to clear wareo plateau which provided good observation towards scarlet beach as well as serving as a junction for japanese lines of communication south once wareo was secure allies advanced along coast towards sio while us forces landed at saidor to follow up withdrawing japanese nevertheless us and australian forces would come up against same forces throughout remainder of war around madang and aitape wewak finschhafen was subsequently developed into one of largest bases in southwest pacific area according to garth pratten throughout 1944 base saw considerable development with establishment of a staging camp that had a divisional capacity a wharf ramps for tank landing ships lsts ramps and piers in addition several airfields were established capable of hosting both fighter and bomber aircraft as well as several fuel dumps from finschhafen allies were able to project air power towards main japanese base at rabaul and seal off vitiaz and dampier straits in addition base became an important logistics hub playing an important role in supplying american war machine as it advanced through philippines in 1944 1945 in 1961 battle honour finschhafen was awarded to australian army units that had been involved in capture of finschhafen covering period 22 september to 8 december 1943 it includes capture of scarlet beach defence of scarlet beach and fighting for sattelberg although separate battle honours were also awarded for these actions references bibliography category south west pacific theatre of world war ii category battles of world war ii involving australia category conflicts
