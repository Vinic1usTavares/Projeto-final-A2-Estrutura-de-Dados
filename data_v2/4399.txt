statue of james ii is an outdoor bronze sculpture located in front garden of national gallery at trafalgar square in london united kingdom probably inspired by french statues of same period it depicts james ii of england as a roman emperor wearing roman armour and a laurel wreath traditionally awarded to a victorious roman commander it originally also depicted him holding a baton it was produced by workshop of grinling gibbons though most likely by notable sculptor from brussels peter van dievoet and laurence vandermeulen from mechelen and not gibbons himself statue has been relocated several times since it was first erected in grounds of old palace of whitehall in 1686 only two years before james ii was deposed description statue is executed in bronze and depicts james ii as a roman emperor he is shown standing in a pose and pointing downwards in great ease of attitude and a certain serenity of air as allan cunningham described it it formerly held a baton in its right hand though this is now missing face is said to be an excellent depiction of king unusually for time gibbons sought a degree of fidelity to original classical styles james is depicted wearing a laurel wreath on top of short hair whereas other imperial style statues of both charles ii and james ii depicted two kings with an anachronistic combination of roman armour and a 17th century periwig statue was probably inspired by similar imperial portrayals of louis xiv of france one in particular a colossal statue by martin desjardins of louis xiv wearing roman armour with a laurel wreath and baton is so similar in type to figures of charles ii and james ii that it may have been their direct inspiration plinth is inscribed with legend jacobus secundus dei gratia angliae scotiae franciae et hiberniae rex fidei defensor anno m d c lxxxvi which translates to james ii by grace of god king of england scotland france and ireland defender of faith 1686 history thumb left privy gardens of palace of
