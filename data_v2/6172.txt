daisy in her debut rather than series standard damsel in distress princess peach when jumped on koopa shells explode after a small delay mario throws bouncing balls rather than fireballs referred to as in manual 1 up mushroom power ups are depicted as hearts and level end flagpoles are replaced with a platforming challenge compared to super mario bros which contains 32 levels subdivided into 8 worlds with 4 levels each super mario land is smaller with 12 levels subdivided into 4 worlds with 3 levels each there are five unique bosses one at end of each of four worlds and a fifth and final boss being tatanga who appears when fourth boss is defeated first three bosses may be destroyed with projectiles or player may move past them to exit without destroying them first last level has no regular exit and two bosses at end of that level must be destroyed with projectiles to complete level and game some elements recur from previous mario games such as blocks suspended in midair moving platforms that must be used to traverse pitfalls pipes that lead to other areas collectible coins that grant an extra life when 100 are collected and goomba enemies after player has completed game they may play through again on a harder mode in which levels are same apart from enemies being more numerous if player completes harder mode game allows player to start another play on any level in game development thumb upright mario creator shigeru miyamoto was famously hands off in first portable mario game s development super mario land was developed by nintendo r d1 and published by nintendo in 1989 as a launch title for their game boy handheld console nintendo ceo hiroshi yamauchi believed that fun games sold consoles so when company created game boy handheld console he wanted a fun game that would feature nintendo s mascot mario and subsequently sell consoles job fell to nintendo r d1 a development team led by game boy inventor gunpei yokoi yokoi had previously created game watch series and worked with his protege shigeru miyamoto on game that invented mario donkey kong super mario land was fourth super mario title first portable mario game and first in series to be made without miyamoto absent miyamoto s direction development team used elements new and inconsistent with series as super mario land shrunk elements of series to fit portable device s small screen yokoi head of r d1 served as producer and satoru okada served as director they had previously developed metroid 1986 and kid icarus 1986 together and two subsequently designed game boy yokoi on its industrial design and okada on its engineering their super mario land was planned as portable console s showcase title until henk rogers brought tetris to nintendo of america and convinced minoru arakawa that addictive computer game would help nintendo reach largest audience company subsequently chose to bundle tetris with every game boy purchase game boy was released in japan in april 1989 north america in july and europe in september 1990 and super mario land was a launch title game s official first release was on april 21 1989 in japan and its north american release followed in august about 22 years later super mario land was released for nintendo 3ds via virtual console on june 6 2011 as one of its opening titles its added features include an increased size about 60 percent zoom and an optional shades of green color palette to match effect of original game boy s monochrome reception critics saw super mario land as a smaller and shorter version of super mario bros ign s lucas thomas wrote that protagonist enemies and overall game were shorter and noted that mario himself was just 12 pixels in height on game boy s small screen with this in mind thomas was concerned about player eyestrain in rereleases of game still ign s levi buchanan thought game made no compromises in its size reduction at time of its release in 1989 reviewers were excited to have a portable mario game paul rand of computer and video games called game an arcade machine in your pocket and graphics remarkable for their size french games magazine player one felt that super mario land adequately compromised where necessary to bring mario to a portable device electronic gaming monthly steve harris considered game fantastic and very fun to play albeit short ed semrad and donn nauert of same outlet both declared super mario land easily best game boy cart of time complex gus turner wrote that graphics were simple and official nintendo magazine said game was ridiculously short eurogamer reported that game could be finished in under an hour complex gus turner wrote that game had fun and difficulty associated with series and tony mott of said game proved that nintendo s game boy had playability to match its competitors matt regan of mean machines agreed playability to nth degree british magazines mean machines and games machine both commented on game s number of secrets to find eurogamer chris schilling called hirokazu tanaka s soundtrack surely one of all time greats and official nintendo magazine said it was among greatest videogame music ever composed player one eurogamer and complex too complimented music player one further pronounced super mario land a masterpiece pinnacle of portable video gaming following game boy s overnight success super mario land sold over 18 million copies more than that of super mario bros 3 legacy thumb upright 455 super mario land was a launch title for game boy in 1989 game began a super mario land series of portable mario games super mario land 2 6 golden coins added a non linear overworld and introduced wario an evil version of mario as game s villain subsequent wario land super mario land 3 began wario franchise after 19 years 2011 title super mario 3d land for nintendo 3ds became mario s first game in stereoscopic 3d audrey drake of ign argued that both wario land and super mario 3d land were not legitimate sequels and wrote that latter felt more like super mario bros 3 with mario galaxy influences than a successor to super mario land 2 superball flower appears in super mario maker 2 as an unlockable power up item usable only in super mario bros style super mario land is remembered for its miniaturized super mario elements and twist on just about every mario mainstay imaginable many of its new elements did not recur later in series making super mario land strange compared to rest of series or what ign s thomas described as a singular oddball ign s marc nix felt retrospectively that super mario land was only uninspired mario game with funky voids of white and ufos instead of strikingly original mushroom kingdom mean machines was also put off by alien theme easy difficulty and dot matrix screen blur ign s travis fahs wrote that game was comparatively not as ambitious as super mario bros 3 mean machines felt as if it was not a true mario game not worth its originally high review score and in retrospect not really a classic glen fox of nintendo life agreed writing that it was an impressive achievement at time but did not age as well as other mario games eurogamer schilling wrote that mario felt different lighter with more friction and that game felt radical and distinctive for risks it took ign s thomas cited out of place gameplay elements like shooter levels exploding koopa shells non extinguishing fireballs and non princess peach plot as departures from series thomas attributed this to mario creator miyamoto s lack of involvement in game s development which he described as famously hands off schilling of eurogamer instead blamed game boy s technical limitations but he too was perplexed by new sphinx seahorse and moai head enemies and considered exploding koopa shells a cruel trick disdainful of series core gameplay super mario land shooter levels new to series were not revisited in subsequent series games and subsequent series games such as super mario land 2 both dropped original s tiny scale and chose classic fire flower fireballs over first installment s bouncing balls game was included in multiple rankings of top game boy games and official nintendo magazine listed it at 73 in its top 100 nintendo games after her debut in super mario land princess daisy appears in later mario series sports and racing games notes references external links category
