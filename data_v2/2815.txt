witcham gravel helmet is a roman auxiliary cavalry helmet from first century ad only decorative copper alloy casing remains an iron core originally fit under casing but has now corroded away cap neck guard and cheek guards were originally tinned giving appearance of a silver helmet encircled by a gold band helmet s distinctive feature is presence of three hollow bosses out of an original six that decorate exterior no other roman helmet is known to have such a feature they may be a decorative embellishment influenced by etruscan helmets from sixth century bc which had similar lead filled bosses that would have deflected blades helmet was discovered during peat digging in parish of witcham gravel cambridgeshire perhaps during 1870s it was said to have been found at a depth of about four feet although exact findspot within witcham gravel is unknown at time parish comprised about 389 acres helmet was first published in 1877 when owned by thomas maylin vipan it was exhibited to society of antiquaries of london when vipan died in 1891 british museum purchased it from his estate it remains in museum s collection and as of 2019 is on view in room 49 description helmet primarily comprises eight components a skull cap a brow piece an occiput a neck guard two raised ear protectors and two cheek guards of which one remains surviving pieces are made of copper alloy cap neck guard and cheek guards were tinned creating appearance of a gold band surrounding a silver helmet originally they were attached to an iron core by two rivets on either side six along neck guard and one split pin at front and at back but iron now remains only as corrosion surviving pieces of helmet are almost entirely decorative and would have imparted very little protection by themselves they are made of thin metal proving an easy medium for repousse work four semicircular designs were made with repousse punch marks two each on brow piece and occiput lines of repousse work were also punched across join between neck guard and occiput and at top of occiput and brow piece unique feature of helmet not known on any other roman helmet is presence of three hollow bosses on neck guard these were both soldered and riveted on latter attachments would also help hold copper alloy components to iron core circular remnants suggest that other bosses were placed above each ear and over split pin at front five small bosses were likewise riveted to ornate cheek guards already featuring depicting naturalistic ears none of these bosses survive although their impressions remain helmet would have also had a crest markings at apex of skull cap indicate former presence of a crest box long by wide joined by six rivets two each at front centre and back box would have been made of organic materials such as wood filled with horsehair and has since decayed discovery thumb alt colour photograph showing a small river on left and grass with a cottage on right approximate findspot of helmet alongside new

hemispherical helmet with deep brim bosses on witcham gravel helmet recall similar features on etruscan helmets from around sixth century bc helmet was likely produced around third quarter of first century ad based on size and steep angle of neck guard it is broadly classified as an auxiliary cavalry helmet type b according to typology put forward by h russell robinson it is sole surviving example of type b helmets though similar to type a helmets which are hemispherical with recesses for ears and small neck flanges extending from occiput it has a larger sloping neck guard although bosses on helmet have no known roman parallel their origin may trace to etruscan helmets from around sixth century bc examples from near region of adriatic coast and now found in metropolitan museum of art university of pennsylvania museum of archaeology and anthropology and british museum have similar bosses these examples are filled with lead which would have helped deflect blades bosses on
