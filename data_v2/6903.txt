copernicium is a synthetic chemical element with symbol cn and atomic number 112 its known isotopes are extremely radioactive and have only been created in a laboratory most stable known isotope copernicium 285 has a half life of approximately 28 seconds copernicium was first created in 1996 by gsi helmholtz centre for heavy ion research near darmstadt germany it is named after astronomer nicolaus copernicus in periodic table of elements copernicium is a d block transactinide element and a group 12 element during reactions with gold it has been shown to be an extremely volatile substance so much so that it is possibly a gas or a volatile liquid at standard temperature and pressure copernicium is calculated to have several properties that differ from its lighter homologues in group 12 zinc cadmium and mercury due to relativistic effects it may give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones and it may have more similarities to noble gases such as radon rather than its group 12 homologues copernicium has also been calculated to possibly show oxidation state 4 while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all it has also been predicted to be more difficult to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than other group 12 elements and indeed copernicium is expected to be most noble metal on periodic table solid copernicium is expected to be bound mostly by dispersion forces like noble gases predictions on its band structure are varied ranging from a noble metal to a semiconductor or even an insulator history discovery copernicium was first created on february 9 1996 at gesellschaft fur schwerionenforschung gsi in darmstadt germany by sigurd hofmann victor ninov et al this element was created by firing accelerated zinc 70 nuclei at a target made of lead 208 nuclei in a heavy ion accelerator a single atom a second was reported but was found to have been based on data fabricated by ninov of copernicium was produced with a mass number of 277 pb zn cn cn n in may 2000 gsi successfully repeated experiment to synthesize a further atom of copernicium 277 this reaction was repeated at riken using search for a super heavy element using a gas filled recoil separator set up in 2004 and 2013 to synthesize three further atoms and confirm decay data reported by gsi team this reaction had also previously been tried in 1971 at joint institute for nuclear research in dubna russia to aim for produced in 2n channel but without success iupac iupap joint working party jwp assessed claim of copernicium s discovery by gsi team in 2001 and 2003 in both cases they found that there was insufficient evidence to support their claim this was primarily related to contradicting decay data for known nuclide rutherfordium 261 however between 2001 and 2005 gsi team studied reaction 248cm 26mg 5n and were able to confirm decay data for hassium 269 and rutherfordium 261 it was found that existing data on rutherfordium 261 was for an isomer now designated rutherfordium in may 2009 jwp reported on claims of discovery of element 112 again and officially recognized gsi team as discoverers of element 112 this decision was based on confirmation of decay properties of daughter nuclei as well as confirmatory experiments at riken work had also been done at joint institute for nuclear research in dubna russia from 1998 to synthesise heavier isotope 283cn in hot fusion reaction 238u 48ca 3n 283cn most observed atoms of 283cn decayed by spontaneous fission although an alpha decay branch to was detected while initial experiments aimed to assign produced nuclide with its observed long half life of 3 minutes based on its chemical behaviour this was found to be not mercury like as would have been expected copernicium being under mercury in periodic table and indeed now it appears that long lived activity might not have been from 283cn at all but its electron capture daughter instead with a shorter 4 second half life associated with 283cn another possibility is assignment to a metastable isomeric state while later cross bombardments in 242pu 48ca and 48ca reactions succeeded in confirming properties of 283cn and its parents 287fl and and played a major role in acceptance of discoveries of flerovium and livermorium elements 114 and 116 by jwp in 2011 this work originated subsequent to gsi s work on 277cn and priority was assigned to gsi naming thumb upright left alt a painted portrait of copernicus nicolaus copernicus who formulated a heliocentric model with planets orbiting around sun replacing ptolemy s earlier geocentric model 185x185px using mendeleev s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements copernicium should be known as eka mercury in 1979 iupac published recommendations according to which element was to be called with corresponding symbol of a systematic element name as a placeholder until element was discovered and discovery then confirmed and a permanent name was decided on although widely used in chemical community on all levels from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in field who either called it element 112 with symbol of 112 or even simply 112 after acknowledging gsi team s discovery iupac asked them to suggest a permanent name for element 112 on 14 july 2009 they proposed copernicium with element symbol cp after nicolaus copernicus to honor an outstanding scientist who changed our view of world during standard six month discussion period among scientific community about naming it was pointed out that symbol cp was previously associated with name cassiopeium cassiopium now known as lutetium lu for this reason iupac disallowed use of cp as a future symbol prompting gsi team to put forward symbol cn as an alternative on 19 february 2010 anniversary of copernicus birth iupac officially accepted proposed name and symbol isotopes copernicium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in laboratory either by fusing two atoms or by observing decay of heavier elements seven different isotopes have been reported with mass numbers 277 and 281 286 and one unconfirmed metastable isomer in 285cn has been reported most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay but some undergo spontaneous fission and copernicium 283 may have an electron capture branch isotope copernicium 283 was instrumental in confirmation of discoveries of elements flerovium and livermorium half lives all confirmed copernicium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive in general heavier isotopes are more stable than lighter most stable known isotope 285cn has a half life of 29 seconds 283cn has a half life of 4 seconds and unconfirmed and 286cn have half lives of about 15 and 8 45 seconds respectively other isotopes have half lives shorter than one second and 284cn both have half lives on order of 0 1 seconds and other two isotopes have half lives slightly under one millisecond it is predicted that heavy isotopes 291cn and 293cn may have half lives longer than a few decades for they are predicted to lie near center of theoretical island of stability and may have been produced in r process and be detectable in cosmic rays though they would be about 10 12 times as abundant as lead lightest isotopes of copernicium have been synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products except for 277cn which is not known to be a decay product while heavier isotopes are only known to be produced by decay of heavier nuclei heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is 283cn three heavier isotopes 284cn 285cn and 286cn have only been observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers in 1999 american scientists at university of california berkeley announced that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of 293og these parent nuclei were reported to have successively emitted three alpha particles to form copernicium 281 nuclei which were claimed to have undergone alpha decay emitting alpha particles with decay energy 10 68 mev and half life 0 90 ms but their claim was retracted in 2001 this isotope however was produced in 2010 by same team new data contradicted previous fabricated at lawrence berkeley physicists say a colleague took them for a ride george johnson new york times 15 october 2002 data predicted properties chemical copernicium is tenth and last member of 6d series and is heaviest group 12 element in periodic table below zinc cadmium and mercury it is predicted to differ significantly from lighter group 12 elements valence s subshells of group 12 elements and period 7 elements are expected to be relativistically contracted most strongly at copernicium this and closed shell configuration of copernicium result in it probably being most noble metal on periodic table with a predicted standard reduction potential of 2 1 v for cn2 cn couple in comparison that for au couple of gold is 1 5 v with a predicted first ionization energy of 1155 kj mol that almost matches that of noble gas xenon at 1170 4 kj mol its metallic bonds should also be very weak possibly making it extremely volatile like noble gases and potentially making it gaseous at room temperature chemistry on islands of stability new scientist 11 september 1975 p 574 issn 1032 1233 however it should be able to form metal metal bonds with copper palladium platinum silver and gold these bonds are predicted to be only about 15 20 kj mol weaker than analogous bonds with mercury in opposition to earlier suggestion ab initio calculations at high level of accuracy predicted that chemistry of singly valent copernicium resembles that of mercury rather than that of noble gases latter result can be explained by huge spin orbit interaction which significantly lowers energy of vacant 7p1 2 state of copernicium once copernicium is ionized its chemistry may present several differences from those of zinc cadmium and mercury due to stabilization of 7s electronic orbitals and destabilization of 6d ones caused by relativistic effects cn2 is likely to have a rn electronic configuration using 6d orbitals before 7s one unlike its homologues fact that 6d electrons participate more readily in chemical bonding means that once copernicium is ionized it may behave more like a transition metal than its lighter homologues especially in possible 4 oxidation state in aqueous solutions copernicium may form 2 and perhaps 4 oxidation states diatomic ion featuring mercury in 1 oxidation state is well known but ion is predicted to be unstable or even non existent copernicium ii fluoride cnf2 should be more unstable than analogous mercury compound mercury ii fluoride hgf2 and may even decompose spontaneously into its constituent elements in polar solvents copernicium is predicted to preferentially form and anions rather than analogous neutral fluorides cnf4 and cnf2 respectively although analogous bromide or iodide ions may be more stable towards hydrolysis in aqueous solution anions and should also be able to exist in aqueous solution nevertheless more recent experiments have cast doubt on possible existence of hgf4 and indeed some calculations suggest that both hgf4 and cnf4 are actually unbound and of doubtful existence formation of thermodynamically stable copernicium ii and iv fluorides would be analogous to chemistry of xenon analogous to mercury ii cyanide hg cn 2 copernicium is expected to form a stable cyanide cn cn 2 physical and atomic copernicium should be a dense metal with a density of 14 0 g cm3 in liquid state at 300 k this is similar to known density of mercury which is 13 534 g cm3 solid copernicium at same temperature should have a higher density of 14 7 g cm3 this results from effects of copernicium s higher atomic weight being cancelled out by its larger interatomic distances compared to mercury some calculations predicted copernicium to be a gas at room temperature which would make it first gaseous metal in periodic table second being flerovium eka lead due to closed shell electron configurations of copernicium and flerovium kratz jens volker impact of superheavy elements on chemical and physical sciences 4th international conference on chemistry and physics of transactinide elements 5 11 september 2011 sochi russia a 2019 calculation agrees with these predictions on role of relativistic effects suggesting that copernicium will be a volatile liquid bound by dispersion forces under standard conditions its melting point is estimated at and its boiling point at latter in agreement with experimentally estimated value of atomic radius of copernicium is expected to be around 147 pm due to relativistic stabilization of 7s orbital and destabilization of 6d orbital cn and cn2 ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons which is opposite of behavior of its lighter homologues in addition to relativistic contraction and binding of 7s subshell 6d5 2 orbital is expected to be destabilized due to spin orbit coupling making it behave similarly to 7s orbital in terms of size shape and energy predictions of expected band structure of copernicium are varied calculations in 2007 expected that copernicium may therefore be a semiconductor with a band gap of around 0 2 ev crystallizing in hexagonal close packed crystal structure however calculations in 2017 and 2018 suggested that copernicium should be a noble metal at standard conditions with a body centered cubic crystal structure it should hence have no band gap like mercury although density of states at fermi level is expected to be lower for copernicium than for mercury 2019 calculations then suggested that in fact copernicium has a large band gap of 6 4 0 2 v which is similar to that of noble gas radon 7 1 v and would make it an insulator bulk copernicium is predicted by these calculations to be bound mostly by dispersion forces like noble gases like mercury radon and flerovium but not oganesson eka radon copernicium is calculated to have no electron affinity experimental atomic gas phase chemistry interest in copernicium s chemistry was sparked by predictions that it would have largest relativistic effects in whole of period 7 and group 12 and indeed among all 118 known elements copernicium is expected to have ground state electron configuration rn 5f14 7s2 and thus should belong to group 12 of periodic table according to aufbau principle as such it should behave as heavier homologue of mercury and form strong binary compounds with noble metals like gold experiments probing reactivity of copernicium have focused on adsorption of atoms of element 112 onto a gold surface held at varying temperatures in order to calculate an adsorption enthalpy owing to relativistic stabilization of 7s electrons copernicium shows radon like properties experiments were performed with simultaneous formation of mercury and radon radioisotopes allowing a comparison of adsorption characteristics first chemical experiments on copernicium were conducted using 238u 48ca 3n 283cn reaction detection was by spontaneous fission of claimed parent isotope with half life of 5 minutes analysis of data indicated that copernicium was more volatile than mercury and had noble gas properties however confusion regarding synthesis of copernicium 283 has cast some doubt on these experimental results given this uncertainty between april may 2006 at jinr a psi team conducted experiments probing synthesis of this isotope as a daughter in nuclear reaction 242pu 48ca 3n 287fl 242pu 48ca fusion reaction has a slightly larger cross section than 238u 48ca reaction so that best way to produce copernicium for chemical experimentation is as an overshoot product as daughter of flerovium in this experiment two atoms of copernicium 283 were unambiguously identified and adsorption properties were interpret to show that copernicium is a more volatile homologue of mercury due to formation of a weak metal metal bond with gold this agrees with general indications from some relativistic calculations that copernicium is more or less homologous to mercury however it was pointed out in 2019 that this result may simply be due to strong dispersion interactions in april 2007 this experiment was repeated and a further three atoms of copernicium 283 were positively identified adsorption property was confirmed and indicated that copernicium has adsorption properties in agreement with being heaviest member of group 12 these experiments also allowed first experimental estimation of copernicium s boiling point 84 degc so that it may be a gas at standard conditions because lighter group 12 elements often occur as ores experiments were conducted in 2015 to deposit copernicium atoms on a selenium surface to form copernicium selenide reaction of copernicium atoms with trigonal selenium to form a selenide was observed with t se 48 kj mol with kinetic hindrance towards selenide formation being lower for copernicium than for mercury this was unexpected as stability of group 12 selenides tends to decrease down group from znse to while it increases down group for group 14 selenides from gese to see also
