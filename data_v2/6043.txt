december 7 2010 on january 25 2011 song was re released for urban radio adds composition raining men is a hip hop song with a shiny trap beat that lasts for a duration of 3 44 3 minutes 44 seconds song is not a cover of weather girls song it s raining men composed by paul jabara and paul shaffer however it is based on it with regard to its lyrical content and does sample it instrumentation consists of sirens and mind melting bass song is written in key of and is set in simple time with a moderated hip hop groove with a metronome of 80 beats per minute raining mens composition was likened to work of m i a by emily mckay for nme stacey anderson for spin commented on minaj s vocal of word really writing that she projects word as a breathless contortion into its own fully demented sideshow with regard to fast speed in which minaj raps james reed for boston globe described minaj s verse as a manic guest rhyme rihanna s vocal range in song spans from low note of g3 to high note of b4 according to jon pareles for new york times songs lyrics revolve around rihanna and minaj singing and rapping about an endless supply of available men lyrically kevin o donnell of spin described song as rihanna and minaj s own female empowerment anthem critical reception song was met with mixed reviews from music critics jon pareles and jon caramanica of new york times commented that rihanna shares mechanized chattering beat of raining men with nicki minaj singing and rapping about an endless supply of available men stacey anderson of spin commented that song is highlight of album calling it a gloriously eccentric collaboration with nicki minaj that their minor key hyperventilating air sirens dissolving into mind melting bass and scene stealing minaj s breathless contortion of simple word really into its own fully demented sideshow bbc music also commended minaj s presence on song saying that nicki minaj makes for a superb partner in crime on raining men her wild kinetic flow complementing rihanna s steely delivery to wicked effect jim farber for new york daily news said that rihanna pairs just as well with nicki minaj on a complete tear down on old weather girls disco standard it s raining men here it s not a gay song of lust but a statement of assurance that no man should incite too much worry considering their sheer numbers chris richards of washington post said that nicki minaj a quick witted rapper able to assume voices of a dozen characters in a single song fails to impart any wisdom on her colleague with raining men emily mackay of nme said that raining men is a bold collaboration between rihanna and minaj which plays to both of their strengths in hip pop collaboration august brown for los angeles times said that cheers drink to that and raining men as and spunky as they may be are such a turn from rated r that they come off as little more than image recalibration that s her prerogative as an artist and it s certainly earned but it underscores one thing we ve always wondered about rihanna what is she really feeling ryan dombal of pitchfork media was more critical of song commenting that raining men is a shameless beyonce rip off that would be quickly dismissed if not for fact that it s a pretty damn good beyonce rip off with a characteristically scene stealing guest verse from nicki minaj james reed of boston globe also noticed similarity between song s composition and work of american r b recording artist beyonce knowles saying raining men borrowing a digitized riff from beyonce s diva features rising rapper nicki minaj on a typically manic guest rhyme song s message doubles as album s mantra some cats really do have nine lives idolator reviewer becky bain praised minaj s infectious and energetic verse and felt song s rhythm fits nicki s quirkiness perfectly chart performance thumb right rihanna performing raining men on loud tour in oakland california upon release of loud raining men charted in south korea united
