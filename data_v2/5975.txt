evstafi class were a pair of pre dreadnought battleships of imperial russian navy built before world war i for black sea fleet they were slightly enlarged versions of with increased armour and more guns numerous alterations were made as a result of experience in russo japanese war of 1904 5 that seriously delayed completion of two ships they were most modern ships in black sea fleet when world war i began and formed core of fleet for first year of war before newer dreadnoughts entered service they forced german battlecruiser to disengage during battle of cape sarych shortly after russia declared war on ottoman empire in late 1914 both ships covered several bombardments of bosphorus fortifications in early 1915 including one where they were attacked by goeben but they managed to drive her off later evstafi and ioann zlatoust were relegated to secondary roles after first dreadnought entered service in late 1915 and were subsequently put into reserve in 1918 in sevastopol both ships were captured when germans took city in may 1918 and was turned over to allies after armistice in november 1918 their engines were destroyed in 1919 by british when they withdrew from sevastopol to prevent advancing bolsheviks from using them against white russians they were abandoned when whites evacuated crimea in 1920 and were scrapped in 1922 23 description general characteristics two evstafi class ships were long at waterline and long overall they had a beam of and a draught of they displaced only more than their designed displacement of mclaughlin 2003 p 147 evstafi class were slightly larger than potemkin being longer wider but displaced less ships had a double bottom from frames 18 to 82 they were divided into 10 main compartments by transverse watertight bulkheads they also had a centreline longitudinal bulkhead presumably separating engine rooms mclaughlin 2003 pp 116 147 149 propulsion evstafi class had two three cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines built by in nikolayev that had a total designed output of mclaughlin 2003 p 46 twenty two belleville water tube boilers provided steam to engines at a pressure of which drove two screw propellers on sea trials powerplant produced a total over and a top speed of they carried a maximum of of coal at full load that provided a range of at a speed of two steam powered dynamos were carried with a total output of 300 kw as well as two auxiliary dynamos rated at 64 kw each mclaughlin 2003 pp 148 151 52 armament main armament consisted of two pairs of 12 inch 40 calibre pattern 1895 guns mounted in hydraulically powered twin turrets fore and aft each turret had a firing arc of 260 degrees guns had a rate of fire of 40 seconds between rounds and 75 rounds per gun were carried mclaughlin 2003 pp 148 150 these guns had a maximum elevation of 35 degrees and could depress to 5 degrees they fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a range of at maximum elevation all four 50 calibre pattern 1905 guns were mounted in corners of superstructure in armoured casemates these guns had a firing arc of 120 degrees and could fire straight ahead or astern mclaughlin 2003 p 150 they had a range of elevation from 5 degrees to 20 degrees guns fired a high explosive shell that weighed at a muzzle velocity of at 19 5 degrees elevation it could range out to 110 rounds were stowed per gun dozen canet pattern 1892 45 calibre guns were mounted in lower casemates guns could elevate to a maximum of 20 degrees and depress to 5 degrees they fired shells that weighed with a muzzle velocity of they had a maximum range of when fired at maximum elevation ships carried 180 rounds per gun anti torpedo boat armament consisted of fourteen canet pattern 1892 50 calibre guns mounted in sponsons on upper deck protected by gun shields gun fired shells to a range of about at its maximum elevation of 21 degrees with a muzzle velocity of rate of fire was between 12 and 15 rounds per minute evstafi class carried two torpedo tubes on broadside aft mclaughlin 2003 p 151 these torpedoes carried a warhead of tnt it had two speed settings which gave it a maximum range of at or at protection evstafi class ships used krupp armour maximum thickness of waterline belt was which reduced to abreast magazines it covered about of ship s length belt was high including below waterline belt terminated in transverse bulkheads belt was extended to bow by armour plates thick and to stern by armour upper belt was six inches thick and was intended to protect gap between waterline belt and casemate casemate protected six and eight inch guns and was thick bulkheads separated each gun sides of turrets were thick and they had a roof their barbettes were also 10 inches thick although this was reduced to five inches where they were screened behind other armour two conning towers sides were in thickness with a roof decks ranged from in thickness construction construction of both ships began well before formal keel laying ceremony evstafi on 13 july dates used in this article are new style and ioann zlatoust on 13 july 1903 although working drawings and preliminary calculations were not approved until 31 may 1904 which caused some problems with ioann zlatoust progress was relatively quick despite disruptions caused by 1905 revolution and both ships were launched less than three years after work began fitting out however was considerably delayed by a number of changes made as navy digested lessons of russo japanese war maximum elevation of main guns was increased from 15 degree to 35 degrees number of torpedo tubes was reduced from five to two mine stowage was eliminated as were guns armour protection of waterline fore and aft of main belt was increased to prevent sort of damage that disabled several ships at battle of tsushima a second conning tower was added at rear of superstructure and its design was altered probably to eliminate overhanging top that deflected splinters into conning tower at battle of yellow sea and tsushima masts and their fighting tops were replaced by light pole masts and light booms replaced heavy boat cranes to save weight mclaughlin 2003 pp 147

sevastopol 13 november 1904 13 may 1906 1 april 1911 world war i evstafi as newest ship in black sea fleet was flagship of vice admiral andrei eberhardt for first year or so of world war i two weeks after russian declaration of war on ottoman empire on 2 november 1914 black sea fleet set out to bombard trebizond on 15 november force consisted of pre dreadnoughts evstafi ioann zlatoust and three cruisers escorted by three destroyers and 11 torpedo boats they did this successfully on morning of 17 november and then turned west to hunt for turkish shipping along anatolian coast before setting course for sevastopol later that afternoon following day while en route ships were intercepted by german battlecruiser goeben and light cruiser in what came to be known as battle of cape sarych despite noon hour conditions were foggy and capital ships initially did not spot each other black sea fleet had experimented on concentrating fire from several ships under control of a master ship before war and evstafi held her fire until ioann zlatoust master ship could see goeben when gunnery commands were finally received they showed a range over in excess of evstafis own estimate of so evstafi opened fire using her own data before goeben turned to unmask its broadside she scored a hit with her first salvo as a 12 inch shell partially penetrated armor casemate protecting one of goebens secondary guns it detonated some of ready use ammunition starting a fire that burnt out casemate and killed its crew mclaughlin 2003 pp 302 03 goeben returned fire shortly afterward and hit evstafi in middle funnel shell detonated after it passed through funnel and destroyed antennae for fire control radio which meant that evstafi could not correct ioann zlatousts inaccurate range data other ships either used ioann zlatousts incorrect data or never saw goeben and failed to register any hits on german ship goeben hit evstafi four more times although one shell failed to detonate before rear admiral wilhelm souchon decided to turn away and break contact after fourteen minutes of combat evstafi suffered 34 killed and 24 wounded from those hits and only fired between 12 and 16 twelve inch shells as well as 14 eight inch and 19 six inch shells ioann zlatoust fired only six shells from her main armament mclaughlin 2001 pp 131 33 several armour plates on evstafi required replacement after battle and they were taken from old pre dreadnought allowing repairs to be complete by 29 november mclaughlin 2001 p 132 on 9 january 1915 breslau and encountered russian fleet while returning from a bombardment mission in eastern part of black sea during a minor engagement breslau hit evstafis forward turret temporarily putting it out of action after which two cruisers escaped using their superior speed mclaughlin 2003 p 152 coast bombardment evstafi and ioann zlatoust served as covering force for several bombardment missions of bosphorus between 18 march and 9 may 1915 while two earlier bombardments were uneventful 9 may bombardment provoked a reaction as goeben intercepted russian battleships after they had been spotted by both forces turned on parallel courses and opened fire at range of and although neither side scored a hit goeben had multiple near misses on evstafi admiral eberhardt then ordered his ships to make only while goeben was making goeben was unable to cross t of russian ships despite its superior speed as they were continually turning this maneuver bought enough time that tri sviatitelia and pantelimon were able to rejoin other two ships before they could start shelling ottoman forts pantelimon then hit goeben twice before german ship broke contact after 22 minutes of firing with fleet assembled admiral eberhardt attempted to pursue german battlecruiser but was unsuccessful nekrasov pp 55 57 both ships were subsequently fitted with anti aircraft guns on top of each of their turrets during 1915 and screens were added on top of their funnels to keep out light bombs ioann zlatoust initially received four 75 millimetre guns but this was later altered to a pair of 75 mm guns and another pair of guns evstafi first received three 75 mm guns but these were later replaced by two 63 5 mm guns and a pair of guns mclaughlin 2003 p 310 on 1 august 1915 she and all other pre dreadnoughts were transferred to 2nd battleship brigade after dreadnought had entered service on 1 october new dreadnought provided cover while ioann zlatoust and pantelimon bombarded zonguldak and evstafi shelled nearby town of kozlu mclaughlin 2003 p 304 later both evstafi class ships participated in second bombardment of varna in may 1916 nekrasov pp 90 92 evstafi and ioann zlatoust were reduced to reserve in march 1918 in sevastopol immobile they were captured by germans there in may and handed over to allies following december british wrecked their engines between 22 24 april 1919 when they left crimea in order to prevent advancing bolsheviks from using them against white russians later they were captured by both sides during russian civil war but were abandoned by white russians when they evacuated crimea in november 1920 ships were then scrapped in 1922 23 although they were not stricken from navy list until 21 november 1925 footnotes citations references external links ship history on black sea fleet ship history on black sea fleet
