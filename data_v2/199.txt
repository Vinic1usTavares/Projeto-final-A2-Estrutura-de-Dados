and good execution and that it gave us good comedy as it had plenty to work with in regards to liz and dennis story he admitted that while it was funny it was fairly stereotypical canning commented that jack s relationship with condoleezza rice in episode was a great concept and offered up a good number of chuckles although it never became as clever as it appeared it was going to be canning gave episode a 6 5 out of 10 rating tv guide s matt mitovich was complimentary towards episode reporting now this is what i m talking about second tier cast integration multiple stories going on intimations that condoleezza rice likes phone sex another winning week for nbc s 30 rock mitovich enjoyed fact that jack was in a relationship with rice writing that another show would build whole episode around them but that 30 rock made it that much funnier by playing it in background and thus getting to be more outrageous with it julia ward of aol s tv squad wrote that alec baldwin always knocks ball out of park on acting front but noted that best material in this episode belonged to tracy and toofer story show does have a tendency to telegraph its punchlines but it was nice to have two men s differences resolved by finding funny in a star jones excessive vomiting sketch ward was complimentary towards jane krakowski observing that her comic timing in break up was impeccable as usual but it would be nice to see her character get a tad more three dimensional amy amatangelo of boston herald enjoyed dean winters appearances on show citing that he does a hilarious turn as dennis while houston chronicle s mike mcdaniel opined that winters had a s stealing and hilarious role on show references external links category 30 rock season 1 episodes category 2006 american television
