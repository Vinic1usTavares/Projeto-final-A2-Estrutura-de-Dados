adams of a v club awarded episode a b and wrote that episode was squarely invested in advancing pieces on offices game board all while keeping its gaze fixed on events of previous episode adams felt that a story was largely dramatic but was successfully balanced by simplistic yet humorous b story which helps that a story find its best beats ultimately he felt that episode sets up a portion of season where secrets and snooping become recurring components fitting for a show grounded in truth telling conventions of documentary film holloway highlighted michael s review of angela wherein he
