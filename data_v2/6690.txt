with you could it feel same from second verse and onwards song finds beyonce vocalizing an internal battle alternately desperate and calm as stated by joey guerra of houston chronicle she starts to

beginning moments song draws on sparse wave of recent music by british band xx by using silence as a weapon a notion that extends across 12 song album adam markovitz of entertainment weekly was also positive writing that beyonce pants and sweats and grunts except you know sexy like her voice climbing ever higher in search of an octave big enough to hold it embling of tiny mix tapes wrote that if

songs like i miss you and start over would earn deserved spots in beyonce pantheon once fans take time to grow attached to them andrew unterberger of popcrush praised way beyonce delivers line why is
