different people t i told rapfix live about track s inspiration i live life that most would die for but there s a lot of things that come with this life people don t take that into consideration there are a lot of things in this life that i would trade in a minute just for a slice of normalcy i just listed a few things that they probably never viewed from that particular perspective because i think people need to see things another way they need to see it other than just celebrity in november 2010 alex da kid announced that castle walls would be released as a single from no mercy however song was not released a 30 second snippet of song featuring aguilera s part was released onto youtube later that month composition castle walls lasts for a duration of 5 29 five minutes and twenty nine seconds and is a hip hop and electro song song features a europop keyboard in its arrangement nathan rabin from a v club wrote that lyrics of castle walls offer similarly incisive and only occasionally self pitying commentary on tragedy and triumph of being young black rich famous and a repeat felon song begins with chorus in which aguilera sings everyone thinks that i have it all but it s so empty living behind these castle walls these castle walls if i should tumble if i should fall would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls there s no one here at all behind these castle walls after chorus t i raps verse see with phantoms and ferraris in driveway but you see it came in exchange of a sane man s sanity your vision jaded by grammys on mantlepiece just switch your camera lenses you will see agony over a warbling electronic background and hip hop beats towards song s conclusion there is a sad string arrangement and an electronica influenced triumphantly striding beat an editor from hiphopdx compared castle walls to love way you lie by eminem featuring rihanna which was also produced by da kid reception thumb left 170px christina aguilera pictured in 2010 was

wrote a mixed review calling castle walls heartfelt but it also feels like a hip hop version of late period phil collins a sort of end so inoffensive and far removed from life force of hip hop as to
