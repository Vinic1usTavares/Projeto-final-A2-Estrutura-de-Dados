section of border croatian claim corresponds to red line while serbian claim corresponds to course of danube first general outline of post 1945 borders of croatia was made by anti fascist council for national liberation of yugoslavia on 24 february 1945 some issues regarding border such as baranja were left unresolved newly established autonomous province of vojvodina a part of socialist republic of serbia since april 1945 sought to establish its border with socialist republic of croatia along drava river thus including baranja danube and along vukovar zupanja line to counter claims made by vojvodina croatian authorities staked counterclaims in areas of vukovar vinkovci baranja and in area of sombor in order to settle matter federal authorities set up a five member commission presided over by milovan dilas in june 1945 commission identified three sets of disputed territories those were districts of subotica sombor apatin and odzaci in backa districts of and darda in baranja and districts of vukovar sid and ilok in syrmia districts in backa were awarded to vojvodina while those in baranja were awarded to croatia both primarily along ethnic lines commission also noted that if yugoslavia managed to acquire region of baja from hungary decision regarding backa would be reviewed district of vukovar was also awarded to croatia while ilok and sid were assigned to vojvodina in case of ilok decision was specified to be provisional until authorities are consolidated on either side of boundary when issue would be reexamined subsequently serbian parliament enacted a law establishing vojvodina s borders it referred to boundary proposed by dilas commission explicitly noting that it was temporary law noted that border follows danube from hungarian border to ilok crosses danube leaving ilok sarengrad and in croatia then moves south and leaves cadastral municipalities of tovarnik lipovac and jamena in croatia and everything east of line in vojvodina awarding of ilok to croatia was a departure from findings of dilas commission and it was based on a referendum held in town on matter in 1945 or 1946 when its population voted to be added to croatia start of dispute in 1947 vojvodina s ministry of agriculture complained to serbia s ministry of forestry that authorities in vukovar refused to hand over four river islands and then to croatia s ministry of forestry regarding same matter asking for assistance after croatia refused request serbian authorities turned to federal government federal authorities advised resolving matter through mutual agreement and said that vojvodina s interpretation of law on its borders that border runs along thalweg of danube valley i e along river s midpoint is erroneous because law does not apply such wording in a letter dated 18 april 1947 yugoslav authorities said that disputed river islands were territory of vukovar district and that territory could not be transferred to vojvodina before border was defined otherwise by may 1947 authorities in vojvodina noted that there was a dispute between them and authorities in croatia regarding interpretation of position of border along danube and that federal authorities who were asked to mediate in dispute supported position of croatia at same time vojvodina requested that croatia return territories on right bank of danube that had previously been ceded to it varos viza and mala siga while in yugoslav framework issue received little further attention as its resolution was discouraged by federal authorities and because area involved had limited economic value was uninhabited and frequently flooded by 1948 croatia and serbia agreed on two modifications of border village of was transferred to croatia while jamena was turned over to vojvodina
