heterodontosauridae is a family of early ornithischian dinosaurs that were likely among most basal primitive members of group although their fossils are relatively rare and their group small in numbers they lived across all continents except australia for approximately 100 million years from late triassic to early cretaceous heterodontosaurids were fox sized dinosaurs less than in length including a long tail they are known mainly for their characteristic teeth including enlarged canine like tusks and cheek teeth adapted for chewing analogous to those of cretaceous hadrosaurids their diet was herbivorous or possibly omnivorous description thumb left size comparison of many heterodontosaurids thumb life restoration of fruitadens among heterodontosaurids only heterodontosaurus itself is known from a complete skeleton fragmentary skeletal remains of abrictosaurus are known but have not been fully described while most other heterodontosaurids are known only from jaw fragments and teeth consequently most heterodontosaurid synapomorphies defining features have been described from teeth and jaw bones heterodontosaurus measured just over 1 meter 3 3 ft in length while fragmentary remains of lycorhinus may indicate a larger individual tianyulong from china appears to preserve filamentous integument which has been interpreted to be a variant of proto feathers found in some theropods these filaments include a crest along its tail presence of this filamentous integument has been used to suggest that both ornithischians and saurischians were endothermic skull and teeth both abrictosaurus and heterodontosaurus had very large eyes underneath eyes jugal bone projected sideways a feature also present in ceratopsians as in jaws of most ornithischians anterior edge of premaxilla a bone at tip of upper jaw was toothless and probably supported a keratinous beak rhamphotheca although heterodontosaurids did have teeth in posterior section of premaxilla a large gap called a diastema separated these premaxillary teeth from those of maxilla main upper jaw bone in many ornithischians but this diastema was characteristically arched in heterodontosaurids mandible lower jaw was tipped by predentary a bone unique to ornithischians this bone also supported a beak similar to one found on premaxilla all teeth in lower jaw were found on dentary bone thumb left snouts of heterodontosaurus a abrictosaurus b and tianyulong c heterodontosaurids are named for their strongly heterodont dentition there were three premaxillary teeth in early jurassic abrictosaurus heterodontosaurus and lycorhinus first two premaxillary teeth were small and conical while much larger third tooth resembled canines of carnivoran mammals and is often called caniniform or tusk a lower caniniform larger than upper took first position in dentary and was accommodated by arched diastema of upper jaw when mouth was closed these caniniforms were serrated on both anterior and posterior edges in heterodontosaurus and lycorhinus while those of abrictosaurus bore serrations only on anterior edge in early cretaceous echinodon there may have been two upper caniniforms which were on maxilla rather than premaxilla and fruitadens from late jurassic may have had two lower caniniforms on each dentary thumb evolution of key specialisations in heterodontosaurids according to sereno 2012 like characteristic tusks cheek teeth of derived heterodontosaurids were also unique among early ornithischians small ridges or denticles lined edges of ornithischian cheek teeth in order to crop vegetation these denticles extend only a third of way down tooth crown from tip in all heterodontosaurids in other ornithischians denticles extend further down towards root basal forms like abrictosaurus had cheek teeth in both maxilla and dentary that were generally similar to other ornithischians widely spaced each having a low crown and a strongly developed ridge cingulum separating crown from root in more derived forms like lycorhinus and heterodontosaurus teeth were chisel shaped with much higher crowns and no cingula so that there was no difference in width between crowns and roots these derived cheek teeth were overlapping so that their crowns formed a continuous surface on which food could be chewed tooth rows were slightly inset from side of mouth leaving a space outside teeth that may have been bounded by a muscular cheek which would have been necessary for chewing hadrosaurs and ceratopsians of cretaceous period as well as many herbivorous mammals would convergently evolve somewhat analogous dental batteries as opposed to hadrosaurs which had hundreds of teeth constantly being replaced tooth replacement in heterodontosaurids occurred far more slowly and several specimens have been found without a single replacement tooth in waiting characteristically heterodontosaurids lacked small openings foramina on inside of jaw bones which are thought to have aided in tooth development in most other ornithischians heterodontosaurids also boasted a unique spheroidal joint between dentaries and predentary allowing lower jaws to rotate outwards as mouth was closed grinding cheek teeth against each other because of slow replacement rate this grinding produced extreme tooth wear that commonly obliterated most of denticles in older teeth although increased height of crowns gave each tooth a long life skeleton thumb fossil of tianyulong muzzle hand feet and tail framed in red postcranial anatomy of heterodontosaurus tucki has been well described although h tucki is generally considered most derived of early jurassic heterodontosaurids so it is impossible to know how many of its features were shared with other species forelimbs were long for a dinosaur over 70 of length of hindlimbs well developed deltopectoral crest a ridge for attachment of chest and shoulder muscles of humerus and prominent olecranon process where muscles that extend forearm were attached of ulna indicate that forelimb was powerful as well there were five digits on manus hand first was large tipped with a sharply curved claw and would rotate inwards when flexed robert bakker called it twist thumb second digit was longest slightly longer than third both of these digits bore claws while fourth and fifth digits were very small and simple in comparison in hindlimb tibia was 30 longer than femur which is generally considered an adaptation for speed tibia and fibula of lower leg were fused to astragalus and calcaneum of ankle forming a tibiofibiotarsus convergently with modern birds also similarly to birds lower tarsal ankle bones and metatarsals were fused to form a tarsometatarsus there are four digits in pes hindfoot with only second third and fourth contacting ground tail unlike many other ornithischians did not have ossified tendons to maintain a rigid posture and was probably flexible fragmentary skeleton known for abrictosaurus has never been fully described although forelimb and manus were smaller than in heterodontosaurus also fourth and fifth digits of forelimb each bear one fewer phalanx bone classification thumb left holotype jawbone of geranosaurus south african paleontologist robert broom created name geranosaurus in 1911 for dinosaur jaw bones missing all of teeth in 1924 lycorhinus was named and classified as a cynodont by sidney haughton heterodontosaurus was named in 1962 and it lycorhinus and geranosaurus were recognized as closely related ornithischian dinosaurs alfred romer named heterodontosauridae in 1966 as a family of ornithischian dinosaurs including heterodontosaurus and lycorhinus it was defined as a clade in 1998 by paul sereno and redefined by him in 2005 as stem clade consisting of heterodontosaurus tucki and all species more closely related to heterodontosaurus than to parasaurolophus walkeri pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis triceratops horridus or ankylosaurus magniventris heterodontosauridae includes genera abrictosaurus lycorhinus and heterodontosaurus all from south africa while richard thulborn once reassigned all three to lycorhinus all other authors consider three genera distinct within family heterodontosaurus and lycorhinus are considered sister taxa with abrictosaurus as a basal member geranosaurus is also a heterodontosaurid but is usually considered a nomen dubium because type specimen is missing all its teeth making it indistinguishable from any other genus in family more recently genus echinodon has been considered a heterodontosaurid in several studies lanasaurus was named for an upper jaw in 1975 but more recent discoveries have shown that it belongs to lycorhinus instead making lanasaurus a junior synonym of that genus dianchungosaurus was once considered a heterodontosaurid from asia but it has since been shown that remains were a chimera of prosauropod and remains jose bonaparte also classified south american pisanosaurus as a heterodontosaurid at one time but this animal is now known to be a more basal ornithischian thumb skull of abrictosaurus membership of heterodontosauridae is well established in comparison to its uncertain phylogenetic position several early studies suggested that heterodontosaurids were very primitive ornithischians due to supposed similarities in morphology of forelimbs robert bakker proposed a relationship between heterodontosaurids and early sauropodomorphs like anchisaurus bridging orders saurischia and ornithischia dominant hypothesis over last several decades has placed heterodontosaurids as basal ornithopods however others have suggested that heterodontosaurids instead share a common ancestor with marginocephalia ceratopsians and pachycephalosaurs a hypothesis that has found support in some early 21st century studies clade containing heterodontosaurids and marginocephalians has been named heterodontosaurids have also been seen as basal to both ornithopods and marginocephalians in 2007 a cladistic analysis suggested that heterodontosaurids are basal to all known ornithischians except pisanosaurus a result that echoes some of very earliest work on family however a study by bonaparte found to be synonymous with heterodontosauridae and not a separate family in its own right thereby including pisanosaurus as a bonaparte j f 1976 pisanosaurus and origin

early jurassic of southern africa heterodontosaurid remains are now known from four continents early in heterodontosaurid history supercontinent pangaea was still largely intact allowing family to achieve a near worldwide distribution oldest known possible heterodontosaurid remains are a jaw fragment and isolated teeth from laguna colorada formation of argentina which dates back to late triassic these remains have a derived morphology similar to heterodontosaurus including a caniniform with serrations on both anterior and posterior edges as well as high crowned maxillary teeth lacking a cingulum et al 2007 tentatively agreed that this fossil material represents a heterodontosaurid but stated that additional material is needed to confirm this assignment because specimen is poorly preserved while sereno 2012 only stated that this material may represent an ornithischian or even specifically a heterodontosaurid olsen kent whiteside 2010 noted that age of laguna colorada formation itself is poorly constrained and thus it wasn t conclusively determined whether putative heterodontosaurid from this formation is of triassic or jurassic age most diverse heterodontosaurid fauna comes from early jurassic of southern africa where fossils of heterodontosaurus abrictosaurus lycorhinus and dubious geranosaurus are found undescribed early jurassic heterodontosaurids are also known from united states and mexico respectively in addition beginning in 1970s a great deal of fossil material was discovered from late jurassic morrison formation near fruita colorado in united states described in print in 2009 this material was placed in genus fruitadens heterodontosaurid teeth lacking a cingulum have also been described from late jurassic and early cretaceous formations in spain and portugal remains of echinodon were redescribed in 2002 showing that it may represent a late surviving heterodontosaurid from berriasian stage of early cretaceous in southern england dianchungosaurus from early jurassic of china is no longer considered a heterodontosaurid though one late surviving asian form is known tianyulong paleobiology left upright thumb restoration of most heterodontosaurid fossils are found in geologic formations that represent arid to semi arid environments including upper elliot formation of south africa and purbeck beds of southern england it has been suggested that heterodontosaurids underwent seasonal aestivation or hibernation during driest times of year due to lack of replacement teeth in most heterodontosaurids it was proposed that entire set of teeth was replaced during this dormant period as it seemed that continual and sporadic replacement of teeth would interrupt function of tooth row as a single chewing surface however this was based on a misunderstanding of heterodontosaurid jaw mechanics it was thought that heterodontosaurids actually did replace their teeth continually though more slowly than in other reptiles but ct scanning of skulls from juvenile and mature heterodontosaurus shows no replacement teeth there is currently no evidence that supports hypothesis of aestivation in heterodontosaurids but it cannot be rejected based on skull scans while cheek teeth of heterodontosaurids are clearly adapted for grinding tough plant material their diet may have been omnivorous pointed premaxillary teeth and sharp curved claws on forelimbs suggest some degree of predatory behavior it has been suggested that long powerful forelimbs of heterodontosaurus may have been useful for tearing into insect nests similarly to modern anteaters these forelimbs may have also functioned as digging tools perhaps for roots and tubers thumb tianyulong restoration length of forelimb compared to hindlimb suggests that heterodontosaurus might have been partially quadrupedal and prominent olecranon process and digits of forelimb are found in many quadrupeds however manus is clearly designed for grasping not weight support many features of hindlimb including long tibia and foot as well as fusion of tibiofibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus indicate that heterodontosaurids were adapted to run quickly on hindlegs so it is unlikely that heterodontosaurus moved on all four limbs except perhaps when feeding short tusks found in all known heterodontosaurids strongly resemble tusks found in modern musk deer peccaries and pigs in many of these animals as well as longer tusked walrus and asian elephants this is a sexually dimorphic trait with tusks only found in males type specimen of abrictosaurus lacks tusks and was originally described as a female while this remains possible unfused sacral vertebrae and short face indicate that this specimen represents a juvenile animal while a second larger specimen of abrictosaurus clearly possesses tusks therefore it is possible that tusks are found only in adults rather than being a secondary sexual characteristic of males these tusks could have been used for combat or display with members of same species or with other species absence of tusks in juvenile abrictosaurus could also be another characteristic separating it from other heterodontosaurids as well as tusks are known in juvenile heterodontosaurus other proposed functions for tusks include defense and use in an occasionally omnivorous diet in 2005 a small complete fossilized heterodontosaurid skeleton more than 200 million years old was discovered in south africa in july 2016 it was scanned by a team of south african researchers using european synchrotron radiation facility scan of
