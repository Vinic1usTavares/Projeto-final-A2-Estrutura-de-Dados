right thumb 200px current theoretical model of atom involves a dense nucleus surrounded by a probabilistic cloud of electrons in chemistry and physics atomic theory is a scientific theory of nature of matter which states that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms it began as a philosophical concept in ancient greece and entered scientific mainstream in early 19th century when discoveries in field of chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were made up of atoms word atom comes from ancient greek adjective atomos meaning indivisible berryman sylvia ancient atomism stanford encyclopedia of philosophy fall 2008 edition edward n zalta ed 19th century chemists began using term in connection with growing number of irreducible chemical elements around turn of 20th century through various experiments with electromagnetism and radioactivity physicists discovered that so called uncuttable atom was actually a conglomerate of various subatomic particles chiefly electrons protons and neutrons which can exist separately from each other in fact in certain extreme environments such as neutron stars extreme temperature and pressure prevents atoms from existing at all since atoms were found to be divisible physicists later invented term elementary particles to describe uncuttable though not indestructible parts of an atom field of science which studies subatomic particles is particle physics and it is in this field that physicists hope to discover true fundamental nature of matter history philosophical atomism idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old idea appearing in many ancient cultures such as greece and india word atom meaning uncuttable was coined by pre socratic greek philosophers leucippus and his pupil democritus 460 370 bc democritus taught that atoms were infinite in number uncreated and eternal and that qualities of an object result from kind of atoms that compose it democritus s atomism was refined and elaborated by later greek philosopher epicurus 341 270 bc and by roman epicurean poet lucretius 99 55 bc during early middle ages atomism was mostly forgotten in western europe during 12th century atomism became known again in western europe through references to it in newly rediscovered writings of aristotle in 14th century rediscovery of major works describing teachings including lucretius s de rerum natura and diogenes laertius s lives and opinions of eminent philosophers led to increased scholarly attention on subject nonetheless because atomism was associated with philosophy of epicureanism which contradicted orthodox christian teachings belief in atoms was not considered acceptable by most european philosophers french catholic priest pierre gassendi 1592 1655 revived epicurean atomism with modifications arguing that atoms were created by god and though extremely numerous are not infinite gassendi s modified theory of atoms was popularized in france by physician francois bernier 1620 1688 and in england by natural philosopher walter 1619 1707 chemist robert boyle 1627 1691 and physicist isaac newton 1642 1727 both defended atomism and by end of 17th century it had become accepted by portions of scientific community john dalton near end of 18th century two laws about chemical reactions emerged without referring to notion of an atomic theory first was law of conservation of mass closely associated with work of antoine lavoisier which states that total mass in a chemical reaction remains constant that is reactants have same mass as products second was law of definite proportions first established by french chemist joseph louis proust in 1799 proust joseph louis researches on copper excerpted from ann chim 32 26 54 1799 as translated and reproduced in henry m leicester and herbert s a source book in chemistry 1400 1900 cambridge massachusetts harvard 1952 retrieved on august 29 2007 this law states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent chemical elements then masses of constituents will always have same proportions by weight regardless of quantity or source of original substance john dalton studied and expanded upon this previous work and defended a new idea later known as law of multiple proportions if same two elements can be combined to form a number of different compounds then ratios of masses of two elements in their various compounds will be represented by small whole numbers for example proust had studied tin oxides and found that there is one type of tin oxide that is 88 1 tin and 11 9 oxygen and another type that is 78 7 tin and 21 3 oxygen these are tin ii oxide and tin dioxide respectively dalton noted from these percentages that 100g of tin will combine either with 13 5g or of oxygen 13 5 and 27 form a ratio of 1 2 dalton found that an atomic theory of matter could elegantly explain this law as well as proust s law of definite proportions for example in case of proust s tin oxides one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms to form either first or second oxide of tin 1952 from atomos to atomism p 137 dalton believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbed different gases in different proportions for example he found that water absorbed carbon dioxide far better than it absorbed nitrogen dalton john on absorption of gases by water and other liquids in memoirs of literary and philosophical society of manchester 1803 retrieved on august 29 2007 dalton hypothesized this was due to differences in mass and complexity of gases respective particles indeed carbon dioxide molecules co2 are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules n2 dalton proposed that each chemical element is composed of atoms of a single unique type and though they cannot be altered or destroyed by chemical means they can combine to form more complex structures chemical compounds this marked first truly scientific theory of atom since dalton reached his conclusions by experimentation and examination of results in an empirical fashion right thumb various atoms and molecules as depicted in john dalton s a new system of chemical philosophy 1808 in 1803 dalton orally presented his first list of relative atomic weights for a number of substances this paper was published in 1805 but he did not discuss there exactly how he obtained these figures method was first revealed in 1807 by his acquaintance thomas thomson in third edition of thomson s textbook a system of chemistry finally dalton published a full account in his own textbook a new system of chemical philosophy 1808 and 1810 dalton estimated atomic weights according to mass ratios in which they combined with hydrogen atom taken as unity however dalton did not conceive that with some elements atoms exist in molecules e g pure oxygen exists as o2 he also mistakenly believed that simplest compound between any two elements is always one atom of each so he thought water was ho not h2o this in addition to crudity of his equipment flawed his results for instance in 1803 he believed that oxygen atoms were 5 5 times heavier than hydrogen atoms because in water he measured 5 5 grams of oxygen for every 1 gram of hydrogen and believed formula for water was ho adopting better data in 1806 he concluded that atomic weight of oxygen must actually be 7 rather than 5 5 and he retained this weight for rest of his life others at this time had already concluded that oxygen atom must weigh 8 relative to hydrogen equals 1 if one assumes dalton s formula for water molecule ho or 16 if one assumes modern water formula h2o avogadro flaw in dalton s theory was corrected in principle in 1811 by amedeo avogadro avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases at equal temperature and pressure contain equal numbers of molecules in other words mass of a gas s particles does not affect volume that it occupies avogadro s law allowed him to deduce diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying volumes at which they reacted for instance since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor at constant pressure and temperature it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water thus avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements and made a clear distinction between molecules and atoms brownian motion in 1827 british botanist robert brown observed that dust particles inside pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about for no apparent reason in 1905 albert einstein theorized that this brownian motion was caused by water molecules continuously knocking grains about and developed a hypothetical mathematical model to describe it this model was validated experimentally in 1908 by french physicist jean perrin thus providing additional validation for particle theory and by extension atomic theory discovery of subatomic particles atoms were thought to be smallest possible division of matter until 1897 when j j thomson discovered electron through his work on cathode rays a crookes tube is a sealed glass container in which two electrodes are separated by a vacuum when a voltage is applied across electrodes cathode rays are generated creating a glowing patch where they strike glass at opposite end of tube through experimentation thomson discovered that rays could be deflected by an electric field in addition to magnetic fields which was already known he concluded that these rays rather than being a form of light were composed of very light negatively charged particles he called corpuscles they would later be renamed electrons by other scientists he measured mass to charge ratio and discovered it was 1800 times smaller than that of hydrogen smallest atom these corpuscles were a particle unlike any other previously known thomson suggested that atoms were divisible and that corpuscles were their building blocks to explain overall neutral charge of atom he proposed that corpuscles were distributed in a uniform sea of positive charge this was plum pudding model as electrons were embedded in positive charge like raisins in a plum pudding although in thomson s model they were not stationary discovery of nucleus right 400px thumb geiger marsden experiment left expected results alpha particles passing through plum pudding model of atom with negligible deflection right observed results a small portion of particles were deflected by concentrated positive charge of nucleus thomson s plum pudding model was disproved in 1909 by one of his former students ernest rutherford who discovered that most of mass and positive charge of an atom is concentrated in a very small fraction of its volume which he assumed to be at very center in geiger marsden experiment hans geiger and ernest marsden colleagues of rutherford working at his behest shot alpha particles at thin sheets of metal and measured their deflection through use of a fluorescent screen given very small mass of electrons high momentum of alpha particles and low concentration of positive charge of plum pudding model experimenters expected all alpha particles to pass through metal foil without significant deflection to their astonishment a small fraction of alpha particles experienced heavy deflection rutherford concluded that positive charge of atom must be concentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect alpha particles so strongly this led rutherford to propose a planetary model in which a cloud of electrons surrounded a small compact nucleus of positive charge only such a concentration of charge could produce electric field strong enough to cause heavy deflection first steps toward a quantum physical model of atom planetary model of atom had two significant shortcomings first is that unlike planets orbiting a sun electrons are charged particles an accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to larmor formula in classical electromagnetism an orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward nucleus colliding with it in a small fraction of a second second problem was that planetary model could not explain highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed thumb right bohr model of atom quantum theory revolutionized physics at beginning of 20th century when max planck and albert einstein postulated that light energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete amounts known as quanta singular quantum in 1913 niels bohr incorporated this idea into his bohr model of atom in which an electron could only orbit nucleus in particular circular orbits with fixed angular momentum and energy its distance from nucleus i e their radii being proportional to its energy under this model an electron could not spiral into nucleus because it could not lose energy in a continuous manner instead it could only make instantaneous quantum leaps between fixed energy levels when this occurred light was emitted or absorbed at a frequency proportional to change in energy hence absorption and emission of light in discrete spectra bohr s model was not perfect it could only predict spectral lines of hydrogen it couldn t predict those of atoms worse still as spectrographic technology improved additional spectral lines in hydrogen were observed which bohr s model couldn t explain in 1916 arnold sommerfeld added elliptical orbits to bohr model to explain extra emission lines but this made model very difficult to use and it still couldn t explain more complex atoms discovery of isotopes while experimenting with products of radioactive decay in 1913 frederick soddy discovered that there appeared to be more than one element at each position on periodic table term isotope was coined by margaret todd as a suitable name for these elements that same year j j thomson conducted an experiment in which he channeled a stream of neon ions through magnetic and electric fields striking a photographic plate at other end he observed two glowing patches on plate which suggested two different deflection trajectories thomson concluded this was because some of neon ions had a different mass as excerpted in henry a lloyd motz world of atom vol 1 new york basic books 1966 retrieved on august 29 2007 nature of this differing mass would later be explained by discovery of neutrons in 1932 discovery of nuclear particles in 1917 rutherford bombarded nitrogen gas with alpha particles and observed hydrogen nuclei being emitted from gas rutherford recognized these because he had previously obtained them bombarding hydrogen with alpha particles and observing hydrogen nuclei in products rutherford concluded that hydrogen nuclei emerged from nuclei of nitrogen atoms themselves in effect he had split a nitrogen from his own work and work of his students bohr and henry moseley rutherford knew that positive charge of any atom could always be equated to that of an integer number of hydrogen nuclei this coupled with atomic mass of many elements being roughly equivalent to an integer number of hydrogen atoms then assumed to be lightest particles led him to conclude that hydrogen nuclei were singular particles and a basic constituent of all atomic nuclei he named such particles protons further experimentation by rutherford found that nuclear mass of most atoms exceeded that of protons it possessed he speculated that this surplus mass was composed of previously unknown neutrally charged particles which were tentatively dubbed neutrons in 1928 walter bothe observed that beryllium emitted a highly penetrating electrically neutral radiation when bombarded with alpha particles it was later discovered that this radiation could knock hydrogen atoms out of paraffin wax initially it was thought to be high energy gamma radiation since gamma radiation had a similar effect on electrons in metals but james chadwick found that ionization effect was too strong for it to be due to electromagnetic radiation so long as energy and momentum were conserved in interaction in 1932 chadwick exposed various elements such as hydrogen and nitrogen to mysterious beryllium radiation and by measuring energies of recoiling charged particles he deduced that radiation was actually composed of electrically neutral particles which could not be massless like gamma ray but instead were required to have a mass similar to that of a proton chadwick now claimed these particles as rutherford s neutrons for his discovery of neutron chadwick received nobel prize in 1935 quantum physical models of atom right thumb five filled atomic orbitals of a neon atom separated and arranged in order of increasing energy from left to right with last three orbitals being equal in energy each orbital holds up to two electrons which most probably exist in zones represented by colored bubbles each electron is equally present in both orbital zones shown here by color only to highlight different wave phase in 1924 louis de broglie proposed that all moving particles particularly subatomic particles such as electrons exhibit a degree of wave like behavior erwin schrodinger fascinated by this idea explored whether or not movement of an electron in an atom could be better explained as a wave rather than as a particle schrodinger s equation published in 1926 describes an electron as a wavefunction instead of as a point particle this approach elegantly predicted many of spectral phenomena that bohr s model failed to explain although this concept was mathematically convenient it was difficult to visualize and faced opposition one of its critics max born proposed instead that schrodinger s wavefunction described not electron but rather all its possible states and thus could be used to calculate probability of finding an electron at any given location around nucleus this reconciled two opposing theories of particle versus wave electrons and idea of wave particle duality was introduced this theory stated that electron may exhibit properties of both a wave and a particle for example it can be refracted like a wave and has mass like a particle a consequence of describing electrons as waveforms is that it is mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive position and momentum of an electron this became known as heisenberg uncertainty principle after theoretical physicist werner heisenberg who first described it and published it in 1927 this invalidated bohr s model with its neat clearly defined circular orbits modern model of atom describes positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities an electron can potentially be found at any distance from nucleus but depending on its energy level exists more frequently in certain regions around nucleus than others this pattern is
