1969 atlantic hurricane season was most active atlantic hurricane season since 1933 and is tied with 2019 as fourth most active atlantic hurricane season on record and was also final year of most recent positive atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo era hurricane season officially began on june 1 and lasted until november 30 season had highest number of systems reach hurricane status twelve in a single season until that record was surpassed in 2005 season was above average despite an el nino which typically suppresses activity in atlantic ocean while increasing tropical cyclone activity in pacific ocean activity began with a series of five tropical depressions first of which developed on may 29 third system in that series tropical depression seven caused extensive flooding in cuba and jamaica in early june final in series formed on july 25 same day that tropical storm anna developed neither former nor latter caused significant impact on land later in season tropical depression twenty nine caused severe local flooding in florida panhandle and southwestern georgia in september hurricane blanche was a small and short lived tropical cyclone in mid august that resulted in minimal effects most significant storm of season was hurricane camille which peaked as a category 5 hurricane on august 17 and devastated gulf coast of united states upon striking mississippi next day strong winds and storm surge heights especially impacted mississippi and louisiana later in its duration storm caused severe flooding virginia and west virginia camille alone was responsible for 259 deaths and 1 43 billion all damage figures are in 1969 usd unless otherwise noted it was costliest united states hurricane at time until hurricane agnes in 1972 in early september hurricane francelia caused deadly floods in central america with 271 people killed in central america hurricane inga had third longest duration of an atlantic tropical cyclone last storm hurricane martha was only known tropical cyclone to make landfall in panama martha caused minor flooding in former and costa rica overall systems of season collectively caused 535 deaths and over 1 5 billion in losses season summary thumb right radar image of hurricane camille on august 17 1969 atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1 of twenty four tropical cyclones that developed in north atlantic ocean in 1969 eighteen of them intensified into tropical storms this was above 1950 2000 average of 9 6 named storms in terms of tropical storms it was busiest season since 1933 twelve of eighteen named storms reached hurricane status a record that stood until there were fifteen named storms in 2005 five of hurricanes deepened into major hurricanes which are category 3 or higher on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale between 1950 and 2000 there was an average of 2 3 major hurricanes per season throughout season u s weather bureau issued more advisories than in any previous season additionally reconnaissance aircraft were utilized for more flight hours than in any year in atlantic basin until that point season officially ended on november 30 hurricane camille made landfall in mississippi on august 18 as a category 5 hurricane becoming one of only four tropical cyclones to strike united states as a category 5 other than labor day hurricane in 1935 hurricane andrew in 1992 and hurricane michael in 2018 project stormfury had some of its most successful seeding experiments on hurricane debbie which declined in wind speed by 31 on first day and by 18 of following day with a duration of almost 25 days from september 20 to october 15 hurricane inga is third longest lasting tropical cyclone in atlantic behind only san ciriaco hurricane of 1899 and hurricane ginger in 1971 on november 24 hurricane martha became first tropical cyclone on record to strike panama season was above average despite an el nino which typically suppresses tropical cyclogenesis in atlantic ocean while increasing activity in eastern pacific ocean atlantic upper tropospheric shear line a semi permanent feature that extended southeastward into caribbean sea which enhances outflow from disturbances remained persistent throughout season however opposite periphery of shear line inhibits divergent outflow of a disturbance this may have increased number of tropical cyclones developing while causing other storms to remain weak or dissipate over deep tropics additionally an abnormally strong mid tropospheric ridge replaced further south than normal westerlies that deterred tropical cyclone formation in 1968 five hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall causing 535 deaths and 1 5 billion in damage tropical depression twenty nine also resulted in damage thumb left weather map featuring hurricane inga on october 3 tropical cyclogenesis began early with two tropical depressions forming on may 29 neither intensified into a named storm in june two additional tropical depressions developed both of which failed to reach tropical storm intensity activity briefly went dormant between june 15 and july 25 when next depression originated that same day season s first named storm anna developed over eastern atlantic there were five tropical cyclones that formed in month of august blanche camille debbie eve and francelia camille was most intense tropical cyclone of season peaking as a category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph 280 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of september was most active month of season with six tropical cyclones five of which intensified into a tropical storm gerda holly inga and an unnamed hurricane of five named storms that originated in october three intensified into hurricanes including kara laurie and an unnamed storm this was well above currently used 1981 2010 average of two tropical storms and one hurricane in month of october although an unnamed hurricane existed into november martha was only tropical cyclone to originate in that month martha last storm of season dissipated over panama on november 25 season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 166 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding which is tropical storm strength systems tropical depression seven tropical depression seven developed near yucatan peninsula on june 7 it moved north reaching western cuba by following day as depression moved towards florida small craft warnings were issued for southern coast depression made landfall in florida on june 9 and dissipated shortly thereafter as a result of rain in cuba radio havana warned of a flash flood and later reported that three rivers were overflowing in camaguey flooding also forced 1 801 people from their homes sustained winds of and gusts up to were observed on island impact from depression in florida is unknown damage was catastrophic in jamaica with landslides flooding broken communication lines cancellation of its railway service and evacuation of hundreds of people from their homes jamaica railway corporation s trains were disrupted by landslides blocking tracks from spanish town to port antonio and floodwaters inundating a bridge in gregory park a train bound for kingston was disrupted by flooded bridge as was a diesel tram isolating both trains at richmond furthermore former train did not reach its destination due to landslides jamaica telephone company reported troubles due to waterlogged telephone lines schools and colleges in kingston suspended classes and motorists in area had difficulty traveling due to flooded roads correspondents from gleaner reported heavy rains which inundated roads washed away livestock and destroyed crops on june 9 church welfare organization of west indies junior seventh day adventists set out food money and blankets victims tropical storm anna on july 23 a tropical wave emerged into atlantic from west coast of africa by 0600 utc on july 25 system developed into tropical depression twelve initially depression strengthened slowly while moving west northwestward eventually it was upgraded to tropical storm anna on july 27 intensification continued during next 66 hours on july 29 anna peaked with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph 110 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of thereafter storm began to weaken and moved in a more northwesterly direction late on july 31 anna was downgraded to a tropical depression while situated north of lesser antilles anna briefly re strengthened into a tropical storm late on august 1 storm re curved northeastward on august 2 and remained offshore of east coast of united states ana once again reached tropical storm status by early on august 3 further intensification occurred with storm reaching winds of 65 mph 100 km h later that day however anna transitioned into an extratropical cyclone after merging with an extratropical low pressure area at 0000 utc on august 4 while centered near sable island remnants continued rapidly east northeastward across atlantic until becoming unidentifiable on august 5 hurricane blanche a tropical wave was initially tracked about east of lesser antilles on august 6 system curved west northward on august 6 and eventually moved around western periphery of bermuda high late on august 10 a circulation developed and by 0000 utc on august 11 system became a tropical depression while located about east of beach florida under influence of a trough it headed rapidly north to north northeastward after ships reported winds up to depression was upgraded to tropical storm blanche later on august 11 significant intensification then occurred later on august 11 navy reconnaissance reports indicated that blanche reached hurricane intensity after winds peaked at 85 mph 140 km h strong southwesterly current which blanche was embedded in caused storm to accelerate northeastward on august 12 storm began losing tropical characteristics near sable island namely wind field was becoming asymmetrical at sable island a weather station reported sustained winds of and gusts up to while passing to south of newfoundland blanche was absorbed by a frontal zone at 0000 utc on august 13 hurricane camille a tropical disturbance moved off west coast of africa on august 5 and developed into tropical storm camille near grand cayman on august 14 storm strengthened quickly and was a category 3 hurricane when it struck near western tip of cuba on august 15 storm damaged 100 homes on isla de la juventud while 20 000 residents were left homeless on mainland five fatalities were also reported and damages reached 5 million early on august 16 camille emerged into gulf of mexico between august 16 and august 17 storm rapidly deepened with a minimum barometric pressure of later on august 17 camille peaked as a 175 mph 280 km h category 5 it likely maintained this intensity until landfall near bay st louis mississippi early on august 18 camille was one of only four tropical cyclones to strike mainland united states as a category 5 others were 1935 labor day hurricane hurricane andrew in 1992 and hurricane michael in 2018 mississippi bore brunt of hurricane camille a combination of strong winds and large storm surges caused adverse impact in state in mississippi alone 3 881 dwellings were destroyed and 41 848 were damaged about 406 trailers were destroyed and an additional 325 suffered major losses an estimated 645 farm buildings were destroyed and another 2 002 received major damage in addition 569 small businesses were impacted in mississippi s neighboring states of alabama and louisiana 1 781 homes were destroyed and 6 000 others were inflicted losses about 676 trailers were demolished and 296 were severely impacted additionally 124 small businesses were either destroyed or incurred major damage camille rapidly weakened after landfall on august 18 and was only a tropical depression about 24 hours later however storm maintained intensity as it recurved to east over ohio river valley it dropped heavy rainfall while approaching atlantic ocean especially in virginia up to fell in west central nelson county in nelson county alone 133 bridges washed out while in some places entire communities were under water rivers crested at record heights causing severe flooding in state of virginia and west virginia combined an estimated 349 homes were destroyed and 2 587 received damage to some degree eighty three trailers were demolished and 71 others received major losses reportedly 730 farm buildings were destroyed and 535 were inflicted minor damage ninety six small businesses were also severely damaged or destroyed along its path rainfall was recorded in several other states including arkansas delaware florida georgia illinois indiana maryland new jersey north carolina ohio pennsylvania south carolina and tennessee after reaching atlantic camille re strengthened into a 70 mph 115 km h tropical storm but was absorbed by a cold front south of newfoundland on august 22 with losses estimated at 1 42 billion camille was considered costliest hurricane in united states history at time additionally there were 256 deaths in united states hurricane debbie on august 14 a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression while located about midway between lesser antilles and coast of africa following day depression strengthened into tropical storm debbie by late on august 16 debbie became a category 1 hurricane moving northwestward it intensified further to a category 3 hurricane with winds of 115 mph 185 km h on august 18 however storm then began oscillating between a category 1 and a category 3 hurricane for next few days possibly due to being seeded by silver iodide as part of project stormfury on august 20 debbie attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph 195 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of storm curved northeastward as hurricane camille moved offshore east coast of united states and briefly weakened to a category 2 hurricane on august 21 before re strengthened into a category 3 hurricane hours later debbie accelerated and fell to category 2 intensity by midday on august 23 storm curved northward and weakened to a category 1 hurricane on following day shortly before passing just offshore newfoundland debbie turned northeastward and deteriorated to a tropical storm on august 25 several hours later hurricane dissipated about 225 mi 360 km east northeast of cape farewell greenland in newfoundland wind gusts up to 85 mph 140 km h were observed in st john s while rainfall up to was recorded along avalon and bonavista peninsulas tropical storm eve in wake of hurricane camille a quasi stationary front moved across southern united states and became situated over north florida a cut off low pressure area developed along system and acquired a low level circulation by 0000 utc on august 25 system was classified as a tropical depression while located about 100 mi 160 km east of jacksonville florida due to cold air in region depression strengthened slowly while tracking nearly due east late on august 25 it was upgraded to tropical storm eve on august 26 national hurricane center noted although conditions would prevent rapid deepening further intensification was possible storm threatened mid atlantic states and bermuda but remained offshore and caused no impacts in either region eve strengthened slightly on august 26 reaching maximum sustained winds of 60 mph 95 km h although storm weakened later that day eve reached its minimum barometric pressure of early on august 2 eve was downgraded to a tropical depression it began to succumb to effects of cold air which entrained circulation of storm at 0000 utc on august 28 eve degenerated into a trough of low pressure while located about west northwest of bermuda hurricane francelia a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression near windward islands on august 29 initially depression slowly strengthened while moving west northwestward and was upgraded to tropical storm francelia until more than 24 hours later while located north of honduras it curved west southwestward and was upgraded to a hurricane on september 1 storm briefly became a category 3 hurricane on september 2 peaking with winds of 115 mph 185 km h late on september 3 francelia made landfall near punta gorda belize with winds of 100 mph 155 km h storm quickly weakened inland and less than 24 hours later it dissipated over northern guatemala however remnants of francelia later contributed to development of hurricane glenda in eastern pacific ocean during its early stages francelia brought gusty winds and light rainfall to several islands in caribbean sea while remaining nearly stationary offshore central america heavy precipitation fell in some countries especially guatemala where severe flooding killed 269 people and caused 15 million in damage throughout country approximately 10 200 people were left homeless in neighboring honduras hurricane caused damage in northern portions of country with offshore bay islands department being particularly hard hit there storm damaged or destroyed majority of two towns in el salvador flooding isolated towns for several days and caused crop damage coastal areas of belize lost electricity and telephone service and high winds resulted in extensive damage to banana crops a number of rivers in region flooded including belize river which reached 36 ft 11 m above normal francelia ranked as deadliest tropical cyclone in guatemala until hurricane mitch in 1998 overall damage was estimated at 35 6 million and there were 271 deaths hurricane gerda a tropical wave located over central bahamas developed into a tropical depression on september 6 depression moved northwestward and initially remained disorganized by early on september 7 depression made landfall near west palm beach florida impact in state was minimal limited mostly to light rainfall later on september 7 depression reemerged into atlantic ocean just south of cape canaveral it began to strengthen on following day and was upgraded to tropical storm gerda at 0600 utc by late on september 8 gerda intensified into a hurricane storm deepened significantly further peaking with winds of 125 mph 205 km h on september 9 early on september 10 gerda weakened slightly while approaching new england and atlantic canada it made landfall near eastport maine on september 10 and was one of strongest tropical cyclones to strike state despite landfall as a category 2 hurricane strongest sustained wind speed recorded was 60 mph 95 km h in washington county maine twenty four hour rainfall amounts exceeding were observed in some areas of new england with a precipitation peak of in wellfleet massachusetts due to winds and rainfall portions of maine massachusetts and new hampshire reported power outages and localized flooding by 0600 utc on september 10 gerda became extratropical over southeastern quebec in atlantic canada winds left many without electricity in new brunswick and nova scotia and left about 3 5 million in losses to apple crops hurricane holly a tropical wave emerged into atlantic ocean from west coast of africa on september 8 moving westward to west northwestward it developed into a tropical depression at 1200 utc on september 14 while located about 1 250 mi 2 315 km southeast of puerto rico based on hurricane hunter observations of an organized circulation it quickly organized and was soon upgraded to tropical storm holly continuing northwestward it steadily intensified and hurricane hunters reported that holly attained hurricane status on september 16 with peak winds of 85 mph 140 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of on september 16 holly weakened slightly while turning westward toward lesser antilles due to lack of good upper level outflow as well as unfavorable water holly quickly weakened to tropical storm status on september 18 as confirmed by hurricane hunters by next day it weakened to tropical depression status and later moved through lesser antilles holly dissipated on september 21 in caribbean sea while situated between los roques archipelago of venezuela and puerto rico tropical depression twenty nine ship reports on september 19 indicated presence of low pressure area in gulf of mexico centered about west northwest of key west florida it is estimated that a tropical depression developed at 1200 utc on that day depression headed north northwestward and did not strengthen by early on september 21 depression made landfall between panama city and port st joe florida it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area only a few hours later a high pressure ridge blocked system s movement moving it to east by september 23 system became a low pressure trough upper level wind shear moved circulation to east northeast and moved into atlantic ocean next day rainfall in florida peaked at in havana and exceeding in most of central panhandle many bridges and roads were washed out or inundated by water including portions of u s route 98 and state road 20 between tallahassee and panama city in addition a tornado spawned by depression destroyed a trailer damaged 30 homes and toppled ballpark bleachers fences lights and electrical poles damage in florida reached almost 3 78 million including 1 65 million to crops and 2 135 million to property in southwest georgia precipitation totals exceeding were common while rainfall peaked at in southern decatur county severe local flooding ensued causing damage to property and crops mostly to peanuts that were not threshed up to of rainfall fell in alabama while precipitation totals reached in tennessee south carolina north carolina and virginia hurricane inga a tropical disturbance developed into a tropical depression on september 20 by following day it strengthened into tropical storm inga while centered about east southeast of san juan puerto rico at time storm was moving westward at however by september 23 storm weakened to a tropical depression depression continued west northwestward passing north of leeward islands before drifting northwestward inga became a tropical storm again on september 29 it continued to intensify and achieved hurricane status on september 30 while curving northeastward storm then turned towards south and ultimately completed a cyclonic loop as it bent back westward late on october 3 inga turned to northwest early on october 5 hurricane produced wind gusts up to 80 mph 130 km h on bermuda though minimal impact occurred other than power outages thereafter inga curved northeastward and continued deepen later on october 5 it peaked as a category 3 with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph 185 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of while moving into an environment of colder sea surface temperatures storm began to weaken as cold air became entrained into its circulation storm began to lose tropical characteristics inga briefly re strengthened while beginning to drift generally eastward however storm turned southward and began to weaken deteriorating to a tropical storm on october 10 heading westward inga was downgraded to a tropical depression before dissipating fully on october 15 while located about from where it initially attained hurricane status subtropical storm one an upper level low pressure area in southeastern gulf of mexico spawned a subtropical depression at 1200 utc on september 29 operationally it was classified as tropical depression thirty two six hours later strengthened into a subtropical storm early on following day storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph 95 km h it maintained that intensity for about 24 hours before cool air and wind shear began weakening storm early on october 1 shortly thereafter storm weakened back to a subtropical depression a few hours prior to landfall near fort walton beach florida subtropical depression rapidly dissipated inland rainfall was relatively light and heaviest amounts were displaced far east of track with precipitation peaking at in saint augustine florida closer to location of landfall rainfall reached nearly in pensacola several waterspouts were reported in panama city area while a tornado in and unroofed a home in st james community united states coast guard planes searched for three people in a light aircraft that went missing as it traveled from defuniak springs to sebring storm brought rainfall to several others states reaching as far north as maine tropical storm jenny on october 1 a tropical depression developed over northwestern caribbean sea from same cut off low pressure that spawned previous subtropical storm on september 29 depression moved quickly north northeastward and struck cuba early on october 2 while approaching southwest coast of florida later that day system intensified into tropical storm jenny simultaneously jenny attained its peak intensity with winds of 45 mph 75 km h and a minimum pressure of around 0000 utc on october 2 storm made landfall between fort myers and naples florida with winds of 40 mph 60 km h jenny emerged into western atlantic as a tropical depression but increased ridging forced storm to track west southwestward back over florida cyclone was unable to re strengthen and dissipated on october 6 south of louisiana storm crossed cuba as a tropical depression minimal impact was reported storm produced moderate to heavy rainfall over parts of florida peninsula peaking at near deland minor road washouts were reported in lee county rainfall along lower kissimmee river and lake okeechobee basin caused some pastures and flood plain areas to be inundated by water lake kissimmee rose in height due to precipitation jenny s remnants later contributed to development of heavy rains in southern louisiana hurricane kara a cold core trough of low pressure over western atlantic ocean warmed on eastern end becoming a tropical depression on october 7 about 135 mi 215 km north of punta cana dominican republic depression passed south of turks and caicos islands and later to west of mayaguana early on october 9 system turned northward and intensified into tropical storm kara after several hours southwesterly flow associated with an upper level trough then caused storm to curve northeastward on october 10 an upper level low pressure formed offshore north carolina initially kara moved rapidly north northwest around low however by october 11 kara and low merged resulting in former moving erratically while tracking southwestward into warmer ocean temperatures storm continued to strengthen after executing a small cyclonic loop kara developed an eye feature on october 14 before strengthening into a hurricane on october 15 while moving offshore north carolina storm brought tides of above normal between october 10 and october 15 causing coastal flooding in very low lying areas by october 15 an upper level westerlies forced storm to move northeastward and accelerate kara then became to strengthen further and became a category 2 hurricane at 1800 utc on october 17 six hours later storm peaked with sustained winds of 105 mph 165 km h and a minimum pressure of kara began losing tropical characteristics and weakening after encountering a cold trough over northeast atlantic falling to tropical storm intensity late on october 18 storm soon became extratropical about north northeast of corvo island in azores hurricane laurie a low pressure area developed into a tropical depression while located about 75 mi 120 km northeast of guanaja in bay islands department of honduras although conditions were favorable for rapid deepening depression failed to do so because it was not vertically stacked and struck yucatan peninsula late on october 18 after emerging into gulf of mexico on following day system strengthened into tropical storm laurie later on october 19 laurie curved northward and continued intensifying at 12 00 utc on october 20 storm became a hurricane it then curved eastward over central gulf of mexico and continued to deepen peaking as a category 2 hurricane with sustained winds of 105 mph 165 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of thereafter drier air began weakening laurie on october 22 laurie curved southeastward and then southward allowing it to remain well offshore gulf coast of united states early on october 23 cyclone weakened to a tropical storm while curving west southwestward late following day laurie deteriorated into a tropical depression after moving southwestward and then southward storm made landfall near paraiso tabasco mexico early on october 27 laurie promptly dissipated offshore oil rig personnel were evacuated as storm approached a hurricane watch was issued from galveston texas to pensacola florida watch was extended eastward to apalachicola florida on october 21 voluntary evacuations occurred in southern louisiana out of fear of a storm similar to hurricane betsy in 1965 or camille earlier that year impact on land was primarily limited to minor beach erosion it caused minor damage in yucatan peninsula and in tabasco hurricane martha tropical storm martha developed in southwestern caribbean sea on november 21 initially storm developed with sustained winds of 50 mph 85 km h skipping tropical depression status it remained stationary and quickly intensified into a hurricane martha attained maximum sustained winds of 90 mph 150 km h on november 22 subsequently martha weakened and drifted southward on november 24 martha made landfall in veraguas panama as a strong tropical storm martha was only tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in panama system weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over land on november 25 because storm weakened prior to landfall strong winds were not expected or reported in impacted countries in panama more than of precipitation may have fallen in some areas agricultural land was flooded in almirante del toro and streets became inundated in low lying areas of puerto chiriqui storm also brought significant rains to costa rica flooding and mudslides isolated most of capital city of san jose numerous streets were inundated in damage in costa rica reached 30 million and 5 deaths were reported other systems in addition to 20 other tropical cyclones of season there were three minor tropical depressions first tropical depression numbered five developed on may 29 about 85 mi 135 km southeast of cutler bay florida depression tracked northeastward and passed through bahamas on abaco islands later that day after crossing bahamas depression continued northeastward and eventually dissipated southwest of bermuda on may 30 no impact was reported in bahamas also on may 29 tropical depression six developed while centered 40 mi 60 km south southwest of san andres island colombia depression headed west northwestward toward coast of nicaragua however it quickly veered away to northeast for rest of its duration depression mainly headed north or north northeastward across caribbean sea on june 1 day that 1969 atlantic hurricane season officially began tropical depression six made landfall on zapata peninsula in cuba depression dissipated early on june 2 no impact was reported in cuba or nicaragua tropical depression seven caused serious damage in cuba and jamaica as described above at 0000 utc on june 12 tropical depression eight formed about 55 mi 90 km east of cozumel quintana roo it moved west northwestward without strengthening and made landfall between playa del carmen and puerto morelos roo later that day with winds of 30 mph 45 km h depression moved slowly across yucatan peninsula until emerging into gulf of mexico along north coast of yucatan peninsula on june 14 no intensification occurred in gulf of mexico occurred and by 0000 utc on june 15 depression dissipated while located about north northeast of progreso yucatan a tropical wave situated about east of trinidad developed into tropical depression thirteen on july 25 depression moved northwestward toward lesser antilles and later that day crossed barbados with winds of 35 mph 55 km h it continued to northwest and may have struck martinique on june 26 at 0000 utc on following day depression dissipated about 30 mi 50 km west southwest of guadeloupe thumb right an unnamed hurricane on november 5 in addition to tropical depressions four additional unnamed storms existed during season a subtropical depression formed offshore north carolina on september 21 it reached subtropical storm strength that day a few days later it reached hurricane strength while moving to northeast storm dissipated on september 26 while located about south of newfoundland another storm developed from a subtropical depression southwest of azores on september 24 after drifting west southwest it moved westward and strengthened into a subtropical storm on september 25 and later a tropical storm cyclone reached its peak on september 27 while moving northward on september 29 it dissipated east of newfoundland a subtropical depression formed west southwest of azores on october 28 moving northwestward it reached tropical storm status on october 29 and soon peaked with winds of storm became extratropical to west of azores on october 31 a large extratropical storm over north atlantic formed a subtropical storm on october 31 south of newfoundland it moved southeast gaining tropical characteristics and strength on way it reached hurricane strength on november 4 peaking as a minimal category 1 storm while approaching azores but weakened prior to passing through islands
