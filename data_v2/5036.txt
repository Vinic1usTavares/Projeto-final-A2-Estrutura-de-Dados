frank spotnitz described episode as a fortunate accident late in fourth season of show gillian anderson left show for a week to film her part in film mighty producers knowing that they would have to write an episode without dana scully decided it was not fair to have david duchovny carry same workload as in a normal episode considering her absence as such a story was devised in which his involvement would be light this resulted in decision to write for second year in a row an episode focused on assistant director walter skinner mitch pileggi howard gordon having written previous skinner centric episode avatar joined spotnitz and two wrote episode over a weekend while another gordon written episode synchrony was in production writers felt that this was perfect time to bring in skinner s deal with smoking man william b davis to cure scully s cancer made in episode memento mori meisler pp 230 231 frank spotnitz said of skinner s deal hard thing for skinner was that we had to keep him in middle we had him tell mulder not to bargain with smoking man in order to save scully s life and then he himself struck a faustian bargain with cigarette smoking man and was in his debt for some kind hurwitz and knowles p 113 writing staff felt that zero sum was a logical place to bring back bees that were used in season premiere herrenvolk feeling it was important to not have something paranormal happen to skinner in this episode considering that had been done in previous season live bees were used for filming but showed up poorly in footage visual effects technician laurie kallsen george then spent nine days digitally enhancing footage to improve upon this meisler p 231 virus carrying bees would later form a central plot point in series 1998 feature film adaptation director kim manners noted that episode was a really good show for me because i had not got a chance to work with mitch and they wrote a great script you know it was really something he could sink his teeth into and he just did a great job bill davis was fabulous in that show too this was second episode of series to not feature scully first being second season episode 3 guest actor

this episode during its original airing meisler p 298 episode has received mixed to positive responses from critics zack handlen writing for a v club rated episode an a calling it utterly bad ass handlen felt that episode effectively toyed with series usual narrative structure making lead character fox mulder seem nearly as much of an antagonist as smoking man handlen also felt that zero sum gave significant insight into character of walter skinner paula vitaris writing for cinefantastique rated zero sum one and a half stars out of four noting that its pacing and tone are off vitaris felt that duchovny and pileggi give good performances despite pileggi seeming unintentionally comic at times though she noted that an episode without scully feels pretty empty robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to x files millennium lone gunmen rated episode four stars out of five noting that pileggi looks much more comfortable here than he did in last year s showcase avatar shearman and pearson felt that episode s attempts to tie into wider storylines appearance of marita covarrubias in particular are where it really stumbles noting that its success lies in shock value of seeing a deliberately familiar story through fractured view of another character shearman and pearson pp 101 102 footnotes bibliography external links category 1997
