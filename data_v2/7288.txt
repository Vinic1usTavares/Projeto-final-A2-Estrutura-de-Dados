limited mdl in india and are largest destroyers to be operated by indian navy due to delays in construction sea trials initial commissioning date of first ship of class had been pushed back from 2010 to 2014 destroyers are a follow on of project 15 s but are considerably more capable due to major improvements in design addition of substantial land attack capabilities fitting out of modern sensors

system to provide maritime domain awareness intricate power supply management is done using apms and remote control and monitoring of machinery is achieved through acs development in 1986 cabinet committee on political affairs approved a follow on class of earlier project 15 delhi class destroyers aim was that follow on class would incorporate a higher level of air defence land attack anti submarine and anti ship capabilities than preceding class however indian navy did not initially take up option kolkata class destroyer globalsecurity org by year 2000 indian navy had redesigned follow on kolkata class to incorporate even higher levels of technology including modern stealth characteristics and in may of that year approval for construction was given concept and function for project 15a was framed by navy s directorate of naval design while detailed design was developed by mazagon dock limited mdl initially in 2008 total program cost with long term spare parts was expected to cost but construction costs escalated about 225 and by 2011 cost of program became with each ship costing defense minister a k antony cited causes being delay in supply of warship grade steel by russia increase in costs of russian specialists due to inflation during build period wage revision due from october 2003 and delay in of cost of weapons and sensors a comptroller and auditor general of india report published in 2010 blamed navy for delays criticizing late decisions for replacement of surface to air missile system with barak change of gun mount inclusion of a sonar dome and modification of helicopter hangar to accommodate hal dhruv construction thumb left hull of a 15a destroyer being built at mazagon docks construction of three kolkata class ships was sanctioned by government of india in may 2000 and steel for lead ship was cut in march 2003 construction began in september 2003 at mazagon docks mumbai with an initial expectation that first of class would be handed over to navy by 2010 however since then kolkata class has suffered consecutive delays slow construction procedures and technical problems which saw first ship of class enter service during mid 2014 delays in construction programme have been attributed to persistent design changes made by indian navy to incorporate new weapons systems and sensors failure by a ukrainian shipyard to deliver ship s propellers and shafts and contract later being awarded to a russian firm and finally delay in delivery of barak 8 anti air missiles kolkata class are largest destroyers ever to be constructed at mazagon docks technical problems were found during sea trials of lead ship kolkata which delayed project by six months to early 2014 ships of class thumb ins kolkata commissioning ceremony no
