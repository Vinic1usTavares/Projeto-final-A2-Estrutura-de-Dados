his 14 show channel orange tour through north america composition sweet life is a smooth r b track with a 1970s aesthetic production was described as similar to work of stevie wonder with elements of twinkling stevie esque electric piano it moves between lush jazz funk and a cappella breakdowns featuring a massive synth stoked chorus and scoring similar to that of james bond end credit theme track was described as impressively detailed containing a below mix vocal loop warm horns handled by williams a perpetually meandering electronic keyboard line it was noted that it still managed to feel spacious and loose drawing inspiration from soul songs from 70 s live instruments were used during recording adding a more organic sense to sound ocean makes his vocal presence front center on track a move compared to pomposity of musical choreographer busby berkeley with lyrical influence from joan didion and randy newman r b singer d angelo and his album voodoo was noted as another inspiration

described as signature williams serving as a jazzy sound bed for ocean s vocal performance right thumb song draws inspiration from luxurious surroundings of ladera heights california song is set in ladera heights california declared as black beverly hills by ocean ocean referring it to black beverly hills also is probably a reference to a scene in quentin tarantino film reservoir dogs ocean compares setting to a domesticated paradise with palm trees pools whatever feels good placed in a tropical setting ocean spins a narrative of finer pleasures of high class living and how they can act as blinders to life s with lines such as you ve had a landscaper and a housekeeper since you were born sweet life paints a picture of nightmarish disillusionment within lives of rich people critiquing their lives as restless and dangerous in nature along with channel orange track super rich kids sweet life is a commentary of aimless money obsessed teenagers with parallels of bret easton ellis s less than zero track much like most of channel orange tells a story about seeming alienation while also making an argument for ways in which alienation is humorous pathetic and at times tender ocean s humor is used as a veil for frustration and regret using irony to pinpoint absurdity in things composition presents a struggle by ocean to avoid of wealth and serves as a haunting meditation on how money makes living well possible while also noting downsides it offers track has drawn comparisons to style of 808s heartbreak a studio album by rapper kanye west noted for its jarring use of auto tune plagenhoef scott review 808s heartbreak pitchfork media retrieved on 2009 08 07 west has often been noted as an influence by ocean ology writer terron r moore mused that unlike west ocean was an inherently sad guy and that feeling of inner loss and hopelessness appears on every track on album even when he s supposed to be singing about sweet life he noted a hidden sense of despair on song not immediately apparent on first listen song also contains parallels to ocean s own musical career where ocean recognizes that an album is much like a relationship main track single often is not best choice while singles are generally regarded as an album s best song ocean remarks that sometimes most obvious decision holds more subtly jason lipshutz of billboard mused that ocean took on role of a captain on track prodding privileged to reach for more by unraveling their lavish realities why see world when you got beach he asks rhetorically robert everett green of globe and mail stated that track depicts dislocated lives of easy pleasure of keepin it surreal with pills and sunshine in music that s supposedly all about feeling good reception thumb right 200px production by pharrell williams was widely praised by critics sweet life was highly praised by music critics john calvert of quietus described song as really big like r kelly s i believe i can fly big like superman eating a super hotdog while fighting king kong while ok you get picture if you were looking around for a high concept pitch style descriptor with its synth brass and philly soul strings you might call it stevie wonder meets n e r d in space but then that would be too simplistic a definition for multifaceted resolutely accomplished sweet thing pitchforks larry fitzmaurice labeled it a best new track and noted that this was a week where frank ocean bravely invited us to learn more about his personal story sweet life is another reminder of how well he can structure a narrative in musical realm telegraphs neil mccormick noted that ocean took r b genre and pushed it out into strange new places with tracks like blissful jazzy jigsaw of sweet life which seems to assemble itself from disconnected elements as it goes along allmusic s andy kellman mused that track served as one of album s lighter moments and wrote that bright sweet life and relatively exuberant monks both of which would be standouts on any n e r d album offer more than bright coating dealing in surrealism and sharp observations that are equally penetrating greg kot writer for chicago tribune stated that track seduces like a drug dealer with ocean crooning over a laid back rhythm prefix magazines david padula commented that it centers around a jazzy keyboard lick that dips regularly into more lush surroundings crisp percussion is a highlight but winning point is soulful croons and general smoothness of ocean mike powell s spin praised ocean s writing abilities musing my tv ain t hd that s too real narrator of sweet life complains then returns to his swimming pool if song wasn t so pretty ocean s velvety voice soft jazzy accompaniment you might even feel bad for him killian fox of observer

wonder onwards amy dawson critic for metro called composition an irresistibly warm slice of old school funk musicomhs laurence green praised sweet life commenting and sweet it is a joyous affirmation to living life with eyes open wide soaking up experiences of youth consequence of sounds harley brown felt that ocean did an uncanny impression of stevie wonder and placed song amongst channel orange
