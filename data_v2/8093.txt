argument from morality is an argument for existence of god arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that god is best or only explanation for this concluding that god must exist arguments from moral order are based on asserted need for moral order to exist in universe they claim that for this moral order to exist god must exist to support it argument from morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate soundness of argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta ethics german philosopher immanuel kant devised an argument from morality based on practical reason kant argued that goal of humanity is to achieve perfect happiness and virtue summum bonum and believed that an afterlife must exist in order for this to be possible and that god must exist to provide this in his book mere christianity c s lewis argued that conscience reveals to us a moral law whose source cannot be found in natural world thus pointing to a supernatural lawgiver lewis argued that accepting validity of human reason as a given must include accepting validity of practical reason which could not be valid without reference to a higher cosmic moral order which could not exist without a god to create and or establish it a related argument is from conscience john henry newman argued that conscience supports claim that objective moral truths exist because it drives people to act morally even when it is not in their own interest newman argued that because conscience suggests existence of objective moral truths god must exist to give authority to these truths contemporary defenders of argument from morality are graham ward alister mcgrath and william lane craig general form all variations of argument from morality begin with an observation about moral thought or experiences and conclude with existence of god some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim evident through human experience arguing that god is best explanation for these other versions describe some end which humans should strive to attain that is only possible if god exists many arguments from morality are based on moral normativity which suggests that objective moral truths exist and require god s existence to give them authority often they consider that morality seems to be binding obligations are seen to convey more than just a preference but imply that obligation will stand regardless of other factors or interests for morality to be binding god must exist in its most general form argument from moral normativity is a human experience of morality is observed god is best or only explanation for this moral experience therefore god exists some arguments from moral order suggest that morality is based on rationality and that this can only be case if there is a moral order in universe arguments propose that only existence of god as orthodoxly conceived could support existence of moral order in universe so god must exist alternative arguments from moral order have proposed that we have an obligation to attain perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue they attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible and achieving perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists a natural moral order requires existence of god as orthodoxly conceived so god must exist variations practical reason thumb portrait of immanuel kant who proposed an argument for existence of god from morality in his critique of pure reason german philosopher immanuel kant stated that no successful argument for god s existence arises from reason alone in his critique of practical reason he went on to argue that despite failure of these arguments morality requires that god s existence is assumed owing to practical reason oppy 2006 pp 372 373 rather than proving existence of god kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires assumption that god exists guyer 2006 p 234 kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about summum bonum two central aims of moral virtue and happiness where happiness arises out of virtue as ought implies can kant argued it must be possible for summum bonum to be achieved he accepted that it is not within power of humans to bring summum bonum about because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads to happiness so there must be a higher power who has power to create an afterlife where virtue can be rewarded by happiness philosopher g h r parkinson notes a common objection to kant s argument that what ought to be done does not necessarily entail that it is possible he also argues that alternative conceptions of morality exist which do not rely on assumptions that kant makes he cites utilitarianism as an example which does not require summum bonum parkinson 1988 p 344 nicholas everitt argues that much moral guidance is unattainable such as biblical command to be christ like he proposes that kant s first two premises only entail that we must try to achieve perfect good not that it is actually attainable everitt 2003 p 137 argument from objective moral truths both theists and non theists have accepted that existence of objective moral truths might entail existence of god atheist philosopher j l mackie accepted that if objective moral truths existed they would warrant a supernatural explanation scottish philosopher w r sorley presented following argument if morality is objective and absolute god must exist morality is objective and absolute therefore god must exist martin 1992 pp 213 214 many critics have challenged second premise of this argument by offering a biological and sociological account of development of human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute this account supported by biologist e o wilson and philosopher michael ruse proposes that human experience of morality is a by product of natural selection a theory philosopher mark d linville calls evolutionary naturalism according to theory human experience of moral obligations was result of evolutionary pressures which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development this entails that moral values do not exist independently of human mind morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce no human society today advocates immorality such as theft or murder because it would undoubtedly lead to end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring scottish empiricist david hume made a similar argument that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless craig moreland 2011 p 393 because evolutionary naturalism proposes an empirical account of morality it does not require morality to exist objectively linville considers view that this will lead to moral scepticism or antirealism craig moreland 2011 pp 393 de anna 2006 pp 24 25 c s lewis argued that if evolutionary naturalism is accepted human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong despite this lewis argued those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist leading lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent mcswain ward 2010 pp 110 111 as an alternative ethical theory lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated god with goodness and treated goodness as an essential part of reality thus asserting god s existence mcswain ward 2010 p 112 j c a gaskin challenges first premise of argument from moral objectivity arguing that it must be shown why absolute and objective morality entails that morality is commanded by god rather than simply a human invention it could be consent of humanity that gives it moral force for example american philosopher michael martin argues that it is not necessarily true that objective moral truths must entail existence of god suggesting that there could be alternative explanations he argues that naturalism may be an acceptable explanation and even if a supernatural explanation is necessary it does not have to be god polytheism is a viable alternative martin also argues that a non objective account of ethics might be acceptable and challenges view that a subjective account of morality would lead to moral anarchy william lane craig has argued for this form of moral argument https www youtube com watch v argument for conscience thumb portrait of john henry newman who used conscience as evidence of existence of god related to argument from morality is argument from conscience associated with eighteenth century bishop joseph butler and nineteenth century cardinal john henry newman newman proposed that conscience as well as giving moral guidance provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by divine he argued that is an inadequate explanation of human experience of morality because people avoid acting immorally even when it might be in their interests newman proposed that to explain conscience god must exist martin 1992 p 214 british philosopher john locke argued that moral rules cannot be established from conscience because differences in people s consciences would lead to contradictions locke also noted that conscience is influenced by education company and customs of country a criticism mounted by j l mackie who argued that conscience should be seen as an of other people into an agent s mind parkinson 1988 pp 344 345 michael martin challenges argument from conscience with a naturalistic account of conscience arguing that naturalism provides an adequate explanation for conscience without need for god s existence he uses example of internalization by humans of social pressures which leads to fear of going against these norms even if a supernatural cause is required he argues it could be something other than god this would mean that phenomenon of conscience is no more supportive of monotheism than polytheism c
