maneater was filmed in winnipeg manitoba canada film uses no cgi special effects at all with killer tiger portrayed by actual trained tigers in scenes where tiger is chasing various characters tiger

demand earlier in 2007 before it aired in united states on sci fi channel on september 8 2007 as its saturday night movie of week premiere on january 8 2008 genius entertainment released film on dvd it included no extras an anamorphic widescreen transfer and a dolby digital 5 1 audio track film was re released on july 22 2008 as part of first volume of maneater series collection sets volume also included blood monkey and in spider s web first and second films in series respectively reception as with many other films in series maneater was panned by critics felix gonzalez jr of com referred to film as another z grade extravaganza of gore and mayhem and felt that it was typical of most sci fi original movies in that it contained horrendous writing and nonsensical characters he considered busey s being headliner was first sign of trouble stating that with his ill fitting suit and incomprehensible facial expressions busey is actually more frightening than tiger matt from blogcritics felt original novel was superior to its film adaptation and felt movie was an appallingly bad creature feature that barely qualifies as such with multiple plot holes unexplored subplots and stereotypical characters plagued by bad acting staci layne wilson of horror com also felt film was full of stereotypes including a stupid circus trainer bible thumping great white hunter small minded mayor press wise indian sage and military sorts but felt they were depicted in such an extreme manner that they were simply boring she found films conclusion to be predictable and corny she did praise film s cinematography and visual appeal despite limited number of filming locations actually used in reviewing film for dvd talk film instructor and critic justin felix found use of a real tiger one of only original elements of film while feeling plot setting and characters followed set sci fi channel movie of week formula at same time he notes that use of a live tiger results in most attacks occurring off screen and tiger being rarely seen at all taking away usual fun of laughing at badly done cg terrors monsters and critics com s jeff swindoll felt film was a poor attempt at replicating jaws with tiger taking on role of a land shark while he felt character of colonel graham was contrived and seemed to come from another era swindoll did think ian d clark did portray character decently like other critics swindoll praised use of a live tiger but also notes that it was obvious tiger was playing with actors like a sweet pussycat and that post production editing did a bad job of trying to make it look like tiger was a vicious killer several reviewers praised film for being more subdued than most of sci fi s gore filled creature films and for its use of a live tiger rather than poor cgi effects however david johnson of dvd verdict heavily criticized film for its significant dearth of righteous tiger attack action he found implied violence resulted in a boring film that will not satisfy more horror film buff gore hounds that might be attracted to promise of a big ass tiger sinking his teeth into some hapless rednecks will be almost certainly disappointed big bummer is that we don t even get any tiger on human direct action until very end and that s boilerplate lassie stuff with a stuntman fending off a laid back stunt tiger conversely unlike other reviewers he praised characters feeling they were interesting and ended up being ones he somewhat cared about references external links official sonar entertainment maneater website official genius entertainment maneater
