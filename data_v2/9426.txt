lactarius vinaceorufescens commonly known as yellow staining milkcap or yellow latex milky is a poisonous species of fungus in family russulaceae it produces mushrooms with pinkish cinnamon caps up to wide held by pinkish white stems up to long closely spaced whitish to pinkish buff gills develop wine red spots in age when it is cut or injured mushroom oozes a white latex that rapidly turns bright sulfur yellow species common and widely distributed in north america grows in ground in association with conifer trees there are several other lactarius species that bear resemblance to l vinaceorufescens but most can be distinguished by differences in staining reactions macroscopic characteristics or habitat taxonomy and classification species was first described by american mycologists lexemuel ray hesler and alexander h smith in 1960 based on specimens collected in muskegon michigan in 1936 in same publication they also named variety lactarius vinaceorufescens var to account for individuals with prominently projecting pleurocystidia measuring 9 12 um broad but they reduced this to synonymy with main species in their 1979 monograph of north american lactarius species hesler and smith 1979 pp 317 19 fungus is classified in subsection of subgenus in genus lactarius along with other species with latex that stains fruit body tissue yellow or with latex that slowly become yellow upon exposure to air hesler and smith 1979 pp 304 5 specific epithet vinaceorufescens is derived from latin word meaning becoming wine reddish mushroom is commonly known as yellow latex milky or yellow staining milkcap description thumb 180px left latex rapidly turns yellow upon exposure to air cap of l vinaceorufescens is initially convex then becomes broadly convex to nearly flat and reaches diameters of wide cap margin is rolled inwards at first but later expands becoming somewhat uplifted and uneven with age cap surface is smooth pale pinkish cinnamon with pinkish buff at margin when young becoming darker pinkish cinnamon to orangey cinnamon when older faintly zoned with bands or water spots of nearly same color gills are attached to slightly decurrent narrow close together and often forked near stem there are several tiers of lamellulae short gills that do not fully extend to stem from cap margin gills are initially whitish to pinkish buff later spotting wine red vinaceous to pinkish brown or dark reddish brown latex that is exuded when mushroom is cut or injured is initially white but rapidly turns sulfur yellow stem is long by thick nearly equal in width throughout or enlarged slightly downward and hollow stem surface is nearly smooth with white to brownish stiff hairs at base pinkish white overall and darkening with age flesh is moderately thick white to pinkish staining bright sulfur yellow it has an acrid taste spore print is white to yellowish mushrooms are poisonous as a general rule several guide books recommend to avoid consumption of lactarius species with latex that turns yellow spores are roughly spherical to broadly ellipsoid hyaline translucent amyloid and measure 6 5 9 by 6 7 um they are ornamented with warts and ridges that sometimes form a partial reticulum with prominences up to 0 8 um basidia spore bearing cells are four spored and measure 28 33 by 8 10 um pleurocystidia cystidia found on gill faces are roughly cylindrical to narrowly club shaped when they are young but soon broaden in mid portion and taper to an abrupt point they reach dimensions of 40 68 up to 80 um by 9 13 um cheilocystidia cystidia on gill edges are roughly club shaped or ventricose with acute apices and measure 32 44 by 6 10 um clamp connections are absent in hyphae cap cuticle is a thin ixocutis composed of gelatinous hyphae that are typically 2 4 um wide projecting out from cuticle surface are ends of numerous connective hyphae about 5 15 um long similar species thumb 160px right lactarius chrysorrheus also produces yellow latex lactarius has nearly identical microscopic features to l vinaceorufescens but macroscopically it does not have reddish vinaceous stains that develop on cap gills and stem of l vinaceorufescens and it grows on ground under oak another lookalike is l but it may be distinguished from l vinaceorufescens by several features a smaller fruit body a whitish cap that becomes brownish red with age and does not spot vinaceous or brown bitter to faintly acrid latex and slightly smaller spores l chrysorrheus is also similar but it has a whitish to pale yellowish cinnamon cap with slightly darker spots and grows under hardwoods especially oak on well drained often sandy soil and its gills do not discolor or spot vinaceous or brown other superficially similar species include l rubrilacteus l rufus l l fragilis and l but none of these species have yellow staining reaction characteristic of l vinaceorufescens edible species lactarius has an orange brown to light grayish brown cap with thin bands of dark grayish brown a watery latex and whitish to tan flesh with an odor resembling maple sugar or burnt sugar lactarius sulfur milk lactarius has an oranger cap and white latex that slowly changes yellow upon exposure to air it is typically found in broadleaf and mixed woods habitat and distribution thumb 190px right foreground specimen has stiff white hairs at base of stem fruit bodies of lactarius vinaceorufescens grow scattered or in groups on ground under pine between august and october species is known to develop mycorrhizal associations with douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii it is a fairly common and widely distributed species in north america mushroom has been found in boreal forests and high elevation forests of southern appalachians associated with tree genera picea abies and pinus in california it has been noted to commonly co occur with l fragilis l rubrilacteus russula and r see also list of lactarius species references cited text external links youtube video of
