performer had image of an action hero while his casting was made public in a november 2003 news report announcing project s inception director revealed that vikram was added to cast in mid 2003 and

her call sheet shankar eventually offered role to sadha expressing hope that it would be an important movie in her career sadha accepted offer working on film for 120 days adding i have a major role to play in anniyan there are few heavy portions involving me in movie that i have given my best she considered being a part of a shankar film especially during early stages of her career as a god s

tapped i don t want to be part of such cinema where all one has to do is dance around trees vivek prakash raj nedumudi venu and nassar appear in supporting roles mohan a carnatic vocalist and

scenes no one could miss him for roles that have some ambiguity about whether it s a good guy or a bad guy he is one of best choices until end one cannot really guess if he ll end up being good or bad comedian and character artiste charle played an unnamed wastrel and alcoholic who extorts money from his ageing parents for his expenses and is considered by anniyan to be a liability to society charle was instructed by shankar people should see only character only later should they realise that it was charle role of younger ambi was played by child actor hari prashanth alias viraj when he came to recording studio to voice his lines he was accompanied by his father s n surendar a singer and dubbing artiste shankar recognised surendar and asked him to lend his voice for nedumudi venu as

re takes where necessary to make scenes better and gave suggestions but left ultimate verdict to director disclosing that among three shades to his character he found playing ambi to be toughest he reasoned because as a hero you are not used to being a wimp on screen it s difficult digesting getting beaten up in contrast being a graduate in english literature he found playing remo much easier and more in his comfort zone in an interview with gulf news vikram spoke of challenges in portraying all three characters while wearing same costumes he said i love such challenges although costume defined each of three characters in anniyan there were scenes where ambi would suddenly become remo and remo would become anniyan there i made it dramatic to bring out each character he credited his wife shailaja balakrishnan a psychologist for helping him in fleshing out character of ambi a person who has multiple personality disorder in a conversation with film critic baradwaj rangan shailaja recalled times film was being made and spoke of vikram saying i felt we should live in two houses it s not easy to live with a man who can get that eccentric an actor who wants to be that difficult on himself i wouldn t say he becomes character but there s definitely some kind of vikram confessed that he had a tough time during film s making as playing different characters affected him and he found himself going mad he added that he would take a break after a 15 day shoot and watch pigeons on his terrace as a way of dealing with pressure vikram grew a tummy to portray ramanujam while he sported a macho look for anniyan he also grew his hair long in preparation for his role and rejected other film offers to maintain continuity in his looks together with his character looks and those that he sported in song sequences vikram appears in film in 18 different getups vikram s look in film was created by make up artiste banu for those parts that show him as metrosexual remo he coloured his hair

conventions in music making anniyan too proves his relentless quest for freshness sreedhar pillai of hindu said that audio was impressive with a combination of peppy songs and semi classical numbers that will appeal to all another music critic pointed out that songs in shankar s films become a rage only after release of films as his lavish picturisation enriches music comparing music with those of rahman s in shankar s previous films krishnakumar of rediff com said jayaraj doesn t disappoint but while arr wafted and lingered jayaraj explodes and fizzles away and iyengar veetu azhage try to seep into your head and tempts you to tap your feet but only momentarily you won t recollect them once songs are over music was received well by audience and tracks kadhal yaanai and kannum kannum

interesting screen line with racy action she also noted that story resembled shankar s indian 1996 a lot while also bearing semblance to his gentleman 1993 she remarked that story and screenplay deserved to be lauded for its ingenious sparks in narration but problems arose with respect to its plausibility she then declared some of best camera shots stunts and locations on a mind boggling scale have been showcased if you enjoy magnificence in cinema you will like this anniyan krishnakumar wrote for rediff com that learning from debacle of boys director went back to his strength by taking a social theme spicing it up and serving perfect commercial fare he added that in trying to explain multiple personality disorder in simplest of terms director has only succeeded to a certain extent as a majority of viewers who are not that well informed might not even comprehend what is being said labelling film as a must see a reviewer at sify acclaimed that film holds viewers riveted with its racy narration a relevant message backed with technical wizardry never seen before colourful song picturisation and particularly performance of vikram yet reviewer criticised that film was too lengthy and story too thin on logic reviewing aparichithudu telugu version of film hindu said that it was watchable regarding hindi version of film raja sen of rediff com derided pathetic dubbing though saying that it was refreshing and watchable despite boasting of enough masala to make viewers sneeze he concluded his review by saying overall aparichit is a slickly made well paced actioner that works quite well despite dub film is engaging and crisply scripted and action is never too excessive lightened by jokes and general tomfoolery that never offensively interrupts actual plot awards and nominations following commercial success of telugu version aparichitudu which was a runaway hit in andhra pradesh shankar was by sri venkateswara social and cultural organisation of tirupati and was conferred title brahma in a conversation with athlete shiny wilson actor jayaram remarked anniyan was a runaway hit in kerala but if a malayalam star had tried out an anniyan kind of role with a
