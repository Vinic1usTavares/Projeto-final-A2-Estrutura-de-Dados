minister of army general korechika anami minister of navy admiral mitsumasa yonai chief of army general staff general yoshijiro umezu chief of navy general staff admiral koshiro oikawa later replaced by admiral soemu toyoda all of these positions were nominally appointed by emperor and their holders were answerable directly to him nevertheless japanese civil law from 1936 required that army and navy ministers had to be active duty flag officers from those respective services while japanese military law from long before that time prohibited serving officers from accepting political offices without first obtaining permission from their respective service headquarters which if and when granted could be rescinded at any time thus japanese army and navy effectively held a legal right to nominate or refuse to nominate their respective ministers in addition to effective right to order their respective ministers to resign their posts strict constitutional convention dictated as it technically still does today that a prospective prime minister could not assume premiership nor could an incumbent prime minister remain in office if he could not fill all of cabinet posts thus army and navy could prevent formation of undesirable governments or by resignation bring about collapse of an existing government frank 86 spector 33 emperor hirohito and lord keeper of privy seal koichi kido also were present at some meetings following emperor s wishes exact role of emperor has been a subject of much historical debate following pm suzuki s orders many key pieces of evidence were destroyed in days between japan s surrender and start of allied occupation starting in 1946 following constitution of tokyo tribunal imperial family began to argue that hirohito was a powerless figurehead which brought some historians to accept this point of view others like herbert bix john w dower akira fujiwara and yoshiaki yoshimi argue that he actively ruled from behind scenes according to richard frank neither of these polar positions is accurate and truth appears to lie somewhere in between frank 87 as iris chang reports japanese deliberately destroyed hid or falsified most of

navy minister was known to desire an early end to war frank 92 according to historian richard b frank after war suzuki and others from his government and their apologists claimed they were secretly working towards peace and could not publicly advocate it they cite japanese concept of art of hidden and invisible technique to justify dissonance between their public actions and alleged behind scenes work however many historians reject this robert j c butow wrote japanese leaders had always envisioned a negotiated settlement to war their prewar planning expected a rapid expansion and consolidation an eventual conflict with united states and finally a settlement in which they would be able to retain at least some new territory they had conquered spector 44 45 by 1945 japan s leaders were in agreement that war was going badly but they disagreed over best means to negotiate its end there were two camps so called peace camp favored a diplomatic initiative to persuade joseph stalin leader of soviet union to mediate a settlement between allies and japan and hardliners who favored fighting one last decisive battle that would inflict so many casualties on allies that they would be willing to offer more lenient terms both approaches were based on japan s experience in russo japanese war forty years earlier which consisted of a series of costly but largely indecisive battles followed by decisive naval battle of tsushima frank 89 thumb upright left as prime minister admiral kantaro suzuki headed japanese government in final months of war in february 1945 prince

against japan was also discussed in detail truman learned of successful trinity test early in conference and shared this information with british delegation in discussing manhattan project among themselves american and british delegations were keenly aware that they were in soviet controlled territory and took precautions to avoid revealing information to soviets via listening devices they had presumed to be planted throughout conference buildings successful test caused american delegation to reconsider necessity and wisdom of soviet participation for which u s had lobbied hard at

possibly allowing soviets to capture territory beyond that which had been promised to them at tehran and yalta and causing a postwar division of japan similar to that which had occurred in germany american officials meeting in washington on august 10 1945 decided that a useful dividing line between u s and soviet administrative occupation zones would be 38th parallel across midsection of korean peninsula thereby leaving korea s central city seoul within u s zone this arrangement was suggested to soviet side shortly after ussr entered both pacific war and korean peninsula soviets accepted that dividing line even though their attempt to obtain a corresponding northern japan occupation zone on island of hokkaido was rejected by washington edward a olsen korea divided nation greenwood publishing group 2005 page 62 in dealing with stalin truman decided to give soviet leader vague hints about existence of a powerful new weapon without going into details however other allies were unaware that soviet intelligence had penetrated manhattan project in its early stages so stalin already knew of existence of atomic bomb but did not appear impressed by its potential rhodes 690 potsdam declaration it was decided to issue a statement potsdam declaration defining unconditional surrender and clarifying what it meant for position of emperor and for hirohito personally american and british governments strongly disagreed on this point united states wanted to abolish position and possibly try him as a war criminal while british wanted to retain position perhaps with hirohito still reigning furthermore although it would not initially be a party to declaration soviet government also had to be consulted since it would be expected to endorse it upon entering war potsdam

established in accordance with freely expressed will of japanese people a peacefully inclined and responsible government only use of term unconditional surrender came at end of declaration we call upon government of japan to proclaim now unconditional surrender of all japanese armed forces and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action alternative for japan is prompt and utter destruction contrary to what had been intended at its conception declaration made no mention of emperor at all allied intentions on issues of utmost importance to japanese including whether hirohito was to be regarded as one of those who had misled people of japan or even a war criminal or alternatively whether emperor might become part of a peacefully inclined and responsible government were thus left unstated prompt and utter destruction clause has been interpreted as a veiled warning about american possession of atomic bomb which had been tested successfully on first day of conference hasegawa 118 119 on other hand declaration also made specific references to devastation that had been wrought upon germany in closing stages of european war to contemporary readers on both sides who were not yet aware of atomic bomb s existence it was easy to interpret conclusion of declaration simply as a threat to bring similar destruction upon japan using conventional weapons japanese reaction on july 27 japanese government considered how to respond to declaration four military members of big six wanted to reject it but togo acting under mistaken impression that soviet government had no prior knowledge of its contents persuaded cabinet not to do so until he could get a reaction from moscow in a telegram shun ichi kase japan s ambassador to switzerland observed that
