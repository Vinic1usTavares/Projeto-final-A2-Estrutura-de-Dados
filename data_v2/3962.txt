operation barbarossa was code name for axis invasion of soviet union which started on sunday 22 june 1941 during world war ii operation put into action nazi germany s ideological goal of conquering western soviet union so as to repopulate it with germans german generalplan ost aimed to use some of conquered as slave labour for axis war effort to acquire oil reserves of caucasus and agricultural resources of soviet territories and eventually to annihilate slavic peoples and create for germany in two years leading up to invasion germany and soviet union signed political and economic pacts for strategic purposes nevertheless german high command began planning an invasion of soviet union in july 1940 under codename operation otto which adolf hitler authorized on 18 december 1940 over course of operation about three million personnel of axis powers largest invasion force in history of warfare invaded western soviet union along a front with 600 000 motor vehicles and over 600 000 horses for non combat operations offensive marked an escalation of world war ii both geographically and in formation of allied coalition including soviet union operation opened up eastern front in which more forces were committed than in any other theater of war in history area saw of some of war s largest battles most horrific atrocities and highest casualties for soviet and axis forces alike all of which influenced course of world war ii and subsequent history of 20th century german armies eventually captured some 5 000 000 soviet red army troops a majority of whom never returned alive nazis deliberately starved to death or otherwise killed 3 3 million soviet prisoners of war and a vast number of civilians as hunger plan worked to exterminate slavic population mass shootings and gassing operations carried out by nazis or willing collaborators murdered over a million soviet jews as part of holocaust failure of operation barbarossa reversed fortunes of third reich operationally german forces achieved significant victories and occupied some of most important economic areas of soviet union mainly in ukraine and inflicted as well as sustained heavy casualties despite these early successes german offensive stalled in battle of moscow at end of 1941 and subsequent soviet winter counteroffensive pushed german troops back germans had confidently expected a quick collapse of soviet resistance as in poland but red army absorbed german wehrmacht s strongest blows and bogged it down in a war of attrition for which germans were unprepared wehrmacht s diminished forces could no longer attack along entire eastern front and subsequent operations such as case blue in 1942 and operation citadel in 1943 eventually failed which resulted in wehrmacht s retreat and collapse background racial policies of nazi germany as early as 1925 adolf hitler vaguely declared in his political manifesto and autobiography mein kampf that he would invade soviet union asserting that german people needed to secure lebensraum living space to ensure survival of germany for generations to come on 10 february 1939 hitler told his army commanders that next war would be purely a war of totally a people s war a racial war on 23 november once world war ii had already started hitler declared that racial war has broken out and this war shall determine who shall govern europe and with it world racial policy of nazi germany portrayed soviet union and all of eastern europe as populated by non aryan untermenschen sub humans ruled by jewish bolshevik conspirators hitler claimed in mein kampf that germany s destiny was to turn to east as it did six hundred years ago see ostsiedlung accordingly it was stated nazi policy to kill deport or enslave majority of russian and other slavic populations and repopulate land with germanic peoples under generalplan ost nazis belief in their ethnic superiority pervades official records and pseudoscientific articles in german periodicals on topics such as how to deal with alien populations thumb 200px plan of new german settlement colonies marked with dots and diamonds drawn up by friedrich wilhelm university institute of agriculture in berlin 1942 while older histories tended to emphasize notion of a clean wehrmacht upholding its honor in face of hitler s fanaticism historian jurgen forster notes that in fact military commanders were caught up in ideological character of conflict and involved in its implementation as willing participants before and during invasion of soviet union german troops were heavily indoctrinated with anti bolshevik anti semitic and anti slavic ideology via movies radio lectures books and leaflets likening soviets to forces of genghis khan hitler told croatian military leader slavko kvaternik that mongolian race threatened europe following invasion wehrmacht officers told their soldiers to target people who were described as jewish bolshevik subhumans mongol hordes asiatic flood and red beast nazi propaganda portrayed war against soviet union as both an ideological war between german national socialism and jewish bolshevism and a racial war between disciplined germans and jewish gypsy and slavic untermenschen an order from fuhrer stated that einsatzgruppen were to execute all soviet functionaries who were less valuable asiatics gypsies and jews six months into invasion of soviet union einsatzgruppen had already murdered in excess of 500 000 soviet jews a figure greater than number of red army soldiers killed in combat during that time german army commanders cast jews as major cause behind partisan struggle main guideline for german troops was where there s a partisan there s a jew and where there s a jew there s a partisan or partisan is where jew is many german troops viewed war in nazi terms and regarded their soviet enemies as sub human after war began nazis issued a ban on sexual relations between germans and foreign slave workers there were regulations enacted against ost arbeiter eastern workers that included death penalty for sexual relations with a german heinrich himmler in his secret memorandum reflections on treatment of peoples of alien races in east dated 25 may 1940 outlined nazi plans for non german populations in east himmler believed germanization process in eastern europe would be complete when in east dwell only men with truly german germanic blood thumb left heinrich himmler rudolf hess and reinhard heydrich listening to konrad meyer at a generalplan ost exhibition 20 march 1941 nazi secret plan generalplan ost general plan for east prepared in 1941 and confirmed in 1942 called for a new order of ethnographical relations in territories occupied by nazi germany in eastern europe it envisaged ethnic cleansing executions and enslavement of populations of conquered countries with very small percentages undergoing germanization expulsion into depths of russia or other fates while conquered territories would be germanized plan was had two parts kleine planung small plan which covered actions to be taken during war and grosse planung large plan which covered policies after war was won to be implemented gradually over 25 to 30 years a speech given by general erich hoepner demonstrates dissemination of nazi racial plan as he informed 4th panzer group that war against soviet union was an essential part of german people s struggle for existence also referring to imminent battle as old struggle of germans against slavs and even stated struggle must aim at annihilation of today s russia and must therefore be waged with unparalleled harshness hoepner also added that germans were fighting for defense of european culture against asiatic inundation and repulse of jewish bolshevism no adherents of present russian bolshevik system are to be spared walther von brauchitsch also told his subordinates that troops should view war as a struggle between two different races and should act with necessary severity racial motivations were central to nazi ideology and played a key role in planning for operation barbarossa since both jews and communists were considered equivalent enemies of nazi state nazi imperialist ambitions rejected common humanity of both groups declaring supreme struggle for lebensraum to be a vernichtungskrieg war of annihilation german soviet relations of 1939 40 thumb geopolitical disposition of europe in 1941 immediately before start of operation barbarossa grey area represents nazi germany its allies and countries under its firm control in august 1939 germany and soviet union signed a non aggression pact in moscow known as molotov ribbentrop pact a secret protocol to pact outlined an agreement between germany and soviet union on division of eastern european border states between their respective spheres of influence soviet union and germany would partition poland in event of an invasion by germany and soviets would be allowed to overrun baltic states and finland on 23 august 1939 rest of world learned of this pact but were unaware of provisions to partition poland pact stunned world because of parties earlier mutual hostility and their conflicting ideologies conclusion of this pact was followed by german invasion of poland on 1 september that triggered outbreak of world war ii in europe then soviet invasion of poland that led to annexation of eastern part of country as a result of pact germany and soviet union maintained reasonably strong diplomatic relations for two years and fostered an important economic relationship countries entered a trade pact in 1940 by which soviets received german military equipment and trade goods in exchange for raw materials such as oil and wheat to help nazis circumvent a british blockade of germany despite parties ostensibly cordial relations each side was highly suspicious of other s intentions for instance soviet invasion of bukovina in june 1940 went beyond their sphere of influence as agreed with germany after germany entered axis pact with japan and italy it began negotiations about a potential soviet entry into pact after two days of negotiations in berlin from 12 to 14 november 1940 germany presented a written proposal for a soviet entry into axis on 25 november 1940 soviet union offered a written counter proposal to join axis if germany would agree to refrain from interference in soviet union s sphere of influence but germany did not respond as both sides began colliding with each other in eastern europe conflict appeared more likely although they did sign a border and commercial agreement addressing several open issues in january 1941 according to historian robert service joseph stalin was convinced that overall military strength of ussr was such that he had nothing to fear and anticipated an easy victory should germany attack moreover stalin believed that since germans were still fighting british in west hitler would be unlikely to open up a two front war and subsequently delayed reconstruction of defensive fortifications in border regions when german soldiers swam across bug river to warn red army of an impending attack they were treated like enemy agents and shot some historians believe that stalin despite providing an amicable front to hitler did not wish to remain allies with germany rather stalin might have had intentions to break off from germany and proceed with his own campaign against germany to be followed by one against rest of europe german invasion plans thumb marcks plan was original german plan of attack for operation barbarossa as depicted in a us government study march 1955 stalin s reputation as a brutal dictator contributed both to nazis justification of their assault and their faith in success many competent and experienced military officers had been killed in great purge of 1930s leaving red army with a relatively inexperienced leadership compared to that of their german adversary nazis often emphasized soviet regime s brutality when targeting slavs with propaganda they also claimed that red army was preparing to attack germans and their own invasion was thus presented as a pre emptive strike in middle of 1940 following rising tension between soviet union and germany over territories in balkans an eventual invasion of soviet union seemed only solution to hitler while no concrete plans had yet been made hitler told one of his generals in june that victories in western europe finally freed his hands for a showdown with bolshevism with successful end to campaign in france general erich marcks was assigned task of drawing up initial invasion plans of soviet union first battle plans were entitled operation draft east colloquially known as marcks plan his report advocated a a line as operational objective of any invasion of soviet union this assault would extend from northern city of arkhangelsk on arctic sea through gorky and rostov to port city of astrakhan at mouth of volga on caspian sea report concluded that once established this military border would reduce threat to germany from attacks by enemy bombers although hitler was warned by his general staff that occupying western russia would create more of a drain than a relief for germany s economic situation he anticipated compensatory benefits such as demobilization of entire divisions to relieve acute labor shortage in german industry exploitation of ukraine as a reliable and immense source of agricultural products use of forced labor to stimulate germany s overall economy and expansion of territory to improve germany s efforts to isolate united kingdom hitler was convinced that britain would sue for peace once germans triumphed in soviet union and if they did not he would use resources available in east to defeat british empire on 5 december 1940 hitler received final military plans for invasion on which german high command had been working since july 1940 under codename operation otto hitler however was dissatisfied with these plans and on 18 december issued fuhrer directive 21 which called for a new battle plan now code named operation barbarossa operation was named after medieval emperor frederick barbarossa of holy roman empire a leader of third crusade in 12th century on 30 march 1941 barbarossa decree declared that war would be one of extermination and advocated eradication of all political and intellectual elites invasion was set for 15 may 1941 though it was delayed for over a month to allow for further preparations and possibly better weather see reasons for delay according to a 1978 essay by german historian andreas hillgruber invasion plans drawn up by german military elite were coloured by hubris stemming from rapid defeat of france at hands of invincible wehrmacht and by traditional german stereotypes of russia as a primitive backward asiatic country red army soldiers were considered brave and tough but officer corps was held in contempt leadership of wehrmacht paid little attention to politics culture and considerable industrial capacity of soviet union in favour of a very narrow military view hillgruber argued that because these assumptions were shared by entire military elite hitler was able to push through with a war of annihilation that would be waged in most inhumane fashion possible with complicity of several military leaders even though it was quite clear that this would be in violation of all accepted norms of warfare in autumn 1940 high ranking german officials drafted a memorandum on dangers of an invasion of soviet union they said ukraine belorussia and baltic states would end up as only a further economic burden for germany it was argued that soviets in their current bureaucratic form were harmless and that occupation would not benefit germany hitler disagreed with economists about risks and told his right hand man hermann goring chief of luftwaffe that he would no longer listen to misgivings about economic dangers of a war with russia it is speculated that this was passed on to general georg thomas who had produced reports that predicted a net economic drain for germany in event of an invasion of soviet union unless its economy was captured intact and caucasus oilfields seized in first blow thomas revised his future report to fit hitler s wishes red army s ineptitude in winter war against finland in 1939 40 convinced hitler of a quick victory within a few months neither hitler nor general staff anticipated a long campaign lasting into winter and therefore adequate preparations such as distribution of warm clothing and of vehicles and lubricants were not made beginning in march 1941 goring s green folder laid out details for soviet economy after conquest hunger plan outlined how entire urban population of conquered territories was to be starved to death thus creating an agricultural surplus to feed germany and urban space for german upper class nazi policy aimed to destroy soviet union as a political entity in accordance with geopolitical lebensraum ideals for benefit of future generations of nordic master race in 1941 nazi ideologue alfred rosenberg later appointed reich minister of occupied eastern territories suggested that conquered soviet territory should be administered in following reich administrative subdivisions of conquered soviet territory as envisaged and then partially realized by alfred countries and enlarged eastwards to russia and caucasus metropolitan area and remaining european asian republics and territories german military planners also researched napoleon s failed invasion of russia in their calculations they concluded that there was little danger of a large scale retreat of red army into russian interior as it could not afford to give up baltic states ukraine or moscow and leningrad regions all of which were vital to red army for supply reasons and would thus have to be defended hitler and his generals disagreed on where germany should focus its energy hitler in many discussions with his generals repeated his order of leningrad first donbass second moscow third but he consistently emphasized destruction of red army over achievement of specific terrain objectives hitler believed moscow to be of no great importance in defeat of soviet union and instead believed victory would come with destruction of red army west of capital especially west of western dvina and dnieper rivers and this pervaded plan for barbarossa this belief later led to disputes between hitler and several german senior officers including heinz guderian gerhard engel fedor von bock and franz halder who believed decisive victory could only be delivered at moscow they were unable to sway hitler who had grown overconfident in his own military judgment as a result of rapid successes in western europe petroleum albert speer said that oil had been a major factor in decision to invade soviet union hitler believed that oil resources were essential for survival of third reich as a dearth of oil resources was a vulnerability for germany s military german preparations thumb left elements of german 3rd panzer army on road near june 1941 germans had begun massing troops near soviet border even before campaign in balkans had finished by third week of february 1941 680 000 german soldiers were gathered in assembly areas on romanian soviet border in preparation for attack hitler had secretly moved upwards of 3 million german troops and approximately 690 000 axis soldiers to soviet border regions additional luftwaffe operations included numerous aerial surveillance missions over soviet territory many months before attack although soviet high command was alarmed by this stalin s belief that third reich was unlikely to attack only two years after signing molotov ribbentrop pact resulted in a slow soviet preparation this fact aside soviets did not entirely overlook threat of their german neighbor well before german invasion marshal semyon timoshenko referred to germans as soviet union s most important and strongest enemy and as early as july 1940 red army chief of staff boris shaposhnikov produced a preliminary three pronged plan of attack for what a german invasion might look like remarkably similar to actual attack since april 1941 germans had begun setting up operation and operation to substantiate their claims that britain was real target these simulated preparations in norway and english channel coast included activities such as ship concentrations reconnaissance flights and training exercises reasons for postponement of barbarossa from initially planned date of 15 may to actual invasion date of 22 june 1941 a 38 day delay are debated reason most commonly cited is unforeseen contingency of invading yugoslavia in april 1941 historian thomas b buell indicates that finland and romania which weren t involved in initial german planning needed additional time to prepare to participate in invasion buell adds that an unusually wet winter kept rivers at full flood until late spring floods may have discouraged an earlier attack even if they occurred before end of balkans campaign thumb upright okh commander field marshal walther von brauchitsch and hitler study maps during early days of hitler s russian campaign importance of delay is still debated in 1990 william shirer argued that hitler s balkan campaign had delayed commencement of barbarossa by several weeks and thereby jeopardized it many later historians argue that 22 june start date was sufficient for german offensive to reach moscow by september antony beevor wrote in 2012 about delay caused by german attacks in balkans that most historians accept that it made little difference to eventual outcome of barbarossa germans deployed one independent regiment one separate motorized training brigade and 153 divisions for barbarossa which included 104 infantry 19 panzer and 15 motorized infantry divisions in three army groups nine security divisions to operate in conquered territories four divisions in finland and two divisions as reserve under direct control of okh these were equipped with 6 867 armored vehicles of which 3 350 3 795 were tanks 2 770 4 389 aircraft that amounted to 65 percent of luftwaffe 7 200 23 435 artillery pieces 17 081 mortars about 600 000 motor vehicles and 625 000 700 000 horses finland slated 14 divisions for invasion and romania offered 13 divisions and eight brigades over course of barbarossa entire axis forces 3 8 million personnel deployed across a front extending from arctic ocean southward to black sea were all controlled by okh and organized into army norway army group north army group center and army group south alongside three air fleets air force equivalent of army groups that supported army groups luftflotte 1 for north luftflotte 2 for center and luftflotte 4 for south army norway was to operate in far northern scandinavia and bordering soviet territories army group north was to march through baltic states into northern russia either take or destroy city of leningrad and link up with finnish forces army group center army group equipped with most armour and air power was to strike from poland into belorussia and west central regions of russia proper and advance to smolensk and then moscow army group south was to strike heavily populated and agricultural heartland of ukraine taking kiev before continuing eastward over steppes of southern ussr to volga with aim of controlling oil rich caucasus army group south was deployed in two sections separated by a gap northern section which contained army group s only panzer group was in southern poland right next to army group center and southern section was in romania german forces in rear mostly waffen ss and einsatzgruppen units were to operate in conquered territories to counter any partisan activity in areas they controlled as well as to execute captured soviet political commissars and jews on 17 june reich main security office rsha chief reinhard heydrich briefed around thirty to fifty einsatzgruppen commanders on policy of eliminating jews in soviet territories at least in general terms while einsatzgruppen were assigned to wehrmacht s units which provided them with supplies such as gasoline and food they were controlled by rsha official plan for barbarossa assumed that army groups would be able to advance freely to their primary objectives simultaneously without spreading thin once they had won border battles and destroyed red army s forces in border area soviet preparations in 1930 mikhail tukhachevsky a prominent military theorist in tank warfare in interwar period and later marshal of soviet union forwarded a memo to kremlin that lobbied for colossal investment in resources required for mass production of weapons pressing case for 40 000 aircraft and 50 000 tanks in early 1930s a modern operational doctrine for red army was developed and promulgated in 1936 field regulations in form of deep battle concept defense expenditure also grew rapidly from just 12 percent of gross national product in 1933 to 18 percent by 1940 during stalin s great purge in late 1930s which had not ended by time of german invasion on 22 june 1941 much of officer corps of red army was executed or imprisoned and their replacements appointed by stalin for political reasons often lacked military competence of five marshals of soviet union appointed in 1935 only kliment voroshilov and semyon survived stalin s purge tukhachevsky was killed in 1937 fifteen of 16 army commanders 50 of 57 corps commanders 154 of 186 divisional commanders and 401 of 456 colonels were killed and many other officers were dismissed in total about 30 000 red army personnel were executed stalin further underscored his control by reasserting role of political commissars at divisional level and below to oversee political loyalty of army to regime commissars held a position equal to that of commander of unit they were overseeing but in spite of efforts to ensure political subservience of armed forces in wake of red army s poor performance in poland and in winter war about 80 percent of officers dismissed during great purge were reinstated by 1941 also between january 1939 and may 1941 161 new divisions were activated therefore although about 75 percent of all officers had been in their position for less than one year at start of german invasion of 1941 many of short tenures can be attributed not only to purge but also to rapid increase in creation of military units thumb upright semyon timoshenko and georgy zhukov in 1940 in soviet union speaking to his generals in december 1940 stalin mentioned hitler s references to an attack on soviet union in mein kampf and hitler s belief that red army would need four years to ready itself stalin declared we must be ready much earlier and we will try to delay war for another two years as early as august 1940 british intelligence had received hints of german plans to attack soviets only a week after hitler informally approved plans for barbarossa and warned soviet union accordingly but stalin s distrust of british led him to ignore their warnings in belief that they were a trick designed to bring soviet union into war on their side in early 1941 stalin s own intelligence services and american intelligence gave regular and repeated warnings of an impending german attack soviet spy richard sorge also gave stalin exact german launch date but sorge and other informers had previously given different invasion dates that passed peacefully before actual invasion stalin acknowledged possibility of an attack in general and therefore made significant preparations but decided not to run risk of provoking hitler beginning in july 1940 red army general staff developed war plans that identified wehrmacht as most dangerous threat to soviet union and that in case of a war with germany wehrmacht s main attack would come through region north of pripyat marshes into belorussia which later proved to be correct stalin disagreed and in october he authorized development of new plans that assumed a german attack would focus on region south of pripyat marshes towards economically vital regions in ukraine this became basis for all subsequent soviet war plans and deployment of their armed forces in preparation for german invasion thumb left upright marshal zhukov speaking at a military conference in moscow september 1941 in early 1941 stalin authorized state defense plan 1941 dp 41 which along with mobilization plan 1941 mp 41 called for deployment of 186 divisions as first strategic echelon in four military districts of western soviet union that faced axis territories and deployment of another 51 divisions along dvina and dnieper rivers as second strategic echelon under stavka control which in case of a german invasion was tasked to spearhead a soviet counteroffensive along with remaining forces of first echelon but on 22 june 1941 first echelon only contained 171 divisions numbering 2 6 2 9 million and second strategic echelon contained 57 divisions that were still mobilizing most of which were still understrength second echelon was undetected by german intelligence until days after invasion commenced in most cases only when german ground forces bumped into them at start of invasion manpower of soviet military force that had been mobilized was 5 3 5 5 million and it was still increasing as soviet reserve force of 14 million with at least basic military training continued to mobilize red army was dispersed and still preparing when invasion commenced their units were often separated and lacked adequate transportation while transportation remained insufficient for red army forces when operation barbarossa kicked off they possessed some 33 000 pieces of artillery a number far greater than germans had at their disposal soviet union had some 23 000 tanks available of which only 14 700 were combat ready around 11 000 tanks were in western military districts that faced german invasion force hitler later declared to some of his generals if i had known about russian tank strength in 1941 i would not have attacked however maintenance and readiness standards were very poor ammunition and radios were in short supply and many armoured units lacked trucks for supplies most advanced soviet tank models kv 1 and t 34 which were superior to all current german tanks as well as all designs still in development as of summer 1941 were not available in large numbers at time invasion commenced furthermore in autumn of 1939 soviets disbanded their mechanized corps and partly dispersed their tanks to infantry divisions but following their observation of german campaign in france in late 1940 they began to reorganize most of their armored assets back into mechanized corps with a target strength of 1 031 tanks each but these large armoured formations were unwieldy and moreover they were spread out in scattered garrisons with their subordinate divisions up to apart reorganization was still in progress and incomplete when barbarossa commenced soviet tank units were rarely well equipped and they lacked training and logistical support units were sent into combat with no arrangements in place for refueling ammunition resupply or personnel replacement often after a single engagement units were destroyed or rendered ineffective soviet numerical advantage in heavy equipment was thoroughly offset by superior training and organization of wehrmacht soviet air force vvs held numerical advantage with a total of approximately 19 533 aircraft which made it largest air force in world in summer of 1941 about 7 133 9 100 of these were deployed in five western military districts and an additional 1445 were under naval control development of soviet armed by russian military historian mikhail meltyukhov from various january june calculated 131 5 316 5 140 7 personnel

in summer of 1941 debate began in late 1980s when viktor suvorov published a journal article and later book icebreaker in which he claimed that stalin had seen outbreak of war in western europe as an opportunity to spread communist revolutions throughout continent and that soviet military was being deployed for an imminent attack at time of german invasion this view had also been advanced by former german generals following war suvorov s thesis was fully or partially accepted by a limited number of historians including valeri danilov joachim hoffmann mikhail meltyukhov and vladimir and attracted public attention in germany israel and russia it has been strongly rejected by most historians and icebreaker is generally considered to be an anti soviet tract in western countries david glantz and gabriel gorodetsky wrote books to rebut suvorov s arguments majority of historians believe that stalin was seeking to avoid war in 1941 as he believed that his military was not ready to

22 june 1941 soviet military districts in border area were alerted by nko directive no 1 issued late on night of 21 june it called on them to bring all forces to combat readiness but to avoid provocative actions of any kind it took up to two hours for several of units subordinate to fronts to receive order of directive and majority did not receive it before invasion commenced on 21 june at 13 00 army group north received codeword dusseldorf indicating barbarossa would commence next morning and passed down its own codeword dortmund at around 03 15 on 22 june 1941 axis powers commenced invasion of soviet union with bombing of major cities in soviet occupied poland and an artillery barrage on red army defences on entire front air raids were conducted as far as kronstadt near leningrad ismail in bessarabia and sevastopol in crimea meanwhile ground troops crossed border accompanied in some locales by lithuanian and ukrainian fifth columnists roughly three million soldiers of wehrmacht went into action and faced slightly fewer soviet troops at border accompanying german forces during initial invasion were finnish and romanian units as well at around noon news of invasion was broadcast to population by soviet foreign minister vyacheslav molotov without a declaration of war german forces fell on our country attacked our frontiers in many places red army and whole nation will wage a victorious patriotic war for our beloved country for honour for liberty our cause is just enemy will be beaten victory will be ours by calling upon population s devotion to their nation rather than party molotov struck a patriotic chord that helped a stunned people absorb shattering news within first few days of invasion soviet high command and red army were extensively reorganized so as to place them on necessary war footing stalin did not address nation about german invasion until 3 july when he also called for a patriotic war of entire soviet people in germany on morning of 22 june nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels announced invasion to waking nation in a radio broadcast with hitler s words at this moment a march is taking place that for its extent compares with greatest world has ever seen i have decided today to place fate and future of reich and our people in hands of our soldiers may god aid us especially in this fight later same morning hitler proclaimed to his colleagues before three months have passed we shall witness a collapse of russia like of which has never been seen in history hitler also addressed german people via radio presenting himself as a man of peace who reluctantly had to attack soviet union following invasion goebbels openly spoke of a european crusade against bolshevism initial attacks thumb upright 1 35 german advances from june to august 1941 initial momentum of german ground and air attack completely destroyed soviet organizational command and control within first few hours paralyzing every level of command from infantry platoon to soviet high command in moscow moscow not only failed to grasp magnitude of catastrophe that confronted soviet forces in border area but stalin s first reaction was also disbelief at around 07 15 stalin issued nko directive no 2 which announced invasion to soviet armed forces and called on them to attack axis forces wherever they had violated borders and launch air strikes into border regions of german territory at around 09 15 stalin issued nko directive no 3 signed by marshal semyon timoshenko which now called for a general counteroffensive on entire front without any regards for borders that both men hoped would sweep enemy from soviet territory stalin s order which timoshenko authorized was not based on a realistic appraisal of military situation at hand but commanders passed it along for fear of retribution if they failed to obey several days passed before soviet leadership became aware of enormity of opening defeat air war luftwaffe reconnaissance units plotted soviet troop concentration supply dumps and airfields and marked them down for destruction additional luftwaffe attacks were carried out against soviet command and control centers in order to disrupt mobilization and organization of soviet forces in contrast soviet artillery observers based at border area had been under strictest instructions not to open fire on german aircraft prior to invasion one plausible reason given for soviet hesitation to return fire was stalin s initial belief that assault was launched without hitler s authorization significant amounts of soviet territory were lost along with red army forces as a result it took several days before stalin comprehended magnitude of calamity luftwaffe reportedly destroyed 1 489 aircraft on first day of invasion and over 3 100 during first three days hermann goring minister of aviation and commander in chief of luftwaffe distrusted reports and ordered figure checked luftwaffe staffs surveyed wreckage on soviet airfields and their original figure proved conservative as over 2 000 soviet aircraft were estimated to have been destroyed on first day of invasion in reality soviet losses were likely higher a soviet archival document recorded loss of 3 922 soviet aircraft in first three days against an estimated loss of 78 german aircraft luftwaffe reported loss of only 35 aircraft on first day of combat a document from german federal archives puts luftwaffe s loss at 63 aircraft for first day by end of first week luftwaffe had achieved air supremacy over battlefields of all army groups but was unable to effect this air dominance over vast expanse of western soviet union according to war diaries of german high command luftwaffe by 5 july had lost 491 aircraft with 316 more damaged leaving it

to army group s northern and southern sections respectively on 22 june only northern section of army group south attacked but terrain impeded their assault giving soviet defenders ample time to react german 1st panzer group and 6th army attacked and broke through soviet 5th army starting on night of 23 june soviet 22nd and 15th mechanized corps attacked flanks of 1st panzer group from north and south respectively although intended to be concerted soviet tank units were sent in piecemeal due to poor coordination 22nd mechanized corps ran into 1st panzer army s iii motorized corps and was decimated and its commander killed 1st panzer group bypassed much of 15th mechanized corps which engaged german 6th army s infantry division where it was defeated by antitank fire and luftwaffe attacks on 26 june soviets launched another counterattack on 1st panzer group from north and south simultaneously with 9th 19th and 8th mechanized corps which altogether fielded 1649 tanks and supported by remnants of 15th mechanized corps battle lasted for four days ending in defeat of soviet tank units on 30 june stavka ordered remaining forces of southwestern front to withdraw to stalin

hopes of destroying 3rd panzer group however 3rd panzer group had already moved on with its forward units reaching vilnius on evening of 23 june and western front s armoured counterattack instead ran into infantry and antitank fire from v army corps of german 9th army supported by luftwaffe air attacks by night of 25 june soviet counterattack was defeated and commander of 6th cavalry corps was captured same night pavlov ordered all remnants of western front to withdraw to slonim towards minsk subsequent counterattacks to buy time for withdrawal were launched against german forces but all of them failed on 27 june 2nd and 3rd panzer groups met near minsk and captured city next day completing encirclement of almost all of western front in two pockets one around bialystok and another west

to deal with civilians spreading rumors and military deserters on 30 june stalin relieved pavlov of his command and on 22 july tried and executed him along with many members of his staff on charges of cowardice and criminal incompetence on 29 june hitler through commander in chief of german army walther von brauchitsch instructed commander of army group center fedor von bock to halt advance of his panzers until infantry formations liquidating pockets catch up but commander of 2nd panzer group heinz guderian with tacit support of fedor von bock and chief of okh franz halder ignored instruction and attacked on eastward towards bobruisk albeit reporting advance as a reconnaissance in force he also personally conducted an aerial inspection of minsk bialystok pocket on 30 june and concluded that his panzer group was not needed to contain it since hermann hoth s 3rd panzer group was already involved in minsk pocket on same day some of infantry corps of 9th and 4th armies having sufficiently liquidated bialystok pocket resumed their march eastward to catch up with panzer groups on 1 july fedor von bock ordered panzer groups to resume their full offensive eastward on morning of 3 july but brauchitsch upholding hitler s instruction and halder unwillingly going along with it opposed bock s order however bock insisted on order by stating that it would be irresponsible to reverse orders already issued panzer groups however resumed their offensive on 2 july before infantry formations had sufficiently caught up northwest russia thumb upright 1 3 finnish soldiers crossing murmansk railway 1941 during german finnish negotiations finland had demanded to remain neutral unless soviet union attacked them first germany therefore sought to provoke soviet union into an attack on finland after germany launched barbarossa on 22 june german aircraft used finnish air bases to attack soviet positions same day germans launched operation and occupied petsamo province at finnish soviet border simultaneously finland proceeded to neutral aland islands despite these actions finnish government insisted via diplomatic channels that they remained a neutral party but soviet leadership already viewed finland as an ally of germany subsequently soviets proceeded to launch a massive bombing attack on 25 june against all major finnish cities and industrial centers including helsinki turku and lahti during a night session on same day finnish parliament decided to go to war against soviet union finland was divided into two operational zones northern finland was staging area for army norway its goal was to execute a two pronged pincer movement on strategic port of murmansk named operation silver fox southern finland was still under responsibility of finnish army goal of finnish forces was at first to recapture finnish karelia at lake ladoga as well as karelian isthmus which included finland s second largest city vyborg further german advances thumb upright 1 35 german advances during opening phases of operation barbarossa august 1941 on 2 july and through next six days a rainstorm typical of belarusian summers slowed progress of panzers of army group center and soviet defences stiffened delays gave soviets time to organize a massive counterattack against army group center army group s ultimate objective was smolensk which commanded road to moscow facing germans was an old soviet defensive line held by six armies on 6 july soviets launched a massive counter attack using v and vii mechanized corps of 20th army which collided with german 39th and 47th panzer corps in a battle where red army lost 832 tanks of 2 000 employed during five days of ferocious fighting germans defeated this counterattack thanks largely to coincidental presence of luftwaffe s only squadron of tank busting aircraft 2nd panzer group crossed dnieper river and closed in on smolensk from south while 3rd panzer group after defeating soviet counterattack closed on smolensk from north trapped between their pincers were three soviet armies 29th panzer division captured smolensk on 16 july yet a gap remained between army group center on 18 july panzer groups came to within of closing gap but trap did not finally close until 5 august when upwards of 300 000 red army soldiers had been captured and 3 205 soviet tanks were destroyed large numbers of red army soldiers escaped to stand between germans and moscow as resistance continued four weeks into campaign germans realized they had grossly underestimated soviet strength german troops had used their initial supplies and general bock quickly came to conclusion that not only had red army offered stiff opposition but german difficulties were also due to logistical problems with reinforcements and provisions operations were now slowed down to allow for resupply delay was to be used to adapt strategy to new situation hitler by now had lost faith in battles of encirclement as large numbers of soviet soldiers had escaped pincers he now believed he could defeat soviet state by economic means depriving them of industrial capacity to continue war that meant seizing industrial center of kharkov donbass and oil fields of caucasus in south and speedy capture of leningrad a major center of military production in north chief of okh general franz halder fedor von bock commander of army group center and almost all german generals involved in operation barbarossa argued vehemently in favor of continuing all out drive toward moscow besides psychological importance of capturing soviet capital generals pointed out that moscow was a major center of arms production center of soviet communications system and an important transport hub intelligence reports indicated that bulk of red army was deployed near moscow under semyon timoshenko for defense of capital panzer commander heinz guderian was sent to hitler by bock and halder to argue their case for continuing assault against moscow but hitler issued an order through guderian bypassing bock and halder to send army group center s tanks to north and south temporarily halting drive to moscow convinced by hitler s argument guderian returned to his commanding officers as a convert to fuhrer s plan which earned him their disdain northern finland on 29 june army norway launched its effort to capture murmansk in a pincer attack northern pincer conducted by mountain corps norway approached murmansk directly by crossing border at petsamo however in mid july after securing neck of rybachy peninsula and advancing to river german advance was stopped by heavy resistance from soviet 14th army renewed attacks led to nothing and this front became a stalemate for remainder of barbarossa second pincer attack began on 1 july with german xxxvi corps and finnish iii corps slated to recapture salla region for finland and then proceed eastwards to cut murmansk railway near german units had great difficulty dealing with arctic conditions after heavy fighting salla was taken on 8 july to keep momentum german finnish forces advanced eastwards until they were stopped at town of kayraly by soviet resistance further south finnish iii corps made an independent effort to reach murmansk railway through arctic terrain facing only one division of soviet 7th army it was able to make rapid headway on 7 august it captured kestenga while reaching outskirts of large red army reinforcements then prevented further gains on both fronts and german finnish force had to go onto defensive karelia thumb finnish troops advancing in karelia in august 1941 finnish plan in south in karelia was to advance as swiftly as possible to lake ladoga cutting soviet forces in half then finnish territories east of lake ladoga were to be recaptured before advance along karelian isthmus including recapture of vyborg commenced finnish attack was launched on 10 july army of karelia held a numerical advantage versus soviet defenders of 7th army and 23rd army so it could advance swiftly important road junction at was captured on 14 july by 16 july first finnish units reached lake ladoga at achieving goal of splitting soviet forces during rest of july army of karelia advanced further southeast into karelia coming to a halt at former finnish soviet border at with soviet forces cut in half attack on karelian isthmus could commence finnish army attempted to encircle large soviet formations at and by advancing to western shores of lake ladoga by mid august encirclement had succeeded and both towns were taken but many soviet formations were able to evacuate by sea further west attack on vyborg was launched with soviet resistance breaking down finns were able to encircle vyborg by advancing to vuoksi river city itself was taken on 30

turned north and crossed dnieper meanwhile 2nd panzer group diverted from army group center had crossed desna river with 2nd army on its right flank two panzer armies now trapped four soviet armies and parts of two others by august as serviceability and quantity of luftwaffe s inventory steadily diminished due to combat demand for air support only increased as vvs recovered luftwaffe found itself struggling to maintain local air superiority with onset of bad weather in october luftwaffe was on several occasions forced to halt nearly all aerial operations vvs although faced with same weather difficulties had a clear advantage thanks to prewar experience with cold weather flying and fact that they were operating from intact airbases and airports by december vvs had matched luftwaffe and was even pressing to achieve air superiority over battlefields leningrad for its final attack on leningrad 4th panzer group was reinforced by tanks from army group center on 8 august

where reserve troops and freshly improvised units consisting of worker battalions and even schoolboy formations joined in digging trenches as they prepared to defend city on 7 september german 20th motorized division seized shlisselburg cutting off all land routes to leningrad germans severed railroads to moscow and captured railroad to murmansk with finnish assistance to inaugurate start of a siege that would last for over two years at this stage hitler ordered final destruction of leningrad with no prisoners taken and on 9 september army group north began final push within ten days it had advanced within of city however push over last proved very slow and casualties mounted hitler now out of patience ordered that leningrad should not be stormed but rather starved into submission along these lines okh issued directive no la 1601 41 on 22 september 1941 which accorded hitler s plans deprived of its panzer forces army group center remained static and was subjected to numerous soviet counterattacks in particular yelnya offensive in which germans suffered their first major tactical defeat since their invasion began this red army victory also provided an important boost to soviet morale these attacks prompted hitler to concentrate his attention back to army group center and its drive on moscow germans ordered 3rd and 4th panzer armies to break off their siege of leningrad and support army group center in its attack on moscow kiev before an attack on moscow could begin operations in kiev needed to be finished half of army group center had swung to south in back of kiev position while army group south moved to north from its dnieper bridgehead encirclement of soviet forces in kiev was achieved on 16 september a battle ensued in which soviets were hammered with tanks artillery and aerial bombardment after ten days of vicious fighting germans claimed 665 000 soviet soldiers captured although real figure is probably around 220 000 prisoners soviet losses were 452 720 men 3 867 artillery pieces and mortars from 43 divisions of 5th 21st 26th and 37th soviet armies despite exhaustion and losses facing some german units upwards of 75 percent of their men from

but further attacks against main line at river failed with army norway switching its main effort further south front stalemated in this sector further south finnish iii corps launched a new offensive towards murmansk railway on 30 october bolstered by fresh reinforcements from army norway against soviet resistance it was able to come within 30 km 19 mi of railway when finnish high command ordered a stop to all offensive operations in sector on 17 november united states of america applied diplomatic pressure on finland to not disrupt allied aid shipments to soviet union which caused finnish government to halt advance on murmansk railway with finnish refusal to conduct further offensive operations and german inability to do so alone german finnish effort in central and northern finland came to an end karelia germany had pressured finland to enlarge its offensive activities in karelia to aid germans in their leningrad operation finnish attacks on leningrad itself remained limited finland stopped its advance just short of leningrad and had no intentions to attack city situation was different in eastern karelia finnish government agreed to restart its offensive into soviet karelia to reach lake onega and svir river on 4 september this new drive was launched on a broad front albeit reinforced by fresh reserve troops heavy losses elsewhere on front meant that soviet

front of army group center was a series of elaborate defence lines first centred on vyazma and second on russian peasants began fleeing ahead of advancing german units burning their harvested crops driving their cattle away and destroying buildings in their villages as part of a scorched earth policy designed to deny nazi war machine of needed supplies and foodstuffs first blow took soviets completely by surprise when 2nd panzer group returning from south took oryol just south of soviet first main defense line three days later panzers pushed on to bryansk while 2nd army attacked from west soviet 3rd and 13th armies were now encircled to north 3rd and 4th panzer armies attacked vyazma trapping 19th 20th 24th and 32nd armies moscow s first line of defense had been shattered pocket eventually yielded over 500 000 soviet prisoners bringing tally since start of invasion to three million soviets now had only 90 000 men and 150 tanks left for defense of moscow german government now publicly predicted imminent capture of moscow and convinced foreign correspondents of a pending soviet collapse on 13 october 3rd panzer group penetrated to within of capital martial law was declared in moscow almost from beginning of operation typhoon however weather worsened temperatures fell while there was continued rainfall this turned unpaved road network into mud and slowed german advance on moscow additional snows fell which were followed by more rain creating a glutinous mud that german tanks had difficulty traversing whereas soviet t 34 with its wider tread was better suited to negotiate at same time supply situation for germans rapidly deteriorated on 31 october german army high command ordered a halt to operation typhoon while armies were reorganized pause gave soviets far better supplied time to consolidate their positions and organize formations of newly activated reservists in little over a month soviets organized eleven new armies that included 30 divisions of siberian troops these had been freed from soviet far east after soviet intelligence assured stalin that there was no longer a threat from japanese during october and november 1941 over 1 000 tanks and 1 000 aircraft arrived along with siberian forces to assist in defending city with ground hardening due to cold weather germans resumed attack on moscow on 15 november although troops themselves were

officers claimed they could see spires of kremlin but by then first blizzards had begun a reconnaissance battalion managed to reach town of khimki only about from soviet capital it captured bridge over moscow volga canal as well as railway station which marked easternmost advance of german forces in spite of progress made wehrmacht was not equipped for such severe winter warfare soviet army was better adapted to fighting in winter conditions but faced production shortages of winter clothing german forces fared worse with deep snow further hindering equipment and mobility weather conditions had largely grounded luftwaffe preventing large scale air operations newly created soviet units near moscow now numbered over 500 000 men and on 5 december they launched a massive counterattack as part of soviet winter counteroffensive offensive halted on 7 january 1942 after having pushed german armies back 100 250 km 62 155 mi from moscow wehrmacht had lost battle for moscow and invasion had cost german army over 830 000 men aftermath with failure of battle of moscow all german plans for a quick defeat of soviet union had to be revised soviet counter offensives in december 1941 caused heavy casualties on both sides but ultimately eliminated german threat to moscow attempting to explain matters hitler issued directive n 39 which cited early onset of winter and severe cold for german failure whereas main reason was german military unpreparedness for such a giant enterprise on 22 june 1941 wehrmacht as a whole had 209 divisions at its disposal 163 of which were offensively capable on 31 march 1942 less than one year after invasion of soviet union wehrmacht was reduced to fielding 58 offensively capable divisions red army s tenacity and ability to counter attack effectively took germans as much by surprise as their own initial attack had soviets spurred on by successful defense and in an effort to imitate germans stalin wanted to begin his own counteroffensive not just against german forces around moscow but against their armies in north and south anger over failed german offensives caused hitler to relieve field marshal walther von brauchitsch of command and in his place hitler assumed personal control of german army on 19 december 1941 soviet union had suffered heavily from conflict losing huge tracts of territory and vast losses in men and material nonetheless red army proved capable of countering german offensives particularly as germans began experiencing irreplaceable shortages in manpower armaments provisions and fuel despite rapid relocation of red army armaments production east of urals and a dramatic increase of production in 1942 especially of armour new aircraft types and artillery wehrmacht was able to mount another large scale offensive in july 1942 although on a much reduced front than previous summer hitler having realized that germany s oil supply was severely depleted aimed to capture oil fields of baku in an offensive codenamed case blue again germans quickly overran great expanses of soviet territory but they failed to achieve their ultimate goals in wake of their defeat at battle of stalingrad in february 1943 by 1943 soviet armaments production was fully operational and increasingly german war economy final major german offensive in eastern theater of second world war took place during july august 1943 with launch of operation zitadelle an assault on kursk salient approximately one million german troops confronted a soviet force over 2 5 million strong soviets prevailed following defeat of operation zitadelle soviets launched counter offensives employing six million men along a front towards dnieper river as they drove germans westwards employing increasingly ambitious and tactically sophisticated offensives along with making operational improvements in secrecy and deception red army was eventually able to liberate much of area which germans had previously occupied by summer of 1944 destruction of army group centre outcome of operation bagration proved to be a decisive success additional soviet offensives against german army groups north and south in fall of 1944 put german war machine into

treaty and was thus obligated to offer soviet pows humane treatment according to its provisions as they generally did with other allied pows uga digital commons according to soviets they had not signed geneva conventions in 1929 due to article 9 which by imposing racial segregation of pows into different camps contravened soviet constitution article 82 of convention specified that in case in time of war one of belligerents is not a party to convention its provisions shall nevertheless remain in force as between belligerents who are parties thereto icrc geneva convention despite this hitler called for battle against soviet union to be a struggle for existence and emphasized that russian armies were to be annihilated a mindset that contributed to war crimes against soviet prisoners of war a memorandum from 16 july 1941 recorded by martin bormann quotes hitler saying giant occupied area must naturally be pacified as quickly as possible this will happen at best if anyone who just looks funny should be shot conveniently for nazis fact that soviets failed to sign convention played into their hands as they justified their behavior accordingly even if soviets had signed it is highly unlikely that this would have stopped nazis genocidal policies towards combatants civilians and prisoners of war thumb left himmler inspecting a prisoner of war camp before war hitler issued notorious commissar order which called for all soviet political commissars taken prisoner at front to be shot immediately without trial german soldiers participated in these mass killings along with members of ss einsatzgruppen sometimes reluctantly claiming military necessity on eve of invasion german soldiers were informed that their battle demands ruthless and vigorous measures against bolshevik guerrillas saboteurs jews and complete elimination of all active and passive resistance collective punishment was authorized against partisan attacks if a perpetrator could not be quickly identified then burning villages and mass executions were considered acceptable reprisals although majority of german soldiers accepted these crimes as justified due to nazi propaganda which depicted red army as untermenschen a few prominent german officers openly protested about them an estimated two million soviet prisoners of war died of starvation during barbarossa alone by end of war 58 percent of all soviet prisoners of war had died in german captivity organized crimes against civilians including women and children were carried out on a huge scale by german police and military

holocaust historian raul hilberg puts number of jews murdered by mobile killing operations at 1 400 000 original instructions to kill jews in party and state positions were broadened to include all male jews of military age and then expanded once more to all male jews regardless of age by end of july germans were regularly killing women and children on 18 december 1941 himmler and hitler discussed jewish question and himmler noted meeting s result in his appointment book to be annihilated as partisans according to christopher browning annihilating jews and solving so called jewish question under cover of killing partisans was agreed upon convention between hitler and himmler in accordance with nazi policies against inferior asian peoples were also persecuted according to a post war report by prince veli khan they were imprisoned in concentration camps in terrible conditions where those deemed to have mongolian features were murdered daily asians were also targeted by

widespread phenomenon in east as german soldiers regularly committed violent sexual acts against soviet women whole units were occasionally involved in crime with upwards of one third of instances being gang rape historian hannes heer relates that in world of eastern front where german army equated russia with communism everything was fair game thus rape went unreported unless entire units were involved frequently in case of jewish women they were immediately murdered following acts of sexual violence historian birgit beck emphasizes that military decrees which served to authorize wholesale brutality on many levels essentially destroyed basis for any prosecution of sexual offenses committed by german soldiers in east she also contends that detection of such instances was limited by fact that sexual violence was often inflicted in context of billets in civilian housing historical significance thumb world war ii military deaths in europe and asia by theater year operation barbarossa
