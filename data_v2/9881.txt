monks accused of money fraud were combined with arrest of a hardline ultra royalist monk who had taken part in 2014 thailand coup d etat he was from a fourth temple called wat oh noy many officials

germany to demand phra prom methee s return but to no avail german officials stated asylum investigations had to be finished first and only then could extradition be considered news outlet argued that

monastic precepts such as eating only two meals a day on 31 may three monks who were members of sangha council were officially removed from their positions on 17 june buddhist protection center a network that had previously held nationwide protests by monks against junta appealed to thai constitutional court arguing that forced defrocking of monks without trial was unlawful and in violation of

left pongporn expected to complete his investigations by september 2018 varaiyuth director of counter corruption division stated that main focus of investigations was on civil servants not monks meanwhile a number of news reporters doing field research in thai temples found that some thai temples were unaware of any financial dealings because they were not informed about amount of money involved in transfers or presumed that nob as an advisory organization knew what was best in may 2018 nob announced they would seek out examples of temples that had good financial procedures provincial departments of nob were assigned to gather information one objective of provincial investigations was to check whether it would be possible to operate temples without monks handling money however a network called federation of lawyers protecting buddhism petitioned nob to stop investigation because federation considered such an investigation illegitimate specifically federation argued that nob acted beyond its jurisdiction a representative of nob responded that they were just trying to gather information to which federation responded by suing nob for negligence in official duties meanwhile junta leader prayut chan o cha responded to an increase in monks criticizing investigations on social networks questioning whether this was appropriate for monks he added that security measures might be required on 20 june pongporn held a press conference defending provincial investigations stating that he was acting in accordance with law but did not have authority to manage temples he further added that in first two investigations main fault was nob itself but in third fault was with monks arrested due to evidence indicating money laundering he concluded by insisting that any temple aware of any government officials involved in temple scams should report this to nob and they would investigate federation and several other networks however recommended that any temples that had from nob should report this to local police immediately and report to police that they would completely cooperate with any legal action against nob and be a witness in such cases responses and analysis arrests have been widely regarded by journalists and news analysts as unprecedented and a critical blow to faith of thai buddhist devotees foreign french political journalist arnaud dubus and law scholar wrote that fraud investigations were symptomatic of problem of mismanagement and corruption within sangha though problems should be dealt with ncpo was unlikely to be able to do this because they themselves had problems of corruption and lacked political legitimacy guardian stated that timing of investigations and subsequent raids were a clear indication that they were politically motivated as junta tried to assert greater control over thai sangha before next election paul chambers a lecturer at naresuan university claimed arrests were done to take control of any monks who were not loyal to national council for peace and order anthropologist jim taylor wrote that arrests were likely politically motivated arguing that investigations and subsequent arrests represented ruling palace regime trying to consolidate traditional central royalist power by eliminating several non royalist high ranking monks and members of sangha supreme council taylor argued that this was done in order to take control of several wealthy temples and ensure that next leader of thai sangha is a royalist pro junta monk pointing to junta s previous interference with position in 2017 taylor also pointed out that suspects of investigations were innocent until proven guilty yet were defrocked before trial and stripped of decades of monastic seniority solely on basis of unproven accusations domestic thumb upright 0 8 agreed with 2018 arrests alt government officer in military style suit representatives of thai monastic community responded to arrests dumbfounded and saddened chao khun kasem head of southern ecclesiastical regions and head of a pro buddhist network accused thai junta of lack of transparency chao khun kasem as well as jaroon leader of several pro buddhist networks stated that government should deal with its own officials first and only after that deal with monks involved if monks were guilty at all he argued that if allocated budget was not used exactly as requested but was still used for public rather than personal purposes it was not a serious fault former member of state audit office of thailand and korn meedee chairman of thailand buddhists federation said accusations against temples were not clear they mentioned that categories in budget request procedure were very broad and therefore different interpretations in applying budget were likely chao khun kasem stated that officials often grant large sums to decrease paperwork and sometimes use same budget for several temples pricha a scholar at university stated that pongporn s very position as director of nob was questionable because he was appointed by junta rather than by buddhist representatives investigations and subsequent arrests have been described as politically motivated specifically korn has speculated that arrest of three sangha council members was a form of political revenge according to korn three council members had been instrumental in removing pongporn from his position in august 2017 moreover they were understood to have connections with united front for democracy against dictatorship that opposed junta and were therefore seen as a threat critics of junta have argued that high profile arrests were an attempt to cover up military government s own failings on 25 july 2017 several influential monks among them chao khun pipit asked for a of nob calling upon tens of thousands of thai administrative monks to suspend communications with them this eventually led to temporary suspension of pongporn s position as director in august 2017 on 1 june 2018 jaroon in name of several pro buddhist networks charged pongporn with fraud and negligence in official duties after unsuccessfully petitioning several government departments pongporn defended his actions in 2017 and again in june 2018 stating that most of suspects were government officials but if monks were involved he had to follow procedures similarly varaiyuth and his colleague stated in their defense that main targets of investigations were government officials rather than thai temples which in words of varaiyuth tended to be prey of government officers there were also people who supported investigations and arrests arguing that it helped improve monastic community paiboon stated that arrests were good riddance he said that budgets were often abused by temples and since leading monks were considered civil servants under law they should take responsibility wissanu krea ngam deputy prime minister of thailand made a statement that he did not expect thai buddhism to be affected much by events somdet phra supreme patriarch of thai monastic community said he was concerned with current state of buddhism but that he understood that authorities needed to take action he further requested that all organizations properly explain to public what was going on subsequent political reform fraud investigations have led to some ideas for political reform back in 2017 pongporn stated that structure of nob had been greatly improved on and subsequent fraud was less likely in particular more oversight had been built into budget request procedures pongporn also proposed more government control over finances of thai temples on a similar note paiboon argued that every thai temple should have an independent lay accountant pricha argued that fraud investigations point to a larger problem that is sangha council was responsible for too many matters without proper organization and independent oversight council was responsible for legislative executive and judicial powers with no division of these functions journalist and buddhist scholar argued that fraud investigations pointed to a larger problem of thai state and religion being intermingled on 5 july 2018 thai junta amended sangha act an important implication of amendment was that members of sangha council were chosen by thai king instead of being chosen by members of sangha themselves proposed by thai cabinet amendment was unanimously approved by national legislative assembly of thailand a government department junta had set up since 2014 coup wissanu krea ngam explained that sangha council was too old and often ill which made it difficult to appoint their own members and to deal with current crisis new members would normally be appointed in september korn meedee complained that too little time was given for sangha to oppose or give their opinion on amendment and even if they submitted their response in time national legislative assembly did not respond after amendment had been finalized korn stated that buddhist organizations could no longer protest against new act due to risk of violating strict law on lese majeste in thailand he did add however that pro buddhist networks did not object to role of thai king but felt it was possible junta would choose members instead citing king s authority references category buddhism related controversies category history of buddhism
