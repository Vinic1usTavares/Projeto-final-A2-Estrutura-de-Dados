woods in 1932 this song had previously been covered by bing crosby and frank sinatra and publishers unsuccessfully tried to stop redding from recording song from a negro perspective today often considered his signature song jim stewart reckoned if there s one song one performance that really sort of sums up otis and what he s about it s try a little tenderness that one performance is so special and so unique that it expresses who he is on this version redding was backed by booker t m g s while staff producer isaac hayes worked on arrangement try a little tenderness was included on his next album complete unbelievable otis redding dictionary of soul song and album were critically and commercially successful former peaked at number 25 on billboard hot 100 chart and at number 4 on

protege conley whom redding and walden had contracted directly to atco atlantic records rather than to stax volt on tour instead of more established stax volt artists such as rufus thomas and william bell produced negative reactions monterey pop in 1967 redding performed at influential monterey pop festival as closing act on saturday night second day of festival he was invited through efforts of promoter jerry wexler until that point redding was still performing mainly for black audiences at time he had not been considered a commercially viable player in mainstream white american market but after delivering one of most electric performances of night and having been act to most involve audience his performance at monterey pop was therefore a natural progression from local to national acclaim decisive turning point in otis redding s career his act included his own song respect and a version of rolling stones satisfaction redding and his backing band booker t m g s with mar keys horn section opened with cooke s shake after which he delivered an impulsive speech asking audience if they were love crowd and looking for a big response ballad i ve been loving you followed last

moved otis he was happy to be included and it brought him a new audience it was greatly expanded in monterey according to sweet soul music musicians such as brian jones and jimi hendrix were captivated by his performance robert christgau wrote in esquire love crowd screamed one s mind to heavens before monterey redding wanted to record with conley but stax was against idea two moved from

sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band and tried to create a similar sound against label s wishes his wife zelma disliked its atypical melody stax crew were also dissatisfied with new sound stewart thought that it was not r b while bassist donald duck dunn feared it would damage stax s reputation however redding wanted to expand his musical style and thought it was his best song correctly

redding had proposed to record an album featuring cut and rearranged songs in different tempos for example ballads would be uptempo and vice versa another suggestion was to record an album entirely consisting of country standards musicianship style early on redding copied rock and soul style of his role model little richard he was also influenced by soul musicians such as sam cooke whose live album sam cooke at copa was a strong influence but later explored other popular genres he studied recordings of beatles and bob dylan his song hard to handle has elements of rock and roll and influences of eric clapton and jimi hendrix most of his songs were categorized as southern soul and memphis soul his hallmark was his raw voice and ability to convey strong emotion richie unterberger of allmusic noted his hoarse gritty vocals brassy arrangements an emotional way with both party tunes and aching ballads in book rock and roll an introduction authors michael campbell and james brody suggested that redding s singing calls to mind a fervent black preacher especially in up tempo numbers his singing is more than impassioned speech but less than singing with precise pitch according to book redding finds a rough midpoint between impassioned oratory and conventional singing his delivery overflows with emotion in his song i can t turn you loose booker t jones described redding s singing as energetic and emotional but said that his vocal range was limited reaching neither low nor high notes peter buckley in rough guide to rock describes his gruff voice which combined sam cooke s phrasing with a delivery and later suggested he could testify like a hell bent preacher croon like a tender lover or get down and dirty with a bluesy redding received advice from rufus thomas about his clumsy stage appearance jerry wexler said redding didn t know how to move and stood still moving only his upper body although he acknowledged that redding was well received by audiences for his strong message guralnick described redding s painful vulnerability in sweet soul music as an attractive one for audience but not for his friends and partners his early shyness was well known songwriting in his early career redding mostly covered songs from popular artists such as richard cooke and solomon burke around mid 1960s he began writing his own songs always taking along his cheap red acoustic guitar and sometimes asked for stax members opinion of his lyrics he often worked on lyrics with other musicians such as simms rodgers huckaby phil walden and cropper during his recovery from his throat operation redding wrote about 30 songs in two weeks redding was sole copyright holder on all of his songs in sittin on dock of bay he abandoned familiar romantic themes for sad wistful amplified by unforgettable descending guitar riffs by cropper website of songwriters hall of fame noted that song was a kind of brooding dark voicing of despair i ve got nothin to live for look like nothin s gonna come my way although his music in general was exultant and joyful according to journalist ruth robinson author of liner notes for 1993 box set it is currently a revisionist theory to equate soul with darker side of man s musical expression blues that of flame of trouble s got a hold on me music might well be father of form if it is glorified exaltation found in church on any sunday morning is its mother songwriters hall of fame website adds that glorified exaltation indeed was an apt description of otis redding s songwriting and singing style booker t jones compared redding with leonard bernstein stating he was same type person he was a leader he d just lead with his arms and his body and his fingers redding favored short and simple lyrics when asked whether he intended to cover dylan s just like a woman he responded that lyrics contained too much text furthermore he stated in an interview redding also authored his sometimes difficult recordings horn arrangements humming to show players what he had in mind recording of fa fa fa fa fa sad song captures his habit of humming with horn section legacy right thumb otis redding sittin on dock of bay

recognized artists his lean and powerful style exemplified stax sound he was said to be heart and soul of stax while artists such as al jackson dunn and cropper helped to expand its structure his open throated singing tremolo vibrato manic electrifying stage performances and perceived honesty were particular hallmarks along with use of interjections such as gotta gotta gotta some of which came from cooke producer stewart thought begging singing was stress induced and enhanced by redding s shyness artists from many genres have named redding as a musical influence george harrison called respect an inspiration for drive my car rolling stones also mentioned redding as a major influence other artists influenced by redding include led zeppelin grateful dead lynyrd skynyrd doors and virtually every
