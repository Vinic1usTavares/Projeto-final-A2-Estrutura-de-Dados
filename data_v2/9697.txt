thumb 300px kidnapping of edgardo mortara painting by moritz daniel oppenheim 1862 this representation departs significantly from historical record of how mortara was taken no clergy were present for example mortara case was an italian cause celebre that captured attention of much of europe and north america in 1850s and 1860s it concerned papal states seizure of a six year old boy named edgardo mortara from his jewish family in bologna on basis of a former servant s testimony that she had administered an emergency baptism to boy when he fell ill as an infant mortara grew up as a catholic under protection of pope pius ix who refused his parents desperate pleas for his return and eventually became a priest domestic and international outrage against pontifical state s actions may have contributed to its downfall amid unification of italy in late 1857 bologna s inquisitor father pier feletti heard that anna morisi who had worked in mortara house for six years had secretly baptised edgardo when she had thought he was about to die as a baby supreme sacred congregation of roman and universal inquisition held view that this action irrevocably made child a catholic and because papal states forbade raising of christians by members of other faiths it ordered that he be taken from his family and brought up by church police came to mortara home late on 23 june 1858 and kidnapped edgardo following evening after child s father was allowed to visit him during august and september 1858 two starkly different narratives emerged one told of a boy who wanted to return to his family and faith of his ancestors while other described a child who had learned catechism perfectly and wanted his parents to become catholics as well international protests mounted but pope would not be moved after pontifical rule in bologna ended in 1859 feletti was prosecuted for his role in mortara s kidnapping but he was acquitted when court decided that he had not acted on his own initiative with pope as a substitute father mortara trained for priesthood in rome until kingdom of italy captured city in 1870 ending papal states leaving country he was ordained in france three years later at age of 21 mortara spent most of his life outside italy and died in belgium in 1940 aged 88 several historians highlight affair as one of most significant events in pius ix s papacy and they juxtapose his handling of it in 1858 with loss of most of his territory a year later case notably altered policy of french emperor napoleon iii who shifted from opposing movement for italian unification to actively supporting it traditional italian historiography of country s unification does not give much prominence to mortara case which by late 20th century was mostly remembered by jewish scholars but a 1997 study by american historian david kertzer has marked start of a wider re examination of it background political context thumb pope pius ix r 1846 1878 depicted in harper s weekly in 1867 alt pope pius ix thumb map of italy in 1843 papal states had their capital in rome for more than a millennium starting around 754 papal states were territories in italy under direct and sovereign rule of pope catholic church s control over rome and a neighbouring swathe of central italy was generally seen as a manifestation of pope s secular temporal power as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy after end of napoleonic wars in 1815 other main italian states were kingdom of sardinia governed from piedmont on mainland by king victor emmanuel ii kingdom of two sicilies in south and grand duchy of tuscany in west french occupation during 1790s had led pope s popularity and spiritual authority to greatly increase but had also severely damaged geopolitical credibility of papal states historian david kertzer suggests that by 1850s what had once appeared so solid a product of divine order of things now seemed terribly fragile pope pius ix elected in 1846 was initially widely seen as a great reformer and who might throw his weight behind growing movement for italian unification referred to in italian as risorgimento meaning resurgence when revolutions of 1848 broke out however he refused to support a pan italian campaign against austrian empire which controlled lombardy venetia in north east this prompted a popular uprising in papal states pope pius s flight to two sicilies and proclamation in 1849 of short lived roman republic which was crushed by austrian and french intervention in support of pope rome was thereafter guarded by french troops while austrians garrisoned rest of papal states much to resentment of most of inhabitants pope pius shared traditional pontifical view that papal states were essential to his independence as head of catholic church he regained some of his popularity during 1850s but drive for italian unification spearheaded by kingdom of sardinia continued to unsettle him jews of papal states numbering 15 000 or so in 1858 were grateful to pope pius ix because he had ended long standing legal obligation for them to attend sermons in church four times a year based on that week s torah portion and aimed at their conversion to christianity he had also torn down gates of roman ghetto despite objections of many christians however jews remained under many restrictions and vast majority still lived in ghetto mortara and morisi edgardo levi mortara sixth of eight children born to salomone momolo mortara a jewish merchant and his wife marianna nee padovani was born on 27 august 1851 in bologna one of papal legations in pontifical state s far north family had moved in 1850 from duchy of modena just west of bologna bologna s jewish population of about 900 had been expelled in 1593 by pope clement viii some jews mostly merchants like edgardo s father had started to settle in bologna again during 1790s and by 1858 there was a jewish community of about 200 in city jews of bologna practised judaism discreetly with neither a rabbi nor a synagogue papal states officially forbade them to have christian servants but observant jewish families perceived gentile maids as essential because they were not covered by jewish laws and thus provided a way for jews to have household tasks carried out while still observing their sabbath in practice church authorities turned a blind eye and almost every jewish family in bologna employed at least one catholic woman a few months after edgardo s birth mortara family engaged a new servant anna nina morisi an 18 year old catholic from nearby village of san giovanni in persiceto like all her family and friends morisi was illiterate she had come to city following her three sisters to work and save money towards a dowry so she could eventually marry in early 1855 morisi became pregnant as was not uncommon for unmarried servants in bologna at this time many employers would simply sack girls in such situations but mortaras did not they paid for morisi to spend last four months of her pregnancy at a midwife s home and deliver child then had her return to work with them to protect morisi and themselves from embarrassment they told neighbours that their maid was sick and recuperating at home morisi gave her newborn baby to an orphanage as papal states required unwed mothers to do then returned to work with mortaras she remained there until she was hired by another bologna family in 1857 soon after that she married and moved back to san giovanni in persiceto removal instigation in october 1857 inquisitor of bologna dominican friar pier gaetano feletti learned of rumours to effect that a secret baptism had been administered to one of city s jewish children by a catholic servant if true this would make child a catholic in eyes of church a fact with secular as well as spiritual ramifications since church stance was that children they considered to be christians could not be raised by non christians and should be removed from their parents in such circumstances cases like this were not uncommon in 19th century italy and often revolved around baptism of a jewish child by a christian servant official church position was that catholics should not baptise jewish children without parents consent except if a child was on brink of death in these cases church considered customary deferment to parental authority to be outweighed by importance of allowing child s soul to be saved and go to heaven and permitted baptism without parents assent many jewish families feared clandestine baptisms by their christian maids to counter this perceived threat some households required christians leaving their employment to sign statements confirming that they had never baptised any of children thumb basilica of san domenico in bologna photographed in 2006 servant identified in rumours was anna morisi after receiving written permission to investigate from supreme sacred congregation of roman and universal inquisition also called holy office body of cardinals responsible for overseeing and defending catholic doctrine feletti interrogated her at basilica of san domenico in bologna morisi averred that while she was employed by mortaras their infant son edgardo had fallen gravely sick while in her care leading her to fear he might die she said that she had performed an emergency baptism herself sprinkling some water on boy s head and saying i baptise you in name of father and of son and of holy ghost but had never revealed this to child s family edgardo had since recovered feletti had morisi swear to keep story quiet and sent a transcript of meeting to rome requesting permission to remove now six year old edgardo from his family it is not known by historians whether pope pius ix was involved in any of early holy office discussions over mortara or was otherwise aware of feletti s initial investigation he was its official head but he only occasionally attended its meetings and was not likely to be consulted about what cardinals saw as routine matters for holy office situations such as that reported by feletti presented a profound quandary on one hand church officially disapproved of forced conversions but on other it held that baptismal sacrament was sacrosanct and that if it had been properly administered recipient was thereafter a member of christian communion in accordance with 1747 papal bull postremo mense laws of papal states held that it was illegal to remove a child from non christian parents for baptism unless it was dying but if such a child was indeed baptised church was held to bear responsibility to provide a christian education and remove it from its parents cardinals considered morisi s account and ultimately accepted it as bearing all earmarks of truth without leaving least doubt about reality and validity of baptism she performed feletti was instructed to arrange edgardo s removal and transport to house of catechumens in rome where instruction was given to those newly converted or in process of converting to catholicism removal a detail of papal carabinieri military police led by marshal pietro lucidi and brigadier giuseppe agostini arrived at mortara apartment in bologna soon after sunset on 23 june 1858 after asking a few questions about family lucidi announced signor mortara i am sorry to inform you that you are victim of a betrayal and explained that they were under orders from feletti to remove edgardo as he had been baptised marianna screamed hysterically ran to edgardo s bed and shrieked that they would have to kill her before taking him lucidi said repeatedly that he was only following feletti s orders he reported afterwards that he would have a thousand times preferred to be exposed to much more serious dangers in performing my duties than to have to witness such a painful scene lucidi offered to let edgardo s father accompany them to inquisitor to discuss matter with him momolo refused then allowed momolo to send his eldest son riccardo to summon relatives and neighbours marianna s uncle angelo padovani a prominent member of bologna s jewish community concluded that their only hope was to appeal to feletti inquisitor received padovani and marianna s brother in law angelo moscato at san domenico soon after 23 00 feletti said that he like lucidi was merely following orders he declined to reveal why it was thought that edgardo had been baptised saying that this was confidential when men begged him to at least give family one last day with edgardo inquisitor acquiesced on condition that no attempt was made to spirit child away he gave padovani a note to this effect to pass on to marshal lucidi left as ordered leaving two men to stay in mortaras bedroom and watch over edgardo mortaras spent morning of 24 june attempting to have feletti s order overruled by either city s cardinal legate giuseppe pironi ferretti or archbishop of bologna michele viale prela but they found that neither was in city around noon mortaras decided to take steps to make removal as painless as possible edgardo s siblings were taken to visit relatives while marianna reluctantly agreed to spend evening with wife of giuseppe vitta a jewish family friend around 17 00 momolo visited san domenico to make one last plea to feletti inquisitor repeated all he had said to padovani and moscato previous night and told momolo not to worry as edgardo would be well cared for under protection of pope himself he warned that it would benefit no one to make a scene when carabinieri returned that evening momolo came home to find apartment empty apart from vitta marianna s brother also called angelo padovani two policemen and edgardo himself at about 20 00 carabinieri arrived in two carriages one for lucidi and his men and another in which agostini would drive edgardo lucidi entered apartment and removed edgardo from his father s arms prompting two policemen who had guarded him to shed tears momolo followed police down stairs to street then fainted edgardo was passed to agostini and driven away appeal initial appeal morisi confronted thumb upright giacomo antonelli pope s head of government as cardinal secretary of state alt giacomo antonelli with no way of knowing where boy had been taken momolo found out only in early july mortaras supported by jewish communities in bologna rome and elsewhere in italy initially focused on drafting appeals and trying to rally support from jews abroad greatly expanded public voice wielded by jews in western european countries following recent moves towards freedom of press coupled with jewish political emancipation in kingdom of sardinia britain france and united states caused mortara s removal to gain press attention far beyond anything previously given to such incidents papal government was initially disposed to simply ignore momolo s appeals but reconsidered after newspapers began reporting on case pontifical state s many detractors seized on episode as an example of papal tyranny anxious to protect papal states precarious diplomatic position cardinal secretary of state giacomo antonelli liaised with rome s jewish community to arrange a meeting with momolo mortara and received him politely in early august 1858 antonelli promised that matter would be referred to pope and granted momolo s request that he be allowed to visit edgardo regularly in house of catechumens kertzer cites antonelli s concession of repeated visits as opposed to usual single meeting as first sign that mortara case would take on a special significance attempts of mortaras and their allies to identify who was supposed to have baptised edgardo quickly bore fruit after their present servant anna facchini adamantly denied any involvement they considered former employees and soon earmarked morisi as a possible candidate in late july 1858 mortara home was visited by scagliarini a friend of morisi s who had once worked for marianna s brother in law cesare de angelis marianna s brother angelo padovani tested scagliarini by saying falsely that he had heard it was morisi who had baptised edgardo ruse worked scagliarini said that she had been told same thing by morisi s sister monica younger angelo padovani went with de angelis to confront morisi in san giovanni in persiceto padovani recalled finding her in tears after visitors assured her that they meant no harm morisi recounted what she had told feletti she said that a grocer named cesare lepori had suggested baptism when she mentioned edgardo s sickness and shown her how to perform it she had not mentioned it to anyone she went on until soon after edgardo s brother aristide died at age of one in 1857 when a neighbour s servant called regina proposed that morisi should have baptised aristide that she had done so to edgardo slipped out of my mouth according to padovani morisi described crying during her interrogation by inquisitor and expressed guilt over edgardo s removal figuring that it was all my fault i was very unhappy and still am morisi agreed to have this formally recorded but was gone when padovani and de angelis returned after three hours with a notary and two witnesses after searching for her in vain they went back to bologna with only their hearsay account of her story which padovani thought genuine her words and her demeanour and her tears before she could launch into her story persuaded me that what she told me was all true two narratives edgardo was visited by his father several times under supervision of rector of catechumens enrico sarra from mid august to mid september 1858 wildly divergent accounts of what happened during these encounters grew into two rival narratives of entire case momolo s version of events favoured by jewish community and other backers was that a family had been destroyed by government s religious fanaticism that helpless edgardo had spent journey to rome crying for his parents and that boy wanted nothing more than to return home narrative favoured by church and its supporters and propagated in catholic press throughout europe was one of divinely ordained soul stirring redemption and a child endowed with spiritual strength far beyond his years neophyte edgardo had faced a life of error followed by eternal damnation but now stood to share in christian salvation and was distraught that his parents would not convert with him central theme in almost all renditions of narrative favouring mortara family was that of marianna mortara s health from july 1858 onwards it was reported across europe that as a result of her grief edgardo s mother had practically if not actually gone insane and might even die powerful image of heartbroken mother was stressed heavily in family s appeals both to public and to edgardo himself momolo and secretary of rome s jewish community sabatino scazzocchio told edgardo that his mother s life was at risk if he did not come back soon when marianna wrote to her son in august scazzocchio refused to deliver letter on grounds that being relatively calm and reassuring in tone it might work against impression they were trying to give him that she was no longer herself and that only his return could save her one correspondent reported in january 1859 father shows a great deal of courage but mother is having a hard time carrying on if holy father had seen this woman as i saw her he would not have courage to keep her son another moment there were many different versions of catholic story but all followed same basic structure all had edgardo quickly and fervently embracing christianity and trying to learn as much as possible about it most described a dramatic scene of edgardo wondering at a painting of virgin mary in sorrow either in rome or during journey from bologna agostini policeman who had escorted him to rome reported that boy had at first stubbornly refused to enter a church with him for mass but displayed an apparently miraculous transformation when he did a common theme was that edgardo had become a kind of prodigy according to an eyewitness account published in catholic l armonia della colla civilta he had learned catechism perfectly within a few days blesse d servant who baptised him and declared that he wanted to convert all jews to christianity most influential pro church article on mortara was an account published in jesuit periodical la civilta cattolica in november 1858 and subsequently reprinted or quoted in catholic papers across europe this story had child begging rector of catechumens not to send him back but to let him grow up in a christian home and initiated what became a central plank of pro church narrative that edgardo had a new family namely catholic church itself article quoted edgardo as saying i am baptised i am baptised and my father is pope according to kertzer proponents of this pro church narrative did not seem to realise that to many these accounts sounded too good to be true and absurd kertzer comments if edgardo in fact told his father that he did not want to return with him that he now regarded pope as his true father and wanted to devote his life to converting jews this message seems not to have registered with momolo liberals protestants and jews across continent ridiculed catholic press reports a booklet published in brussels in 1859 outlined two contrasting narratives then concluded between miracle of a six year old apostle who wants to convert jews and cry of a child who keeps asking for his mother and his little sisters we don t hesitate for a moment mortara s parents furiously denounced catholic accounts as lies but some of their supporters were less certain about where edgardo s loyalties now lay these included scazzocchio who had attended some of disputed meetings at catechumens lepori s denial morisi discredited momolo returned to bologna in late september 1858 after his two brothers in law wrote to him that if he stayed in rome any longer family might be ruined he left scazzocchio to represent family s cause in rome momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine morisi s credibility either by disproving aspects of her story or by showing her to be untrustworthy he also resolved to confront cesare lepori grocer who morisi said had both suggested baptism and shown her how to perform it based on morisi s story lepori had already been identified by many observers as being ultimately to blame for affair when momolo visited his shop in early october lepori vehemently denied that he had ever spoken to morisi about edgardo or any baptism and said that he was prepared to testify to this effect before any legal authority he claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism so had such a conversation occurred it could hardly have gone as morisi described carlo maggi a catholic acquaintance of momolo s who was also a retired judge sent a report of lepori s refutation to scazzocchio who asked antonelli to pass it on to pope a cover letter attached to maggi s statement described it as proof that morisi s story was false scazzocchio also forwarded an affidavit from mortara family doctor pasquale who acknowledged that edgardo had fallen sick when he was about a year old but stated that he had never been in danger of dying and that in any case morisi had been herself bedridden at time she was supposed to have baptised boy a further report sent from bologna in october 1858 comprising statements of eight women and one man all catholics corroborated doctor s claims about sicknesses of edgardo and morisi respectively and alleged that former maid was given to theft and sexual impropriety four women including servant anna facchini and woman who had employed morisi after she left mortaras elena pignatti claimed that morisi had regularly flirted with austrian officers and invited them into her employers homes for sex alatri then back to rome momolo set out for rome again on 11 october 1858 this time bringing marianna with him in hope that her presence might make a stronger impression on church and edgardo anxious about possible consequences of a dramatic reunification between mother and son rector enrico sarra took edgardo from rome to alatri his own home town about away mortaras tracked them to a church in alatri where from door momolo saw a priest saying mass and edgardo by his side assisting him momolo waited outside and afterwards persuaded rector to let him see his son before this meeting could take place mortaras were arrested on orders of mayor of alatri himself following a request from town s bishop and despatched back to rome antonelli was not impressed thinking this an undignified line of action that would give obvious ammunition to church s detractors and ordered sarra to bring edgardo back to capital to meet his parents edgardo returned to catechumens on 22 october and was visited by his parents often over next month as with momolo s first round of visits two different versions emerged of what happened according to edgardo s parents boy was obviously intimidated by clergymen around him and threw himself into his mother s arms when he first saw her marianna later said he had lost weight and had turned pale his eyes were filled with terror i told him that he was born a jew like us and like us he must always remain one and he replied si mia cara mamma i will never forget to say every day one report in jewish press described priests telling edgardo s parents that god had chosen their son to be apostle of christianity to his family dedicated to converting his parents and his siblings and that they could have him back if they also became christians clerics and nuns then knelt and prayed for conversion of mortara household prompting edgardo s parents to leave in terror pro church accounts by contrast described a boy very much resolved to stay where he was and horrified by his mother s exhortations to return to judaism of his ancestors in this narrative main reason for mortaras grief was not that their son had been taken but that he now stood to grow up in christian faith according to la civilta cattolica marianna flew into a rage on seeing a medallion hanging from edgardo s neck bearing image of virgin mary and ripped it off one article went so far as to claim jewish mother had done this with words i d rather see you dead than a christian some of church s critics had charged that by keeping edgardo it was violating commandment that a child should honour his father and mother la civilta cattolica countered that edgardo still loved his family despite their religious differences and indeed after being taught by priests to read and write had chosen to write his first letter to his mother signing it your most affectionate little son louis ultramontane editor of l univers newspaper and one of pope s staunchest defenders reported after meeting edgardo in rome that boy had told him that he loves his father and his mother and that he will go to live with them when he is older so that he can speak to them of saint peter of god and of most holy mary outrage international scandal political machinations thumb upright napoleon iii of france was among international figures enraged by papal states actions over mortara having made no progress in rome momolo and marianna mortara returned to bologna in early december 1858 and soon afterwards moved to turin in piedmont case an anti catholic publicist s dream to quote kertzer had by now become a massive controversy in both europe and united states with voices across social spectrum clamouring for pope to return edgardo to his parents mortara became a cause celebre not only for jews but for protestant christians as well particularly in united states where anti catholic sentiment abounded new york times published more than 20 articles on case in december 1858 alone in britain spectator presented mortara case as evidence that papal states had worst government in world most insolvent and most arrogant cruelest and meanest catholic press both in italy and abroad steadfastly defended pope s actions pro church articles often took on an overtly antisemitic character charging for example that if coverage in britain france or germany was critical this was hardly a surprise since currently newspapers of europe are in good part in hands of jews scazzocchio suggested that press storm attacking church was actually counter productive for mortara family s cause as it angered pope and thereby steeled his resolve not to compromise regardless of whether pope pius ix had been personally involved in decision to remove mortara from his parents whether he had been or not was debated extensively in press what is certain is that he was greatly surprised by international furore that erupted over matter he adopted position based on postremo mense that to return baptised child to his non christian family would be incompatible with church doctrine as foreign governments and various branches of rothschild family one by one condemned his actions pius ix stood firm on what he saw as a matter of principle those angered included emperor napoleon iii of france who found situation particularly vexing as pontifical government owed its very existence to french garrison in rome napoleon iii had indifferently supported pope s temporal rule because it enjoyed widespread support among french catholics scandal over mortara weakened this considerably and according to historian roger aubert provided final straw that changed french policy in february 1859 napoleon iii concluded a secret pact with kingdom of sardinia pledging french military support for a campaign to drive austrians out and unify italy most of pontifical domain would be absorbed along with two sicilies and other minor states it was then an annual custom for pope to receive a delegation from rome s jewish community shortly after new year meeting on 2 february 1859 quickly descended into a heated argument with pope pius berating jewish visitors for stirring up a storm all over europe about this mortara case when delegation denied that jews of rome had had any hand in anti clerical articles pope dismissed scazzocchio as inexperienced and foolish then shouted newspapers can write all they want i couldn t care less what world thinks pope then calmed down somewhat so strong is pity i have for you that i pardon you indeed i must pardon you one of delegates proposed that church should not give so much credence to morisi s testimony given her spurious morals pope countered that regardless of her character so far as he could see servant had no reason to invent such a story and in any case momolo mortara should not have employed a catholic in first place pope pius ix s determination to keep edgardo developed into a strong paternal attachment according to edgardo s memoirs pontiff regularly spent time with him and played with him pope would amuse child by hiding him under his cloak and calling out where s boy at one of their meetings pope pius told edgardo my son you have cost me dearly and i have suffered a great deal because of you he then said to others present both powerful and powerless tried to steal this boy from me and accused me of being barbarous and pitiless they cried for his parents but they failed to recognise that i too am his father montefiore s petition fall of bologna thumb upright sir moses montefiore president of board of deputies of british jews attempted to intercede on behalf of mortara family italian jewish appeals brought attention of sir moses montefiore president of board of deputies of british jews whose willingness to travel great distances to help his co religionists as he had over damascus blood libel of 1840 for example was already well known from august to december 1858 he headed a special british committee on mortara that relayed reports from piedmont to british newspapers and catholic clergymen and happily noted support expressed by british protestants particularly evangelical alliance led by sir culling eardley after unsuccessfully attempting to have british government lodge an official protest with vatican montefiore resolved to personally travel to rome to present a petition to pope calling for edgardo to be returned to his parents he arrived in rome on 5 april 1859 montefiore failed to gain an audience with pope and was received by cardinal antonelli only on 28 april montefiore gave him board of deputies petition to pass on to pope and said that he would wait in city a week for pontiff s reply two days later news reached rome that fighting had broken out between austrian and piedmontese troops in north war of 1859 had begun while most foreign dignitaries fled rome as quickly as possible montefiore waited in vain for pope s response he finally left on 10 may on his return to britain more than 2 000 leading citizens including 79 mayors and provosts 27 peers 22 anglican bishops and archbishops and 36 members of parliament signed a protest calling pope s conduct a dishonour to christianity repulsive to instincts of humanity meanwhile church quietly had edgardo confirmed as a catholic in a private chapel on 13 may 1859 edgardo was by this time no longer in catechumens but at san pietro in vincoli a basilica elsewhere in rome where pope pius had personally decided boy would be educated as war turned against austrians garrison in bologna left early in morning on 12 june 1859 by end of same day papal colours flying in squares had been replaced with italian green white and red cardinal legate had left city and a group styling itself bologna s provisional government had proclaimed its desire to join kingdom of sardinia bologna was promptly incorporated as part of province of romagna archbishop michele viale prela attempted to persuade citizenry not to co operate with new civil authorities but had little success one of new order s first official acts was to introduce freedom of religion and make all citizens equal before law in november 1859 governor luigi carlo farini issued a proclamation abolishing inquisition retribution feletti arrested thumb upright left luigi carlo farini governor of romagna after papal authorities in bologna fell in 1859 ordered an inquiry into authors of kidnapping momolo mortara spent late 1859 and january 1860 in paris and london trying to rally support while he was away his father simon who lived about west of bologna in reggio emilia successfully asked new authorities in romagna to launch an inquiry into mortara case on 31 december 1859 farini ordered his justice minister to pursue authors of kidnapping filippo curletti new director general of police for romagna was put in charge of investigation after two officers identified erstwhile inquisitor feletti as having given order to remove edgardo curletti and a detachment of police went to san domenico and arrested him at about 02 30 on 2 january 1860 police inspectors questioned feletti but each time they asked about anything to do with mortara or his removal friar said that a sacred oath precluded his discussing affairs of holy office when curletti ordered him to hand over all files relating to mortara case feletti said that they had been burned when asked when or how he repeated that on holy office matters he could say nothing pressed further feletti said as far as activities that i carried out as inquisitor of holy office of bologna i am obliged to explain myself to one forum only to supreme sacred congregation in rome whose prefect is his holiness pope pius ix and to no one else after police searched convent for documents relating to mortara case they found nothing inquisitor was escorted to prison news that feletti had been arrested caused press storm surrounding mortara which had died down somewhat to flare up again across europe investigation feletti s trial was first major criminal case in bologna under new authorities magistrate francesco carboni announced on 18 january 1860 that feletti and lieutenant colonel luigi de dominicis would be prosecuted but not lucidi or agostini when carboni interviewed feletti in prison on 23 january friar said that in seizing edgardo from his family he had only carried out instructions from holy office which never any decree without consent of roman pontiff feletti then recounted a version of church narrative of case stating that edgardo had always remained firm in his desire to remain a christian and was now studying successfully in rome he predicted in conclusion that edgardo would one day be support and pride of mortara family on 6 february momolo mortara gave an account of case that contradicted inquisitor s at almost every turn in rome he said edgardo had been frightened and intimidated by rector s presence but he openly declared his desire to return home with us carboni then travelled to san giovanni in persiceto to interrogate morisi who gave her age as 23 rather than actual 26 morisi said that edgardo had fallen sick in winter of 1851 52 when he was about four months old she recounted having seen mortaras sitting sadly by edgardo s crib and reading from a book in hebrew that jews read when one of them is about to die she repeated her account of giving edgardo an emergency baptism at instigation of grocer lepori and later telling story to a neighbour s servant called regina adding that she had also told her sisters about baptism as before lepori denied any role in affair whatsoever indeed saying he could not even remember morisi regina in morisi s story was identified as regina bussolari though morisi averred to have told her whole story bussolari professed to know nothing of case she said that she had only spoken with morisi once or twice when she was going up to storage room to get something and never about anything to do with mortaras children elena pignatti who had employed morisi after she left mortaras in 1857 her words about morisi s misconduct had formed part of mortaras appeal to pope testified that pignatti said that she had herself seen edgardo during his illness and marianna sitting by crib since his mother was crying and despaired for his life i thought he was dying also because of his appearance his eyes were closed and he was hardly moving she added that during three months when morisi worked for her in late 1857 servant had been summoned to san domenico four or five times and had said that inquisitor had promised her a dowry bussolari s denial that she had discussed any baptism with morisi raised question of who could have reported rumours to inquisitor in first place on 6 march carboni interviewed morisi again and pointed out inconsistencies between her story and testimony of mortara family doctor mortaras themselves and both lepori and bussolari she replied it s gospel truth carboni put it to morisi that she might have invented whole story out of spite against mortara family in hope that church might reward her when carboni asked morisi if she had been to san domenico apart from for her interrogation she stated that she had been there on two other occasions to try to secure a dowry from father feletti carboni suggested that morisi must have herself prompted interrogation by recounting edgardo s baptism during one of these visits morisi insisted that interrogation had been first and other two visits later after one last interview with feletti who again said almost nothing citing a sacred oath carboni informed him that so far as he could see there was no evidence to support his version of events feletti replied i with mortara parents for their painful separation from their son but i hope that prayers of innocent soul succeed in having god reunite them all in christian religion as for my punishment not only do i place myself in lord s hands but i would argue that any government would recognise legitimacy of my action next day feletti and de dominicis latter of whom had fled to rump papal states were formally charged with violent separation of boy edgardo mortara from his own jewish family feletti tried and acquitted feletti faced a court trial under code of laws in effect in bologna at time of edgardo s removal carboni proposed that even under pontifical laws seizure was illegal he reported that he had seen no evidence to support friar s claim that he had acted following instructions from rome and that there was substantial evidence casting doubt on morisi s account but so far as he could see feletti had done nothing to verify what she had said before ordering child removed after feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted saying he was putting his defence in hands of god and virgin mary experienced bologna lawyer francesco jussi was appointed by state to defend him hearing before a panel of six judges on 16 april 1860 was attended by neither mortara family nor feletti former because they were in turin and learned of trial date only two days beforehand and latter because he refused to recognise new authorities right to put him on trial with evidence gathered by curletti and carboni already in hand prosecution had no witnesses to call prosecutor radamisto valentini a lawyer fighting his first major case declared that feletti had ordered removal alone and on his own initiative and then turned his focus to carboni s second point of how authorities in rome could have possibly concluded that morisi s story was genuine valentini went over morisi s account in detail arguing that even if things had happened as she said baptism had not been administered properly and was therefore invalid he then highlighted inconsistencies between her testimony and other accounts condemned morisi as a silly girl corrupted by foul breath and touch of foreign soldiers who rolled over without shame with them and finally charged that feletti had ordered removal himself out of megalomania and an inquisitor s hatred of judaism jussi found himself in unusual position of attempting to defend a client who refused to defend himself with no evidence at his disposal to support feletti s testimony he was forced to rely almost entirely on his own oratory jussi put forward some aspects of sequence of events that he said suggested that orders had indeed come from rome for example that feletti had sent edgardo straight off to capital without seeing him and asserted that holy office and pope were far better placed to adjudge validity of baptism than a secular court he quoted at length from angelo padovani s account of his meeting with anna morisi in july 1858 then cast doubt on grocer lepori s claim that he did not even know how to baptise a child jussi produced a police report in which lepori was described as a close friend of a jesuit priest jussi proposed that lepori and bussolari might both be lying to protect themselves and that morisi s sexual impropriety did not necessarily mean her story was false he concluded that since feletti had been inquisitor at time he had merely done what that office required him to do and no crime had been committed judging panel headed by ferrari ruled following a swift deliberation that feletti should be released as he had acted under instructions from government of time interval between priest s arrest and his trial coupled with swift progress being made towards italian unification meant that mortara case had lost much of its prominence so there was little protest against decision jewish press expressed disappointment an editorial in italian jewish paper l suggested that it had perhaps been unwise to target feletti rather than someone more senior in france archives israelites took a similar line positing what good does it do to strike at arm when it is head that in this case conceived carried out and sanctioned attack plans to recapture edgardo mortaras were not surprised by verdict in feletti s trial momolo hoped that his son might be a major topic of discussion at an international conference on future of italy but was disappointed when no such summit materialised his cause and visit to paris partly motivated formation in may 1860 of alliance israelite universelle a paris based organisation dedicated to advancement of jewish civil rights across world as italian nationalist armies advanced through peninsula fall of rome seemed imminent in september 1860 alliance israelite universelle wrote to momolo offering him financial and logistical support if he wished to reclaim his son by force as getting your child back is cause of all israel a separate plan was formulated by carl blumenthal an english jew serving in giuseppe garibaldi s nationalist volunteer corps blumenthal and three others would dress up as clergymen seize edgardo and spirit him away garibaldi approved this plan in 1860 but it was apparently called off after one of conspirators died conclusion italian unification edgardo flees thumb kingdom of italy red and papal states purple in 1870 geographic names in this map are in german pope remained steadfastly determined not to give edgardo up declaring what i have done for this boy i had right and duty to do if it happened again i would do same thing when delegation from rome s jewish community attended their annual meeting at vatican in january 1861 they were surprised to find nine year old edgardo at pontiff s side new kingdom of italy was proclaimed a month later with victor emmanuel ii as king a reduced incarnation of papal states comprising rome and its immediate environs endured outside new kingdom because of napoleon iii s reluctance to offend his catholic subjects by withdrawing french garrison he pulled these troops out in 1864 following transport to catechumens of another jewish child nine year old giuseppe coen from roman ghetto removal of french garrison brought roman question to fore in italian parliament statesman marco dismissed a proposed compromise whereby rome would become part of kingdom with pope retaining some special powers saying we cannot go to guard mortara boy for pope french garrison returned in 1867 following an unsuccessful attempt by garibaldi to capture city in early 1865 at age of 13 edgardo became a novice in canons regular of lateran adding pope s name to his own to become pio edgardo mortara he wrote repeatedly to his family he recalled dealing with religion and doing what i could to convince them of truth of catholic faith but received no reply until may 1867 his parents who were now living in florence wrote that they still loved him dearly but saw nothing of their son in letters they had received in july 1870 just before edgardo turned 19 french garrison in rome was withdrawn for good after franco prussian war broke out italian troops captured city on 20 september 1870 momolo mortara followed italian army into rome hoping to finally reclaim his son according to some accounts he was preceded by his son riccardo edgardo s elder brother who had entered kingdom s service as an infantry officer riccardo mortara fought his way to san pietro in vincoli and found his brother s convent room edgardo covered his eyes raised his hand in front of him and shouted get back satan when riccardo said that he was his brother edgardo replied before you get any closer to me take off that assassin s uniform whatever truth what is certain is that edgardo reacted to capture of rome with intense panic he later wrote after piedmontese troops entered rome they used their force to seize neophyte coen from collegio degli then turned toward san pietro in vincoli to try to kidnap me as well roman chief of police asked edgardo to return to his family to appease public opinion but he refused he subsequently met italian commander general alfonso ferrero la marmora who told him that as he was 19 years old he could do as he wished edgardo was smuggled out of rome by train along with a priest on 22 october 1870 late at night and in lay clothes he made his way north and escaped to austria father mortara thumb father pio edgardo mortara right with his mother marianna c 1878 1890 edgardo found shelter in a convent of canons regular in austria where he lived under an assumed name in 1872 he moved to a monastery at poitiers in france where pope pius regularly corresponded with bishop about young man after a year pio edgardo mortara was ordained as a priest with special dispensation as at 21 he was technically too young he received a personal letter from pope to mark occasion and a lifetime trust fund of 7 000 lire to support him father mortara spent most of rest of his life outside italy travelling throughout europe and preaching it was said that he could give sermons in six languages including basque and read three more including hebrew as a preacher he was in great demand kertzer writes momolo mortara died in 1871 shortly after spending seven months in prison during his trial over death of a servant girl who had fallen from window of his apartment he had been found guilty of murdering her by florentine court of appeal but then acquitted by court of assizes pope pius ix died in 1878 same year marianna travelled to perpignan in south western france where she had heard edgardo was preaching and enjoyed an emotional reunion with her son who was pleased to see her but disappointed when she refused his pleas to convert to catholicism edgardo thereafter attempted to re establish connections with his family but not all of his relatives were as receptive to him as his mother following marianna s death in 1890 it was reported in french newspapers that she had finally on her deathbed and with edgardo beside her become a christian edgardo refuted this i have always ardently desired that my mother embrace catholic faith he wrote in a letter to le temps and i tried many times to get her to do so however that never happened a year later father pio edgardo mortara returned to italy for first time in two decades to preach in modena a sister and some of his brothers came out to hear his sermon and for rest of his life edgardo called on his relatives whenever he was in italy during a 1919 sojourn in rome he visited house of catechumens he had entered 61 years before by this time he had settled at abbey of canons regular at bouhay in liege belgium bouhay had a sanctuary to virgin of lourdes to which father mortara felt a special connection lourdes apparitions of 1858 having occurred in same year as his own conversion to christianity father pio edgardo mortara resided at bouhay for rest of his life and died there on 11 march 1940 at age of 88 appraisal and legacy mortara case is given little attention in most risorgimento histories if it is mentioned at all first book length scholarly work was rabbi bertram korn s american reaction to mortara case 1858 1859 1957 which was devoted entirely to public opinion in united states and according to kertzer often incorrect about details of case main historical reference until 1990s was a series of articles written by italian scholar gemma and published around centenary of controversy in 1958 60 when david kertzer began studying case he was surprised to find that many of his italian colleagues were not familiar with it while specialists in jewish studies across world invariably were mortara had as kertzer put it fallen from mainstream of italian history into ghetto of jewish history kertzer explored many sources not previously studied and eventually published kidnapping of edgardo mortara 1997 which has become standard reference work for affair mortara case was in view of timothy verhoeven greatest controversy to surround catholic church in mid 19th century as it more than any other single issue exposed divide between supporters and opponents of vatican abigail green writes that this clash between liberal and catholic worldviews at a moment of critical international tension gave mortara affair global significance and rendered it a transformative episode in jewish world as well mortara himself suggested in 1893 that his abduction had been for a time more famous than that of sabine women in months before pius ix s beatification by catholic church in 2000 jewish commentators and others in international media raised largely forgotten mortara episode while analysing pope s life and legacy according to dov levitan basic facts of mortara case are far from unique but it is nevertheless of particular importance because of its effect on public opinion in italy britain and france and as an example of great sense of jewish solidarity that emerged in latter half of 19th century as jews rose to cause of their brethren in various parts of world alliance israelite universelle whose formation had been partly motivated by mortara case grew into one of most prominent jewish organisations in world and endures into 21st century case is subject of francesco s two act opera il caso mortara which premiered in new york in 2010 italian language publication by vittorio messori in 2005 of mortara s unpublished castilian memoirs available in english since 2017 under title kidnapped by vatican unpublished memoirs of edgardo mortara reignited debate anew according to michael goldfarb mortara controversy provided an embarrassing example of just how out of touch with modern times church was and demonstrated that pope pius ix was incapable of bringing church into modern era kertzer takes a similar line refusal to return edgardo contributed to growing sense that pope s role as temporal ruler with his own police force was an anachronism that could no longer be maintained kertzer goes so far as to suggest that as a primary motivator for french change of stance that precipitated italian unification in 1859 1861 this story of an illiterate servant girl a grocer and a little jewish child
