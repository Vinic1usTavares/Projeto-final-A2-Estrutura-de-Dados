waptia fieldensis is an extinct species of arthropod from middle cambrian burgess shale lagerstatte of canada it grew to a length of about and resembled modern shrimp in both morphology and habit it had a large bivalved carapace and a segmented body terminating into a pair of tail flaps it was an active swimmer feeding on organic particles it gathered from seafloor substrate it is also one of oldest animals with direct evidence of brood care based on number of individuals waptia fieldensis is third most abundant arthropod from burgess shale formation with thousands of specimens collected it was among first fossils found by american paleontologist charles d walcott in 1909 he described it in 1912 and named it after two mountains near discovery site wapta mountain and mount field waptia fieldensis is only species classified under genus waptia although it bears a remarkable resemblance to modern crustaceans its taxonomic affinities remain unclear it is currently classified as a stem group crustacean and tentatively included in clade crustaceomorpha thumb life reconstruction of waptia fieldensis description waptia fieldensis had a maximum body length of exoskeleton was very thin and easily distorted from fossilisation it possessed a large bivalved carapace that was narrow at front with wide posterior margins that covered cephalon and most of thorax cephalon had five short somites body segments with three to five pairs of small and poorly preserved feeding appendages a single pair of long and slender antennae is present segments of which are relatively few and elongated they were most probably used as sensory organs with most segments possessing small setae bristles a pair of short lobed structures possible antennules are also present their position corresponding to location of second pair of antennae in modern day crustaceans in between them is a small triangular rostral plate with a narrow and sharp central ridge well developed compound eyes were stalked striking morphological similarities of eyes of waptia fieldensis to that of extant shrimp make it very likely that they were capable of producing true visual images or were at least sensitive to motion a median eye may have also been present nervous tissue including a putative brain has been identified thorax is divided into two groups of somites anterior group is composed of four somites each with well developed walking limbs with lengths that extend past margins of carapace their morphological details are not well preserved but their distal segments appear to possess a multitude of small spines it is unknown if these limbs are biramous but they are assumed to be endopodites inner branches ramus of leg with exopodites or outer branches absent or not preserved posterior thoracic group is made up of six somites each possessing a pair of long multi jointed appendages segments of these appendages are longer near body and taper towards flexible distal segments extending past carapace they bear a fringe of long slender filaments all of which are directed towards middle of body a characteristic shared by extant crustaceans though usually squashed into blade like shapes from fossilisation process filaments were slender cylindrical tubes when animal was alive filaments at tipmost segment are often bunched together these appendages are believed to be exopodites and may have functioned as gills and as swimming limbs they are possibly biramous with some specimens showing traces of what may be small endopodites at their bases abdomen is composed of five somites all of which lack appendages except last back facing margins of these somites bear small spines and four or more larger spines last abdominal somite forks into a pair of flattened spatulate appendages uropods that function as a tail fan caudal rami in addition to stabilising body while swimming a quick flick of tail fan can rapidly propel animal backwards which may have functioned as a means of escaping predators like in modern shrimp traces of four fused segments are evident in three faint lines dividing each lobe of tail fan a long telson is present at end of body traces of a rounded stomach small digestive glands and an intestine that terminates into a tiny anal opening on telson can also be observed in some specimens discovery thumb field notebook of charles d walcott from august 31 to september 3 1909 detailing discovery of burgess shale fossils three arthropods are drawn in entry for august 31 marrella waptia and naraoia smithsonian institution archives accession 10 166 walcott charles d charles doolittle 1850 1927 charles d walcott collection thumb mount field with wapta mountain in background near field british columbia canada waptia fieldensis was one of first fossils discovered by charles d walcott from burgess shale in august 1909 a rough sketch of waptia is present in his diary for august 31 1909 alongside sketches of marrella and naraoia a formal description for species was published by walcott in 1912 species was named after two mountains connected by fossil ridge containing burgess shale locality wapta mountain and mount field of yoho national park british columbia canada name of wapta mountain itself comes from first nation word meaning running water while mount field was named after american telecommunications pioneer cyrus west field taphonomy specimens of waptia fieldensis were recovered from burgess shale of canada which dates from middle cambrian period 510 to 505 million years ago locality was once about underwater it was located at bottom of a warm and shallow tropical sea adjacent to a submarine limestone cliff now cathedral limestone formation undersea landslides caused by collapse of parts of limestone cliff would periodically bury organisms in area as well as organisms carried by landslides in fine grained mud that later became shale based on number of individuals waptia fieldensis constitutes about 2 55 of total number of organisms recovered from burgess shale and 0 86 of greater phyllopod bed this makes them third most abundant arthropods of burgess shale after marrella and canadaspis national museum of natural history alone houses more than a thousand specimens of species from burgess shale waptia fieldensis are often found disarticulated with parts remaining in close proximity to each other several possible specimens of w fieldensis were also recovered from middle cambrian spence shale member of langston formation in utah in 2008 taxonomy waptia fieldensis is only species accepted under genus waptia it is classified under family established by walcott in 1912 order established by leif stormer in 1944 and tentatively clade crustaceomorpha early restorations of waptia fieldensis by charles r knight in 1940 erroneously depicted it as a primitive shrimp but modern paleontologists now consider it among burgess shale arthropods that are of unknown and uncertain taxonomic placement some authors have suggested that it may be allied to crustaceans but like many cambrian mouthparts were not preserved making it impossible to reliably classify them within crustacean crown group others propose that it may be only distantly related to crustaceans being at least a member of a stem group of crustaceans or even of all arthropods despite being one of first species recovered and being third most abundant fossils of burgess shale there is still no in depth work on morphology of waptia fieldensis in 1975 an apparently very similar species was described from lower cambrian 515 to 520 million years ago maotianshan shale of chengjiang china it was originally placed within ostracod like genus mononotella as mononotella ovata in 1991 xian guang hou and jan bergstrom reclassified it under new genus chuandianella when additional discoveries of more complete specimens made its resemblance to w fieldensis more apparent like w fieldensis chuandianella ovata had a bivalved carapace with a median ridge a pair of caudal rami a single pair of antennae and stalked eyes in 2004 jun yuan chen tentatively transferred it to genus waptia however c ovata had eight abdominal somites in contrast to five in w fieldensis its limbs were biramous and were undifferentiated unlike those of w fieldensis other authors deemed these differences to be enough to separate it from waptia to its own genus in 2002 a second similar species spinodorsalis was recovered from lower cambrian sirius passet of buen formation of northern greenland it was also identified as a possible like c ovata it had biramous undifferentiated appendages but it also had only five abdominal somites like w fieldensis however poor preservation of p spinodorsalis specimens particularly of appendages on head make it difficult to ascertain its taxonomic placement this difficulty is further compounded by evidence that fossils of p spinodorsalis may in fact be moults exuviae and not of actual animal ecology in addition to their striking superficial similarity to contemporary shrimp waptia fieldensis were also very shrimp like in their habits they were bottom dwelling deposit feeders lack of strong feeding appendages indicates that they were more likely to feed by sifting through sea bottom for edible organic particles their tails and feather like filaments on their posterior thoracic somites also imply that they were active swimmers in 2015 egg clutches were identified in six specimens from burgess shale clutch sizes were small only containing up to 24 eggs but each egg was relatively large with an average diameter of they were tucked inside carapace attached along inner surface along with from chengjiang biota around 7 million years older than burgess shale which also had fossilized eggs preserved inside carapace they constitute oldest direct evidence of brood care and of k selection among animals it indicates that they probably lived in an environment which required them to take special measures to ensure survival of their young see also burgessia history of burgess shale stephen formation walcott quarry references external links waptia fieldensis
