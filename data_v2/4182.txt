political uncertainty resulting from a recently concluded civil war 56 delegates met in san felipe de austin to draft a series of petitions to government of mexico volatile william h wharton presided over meeting although convention s agenda largely mirrored that of convention of 1832 delegates also agreed to pursue independent statehood for province which was at time part of state of coahuila y tejas under guidance of sam houston former governor of us state of tennessee a committee drafted a state constitution to submit to mexican congress proposed constitution was largely patterned on us political principles yet retained several spanish customs delegates also requested customs exemptions and asked that a ban on immigration into texas be lifted some residents complained that this convention like its predecessor was illegal nevertheless stephen f austin journeyed to mexico city to present petitions to government frustrated with lack of progress in october austin wrote a letter encouraging texans to form their own state government this letter was forwarded to mexican government and austin was imprisoned in early 1834 during his imprisonment federal and state legislatures later passed a series of measures to placate colonists including introduction of trial by jury austin acknowledged that e very evil complained of has been remedied quoted in davis 2006 p 117 background mexico won its independence from spain in 1821 after new country s monarchy was overthrown constitution of 1824 established a federalist republic composed of multiple states sparsely populated provinces were denied independent statehood and instead merged with neighboring areas mexican texas which marked country s eastern border with united states was combined with coahuila to form new state coahuila y tejas to facilitate government of large area state was subdivided into several departments all of texas was included in department of bexar ericson 2000 p 33 texas was part of mexican frontier and settlers faced frequent raids by native tribes bankrupt and unable to provide much military assistance in 1824 federal government legalized immigration from united states and europe hoping that an influx of settlers would discourage raiding manchaca 2001 pp 164 187 as number of americans living in texas increased mexican authorities became apprehensive that united states intended to annex area possibly by force henson 1982 pp 47 8 morton 1943 p 33 to curb perceived threat mexican government passed law of april 6 1830 which restricted immigration from united states into texas and called for first enforcement of customs duties new laws were unpopular with both native mexicans in texas tejanos and recent immigrants texians davis 2006 p 77 thumb upright general

ostentatious military uniform in 1832 general antonio lopez de santa anna led a revolt against president anastasio bustamante s centralist government davis 2006 p 85 under pretext that they supported santa anna a small group of texians armed themselves and overthrew commander of garrison that was enforcing new customs duties henson 1982 pp 95 102 109 other settlers followed their example and within weeks all mexican soldiers in eastern texas had been forced to leave davis 2006 p 86 buoyed by their military success texians organized a political convention to persuade mexican authorities to weaken laws of april 6 1830 davis 2006 p 92 although two municipalities with largest tejano populations san antonio de bexar and victoria refused to participate 55 delegates met in october for convention of 1832 davis 2006 p 91 they adopted a series of resolutions that requested changes in governance of texas most controversial item was for texas to become an independent state separate from coahuila after approving list of resolutions delegates created a seven member central committee to convene future meetings barker 1985 p 351 before list of concerns could be presented to state and federal governments ramon musquiz political chief of department of bexar ruled that convention was illegal davis 2006 p 94 law directed that citizens should protest to their local ayuntamiento similar to a city council which would forward their concerns to political chief political chief could then escalate concerns to appropriate governmental authority because this process had not been followed musquiz annulled resolutions preparation previous convention s lack of tejano representation fostered a perception that only newcomers to texas were dissatisfied president of convention of 1832 stephen f austin traveled to san antonio de bexar to garner support for changes convention had requested austin found that tejano leaders largely agreed with result of convention but opposed methods by which resolutions had been proposed they urged patience bustamante was still president and would not look favorably on a petition from settlers who had recently sided with his rival santa anna as a compromise ayuntamiento of san antonio de bexar drafted a petition containing similar language to convention s resolutions following legal norms they submitted this to musquiz who forwarded it to mexican congress in early 1833 at this time federal and state governments were in flux bustamante had resigned presidency in late december 1832 as part of a treaty to end civil war there was no effective state government governor of coahuila y tejas had died in september 1832 and his replacement federalist juan martin de veramendi immediately dissolved state legislature which had centralist leanings veramendi called elections to seat a new government in early 1833 davis 2006 p 95 due to political uncertainty austin urged that federal government be given several months to address petition if no action was eventually taken he advised that texas residents would form their own state government essentially declaring independence from coahuila if not from mexico austin s timeframe was endorsed by tejano leaders but it did not pacify texian settlers towards end of december central committee called for a new convention to meet in san felipe de austin in april 1833 san felipe de austin was capital of first colony founded by stephen f austin elections were scheduled for march this action disturbed tejano leaders who saw it as a violation of their agreement with austin barker jan 1943 p 330 communities in texas elected 56 delegates for new convention in a departure from previous election san antonio de bexar also sent delegates including james bowie son in law of governor veramendi bowie like many of his fellow delegates was known as an agitator who wanted immediate change davis 2006 p 96 majority of delegates to previous convention had been more cautious proceedings convention of 1833 was called to order on april 1 1833 in san felipe de austin by coincidence on that day santa anna was inaugurated as new president of mexico delegates elected william h wharton a known hothead as president of convention wharton had lost his bid to be president of previous convention historian william c davis describes wharton s election as a public declaration that while austin was still respected his moderate course would no longer be followed on first day several delegates addressed convention to justify recent texian actions many argued that expulsion of most garrisons in region was not an act of disloyalty to mexico but instead resistance to a particular form of governance sam houston who represented nacogdoches commented that santa anna was only a name used as an excuse for resistance to oppression quoted in davis 2006 p 97 several delegates argued that recently concluded civil war had left mexico in too much turmoil to provide effective rule for texas echoing american revolution slogan no taxation without representation one delegate insisted that texas was not bound by mexican laws since its settlers had no representation this delegate overlooked fact that texas had been granted two representatives to coahuila y tejas legislature davis 2006 p 97 austin presented an overview of events that had occurred in texas and in rest of mexico over previous year he enumerated several grievances against political and judicial systems and concluded that texas needed to become an independent state this could be justified in his opinion by language in constitution of 1824 state constitution by second day of convention delegates were in agreement to pursue separate statehood austin wrote to a friend we are now able to sustain a state govt and no country ever required one more than this houston was named chairman of a committee to draft a new state constitution although houston had not lived in texas for very long he was well known having served as governor of tennessee and as a member of united states congress thumb right upright sam houston chaired committee which wrote a proposed state constitution alt lithograph of a solemn middle aged man looking towards left he is clean shaven with a high forehead he wears a shirt with a high collar a partially unbuttoned vest and a suit jacket new constitution was based on a copy of 1780 massachusetts constitution provided by one of committee members proposed document also drew from constitutions of other states in united states including louisiana missouri and tennessee it provided meticulous detail for new system of government miller jan 1988 p 310 executive branch structure proposed by austin miller jan 1988 p 309 called for a governor who would serve two year terms state would have a bicameral legislature and a three tier judiciary system with local and district courts ultimately kept in check by a state supreme court davis 2006 p 98 a 27 article bill of rights containing according to historian howard miller an impressive list of protected rights was included this document aligned closely with contemporary american political ideals especially notion that all men had a right to liberty much of language and concepts were drawn from first eight amendments to united states constitution document called for trial by jury a distinct departure from mexican law which required that trials be heard by local alcalde defendants would be granted counsel and would have right to examine any evidence against them they would be protected from excessive bail or cruel and unusual punishments civil authorities would take priority over military authorities ericson april 1959 p 459 delegates also agreed to protect free communication of thoughts and opinions quoted in miller jan 1988 p 310 a phrase carefully drafted to imply freedom of speech of assembly and of press although it could also be interpreted to imply freedom of religion delegates were unwilling to explicitly grant that right knowing that it would cause an uproar in catholic mexico although mexican law mandated that settlers convert to catholicism most texians continued to practice their former religions with little interference from governmental authorities a few of rights were drawn from spanish practices ericson apr 1959 p 458 proposed constitution forbade english practices of primogeniture and entailment following a change made to spanish law in 1821 delegates retained traditional spanish prohibition against seizing a debtor s physical apr 1959 p 460 and extended it to forbid imprisonment as a punishment for debt this was a novel idea in united states nine states had enumerated certain conditions under which a debtor could not be imprisoned but no state had an unqualified prohibition on practice borrowing from resolutions of convention of 1832 delegates wrote into constitution a guarantee of free public education they further banned unsecured paper currency and insisted state economy should be based solely on hard currency when constitution was completed david g burnet headed a subcommittee to craft a letter to mexican authorities to explain merits of proposal resolutions in addition to development of a state constitution delegates passed a series of resolutions that asked mexican authorities for reforms several of these echoed resolutions passed at previous year s convention delegates again insisted that ban on immigration should be repealed and that customs duties be lifted resolutions also requested additional protection from raids by native tribes and that government implement a more efficient mail delivery system we do hold in utter abhorrence all participation whether direct or indirect in african slave trade that we do concur in general indignation which has been manifested throughout civilized world against that inhuman and unprincipled traffic and we do therefore earnestly recommend to our constituents good people of texas that they will not only abstain from all concern in that abominable traffic but that they will unite their efforts to prevent evil from polluting our shores text of resolution condemning in barker oct 1902 p 151 one of resolutions would have been more suited for passage by a state legislature than a group of concerned citizens perhaps to atone for some of more revolutionary items they had requested as one of their final acts delegates passed a resolution that condemned slave trade within texas constitution of 1824 had already abolished slave trade and constitution of coahuila y tejas had forbidden importation of slaves into state most settlers in texas ignored restrictions and instead converted their slaves to servants indentured for 99 years barker oct 1902 p 150 african slaves were still imported into texas occasionally and a ship carrying slaves docked in galveston bay as convention met this ship like most others used to import slaves came from cuba which was a possession of spain because spain did not officially recognize mexican independence delegates considered this trade treasonous to mexico barker oct 1902 p 151 delegates ordered that resolution be printed in newspapers in mexican interior and in new orleans it was not printed in texas although davis clearly asserts that resolution was not printed within texas barker oct 1902 p 151 claims it was published in texas advocate barker does not specify where this newspaper was printed or by whom clearly indicating that it was intended to influence public opinion in mexican interior rather than in texas davis 2006 p 99 resolution was not binding and slaves continued to be imported to texas through cuba despite a vocal minority advocating for unilateral implementation of proposals delegates agreed to present requests to mexican congress for approval they did agree to take action if it appeared their demands would be ignored as their last act delegates elected austin james miller and erasmo seguin to deliver their petitions to mexico city seguin a prominent citizen of san antonio de bexar had not attended convention delegates hoped austin could persuade seguin to accompany him thus implying that tejanos supported resolutions preparations for delivery when convention adjourned on april 13 austin went directly to san antonio de bexar to meet with seguin seguin called a series of meetings held from may 3 to 5 for prominent locals to discuss convention proceedings he was only bexar resident to fully support separate statehood barker jan 1943 p 331 other residents suggested that capital of coahuila y tejas should be moved to san antonio de bexar giving texas more power there was precedent for this under veramendi capital had just been moved from saltillo to if legislature rejected move these residents vowed to support separate statehood davis 2006 p 100 a third group of residents believed that convention like its predecessor was illegal under their interpretation of laws only state legislature would be able to petition mexican congress for such a drastic change austin argued that laws really meant that no one could petition on behalf of people unless people had been consulted and convention served as that consultation meetings ended with no agreement on how to proceed barker jan 1943 p 332 austin wrote that people here agree in substance with rest of texas but differ as to manner and will express no opinion for nor against quoted in davis 2006 p 100 seguin declined to accompany austin miller also withdrew texas was in throes of a cholera epidemic and miller a physician felt it his duty to stay and tend sick davis 2006 p 101 austin then visited goliad but was unable to attract any more tejano support cantrell 1999 p 268 he chose to go to mexico city alone he had visited several times and had established a good reputation among government officials although he was warned that his reception would likely be poor he ignored suggestions to delay his journey reception within mexican interior rumors abounded that texas was on verge of revolution many citizens in matamoros believed texians had already declared independence and were raising an army santa anna was infuriated especially at involvement of houston a former officer in united states military thumb left upright stephen f austin delivered convention s resolutions to mexico city alt portrait of a man with receding hairline and long sideburns wearing an 1840s style suit immediately after santa anna had taken office in april he had handed over all decision making authority to his vice president valentin gomez farias and retired to countryside farias enacted many federalist reforms which angered citizens and army leaders davis 2006 pp 107 108 much of country was clamoring for a return to centralism yet texians wanted to take further steps toward self rule davis 2006 p 109 by time austin arrived in mexico city on july 18 several mexican states had engaged in minor revolts against farias s reforms although texians had expelled troops within their province before santa anna and farias took office many officials identified province with other rebellious states and were suspicious of austin s intentions cholera epidemic reached mexico city within days of austin s arrival prompting congress to adjourn before austin could present convention s resolutions as he waited for legislature to reconvene austin heard rumors that texians were planning a third convention to unilaterally declare themselves a separate state although austin was also frustrated at lack of progress he disapproved of this drastic proposal in an attempt to quell more radical groups in texas in october austin sent a letter to ayuntamiento in san antonio de bexar in which he proposed that all of should jointly form a new state government davis 2006 p 110 in what could be interpreted as an inflammatory gesture austin signed his letter dios y tejas god and texas rather than traditional mexican closing dios y libertad god and liberty cantrell 1999 p 271 a few days after he had posted letter immigration ban was repealed assuaging one of major texian concerns austin had expected letter to reach his friend musquiz who could be trusted to determine when or if it was appropriate to publicly disclose its contents letter arrived while musquiz was out of town and was read by an unsympathetic ayuntamiento member cantrell 1999 pp 272 77 at this member s request ayuntamiento of san antonio de bexar forwarded letter to state officials in coahuila new governor veramendi died in cholera epidemic francisco vidaurri y villasenor ordered austin s arrest cantrell 1999 p 278 austin was arrested in december on suspicion of treason davis 2006 p 111 he was imprisoned through all of 1834 and remained in mexico city on bond until july 1835 during austin s imprisonment government addressed several more of convention s proposals at santa anna s urging coahuila y tejas legislature enacted several measures to placate texians in early 1834 texas gained an additional seat in state legislature an american immigrant was named state attorney general and for first time foreigners were granted explicit permission to participate in retail trade cantrell 1999 p 291 several american legal concepts including trial by jury were introduced to texas and english was authorized as a second language davis 2006 p 117 finally state created four new municipalities in texas matagorda san augustine bastrop and san patricio in a letter to a friend austin
