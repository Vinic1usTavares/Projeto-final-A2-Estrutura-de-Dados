california sea lion zalophus californianus is a coastal eared seal native to western north america it is one of six species of sea lion its natural habitat ranges from southeast alaska to central mexico including gulf of california sea lions are sexually dimorphic males are larger than females and have a thicker neck and protruding sagittal crest they mainly haul out on sandy or rocky beaches but they also frequent manmade environments such as marinas and wharves sea lions feed on a number of species of fish and squid and are preyed on by killer whales and great white sharks california sea lions have a polygynous breeding pattern from may to august males establish territories and try to attract females with which to mate females are free to move in between territories and are not coerced by males mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations notably with barks and mother pup contact calls outside their breeding season sea lions spend much of their time at sea but they come to shore to molt sea lions are particularly intelligent can be trained to perform various tasks and display limited fear of humans if accustomed to them because of this california sea lions are a popular choice for public display in zoos circuses and and are trained by united states navy for certain military operations international union for conservation of nature iucn lists species as least concern due to its abundance to protect fish us states of oregon and washington engage in annual kill quotas of sea lions taxonomy thumb left lithography by joseph smit california sea lion was described by rene primevere lesson a french naturalist in 1828 it is grouped with other sea lions and fur seals in family also known as eared seals differ from true seals in having external ear flaps and proportionately larger foreflippers and pectoral muscles along with galapagos sea lion and extinct japanese sea lion california sea lion belongs to genus zalophus which derives from greek words za meaning intensive and meaning crest this refers to protruding sagittal crest of males which distinguishes members of genus traditionally galapagos sea lion and japanese sea lion were classified as subspecies of california sea lion however a genetic study in 2007 found that all three are in fact separate species lineages of california and japanese sea lion appear to have split off 2 2 million years ago during pliocene california sea lion differs from galapagos sea lion in its greater sexual dimorphism steller sea lion is closest extant relative of zalophus sea lions being a sister taxon appearance physiology and movement thumb left california sea lion skeleton being sexually dimorphic california sea lions differ in size shape and coloration between sexes males are typically around long and weigh up to while females are typically around and weigh up to females and juveniles have a tawny brown pelage although they may be temporarily light gray or silver after molting pelage of adult males can be anywhere from light brown to black but is typically dark brown face of adult males may also be light tan in some areas pups have a black or dark brown pelage at birth although species has a slender build adult males have robust necks chests and shoulders adult males also have a protruding crest which gives them a high domed forehead it is tufted with white hairs they also have manes which are less developed than those of adult male south american and steller sea lions both sexes have long narrow muzzles as an otariid california sea lion relies on its foreflippers to propel itself when swimming this form of aquatic locomotion along with its streamlined body effectively reduces drag underwater its movement is not continuous animal glides in between each stroke flexibility of its spine allows sea lion to bend its neck backwards far enough to reach its hindflippers this allows animal to make dorsal turns and maintain a streamlined posture when moving on land sea lion is able to turn its hindflippers forward and walk on all fours it moves foreflippers in a transverse rather than a sagittal fashion in addition it relies on movements of its head and neck more than its hindflippers for terrestrial locomotion sea lions may travel at speeds of around and can dive at depths of and for up to 9 9 minutes though most dives are typically and last less than 3 minutes thumb right sea lion swimming underwater sea lions have color vision though it is limited to blue green area of color spectrum this is likely an adaptation for living in marine coastal habitats sea lions have fairly acute underwater hearing with a hearing range of 0 4 32 khz sea lions rely on their whiskers or vibrissae for touch and detection of vibrations underwater compared to harbor seal california sea lion s vibrissae are smoother and less specialized and thus perform less when following hydrodynamic trails although they still perform well ecology range and habitat thumb left sea lion rookery on santa barbara island california sea lion ranges along western coast and islands of north america from southeast alaska to central mexico mitochondrial dna sequences in 2009 have identified five distinct california sea lion populations u s or pacific temperate stock western baja california or pacific tropical stock and southern central and northern gulf of california stocks u s stock breeds mainly in channel islands although some breeding sites may be established in northern california and females are now commonly found there western baja california stock mainly breeds near punta eugenia and at isla santa margarita above mentioned stocks are separated by ensenada front stocks of gulf of california live in shallow waters of north northern stock tidal islands near center central stock and mouth of bay southern stock stock status of sea lions at deep waters of central bay has not been analyzed vagrants can reach western north pacific such as on commander islands commander islands nature and biosphere reserve california sea lion zalophus californianus lesson 1828 retrieved on august 24 2017 although several have been recorded around japanese archipelago in recent years their exact origins are unclear lu er dao xian sa mo chuan nei shi bu ming xian hai qi bu ru lei qing bao de su thumb right sea lions in santa cruz california during breeding season sea lions gather on both sandy and rocky shores on warm days they lie closer to water at night or in cool weather they travel farther inland or to higher elevations non breeding individuals may gather at marinas wharves or even navigational buoys california sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time such as near bonneville dam nearly 150 miles up columbia river in 2004 a healthy sea lion was found sitting on a road in merced county california almost a hundred miles upstream from san francisco bay and half a mile from san joaquin river diet and predation california sea lions feed on a wide variety of seafood mainly squid and fish and sometimes clams commonly eaten fish and squid species include salmon hake pacific whiting anchovy herring rockfish lamprey dogfish and market squid they mostly forage near mainland coastlines continental shelf and seamounts they may also search along ocean bottom california sea lions may eat alone or in small to large groups depending on amount of food available they sometimes cooperate with other predators such as dolphins porpoises and seabirds when hunting large schools of fish sea lions sometimes follow dolphins and exploit their hunting efforts adult females feed between from shore males may forage as far as from shore when water temperatures rise they also have learned to feed on steelhead and salmon below fish ladders at bonneville dam and at other locations where fish must queue in order to pass through dams and locks that block their passage sea lions are preyed on by killer whales and large sharks at monterey bay california sea lions appear to be more common food items for transient mammal eating killer whale pods sea lions may respond to dorsal fin of a killer whale and remain vigilant even when encountering resident fish eating pods sea lions are also common prey for white sharks they have been found with scars made by attacks from both white sharks and shortfin mako sharks sharks attack sea lions by ambushing them while they are resting at surface sea lions that are attacked in hindquarters are more likely to survive and make it to shore life history reproductive behavior and parenting thumb sea lion rookery california sea lions breed gregariously between may and august when they arrive at their breeding rookeries when establishing a territory males will try to increase their chances of reproducing by staying on rookery for as long as possible during this time they will fast relying on a thick layer of fat called blubber for energy size and patience allow a male to defend his territory more effectively bigger male more blubber he can store and longer he can wait a male sea lion usually keeps his territory for around 27 days females have long parturition intervals and thus males do not establish their territories until after females give birth most fights occur during this time after this males rely on ritualized displays vocalizations head shaking stares bluff lunges and so on to maintain their territorial boundaries since temperatures can reach over during this time males must include water within their territories some territories are underwater particularly those near steep cliffs sea lions that fail to establish a territory are driven out to sea or gather at a nearby beach thumb left sea lion mother with pup before mating begins females gather into milling groups of 2 20 individuals females in these groups will mount each other as well as males these groups begin to disintegrate as females begin to mate territorial and mating system of california sea lion has been described as similar to a lek system as females appear to choose their mates while moving though different territories they avoid males that are too aggressive or energetic males are usually unable to prevent females from leaving their territories particularly in water mating may occur outside rookeries between non territorial males and females as latter move to and from mating site in some rookeries copulation may be monopolized by a few males while at others a single male may sire no more than four pups female california sea lions have a 12 month reproductive cycle consisting of a 9 month actual gestation and a 3 month delayed implantation of fertilized egg before giving birth in june or july interbirth intervals are particularly long for this species being 21 days for sea lions off california and more than 30 days for sea lions in gulf of california females remain with their pups on shore for 10 days and nurse them after this females will go on foraging trips lasting as long as three days returning to nurse their pups for up to a day pups left on shore tend to gather in nurseries to socialize and play when returning from a trip females call their pups with distinctive calls to which pups will reply in kind a mother and pup can distinguish each other s calls from those of other mothers and pups at first reunions largely depend on efforts of mothers however as pups get older they get more involved in reunions older pups may sometimes join their mothers during their foraging trips adult male california sea lions play no role in raising pups but they do take more interest in them than adult males of other otariid species they have even been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators pups are weaned by a year but can continue to suckle for another year communication thumb barking sea lions pursuing a boat california sea lions communicate with a range of vocalizations most commonly used one is their characteristic bark territorial males are loudest and most continuous callers and barks are produced constantly during peak of breeding season sea lions bark especially rapidly when excited barks of territorial and non territorial males sound similar although those of former are deeper males may bark when threatening other males or during courtship only other vocalization made by territorial males is a prolonged hoarse grunt sound made when an individual is startled by a human this vocalization is also made by groups of non reproductive males female sea lions are less vocal their barks high pitched and shorter than those made by males are used in aggressive situations other aggressive vocalizations given by females include squeal belch and growl sound a female sea lion gives when calling her pups is called a pup attraction call described as loud and brawling pups respond with a mother response call which is similar in structure pups will also bleat or bark when playing or in distress california sea lions can produce vocalizations underwater these include sounds barks and clicks nonbreeding activities outside breeding season males migrate to northern ends of species range to feed while females forage near breeding rookeries sea lions can stay at sea for as long as two weeks at a time they make continuous dives returning to surface to rest sea lions may travel alone or in groups while at sea and haul out between each sea trip adult females and juveniles molt in autumn and winter adult males molt in january and february gulf of california sea lions do not migrate they stay in gulf year round intelligence and trainability thumb 250px left zak a navy sea lion leaps back into boat after a harbor patrol training mission marine biologist ronald j and his research associates have studied sea lions cognitive ability they have discovered that sea lions are able to recognize relationships between stimuli based on similar functions or connections made with their peers rather than only stimuli s common features sea lions have demonstrated ability to understand simple syntax and commands when taught an artificial sign language however sea lions rarely used signs semantically or logically in 2011 a california sea lion named ronan was recorded bobbing her head in synchronization to musical rhythms this rhythmic entrainment was previously seen only in humans parrots and other birds possessing vocal mimicry thumb right captive sea lion performing thumb a california sea lion at central park zoo it has climbed to edge of its tank awaiting feeding showing awareness of its regular feeding time because of their intelligence and trainability california sea lions have been used by circuses and marine mammal parks to perform various tricks such as throwing and catching balls on their noses running up ladders or honking horns in a musical fashion trainers reward their animals with fish which motivates them to perform for ball balancing trainers toss a ball at a sea lion so it may accidentally balance it or hold ball on its nose thereby gaining an understanding of what to do a sea lion may go through a year of training before performing a behavior for public however its memory allows it to perform a behavior even after three months of resting some organizations such as humane society of united states and world animal protection object to using sea lions and other marine mammals for entertainment claiming tricks are exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors and distract audience from animal s unnatural environment california sea lion is used in military applications by u s navy marine mammal program including detecting naval mines and enemy divers in persian gulf animals can swim behind divers approaching a us naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to diver s leg navy officials say sea lions can do this in seconds before enemy realizes what happened organizations like peta believe that such operations put animals in danger however navy insists that sea lions are removed once their mission is complete status thumb hundreds of california sea lions bask on pier 39 in san francisco where they are welcomed as a tourist attraction alt photo of sea lions crowded together on dock iucn lists california sea lion as least concern due to its large and increasing population size estimated population is 238 000 241 000 for u s or pacific temperate stock 75 000 85 000 for western baja california or pacific tropical stock and 31 393 for population in gulf of california off pacific coast of united states sea lions are so numerous that they are close to carrying capacity while gulf of california population declined by 20 by 2008 sea lions may be killed when in conflict with fishermen by poaching and by entanglements in man made garbage they are also threatened by pollutants like ddt and pcb which accumulate in marine food chain thumb shooting sea lions ca 1870s in united states california sea lion is protected on federal marine mammal protection act passed in 1972 which outlaws hunting killing capture and harassment of animal in 1994 an amendment to act allowed for possibility of limited lethal removal of pinnipeds preying on endangered salmonids should level of predation be documented to have a significant adverse impact on decline or recovery of esa listed salmonids applications have been granted for removal of several individual sea lions at ballard locks and at bonneville dam where up to 92 sea lions can be killed each year for a 5 year period critics have objected to killing of sea lions pointing out that level of mortality permitted as a result of recreational and commercial fisheries in river and as part of operation of hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to salmon these animals exploit more man made environments like docks for haul out sites many docks are not designed to withstand weight of several resting sea lions which cause major tilting and other problems wildlife managers have used various methods to control animals and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand them 2015 californian shore sea lions pups crisis in january and february 2015 1450 malnourished or sick sea lion pups were found along stretches of california coast and estimations give a higher number of dead pups national oceanic and atmospheric administration has pointed to unprecedentedly warm pacific coastal waters related to pacific decadal oscillation and el nino as likely cause elevated water temperatures reduced abundance of anchovies sardines and mackerel principal components of sea lion pup diet during nursery season this caused many sea lion pups to starve while others died when they took to open waters in search of food at too early an age several months earlier in summer of 2014 a large number of cassin s chicks died during fledging period due to similar circumstances brought about by elevated water temperatures oregon and washington state governments annual killings in november 2018 state of oregon obtained a permit to kill 93 sea lions per year below willamette falls under a similar program
