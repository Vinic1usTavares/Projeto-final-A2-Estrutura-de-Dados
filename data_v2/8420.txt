hathor house of horus hathor was a major goddess in ancient egyptian religion who played a wide variety of roles as a sky deity she was mother or consort of sky god horus and sun god ra both of whom were connected with kingship and thus she was symbolic mother of their earthly representatives pharaohs she was one of several goddesses who acted as eye of ra ra s feminine counterpart and in this form she had a vengeful aspect that protected him from his enemies her beneficent side represented music dance joy love sexuality and maternal care and she acted as consort of several male deities and mother of their sons these two aspects of goddess exemplified egyptian conception of femininity hathor crossed boundaries between worlds helping deceased souls in transition to afterlife hathor was often depicted as a cow symbolizing her maternal and celestial aspect although her most common form was a woman wearing a headdress of cow horns and a sun disk she could also be represented as a lioness cobra or sycamore tree cattle goddesses similar to hathor were portrayed in egyptian art in fourth millennium bc but she may not have appeared until old kingdom c 2686 2181 bc with patronage of old kingdom rulers she became one of egypt s most important deities more temples were dedicated to her than to any other goddess her most prominent temple was dendera in upper egypt she was also worshipped in temples of her male consorts egyptians connected her with foreign lands such as nubia and canaan and their valuable goods such as incense and semiprecious stones and some of peoples in those lands adopted her worship in egypt she was one of deities commonly invoked in private prayers and votive offerings particularly by women desiring children during new kingdom c 1550 1070 bc goddesses such as mut and isis encroached on hathor s position in royal ideology but she remained one of most widely worshipped deities after end of new kingdom hathor was increasingly overshadowed by isis but she continued to be venerated until extinction of ancient egyptian religion in early centuries ad origins thumb right alt stone slate carved with reliefs replica of narmer palette c 31st

from later times who were represented in this form hathor mehet weret and nut despite these early precedents hathor is not unambiguously mentioned or depicted until fourth dynasty c 2613 bc of old kingdom although several artifacts that refer to her may date to early dynastic period c 3100 2686 bc when hathor does clearly appear her horns curve outward rather than inward like those in predynastic art a bovine deity with inward curving horns appears on narmer palette from near start of egyptian history both atop palette and on belt or apron of king narmer egyptologist henry george fischer suggested this deity may be bat a goddess who was later depicted with a woman s face and inward curling antennae seemingly reflecting curve of cow horns egyptologist lana troy however identifies a passage in pyramid texts from late old kingdom that connects hathor with apron of king reminiscent of goddess on narmer s garments and suggests goddess on narmer palette is hathor rather than bat in fourth dynasty hathor rose rapidly to prominence she supplanted an early crocodile god who was worshipped at dendera in upper egypt to become dendera s patron deity and she increasingly absorbed cult of bat in neighboring region of hu so that in middle kingdom c 2055 1650 bc two deities fused into one theology surrounding pharaoh in old kingdom unlike that of earlier times focused heavily on sun god ra as king of gods and father and patron of earthly king hathor ascended with ra and became his mythological wife and thus divine mother of pharaoh roles hathor took many forms and appeared in a wide variety of roles egyptologist robyn gillam suggests that these diverse forms emerged when royal goddess promoted by old kingdom court subsumed many local goddesses worshipped by general populace who were then treated as manifestations of her egyptian texts often speak of manifestations of goddess as seven hathors or less commonly of many more hathors as many as 362 for these reasons gillam calls her a type of deity rather than a single entity hathor s diversity reflects diversity of traits that egyptians associated with goddesses more than any other deity she exemplifies egyptian perception of femininity sky goddess hathor was given epithets mistress of sky and mistress of stars and was said to dwell in sky with ra and other sun deities egyptians thought of sky as a body of water through which sun god sailed and they connected it with waters from which according to their creation myths sun emerged at beginning of time this cosmic mother goddess was often represented as a cow hathor and mehet weret were both thought of as cow who birthed sun god and placed him between her horns like nut hathor was said to give birth to sun god each dawn hathor s egyptian name was hwt hrw or hwt hr it is typically translated house of horus but can also be rendered as my house is sky falcon god horus represented among other things sun and sky house referred to may be sky in which horus lives or goddess s womb from which he as a sun god is born each day solar goddess hathor was a solar deity a feminine counterpart to sun gods such as horus and ra and was a member of divine entourage that accompanied ra as he sailed through sky in his barque she was commonly called golden one referring to radiance of sun and texts from her temple at dendera say her rays illuminate whole earth she was sometimes fused with another goddess nebethetepet whose name can mean lady of offering lady of contentment or lady of vulva at ra s cult center of heliopolis hathor nebethetepet was worshipped as his consort and egyptologist rudolf argued that hathor s name referred to a mythical house of horus at heliopolis that was connected with ideology of kingship she was one of many goddesses to take role of eye of ra a feminine personification of disk of sun and an extension of ra s own power ra was sometimes portrayed inside disk which troy interprets as meaning that eye goddess was thought of as a womb from which sun god was born hathor s seemingly contradictory roles as mother wife and daughter of ra reflected daily cycle of sun at sunset god entered body of goddess her and fathering deities born from her womb at sunrise himself and eye goddess who would later give birth to him ra gave rise to his daughter eye goddess who in turn gave rise to him her son in a cycle of constant regeneration eye of ra protected sun god from his enemies and was often represented as a uraeus or rearing cobra or as a lioness a form of eye of ra known as hathor of four faces represented by a set of four cobras was said to face in each of cardinal directions to watch for threats to sun god a group of myths known from new kingdom c 1550 1070 bc onward describe what happens when eye goddess rampages uncontrolled in funerary text known as book of heavenly cow ra sends hathor as eye of ra to punish humans for plotting rebellion against his rule she becomes lioness goddess sekhmet and massacres rebellious humans but ra decides to prevent her from killing all humanity he orders that beer be dyed red and poured out over land eye goddess drinks beer mistaking it for blood and in her inebriated state reverts to being benign and beautiful hathor related to this story is myth of distant goddess from late and ptolemaic periods eye goddess sometimes in form of hathor rebels against ra s control and rampages freely in a foreign land libya west of egypt or nubia to south weakened by loss of his eye ra sends another god such as thoth to bring her back to him

represented female aspect of himself and could be personified by hathor nebethetepet or another goddess iusaaset in a late creation myth from ptolemaic period 332 30 bc god khonsu is put in a central role and hathor is goddess with whom khonsu mates to enable creation hathor could be consort of many male gods of whom ra was only most prominent mut was usual consort of amun preeminent deity during new kingdom who was often linked with ra but mut was rarely portrayed alongside amun in contexts related to sex or fertility and in those circumstances hathor or isis stood at his side instead in late periods of egyptian history form of hathor from dendera and form of horus from edfu were considered husband and wife and in different versions of myth of distant goddess hathor was consort of montu and hathor tefnut consort of shu hathor s sexual side was seen in some short stories in a cryptic fragment of a middle kingdom story known as tale of herdsman a herdsman encounters a hairy animal like goddess in a marsh and reacts with terror on another day he encounters her as a nude alluring woman most egyptologists who study this story think this woman is hathor or a goddess like her one who can be wild and dangerous or benign and erotic thomas schneider interprets text as implying that between his two encounters with goddess herdsman has done something to pacify her in contendings of horus and set a new kingdom short story about dispute between those two gods ra is upset after being insulted by another god babi and lies on his back alone after some time hathor exposes her genitals to ra making him laugh and get up again to perform his duties as ruler of gods life and order were thought to be dependent on ra s activity and story implies that hathor averted disastrous consequences of his idleness her act may have lifted ra s spirits partly because it sexually aroused him although why he laughed is not fully understood hathor was praised for her beautiful hair egyptian literature contains allusions to a myth not clearly described in any surviving texts in which hathor lost a lock of hair that represented her sexual allure one text compares this loss with horus s loss of his divine eye and set s loss of his testicles during struggle between two gods implying that loss of hathor s lock was as catastrophic for her as maiming of horus and set was for them hathor was called mistress of love as an extension of her sexual aspect in series of love poems from papyrus chester beatty i from twentieth dynasty c 1189 1077 bc men and women ask hathor to bring their lovers to them

of human queens isis and osiris were considered horus s parents in osiris myth as far back as late old kingdom but relationship between horus and hathor may be older still if so horus only came to be linked with isis and osiris as osiris myth emerged during old kingdom even after isis was firmly established as horus s mother hathor continued to appear in this role especially when nursing pharaoh images of hathor cow with a child in a papyrus thicket represented her mythological upbringing in a secluded marsh goddesses milk was a sign of divinity and royal status thus images in which hathor nurses pharaoh represent his right to rule hathor s relationship with horus gave a healing aspect to her character as she was said to have restored horus s missing eye or eyes after set attacked him in version of this episode in contendings of horus and set hathor finds horus with his eyes torn out and heals wounds with gazelle s milk beginning in late period 664 323 bc temples focused on worship of a divine family an adult male deity his wife and their immature son satellite buildings known as mammisis were built in celebration of birth of local child deity child god represented cyclical

from town of hu named and several child forms of horus milky sap of sycamore tree which egyptians regarded as a symbol of life became one of her symbols milk was equated with water of nile inundation and thus fertility in late ptolemaic and roman periods many temples contained a creation myth that adapted long standing ideas about creation version from hathor s temple at dendera emphasizes that she as a female solar deity was first being to emerge from primordial waters that preceded creation and her life giving light and milk nourished all living things like meskhenet another goddess who presided over birth hathor was connected with shai egyptian concept of fate particularly when she took form of seven hathors in two new kingdom works of fiction tale of two brothers and tale of doomed prince hathors appear at births of major characters and foretell manner of their deaths hathor s maternal aspects can be compared with those of isis and mut yet there are many contrasts between them isis s devotion to her husband and care for their child represented a more socially acceptable form of love than hathor s uninhibited sexuality and mut s character was more authoritative than sexual text of first century ad papyrus likens a faithful wife mistress of a household to mut while comparing hathor to a strange woman who tempts a married man foreign lands and goods egypt maintained trade relations with coastal cities of syria and canaan particularly byblos placing egyptian religion in contact with religions of that region at some point perhaps as early as old kingdom egyptians began to refer to patron goddess of byblos baalat gebal as a local form of hathor so strong was hathor s link to byblos that texts from dendera say she resided there egyptians sometimes equated anat an aggressive canaanite goddess who came to be worshipped in egypt during new kingdom with hathor some canaanite artworks depict a nude goddess with a curling wig taken from hathor s iconography which goddess these images represent is not known but egyptians adopted her iconography and came to regard her as an independent deity whom they associated with hathor hathor s solar character may have played a role in linking her with trade she was believed to protect ships on nile and in seas beyond egypt as she protected barque of ra in sky mythological wandering of eye goddess in nubia or libya gave her a connection with those lands as well hathor was closely connected with sinai peninsula which was not considered part of egypt proper but was site of egyptian mines for copper turquoise and malachite during middle and new kingdoms one of hathor s epithets lady of may have referred specifically to turquoise or to all blue green minerals she was also called lady of faience a blue green ceramic that egyptians likened to turquoise hathor was also worshipped at various quarries and mining sites in egypt s eastern desert such as amethyst mines of wadi el hudi where she was sometimes called lady of amethyst south of egypt hathor s influence was thought to have extended over land of punt which lay along red sea coast and was a major source for incense with which hathor was linked as well as with nubia northwest of punt autobiography of harkhuf an official in sixth dynasty c 2345 2181 bc describes his expedition to a land in or near nubia from which he brought back great quantities of ebony panther skins and incense for king text describes these exotic goods as hathor s gift to pharaoh egyptian expeditions to mine gold in nubia introduced her cult to region during

front of which stand papyrus stalks and a pyramidal chapel hathor in bovine form emerges from a hill representing theban necropolis in a copy of book of dead from 13th century bc hathor was one of several goddesses believed to assist deceased souls in afterlife one of these was imentet goddess of west who personified necropolises or clusters of tombs on west bank of nile and realm of afterlife itself she was often regarded as a specialized manifestation of hathor just as she crossed boundary between egypt and foreign lands hathor passed through boundary between living and duat realm of dead she helped spirits of deceased humans enter duat and was closely linked with tomb sites where that transition began theban necropolis for example was often portrayed as a stylized mountain with cow of hathor emerging from it her role as a sky goddess was also linked to afterlife because sky goddess either nut or hathor assisted ra in his daily rebirth she had an important part in egyptian afterlife beliefs according to which deceased humans were reborn like sun god coffins tombs and underworld itself were interpreted as womb of this goddess from which deceased soul would be reborn nut hathor and imentet could each in different texts lead deceased into a place where they would receive food and drink for eternal sustenance thus hathor as imentet often appears on tombs welcoming deceased person as her child into a blissful afterlife in new kingdom funerary texts and artwork afterlife was often illustrated as a pleasant fertile garden over which hathor sometimes presided welcoming afterlife goddess was often portrayed as a goddess in form of a tree giving water to deceased nut most commonly filled this role but tree goddess was sometimes called hathor instead afterlife also had a sexual aspect in osiris myth murdered god osiris was resurrected when he copulated with isis and conceived horus in solar ideology ra s union with sky goddess allowed his own rebirth sex therefore enabled rebirth of deceased and goddesses like isis and hathor served to rouse deceased to new life but they merely stimulated male deities regenerative powers rather than playing central role ancient egyptians prefixed names of deceased with osiris s name to connect them with his resurrection for example a woman named henutmehyt would be dubbed osiris henutmehyt over time they increasingly associated deceased with both male and female divine powers as early as late old kingdom women were sometimes said to join worshippers of hathor in afterlife just as men joined following of osiris in third intermediate period c 1070 664 bc egyptians began to add hathor s name to that of deceased women in place of that of osiris in some cases women were called osiris hathor indicating that they benefited from revivifying power of both deities in these late periods hathor was sometimes said to rule afterlife as osiris did iconography hathor was often depicted as a cow bearing sun disk between her horns especially when shown nursing king she could also appear as a woman with head of a cow her most common form however was a woman wearing a headdress of horns and sun disk often with a red or turquoise sheath dress or a dress combining both colors sometimes horns stood atop a low or vulture headdress that egyptian queens often wore in new kingdom because isis adopted same headdress during new kingdom two goddesses can be distinguished only if labeled in writing when in role of imentet hathor wore emblem of west upon her head instead of horned headdress seven hathors were sometimes portrayed as a set of seven cows accompanied by a minor sky and afterlife deity called bull of west some animals other than cattle could represent hathor uraeus was a common motif in egyptian art and could represent a variety of goddesses who were identified with eye of ra when hathor was depicted as a uraeus it represented ferocious and protective aspects of her character she also appeared as a lioness and this form had a similar meaning in contrast domestic cat which was sometimes connected with hathor often represented eye goddess s pacified form when portrayed as a sycamore tree hathor was usually shown with upper body of her human form emerging from trunk like other goddesses hathor might carry a stalk of papyrus as a staff though she could instead hold a was staff a symbol of power that was usually restricted to male deities only goddesses who used was were those like hathor who were linked with eye of ra she also commonly carried a sistrum or a menat necklace sistrum came in two varieties a simple loop shape or more complex naos sistrum which was shaped to resemble a naos shrine and flanked by volutes resembling antennae of bat emblem menat necklace made up of many strands of beads was shaken in ceremonies in hathor s honor similarly to sistrum images of it were sometimes seen as personifications of hathor herself mirrors were another of her symbols because in egypt they were often made of gold or bronze and therefore symbolized sun disk and because they were connected with beauty and femininity some mirror handles were made in shape of hathor s face hathor was sometimes represented as a human face with bovine ears seen from front rather than in profile based perspective that was typical of egyptian art when she appears in this form tresses on either side of her face often curl into loops this mask like face was placed on capitals of columns beginning in late old kingdom columns of this style were used in many temples to hathor and other goddesses these columns have two or four faces which may represent duality between different aspects of goddess or watchfulness of hathor of four faces designs of hathoric columns have a complex relationship with those of sistra both styles of sistrum can bear hathor mask on handle and hathoric columns often incorporate naos sistrum shape above goddess s head worship thumb right alt refer to caption copy

deities to receive such donations late old kingdom rulers especially promoted cult of hathor in provinces as a way of binding those regions to royal court she may have absorbed traits of contemporary provincial goddesses many female royals though not reigning queens held positions in cult during old kingdom mentuhotep ii who became first pharaoh of middle kingdom despite having no relation to old kingdom rulers sought to legitimize his rule by portraying himself as hathor s son first images of hathor cow suckling king date to his reign and several priestesses of hathor were depicted as though they were his wives although he may not have actually married them in course of middle kingdom queens were increasingly seen as directly embodying goddess just as king embodied ra emphasis on queen as

emphasized her relationship to hathor in a different way she used names and titles that linked her to a variety of goddesses including hathor so as to legitimize her rule in what was normally a male position she built several temples to hathor and placed her own mortuary temple which incorporated a chapel dedicated to goddess at deir el bahari which had been a cult site of hathor since middle kingdom preeminence of amun during new kingdom gave greater visibility to his consort mut and in course of period isis began appearing in roles that traditionally belonged to hathor alone such as that of goddess in solar barque despite growing prominence of these deities hathor remained important particularly in relation to fertility sexuality and queenship throughout new kingdom after new kingdom isis increasingly overshadowed hathor and other goddesses as she took on their characteristics in ptolemaic period 305 30 bc when greeks governed egypt and their religion developed a complex relationship with that of egypt ptolemaic dynasty adopted and modified egyptian ideology of kingship beginning with arsinoe ii wife of ptolemy ii ptolemies closely linked their queens with isis and with several greek goddesses particularly their own goddess of love and sexuality aphrodite nevertheless when greeks referred to egyptian gods by names of their own gods a practice called interpretatio graeca they sometimes called hathor aphrodite traits of isis hathor and aphrodite were all combined to justify treatment of ptolemaic queens as goddesses thus poet callimachus alluded to myth of hathor s lost lock of hair when praising berenice ii for sacrificing her own hair to aphrodite and iconographic traits that isis and hathor shared such as bovine horns and vulture headdress appeared on images portraying ptolemaic queens as aphrodite temples in egypt thumb upright alt room with tall stone columns topped by faces of women columns walls and ceiling are covered in painted

was in region of memphis where hathor of sycomore was worshipped at many sites throughout memphite necropolis during new kingdom era temple of hathor of southern sycomore was her main temple in memphis at that site she was described as daughter of city s main deity ptah cult of ra and atum at heliopolis northeast of memphis included a temple to hathor nebethetepet that was probably built in middle kingdom a willow and a sycomore tree stood near sanctuary and may have been worshipped as manifestations of goddess a few cities farther north in nile delta such as and also had temples to her as rulers of old kingdom made an effort to develop towns in upper and middle egypt several cult centers of hathor were founded across region at sites such as and naga ed der in first intermediate period c 2181 2055 her cult statue from dendera was periodically carried to theban necropolis during beginning of middle kingdom mentuhotep ii established a permanent cult center for her in necropolis at deir el bahari nearby village of deir el medina home to tomb workers of necropolis during new kingdom also contained temples of hathor one continued to function and was periodically rebuilt as late as ptolemaic period centuries after village was abandoned dendera hathor s oldest temple in upper egypt dates to at least to fourth dynasty after end of old kingdom it surpassed her memphite temples in importance many kings made additions to temple complex through egyptian history last version of temple was built in ptolemaic and roman periods and is today one of best preserved egyptian temples from that time in old kingdom most priests of hathor including highest ranks were women many of these women were members of royal family in course of middle kingdom women were increasingly excluded from highest priestly positions at same time that queens were becoming more closely tied to hathor s cult thus non royal women disappeared from high ranks of hathor s priesthood although women continued to serve as musicians and singers in temple cults across egypt most frequent temple rite for any deity was daily offering ritual in which cult image or statue of a deity would be clothed and given food daily ritual was largely same in every egyptian temple although goods given as offerings could vary according to which deity received them wine and beer were common offerings in all temples but especially in rituals in hathor s honor and she and goddesses related to her often received sistra and menat necklaces in late and ptolemaic times they were also offered a pair of mirrors representing sun and moon festivals many of hathor s annual festivals were celebrated with drinking and dancing that served a ritual purpose revelers at these festivals may have aimed to reach a state of religious ecstasy which was otherwise rare or nonexistent in ancient egyptian religion graves brown suggests that celebrants in hathor s festivals aimed to reach an altered state of consciousness to allow them interact with divine realm an example is festival of drunkenness commemorating return of eye of ra which was celebrated on twentieth day of month of thout at temples to hathor and to other eye goddesses it was celebrated as early as middle kingdom but it is best known from ptolemaic and roman times dancing eating and drinking that took place during festival of drunkenness represented opposite of sorrow hunger and thirst that egyptians associated with death whereas rampages of eye of ra brought death to humans festival of drunkenness celebrated life abundance and joy in a local theban festival known as beautiful festival of valley which began to be celebrated in middle kingdom cult image of amun from temple of karnak visited temples in theban necropolis while members of community went to tombs of their deceased relatives to drink eat and celebrate hathor was not involved in this festival until early new kingdom after which amun s overnight stay in temples at deir el bahari came to be seen as his sexual union with her several temples in ptolemaic times including that of dendera observed egyptian new year with a series of ceremonies in which images of temple deity were supposed to be revitalized by contact with sun god on days leading up to new year dendera s statue of hathor was taken to a specialized room in temple and placed under a ceiling decorated with images of sky and sun on first day of new year first day of month of thoth hathor image was carried up to roof to be bathed in genuine sunlight best documented festival focused on hathor is another ptolemaic celebration festival of beautiful reunion it took place over fourteen days in month of hathor s cult image from dendera was carried by boat to several temple sites to visit gods of those temples endpoint of journey was temple of horus at edfu where hathor statue from dendera met that of horus of edfu and two were placed together on one day of festival these images were carried out to a shrine where primordial deities such as sun god and ennead were said to be buried texts say divine couple performed offering rites for these entombed gods many egyptologists regard this festival as a ritual marriage between horus and hathor although martin stadler challenges this view arguing that it instead represented rejuvenation of buried creator gods c j bleeker thought beautiful reunion was another celebration of return of distant goddess citing allusions in temple s festival texts to myth of solar eye barbara richter argues that festival represented all three things at once she points out that birth of horus and hathor s son ihy was celebrated at dendera nine months after festival of beautiful reunion implying that hathor s visit to horus represented ihy s conception third month of egyptian calendar hathor or athyr was named for goddess festivities in her honor took place throughout month although they are not recorded in texts from dendera worship

temple of baalat gebal in byblos using syncretism of baalat with hathor to cement their close trading relationship with byblos a temple to hathor as lady of byblos was built during reign of thutmose iii although it may simply have been a shrine within temple of baalat after breakdown of new kingdom hathor s prominence in byblos diminished along with egypt s trade links to city a few artifacts from early first millennium bc suggest that egyptians began equating baalat with isis at that time a myth about isis s presence in byblos related by greek author plutarch in his work on isis and osiris in 2nd century ad suggests that by his time isis had entirely supplanted hathor in city egyptians in sinai built a few temples in region largest was a complex dedicated primarily to hathor as patroness of mining at serabit el khadim on west side of peninsula it was occupied from middle of middle kingdom to near end of new timna valley on fringes of egyptian empire on east side of peninsula was site of seasonal mining expeditions during new kingdom it included a shrine to hathor that was probably deserted during off season local midianites whom egyptians used as part of mining workforce may have given offerings to hathor as their overseers did after egyptians abandoned site in twentieth dynasty however midianites converted shrine to a tent shrine devoted to their own deities in contrast nubians in south fully incorporated hathor into their religion during new kingdom when most of nubia was under egyptian control pharaohs dedicated several temples in nubia to hathor such as those at and amenhotep iii and ramesses ii both built temples in nubia that celebrated their respective queens as manifestations of female deities including hathor amenhotep s wife tiye at and ramesses s wife at small temple of abu simbel independent kingdom of kush which emerged in nubia after collapse of new kingdom based its beliefs about kushite kings on royal ideology of egypt therefore hathor isis mut and nut were all seen as mythological mother of each kushite king and equated with his female relatives such as kandake kushite queen or queen mother who had prominent roles in kushite religion at jebel barkal a site sacred to amun kushite king built a pair of temples one dedicated to hathor and one to mut as consorts of amun replacing new kingdom egyptian temples that may have been dedicated to these same goddesses but isis was most prominent of egyptian goddesses worshipped in nubia and her status there increased over time thus in period of nubian history c 300 bc

and fertility deities such as hathor and taweret were commonly worshipped in household shrines egyptian women squatted on bricks while giving birth and only known surviving birth brick from ancient egypt is decorated with an image of a woman holding her child flanked by images of hathor in roman times terracotta figurines sometimes found in a domestic context depicted a woman with an elaborate
