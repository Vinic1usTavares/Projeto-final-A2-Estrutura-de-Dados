coulthard won layout of 21 turn riyadh street circuit was unveiled in a public ceremony at diriyah governorate on 25 september 2018 track s design overseen by contractor issa el features a number of flowing corners and high speed turns and few 90 degrees corners that are typical of formula e street circuits existing road network was upgraded to comply with fia standards with construction performed in close collaboration with unesco and diriyah gate development authority to ensure area s heritage was conserved for future generations d ambrosio spoke of his belief track s sweeping corners would be main objective to setting a fast lap time and race would be about electrical energy management this is definitely not a classic formula e track that we have used before especially all way from turn 1 to turn 14 which will be a lot of part throttle and high speed for formula e concerns about human rights following initial announcement of its inauguration race was subject to criticism by formula e members and outside observers in light of saudi arabia s human rights record regarding its treatment of women minorities and migrant workers its oil wealth and dependency and other major geopolitical problems in response to these concerns agag revealed saudi arabian authorities requested women to participate in weekend s racing activities and were granted dispensation to report on and spectate race we are happy to be part of that change and we see formula e as a force for good and in this case is a very specific place under very specific circumstances but we think formula e can make a contribution also for good in that country by doing this after assassination of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi in consulate of saudi arabia in turkish capital of istanbul in october 2018 agag told associated press ad diriyah eprix would proceed as scheduled and stated formula e would monitor situation referring to incident we obviously have no comment to make at this moment there are no plans to change formula e calendar this season post race test session first in season test session of 2018 19 campaign was held at circuit day after eprix teams were permitted six hours of running divided into two sessions and were allowed to field one or two cars as part of an fia women in motorsport initiative teams were encouraged to field female drivers due to

participant carmen and gt racer carrie schreiner report shakedown a half an hour shakedown session was held on friday afternoon to allow teams to check efficiency and reliability of their cars at reduced speed sam bird and massa stopped during session bird continued and massa pulled over to side of circuit to end his session early after shakedown several drivers praised circuit s challenge paffett explained its elevation changes were greater than had been expected from pre race simulations dillmann compared it to suzuka circuit and rosenqvist likened it to circuito cittadino dell eur just surviving track is going to be an achievement itself felix da costa opined most likely areas for overtaking manoeuvres on narrow circuit away from turn 18 were final and first corners concerns were raised about attack mode activation zone positioned on track s right hand side leaving turn 17 which required drivers to take a tighter line than normal and reduce their speed on racing line in order to enter area and drive near barrier vergne spoke of his feeling zone was too close to corner s exit while jaguar s mitch evans argued it should have been placed further along track dillmann argued drivers could lose up to two seconds of time and they would activate system under safety car conditions felix da costa said he felt differing rate of speed within racing line was dangerous despite criticism fia did not initially consider altering or moving zone because of a perceived limit of alternative areas free practice left thumb upright stoffel vandoorne pictured in 2017 set fastest lap time in restructured practice session two practice sessions both on saturday morning were scheduled to be held before late afternoon race first session was scheduled to run for 45 minutes and second was due to last half an hour torrential rain fell in riyadh overnight and returned when first practice session was about to begin thus fia delayed and then later cancelled first practice 20 minutes after its commencement because conditions did not improve and track marshals had too much standing water to clear and pump away particular water drainage problems emerged at turns eight ten eleven and seventeen due to temporary erection of barriers which created a lack of drainage and caused rivers to collate across circuit due to natural undulations in those areas to compensate for loss of on track driving fia planned for second practice session to last for an hour from 08 35 to 09 35 arabia standard time utc 03 00 rather than scheduled half an hour to provide drivers with an opportunity for track familiarisation before qualifying however heavy rain continued to fall and fia delayed second practice before it was cancelled 25 minutes after its planned start because clearing of deep standing water areas with course vehicles capable of pumping water failed to improve track conditions bird accompanied fia race director scot elkins in a course car for a reconnaissance lap and a track inspection when two returned to pit lane several drivers including vergne lucas di grassi of audi and buemi congregated to discuss situation and its impact on race vergne proposed a hybrid practice session where competitors would simultaneously set lap times with maximum amount of available power reduced from to determine starting order other drivers supported vergne s proposal because of a lack of preparation in changeable conditions it was also suggested jaguar i pace etrophy cars circulate track to dry it because of sport utility vehicle s increased ride height compared to formula e machinery a 35 minute practice period was followed shortly after by a two group qualifying session majority of competitors remained in garage bar vergne who ventured outside to observe weather conditions drivers then spent five minutes three laps at reduced speed behind safety car to gather knowledge on how spark srt05e handled on a saturated circuit before green flag conditions frijns set a benchmark lap before a 17 minute red flag was necessitated as a brake by wire problem sent mortara into turn one tecpro energy absorbing barrier session resumed with ten minutes to go and lap times lowered vergne bird rowland and evans all led until vandoorne set overall fastest lap of 1 minute and 18 868 seconds followed by bird buemi rowland evans vergne sims felix da costa gunther and audi s daniel abt with more than a minute left rosenqvist made an error and hit turn one wall at low speed with damage to his car s nose cone massa drove straight to avoid hitting him one of rosenqvist s wheel arches detached on main straight linking turns 17 and 18 on way back to pit lane qualifying thumb right upright jose maria lopez pictured in 2014 started on front row of grid after application of penalties saturday morning s half an hour qualifying session was divided into two groups of eleven cars rather than customary four of either five or six each group was permitted 15 minutes of on track activity and all drivers were limited to a single timed lap at starting order was determined by combined fastest overall lap times from both groups driver and team who recorded pole position lap time were awarded three points towards their respective championships felix da costa took first pole position of his career with a 1 minute and 17 728 seconds lap dillmann was first driver to circulate track he spent first ten minutes recording multiple lap times at of power and set second fastest time he was investigated for completing more qualifying laps than permitted due to amended schedule confusing his team dragon s jose maria lopez was second driver to record a lap time with five minutes left of group one he could not better dillmann s effort and was in provisional third buemi took fourth and highest placed rookie vandoorne was sole driver in group two to qualify in top ten in fifth bird was sixth vergne complained of car problems and recorded seventh quickest lap frijns d ambrosio and lotterer completed top ten provisional qualifiers with lotterer one and a half seconds slower than felix da costa di grassi was fastest driver not to set a top ten qualifying time his best lap of 1 minute and 19 527 seconds was almost 1 8 seconds off felix da costa s pace he described his car as undriveable evans was faster of two jaguars in 12th 13th placed rowland was an early second group pace setter but he made minor contact with turn one barrier during his maximum power lap and oliver turvey of nio was 14th quickest paffett set 15th fastest lap time because of a driver error on his best lap following him on provisional starting grid were mortara sims abt massa and nelson piquet jr in second jaguar 21st place qualifier gunther scraped a barrier lining track with left front of his car and qualifying was stopped with four minutes left in second group after he parked at turn seven and had to be extricated by a recovery vehicle rosenqvist was slowest overall because he lost control of his car and made contact with outside barrier at edge of turn 21 at high speed with rosenqvist stranded a track marshal created confusion by waving a red flag race control did not officially deploy it post qualifying following deliberation in pre race driver meeting attack mode activation zone was moved closer to start line and painted white lines indicating zone s beginning and exit points were enlargened for improved visibility seven drivers received grid penalties dillmann had all of his qualifying laps invalidated for exceeding maximum amount of permitted laps and his car lacked a data logger sensor his teammate turvey also had all of his timed laps cancelled for having no data logger sensor two virgin teammates of frijns and bird di grassi and rowland had all of their fastest qualifying times deleted for exceeding due to a power overshoot from hitting a trackside bump mortara was issued a three place grid penalty because venturi had transgressed formula e s 2018 19 season battery software implementation guide hence grid lined up after penalties as felix da costa lopez buemi vandoorne vergne d ambrosio lotterer evans paffett sims abt massa mortara rowland piquet gunther rosenqvist di grassi bird frijns turvey and dillmann race race began before a crowd of about 23 000 people at 15 05 local time weather conditions at start were dry and clear with track slippery and damp but drying air temperature was between and track temperature ranged from forecasts indicated a 20 percent chance of rain each driver was mandated to use attack mode twice and were permitted to arm system no more than five times a special feature of formula e is fan boost feature an additional power to use during race s second half five drivers who were allowed to use boost were determined by a fan vote for ad diriyah eprix felix da costa vandoorne massa abt and di grassi were handed extra power before lights went on for start felix da costa overshot his starting slot because he looked away from pole position he reversed to ensure he was in correct position he was skewed at an angle towards left hand side barrier and risked locking his rear tires nevertheless felix da costa held lead on approach to first turn as lopez made a poor start and buemi overtook him vandoorne was passed by vergne for fourth as rowland appeared to jump start but he was not investigated while majority of field avoided a first lap incident mortara locked his brakes and crashed straight into turn one right hand side tecpro energy absorbing barrier he reversed to complete almost an entire lap and entered pit lane for a replacement front wing this created confusion with track marshals at turn who felt a full course fellow flag was necessary to recover mortara s car they later discovered procedure was not officially activated as mortara had left area it came as lotterer steered right to pass d ambrosio for sixth entering turn 18 d ambrosio made contact with rear of lotterer s car with minimal damage to it that prompted massa to pass paffett and abt on their right on entry to final turn to move into tenth further back abt overtook paffett for 11th and gunther was passed by virgin duo of bird and frijns and fell to 17th piquet got ahead of paffett for 13th on straight entering turn 18 on lap two as vandoorne fell to seventh when lotterer and d ambrosio overtook him left thumb upright jean eric vergne pictured in 2016 lost his chance of victory after incurring a drive through penalty for overusing electrical power on lap three vergne pressured lopez for third he tried to pass him into turn 18 but lopez turned right to block him he did succeed on next lap and lotterer also got ahead of lopez to move into fourth soon after both techeetahs battled for third as felix da costa opened up a two second advantage over buemi it concluded when lotterer ran wide on left through turn 17 on sixth lap he then held off lopez on his right entering next corner doing this meant lopez fell into d ambrosio s clutches who was not close enough to affect a pass in meantime turvey and his teammate dillmann used attack mode in an attempt to advance through field with 34 minutes to go on his eighth lap rosenqvist retired with a rear transmission failure during following lap buemi was out braked by vergne on outside at turn 18 for second a driving error from paffett put him off racing line between turns eight and nine and he collided with a barrier and retired on lap ten on lap 11 massa got past vandoorne on right and moved to ninth as vergne began to draw closer to felix da costa lotterer turned left to pass buemi for third at turn 18 on next lap vergne moved to within passing distance of felix da costa on 13th lap he almost took lead when latter ran wide at turn 17 and waited for another lap two ran close by each other through lap 14 until vergne made a pass on defensive felix da costa on his left at turn 18 for lead on lap 17 abt used attack mode to try a pass on rowland but latter kept tenth by driving into corner s run off area buemi held off lopez s attack on following lap on left for fourth entering turn 18 and he then stopped d ambrosio from passing that prompted lopez to be more aggressive on left at same turn on lap 19 and passed buemi that time round buemi ran wide leaving next corner and allowed d ambrosio to pass him for fifth lotterer used attack mode to get ahead of felix da costa on straight linking final and first turns to advance into second at start of 22nd lap at this point it appeared techeetah would finish 1 2 until vergne and his teammate lotterer incurred drive through penalties for exceeding maximum amount power permitted during electrical energy harvesting because of a software problem that used more electrical energy beyond level defined in fia suppliers implementation guide a transgression of article 27 9 of formula e s sporting regulations this eroded vergne s 2 7 second lead and he fell to fifth and lotterer dropped to seventh and lost 20 seconds of time hence felix da costa retook lead with lopez second and d ambrosio third massa and sims were also issued drive through penalties for same infraction as techeetahs on lap 24 lopez failed to earn extra amount of power because he missed attack zone and lost second to d ambrosio he tried again on next lap and again missed attack zone lopez fell to fifth behind buemi and vergne he damaged his rear suspension which left him fighting for control of his car until its rear left wishbone collapsed on a kerb lopez retired at exit to turn 14 thumb upright antonio felix da costa pictured in 2013 took second victory of his career and his first since 2015 buenos aires eprix elkins deployed a brief full course yellow flag and later safety car to allow lopez s car to be extricated by a recovery vehicle he had considered using a system to dictate field to close up to leader felix da costa immediately activated his first attack mode as safety car circulated track for three laps five minutes shortly before racing continued for four laps after safety car s withdrawal nine drivers including felix da costa and vergne strategically used attack mode for a second time disruption to proceedings allowed all to drive at full speed until end some opined there was no electrical energy limitations in all circumstances felix da costa led d ambrosio and vergne at lap 30 restart that lap vergne passed d ambrosio on main straight to move into second buemi had less usable electrical energy and lost sixth to evans and lotterer on laps 30 and 31 on 32nd lap felix da costa used his fanboost to increase his lead over vergne during lap piquet ran into left hand quarter of di grassi s car as former got ahead of him for ninth on approach to turn 18 lotterer earned one championship point for setting fastest lap on lap 32 a 1 minute and 12 591 seconds felix da costa led vergne by 1 507 seconds at start of final lap as latter closed up to provide himself with an opportunity for a last lap pass although felix da costa achieved a good exit out of turn 17 it did not dissuade vergne from an unsuccessful out braking manoeuvre that saw him lock his brakes thus felix da costa held lead for final three corners to claim his second career victory his first since 2015 buenos aires eprix and bmw s maiden formula e win by 0 462 seconds over vergne d ambrosio finished third despite nursing diffuser damage from his earlier contact with lotterer evans took fourth lotterer fifth and of buemi and rowland were sixth and seventh audi duo of abt and di grassi took eighth and ninth and piquet completed top ten last of classified finishers were virgin duo of bird and frijns nio teammates turvey and dillmann gunther vandoorne massa who received two post race penalties for using his fanboost earlier than allowed and for using of energy rather than while on fanboost and incurred one e licence penalty point sims and mortara attrition rate was low with 19 of 22 starters finishing race post race top three drivers appeared on podium to collect their trophies and spoke to media in a later press conference felix da costa spoke of his happiness over his win and called it a perfect start to season when i crossed line i was happy obviously but i was just assimilating everything it was when i saw everyone s faces and felt all emotion from rest of guys that it all really came to me vergne said his second place result was a of what is to come from techeetah and aimed for more podium results and his first win of season i m confident that we will continue to deliver some very exciting racing for rest of championship we re going to absorb all lessons continue in this spirit and come back for more d ambrosio said of his third place finish i come also from two difficult years so it s great to start this new relationship with team in this way we ve worked really hard over past few months to be ready and i think we were really fast and good in race pace i m really happy to be a part of such a great team there are loads of great people and a great atmosphere after retiring from a suspension failure lopez spoke of his belief he lost chance to finish on podium he hoped to maintain his pace at season s next race in marrakesh if we keep it we re going to be fighting next race so i really hope so i know that we re privateers outsiders but truth today is that we were competitive there were many positives today and we take more confidence now going in to marrakesh evans had mixed feelings over coming fourth he said he had a considered approach which enabled him to compete in top five with drivers such as buemi d ambrosio and lopez it was a strong race and a good one especially after bad luck in a bucket load of points is a good start and we ll take that at this early stage but to be so close to podium is a little bittersweet buemi stated that he was disappointed with his sixth place result because of a lack of speed after running in second early on i could not fight techeetahs i just did best i could to lose least amount of time but i was not in their league to be honest thumb upright left daniel abt pictured in 2015 argued that attack mode concept should have its power increased to allow for more effective overtaking media reception to race was mixed writing for guardian richard williams said race demonstrated formula e did not need to follow formula one s example of heavy imposition of penalties as it tried to showcase it was different from internal combustion motor racing he also complimented driving on circuit although it was an entertaining spectacle rules farrago towards end was last thing formula needs journalist maurice hamilton of espn wrote eprix reminded him of hans christian andersen s emperor s new clothes in that it had a similar impression of delusion appeared to infiltrate enthusiastic media and tv summaries referring to a brilliant race and that it did little to arouse deep emotion because circuit appeared to him as weaving through a building site thanks to impression of high screens blanking off construction work views on attack mode were mixed abt argued attack mode was like a lose mode because he lost a position activating it and proposed its power be increased to allow for a more effective pass on other drivers his teammate di grassi concurred and said he believed there were less strategic possibilities with it bird opined that system should lose drivers around six to eight seconds for better on track action a bit like joker lap in rallycross same sort of concept only you lose six eight seconds but you ve got more power for next three laps something like that would be cool evans said his belief system was effective but he wanted a good balance of losing and gaining time audi team principal allan mcnish considered attack mode to have offered up unpredictability that s never a bad thing because i do believe that overtaking is a skillset a driver needs to have and so therefore we saw some guys doing some pretty strong overtaking manoeuvres gunther said he felt it was a helpful system for passing and close racing because this was first race of season felix da costa led drivers championship with 28 points 25 for win and three points for earning pole position vergne was ten points behind him in second and d ambrosio was a further three points adrift in third evans was fourth with 12 points and lotterer rounded out top five with 11 points in teams championship techeetah became leader with 29 points
