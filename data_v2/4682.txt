of first roll of anthony roll depicting henry grace a dieu largest ship in english navy during reign of king henry viii anthony roll is a record of ships of english tudor navy of 1540s named after its creator anthony anthony it originally consisted of three rolls of vellum depicting 58 naval vessels along with information on their size crew armament and basic equipment rolls were presented to king henry viii in 1546 and were kept in royal library in 1680 king charles ii gave two of rolls to samuel pepys who had them cut up and bound as a single volume book which is now in pepys library at magdalene college cambridge third roll remained in royal collection until it was given by king william iv to his daughter lady mary fox who sold it to british museum in 1858 it is now owned by british library anthony roll is only known fully illustrated inventory of ships of english navy in tudor period as work of a successful state official in 16th century england artistic value of anthony roll has been described as being characterised by naive draughtsmanship and conformity to a pattern though its artistic aspects display a decent amateur grasp of form and colour while inventories listed in its text have proven to be highly accurate most of ship illustrations are rudimentary and made according to a set formula level of detail of ship design armament and especially rigging has therefore proven to be only approximate nevertheless through their depiction of ceremonial ornamentation illustrations in roll have provided relevant secondary information to study of tudor period heraldry flags and ship ornamentation only known contemporary depictions of prominent tudor era vessels like henry grace a dieu and mary rose are contained in anthony roll as mary rose sank by accident in 1545 and was successfully salvaged in 1982 comparison between information in roll and physical evidence of mary rose has provided new insights into study of naval history of period author and artist anthony anthony has been identified as compiler of information and artist behind illustrations through his signature which has been compared with holograph letters among state papers anthony s father was william anthony died 1535 a fleming from middelburg in zeeland who migrated to england in 1503 william was a supplier of beer to army and anthony followed in his father s footsteps he went into beer exporting no later than 1530 and became a supplier of beer to navy in 1533 anthony was appointed gunner at tower of london a position he retained nominally until his death he rose to rank of overseer of ordnance office government body responsible for supplying armed forces with artillery and it was in this position that he compiled his roll in 1549 he was promoted to master surveyor of ordnance in tower calais boulogne and elsewhere for life he continued work of supplying arms to english forces and was active in last month of his life supplying guns for an expedition against le havre in 1939 dutch historian nicholas beets proposed that flemish artist and cartographer cornelis or c 1507 1553 could have been anthony anthony s brother although beets suggestion of kinship was conjectural and without any direct evidence it was picked up by geoffrey callender in mariner s mirror in 1963 and has been relayed by several other authors will of william anthony did not mention any other sons and is believed to have been son of antonis daughter of jacob van that cornelis and anthony were related is in words of ann payne not presumably impossible but there is little evidence that they were connected at all history of manuscript alt a small fleet of large highly decorated carracks are riding on a wavy sea in foreground are two low fortified towers bristling with cannon and armed soldiers and retinue walking between them thumb right embarkation of henry viii at dover a contemporary painting that just like anthony roll was intended to serve as a showpiece of tudor royal authority and military might ship portrait had a long history in maritime art from medieval seals and coins to early engravings in 15th century and plain side on view of a ship under sail often with no crew shown was well established as most effective way of recording build of vessels anthony roll belongs to a genre of works that was intended to serve a dual role for king and military leadership as reasonably informative overviews listing details of ships or strategic areas of coastlines they could be studied to determine strengths and weaknesses and as boastful and lively depictions of tudor military might they could be used to flatter king impress courtiers and impose martial authority on foreign ambassadors contemporary maps or plats were routinely decorated with detailed pictures of ships to mark bodies of water as much as to liven up scenes such maps were common at time and were even embellished by artists if deemed too simple or drab navy was expanded during henry viii s reign and he was known to take an interest in warships as can be seen by epic painting embarkation of henry viii at dover which portrayed if rather unrealistically ships that took 29 year old king to summit meeting with francis i of france at field of cloth of gold in 1520 this painting recently dated to around 1545 has also been suggested as a likely source of inspiration to anthony for his illustrations there are three such plats depicting naval actions and expeditions that are attributed to anthony route of anne of cleves from low countries to england 1539 a french attack on a coastal fort date unknown and a french raid on brighton july 1545 design of ships in these paintings especially that of brighton raid closely match those in rolls it is not known exactly when work on rolls began nor when it was finished it is only certain that it was presented to king year it was dated 1546 inclusion of mary rose that sank at battle of solent 19 july 1545 does not mean it was necessarily started before this date since it was still considered possible that she could be raised even as late as 1549 galleasses antelope hart bull and tiger all present in second roll were still being built around march 1546 and hart was not at sea until october that year at same time galley blanchard captured from french 18 may 1546 is not included thumb upright left alt a copper engraving of a man with a composed expression wearing a large dark long haired wig samuel pepys in 1689 pepys owner of two of rolls had them cut up and bound in a single volume after rolls were presented to king they were archived in royal collections in 1680 charles ii gave two of rolls to samuel pepys a navy administrator and avid book collector pepys did not disclose details of how rolls were given to him but it is believed that gift came out of a meeting with king charles where pepys took down king s account of how he escaped from battle of worcester 1651 plan was that pepys would edit and publish already famous story but he never did so it is also known that pepys was planning to write a history of navy and that he was gathering material for this task but this project also was never finished it is considered likely that king charles was aware of pepys plans and presented him with two of rolls either as a gift or as payment for intended publication of escape story second roll could not be located at that time and it was not until 1690 that it was discovered by henry thynne keeper of royal library 1677 89 and a close friend of pepys thynne arranged for pepys to make copies of some of illustrations but by 1690 charles was dead and james ii was in exile pepys had resigned from his position as secretary of admiralty that same year and refused to recognize reign of william iii and mary ii which meant that acquisition of final roll for his collection was out of question creation of codex from first and third rolls is therefore assumed to have been completed shortly after that time after pepys death in 1703 his library passed on to his nephew john jackson after death of jackson in 1724 library along with codex was then passed on to pepys old college at magdalene cambridge where it remains to this day second roll was presumed lost by 1780s but actually remained in hands of royal family william iv gave it to his illegitimate daughter mary fitzclarance sometime in early 19th century in 1824 fitzclarance married charles robert fox a major general and from 1832 35 an officer of surveyor of ordnance same position anthony anthony had three centuries before him fox was a bibliophile and historian charles knighton has suggested he knew value of roll but its location nevertheless remained unknown to scholars in 1857 frederic madden keeper of manuscripts at british museum was shown second roll and learned that mary fox wished to sell it after negotiations it was sold for ps15 to british museum and was numbered additional ms 22047 anthony roll at british library it was kept in its original format as a roll and has been stored in british library s manuscript collection at st pancras since 1999 anthony roll has been used frequently as a primary source for histories of english navy of 16th century but full text and all illustrations were not collected in one volume until 2000 description thumb right alt a worn parchment document with several columns of text above a picture of a small sailing vessel a view of second roll of anthony roll showing layout used throughout document information for each vessel is displayed in columns directly below its illustration here with text for grand mistress seen only partially above text and a full view of illustration of galleass anne gallant anthony roll was originally a set of three separate vellum rolls it exists today in form of a bound volume containing first and third rolls while second roll is preserved in its original form three original rolls were made up out of a total of 17 individual membranes glued to back of next membrane membranes were of a width of and a height varying from after receiving first and third rolls pepys had his clerks cut rolls up and bound in a single volume as a book now known as pepys 2991 transformation of two rolls created a horizontal page structure and some of ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into volume by hand pepys also inserted abstracts between two rolls and a summarizing table that was not anthony s but pre dated pepys binding of rolls this radical treatment of original document has damaged some of illustrations and is today deprecated first three illustrations of henry grace a dieu mary rose and peter pomegranate were all too large to fit on one page and were therefore converted to two page spreads resulting bend down centre of illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail despite this there are no plans to attempt a recreation of original structure of first and third rolls second roll british library additional ms 22047 is still in its original condition with exception of a written endorsement by mary fox from 1857 and some damage caused by an application of chemicals to reveal faded writing three rolls list 58 ships divided into classes based roughly on size and construction each ship is presented along with its name tonnage crew size and in anthony s own words artillery munitions and for warre first roll lists carracks and one pinnace beginning with largest ship henry grace a dieu second roll lists galleasses a hybrid of oar powered and sailing vessels and one galley finally third roll is reserved for pinnaces and rowbarges both basically smaller versions of galleasses artistic analysis thumb left alt a colorful image of a one masted vessel propelled by a large group of rowers toward back of ship a man is holding a raised baton urging rowers on galley subtle a mediterranean type galley which formed centrepiece of three combined rolls and illustration that displays highest artistic quality anthony anthony was not a trained professional artist illustrations are described as striking and boldly executed but have few claims to be fine works of art vessels are for most part painted according to a standard formula with distinct repetitions even in more elaborate depictions anthony s style is signified by a naive draughtsmanship and conformity to a pattern consistent with abilities of a government official with a decent amateur grasp of form and colour rolls were all of roughly same length about and would most likely have been presented side by side for display on a table or hung on a wall focal point of whole composition is in second middle roll where exceptionally well executed painting of galley subtle is placed that this ship was intended to be centrepiece illustration is made clear by presence of pinnace mary james in first roll which is otherwise reserved for sailing ships this appears to have originally been placed at beginning of third roll among other pinnaces and rowbarges but was moved to achieve more equal lengths in his pursuit of living up to image of a renaissance prince henry is known to have been particularly fond of galleys something which would have been known to anthony lettering framing lines and floral pattern decorations are painted in red or black with exception of first three ships of first roll which also feature gold most of illustrations were first sketched with plummet outlines and were then painted over in washes ship timbers are a light brown that are shaded in bow and stern to achieve depth decorations and anchors are highlighted with red and green is used for guns contours are in black and sea is in shades varying from greyish green to a richer blue thumb right alt a small four masted sailing vessel with a small lizard like sculpture in its bow salamander a galleass captured from scots and one of only three ships in anthony roll which has an identifiable figurehead first two rolls were done with roughly same amount of detail while lesser rowbarges essentially small galleys were done more hastily first two ships of first roll henry grace a dieu and mary rose have traces of a grid pattern indicating that they were transferred from a different drawing while rest are done in freehand overall ships follow a formula depending on type of ship exceptions are stern galleries of some of galleasses and figureheads of mary rose salamander and unicorn latter both captured from scots in 1544 prominent exception is galley subtle placed in middle of second roll it is more consistent in type with mediterranean type galleys than galleasses and small rowbarges and features a considerable amount of detail not present in other ships it is only ship where any crew is visible in this case rowers behind as protection from enemy arrows and an overseer wearing a bonnet full skirted armorial doublet and baggy breeches holding a stick or baton as if beating time of strokes of rowers use as an historical source as an historical record anthony roll is in many ways unique it is only known fully illustrated list of a tudor period royal navy though pictures should not be seen as exact depictions drawn from real life for example lists of guns of individual ships which are considered to be an accurate record produced by a senior state official are only approximately matched to paintings rigging is only roughly accurate and has been described by margaret rule archaeological project leader of mary rose excavations as a confusing assemblage of shrouds ratlines and stays many details are present but others are missing such as chain wales horizontal platforms extending from sides to which shrouds parallel ropes that stabilized masts were attached to keep them clear of hull thumb right peter sister ship of mary rose comparisons with mary rose thumb right alt a sailing vessel similar in size to henry grace a dieu already described on top of forecastle in bow of ship is a small sculpture of a bright red flower illustration of mary rose which has been compared to salvaged wreck of actual ship to determine historical accuracy of anthony anthony s ship portrayals comparisons with finds from salvaged mary rose itself have provided an opportunity to compare accuracy of records provided in roll picture of ship has provided clues about basic structural features such as number of masts and sails when compared with an inventory of ship from 1514 there is a close match proving illustration to be largely accurate examination of details in construction however reveals that anthony allowed himself some artistic licence armament in painted ship appears clearly exaggerated heavy stern chasers cannon placed in stern aimed backwards mounted through gun ports on orlop deck just about waterline would not have been feasible because of lack of an orlop deck and steep angle sheer of ship in this area number of gunports in broadside is inaccurate since it implies two slightly staggered rows of nine ports while surviving starboard side of mary rose has only one row of gunports on main deck with seven ports accuracy of forecastle has been more difficult to ascertain since none of it remains conflicting interpretations of what it looked like have been suggested guns in back of forecastle have defied explanation but one theory is that they were included to compensate for guns that were positioned in aftcastle aiming forwards but which would have been obscured due to angle from which ship was depicted list of ammunition small firearms longbows arrows pikes and bills closely matches archaeological evidence as source that is closest in time to sinking of mary rose it has been of central importance for archaeological project especially in estimating size of crew flags and ornamentation thumb right alt a sailing vessel with square flags along its railing designs include horizontal green and white stripes cross of saint george three fleurs de lys on a blue background and blue red and gold english royal arms carrack pansy with various types of heraldic banners along its railings anthony roll provides detailed information about flags used on ships according to vexillologist timothy wilson flags depicted flying from ships are most elaborate source we have for flags flown on ships of king henry viii being richer in visual detail than all other sources put together among most striking flags in illustrations are elongated ceremonial streamers shown flying from all ships in varying numbers these feature a saint george red cross on white ground on hoist nearest flagpole and a very long tail striped in green and white they all feature gold paint on red and green and silver paint now oxidized to black on white this artistic device was used either to simulate fluttering of flags or to actually display metallic thread and paint that was sometimes used to decorate them along railing of all ships most prominently on large carracks and galley subtle there are rows of banners displaying various heraldic designs including english royal arms one or three fleur de lis of french arms saint george s crosses and henry viii s monogram hr in gold on blue what appears to be tudor rose and green and white of house of tudor depictions of flags and banners on ships are in a heraldic and military sense considered to be roughly accurate but not entirely consistent a kind of system of command among various vessels is apparent in how flags are displayed on masts but it does not appear to have been carried through systematically some of heraldic designs have been described as unlikely by 20th century herald george bellew but have deemed to at least be plausible by wilson notes references further reading external links article on
