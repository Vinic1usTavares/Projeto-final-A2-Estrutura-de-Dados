let audio engineer markus dravs into her home studio to start creating new songs bjork wanted to create an album with a simple sound and only one flavour album began with working title of homogeneous

2003 p 120 one of first songs created during sessions was 5 years which dravs created fast beat for progress of homogenic in these sessions was halted due to a media sensation caused by suicide of

song titled so broken which she sang to herself in her kitchen song was later included on japanese import of album malaga sessions to record in privacy away from sudden unwanted media interest bjork s

bell howie b had worked with bjork on debut and post and sigsworth had played harpsichord on post american hip hop group wu tang clan almost contributed to production of homogenic but were unable due

including songs pluto alarm call and bassline in joga bjork stated that she trusts and respects what bell does for me if i were to say who has influenced me most it would be stockhausen kraftwerk

string octet by june 1997 album was behind schedule and bjork was uncertain of final track listing and unhappy with some of recorded vocals composition homogenic is an electronica trip hop art pop and experimental album before production began on homogenic bjork wanted to create an album with a simple sound and only one flavour heather phares of allmusic described sound of homogenic as a fusion of chilly strings courtesy of icelandic string octet stuttering abstract beats and unique touches like accordion and glass harmonica album differs from her previous two releases stylistically and neva chonin of rolling stone stated album was certain to be rough going for fans looking for sweet melodies and peppy dance collages of her earlier releases as with other bjork releases it has been difficult for critics to classify homogenic within a musical genre tiny mix tapes considered that bjork has managed to create something so refreshingly unique that trying to categorize and label music is rather dubious writing for beats per minute cole felt homogenic represented a pinnacle work of trip hop forming part of a sort of holy trinity of this musical aesthetic along with massive attack s mezzanine and portishead s dummy bjork wanted homogenic to have a conceptual focus on her native iceland producer markus dravs recalled bjork wanting it to sound like rough volcanoes with soft moss growing all over it in an interview for oor bjork explained that in iceland everything revolves around nature 24 hours a day earthquakes snowstorms rain ice volcanic eruptions geysers very elementary and uncontrollable but at other hand iceland is incredibly modern everything is hi tech number of people owning a computer is as high as nowhere else in world that contradiction is also on homogenic electronic beats are rhythm heartbeat violins create old fashioned atmosphere colouring bjork s vocals on homogenic range from primitive sounding screams to a traditional singing method used by icelandic choir men a combination of speaking and singing as illustrated in song unravel 2003 p 2003 p 194 majority of songs on homogenic have lyrics about love and failed relationships song joga was written as a tribute to her best friend and tour masseuse of same name bjork called all is full of love a song about believing in love and that love isn t just about two persons it s everywhere around you pytlik 2003 p 170 all neon like contains snippets of a poem bjork wrote called techno prayer in 1996 song 5 years appeared in live form a few weeks after her breakup with musician tricky and music
