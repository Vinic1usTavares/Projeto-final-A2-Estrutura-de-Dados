planned state highway system in north carolina however nc 54 was not officially marked on any state highway maps until 1924 it was routed from nc 75 in pittsboro southeast to nc 50 in moncure connecting town to us 1 by 1929 first nc 54 was decommissioned and was redesignated as a secondary road at same time nc 54 was signed along a new routing beginning at us 70 nc 10 in graham and running along its current routing to us 70 nc 10 in nelson in 1930 route was extended north to virginia nc 54 was placed onto a concurrency with nc 100 to burlington where it then followed a new routing through to nc 703 near thompsonville road followed along a brief concurrency with nc 703 to west into thompsonville where it then was extended back onto a new routing north to it then replaced nc 709 north to virginia border by 1940 routing of nc 54 north of graham was replaced by nc 87 route was then extended along a section of nc 93 to connect with us 70 on western side of burlington nc 54 was extended along us 70a between 1952 and 1953 and then placed onto chapel hill road to cary where it ended at us 1 by 1955 nc 54 was placed from its routing through downtown chapel hill along its current bypass around carrboro and chapel hill previous routing was signed as nc 54a and by 1959 became nc 54 business before being decommissioned in 1985 route was extended along hillsborough street by 1963 to us 1 which later became interstate 440 between 2000 and 2002 nc 54 was routed onto northern loop of maynard street around cary future currently town of morrisville is building an extension to mccrimmon parkway along eastern side of nc 54 and center of town road which is scheduled to be completed between 2018 and 2021 would serve as a bypass nc 54 which is mostly two lanes through town however there has been no official word from north carolina department of transportation ncdot if highway will be routed onto mccrimmon parkway in october 2015 towns of cary and morrisville held a joint meeting over future of nc 54 between towns nc 54 currently has 16 000 to 20 000 vehicles using road each day by 2040 towns project that nearly 45 000 vehicles will be using road daily ncdot capital area metropolitan planning organization and town of morrisville teamed up on study of corridor from nc 540 to maynard road ideally road would become a four to six lane superstreet from durham county line southeast into cary besides study ncdot has yet to allocate money to make improvements to nc 54 major intersections related route north carolina highway 54 alternate nc 54a was a
