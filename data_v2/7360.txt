1410 medieval household was like modern households center of family life for all classes of european society yet in contrast to household of today it consisted of many more individuals than nuclear family from household of king to peasant dwelling more or less distant relatives and varying numbers of servants and dependents would cohabit with master of house and his immediate family structure of medieval household was largely dissolved by advent of privacy in early modern europe variations were immense over an entire continent and a time span of about 1000 years yet it is still possible to speak of a classical model of medieval household particularly as it evolved in carolingian france and from there spread over great parts of europe aristocratic households historical background neither greek nor latin had a word corresponding to modern day family latin familia must be translated to household rather than family herlihy p 2 aristocratic household of ancient rome was similar to that of medieval europe in that it consisted in addition to paterfamilias his wife and children of a number of clients or dependents of lord who would attend upon him counsel him and receive rewards where it differed from its medieval equivalent was in use of slaves rather than paid servants for performance of menial tasks another difference was that due to relative security and peacefulness within borders of roman empire there was little need for fortification aristocratic household of medieval europe on other hand was as much a military as a socio economic unit and from 9th century onwards ideal residence was castle morris p 14 composition as a result of military nature of medieval noble household its composition was predominately male towards end of medieval period ratio levelled out somewhat but at an earlier date feminine element of household consisted only of lady and her daughters their attendants and perhaps a few domestics to perform particular tasks such as washing woolgar pp 34 6 many of male servants were purely military personnel there would be a gatekeeper as well as various numbers of knights and esquires to garrison castle as a military unit woolgar pp 103 4 yet many of these would also serve other functions and there would be servants entirely devoted to domestic tasks at lower level these were simply local men recruited from localities higher level positions in particular those attending on lord were often filled by men of rank sons of lord s relatives or his retainers woolgar pp 36 7 presence of servants of noble birth imposed a social hierarchy on household that went parallel to hierarchy dictated by function woolgar p 18 9 this second hierarchy had at its top steward alternatively seneschal or majordomo who had overriding responsibility for domestic affairs of household woolgar p 17 taking care of personal wellbeing of lord and his family were chamberlain who was responsible for chamber or private living quarters and master of wardrobe who had main responsibility for clothing and other domestic items of roughly equal authority as steward was marshal this officer had militarily vital responsibility for stables and horses of household marshalsea and was also in charge of discipline woolgar pp 42 3 marshal and other higher ranking servants would have assistants helping them perform their tasks these called valets de chambre grooms or pages ranking from top to bottom in that order were most often young boys woolgar pp 31 2 although in larger royal courts valet de chambres included both young noble courtiers and often artists musicians and other specialists who might be of international repute assigning these office of valet was a way of their position within household one of most important functions of medieval household was procuration storage and preparation of food this consisted both in feeding occupants of residence on a daily basis and in preparing larger feasts for guests to maintain status of lord kitchen was divided into a pantry for bread cheese and napery and a buttery for wine ale and beer these offices were headed by a and a butler respectively depending on size and wealth of household these offices would then be subdivided further following is a list of some of offices one could expect to find in a large medieval aristocratic or royal household household offices duncan

press p 249 woolgar pp 17 8 111 144 168 et passim administration food and drink main food and drink secondary steward marshalsea chamber pantry cellar poultry larder scalding house laundry napery in addition to these offices there was a need for servants to take care of hunting animals master huntsman or held a central position in greater noble households cummins pp 175 7 likewise master falconer was a high ranking officer often of noble birth himself cummins pp 217 8 there were spiritual needs to be cared for and a chapel was a natural part of every large household these household chapels would be staffed by varying numbers of clerics chaplains confessors and almoners could serve in administrative capacities as well as religious ones woolgar 176 7 noble households households of medieval kings were in many ways simply aristocratic households on a larger scale as burgundian court chronicler georges observed of splendidly ordered court of dukes of burgundy after deeds and exploits of war which are claims to glory household is first thing that strikes eye and which it is therefore most necessary to conduct and arrange well quoted in johan waning of middle ages 1924 31 in some ways though they were essentially different one major difference was way in which royal household officials were largely responsible for governance of realm as well as administration of household reuter p 122 11th century capetian kings of france for instance ruled through royal officers who were in many respects indistinguishable from their household officers these officers primarily seneschal constable butler chamberlain and chancellor would naturally gain extensive powers and could exploit this power for social advancement one example of this is carolingians of france who rose from position of royal stewards mayors of palace to become kings in their own right cantor p 167 it was father of charlemagne pepin short who gained control of government from enfeebled merovingian king childeric iii another example can be found in royal house of stuart in scotland whose family name bore witness to their background of service allmand p 517 eventually central positions of royal household became little else than honorary titles bestowed upon greatest families and not necessarily even dependent on attendance at court in flanders by thirteenth century offices of constable butler steward and chamberlain had become hereditary right of certain high noble families and held no political significance finally royal household differed from most noble households in size of their military element if a king was able to muster a substantial force of household knights this would reduce his dependence on military service of his subjects this was case with richard ii of england whose one sided dependence on his household knights mostly recruited from county of cheshire made him unpopular with his nobility and eventually contributed to his downfall in england semi royal household of edward of carnarvon later edward ii when prince of wales is earliest for which detailed knowledge can be obtained from sources according to may mckisack fourteenth century oxford history of england 1 note references itineration medieval aristocratic household was not fixed to one location but could be more or less permanently on move greater nobles would have estates scattered over large geographical areas and to maintain proper control of all their possessions it was important to physically inspect localities on a regular basis as master of horses travel was responsibility of marshal everything in noble household was designed for travel so that lord could enjoy same luxury wherever he went woolgar p 181 particularly for kings itineration was a vital part of governance and in many cases kings would rely on hospitality of their subjects for maintenance while on road this could be a costly affair for localities visited there was not only large royal household to cater for but also entire royal administration it was only towards end of medieval period when means of communication improved that households both noble and royal became more permanently attached to one residence woolgar p 197 regional variations thumb 300px ruins of byzantine palace of porphyrogenitus in istanbul aristocratic society centered on castle originated as much of medieval culture in general in carolingian france and from there spread over most of western europe in other parts of europe situation was different on northern and western fringes of continent society was kin based rather than feudal and households were organised correspondingly in ireland basis for social organisation was sept a clan that could comprise as many as 250 households or 1250 individuals all somehow related herlihy pp 32 4 in viking age scandinavia housing arrangements were more humble than those of contemporary france or england but also here greater lords would own grand halls wherein they might entertain large numbers of guests in byzantine empire slaves were employed until end of empire as were eunuchs hussey p 132 little is known of living arrangements of byzantines as very few buildings remain from historical and architectural evidence it is known that even though castles were rare wealthy lived in palaces of varying magnitude with chapels and gardens and rich decorations of mosaics and frescoes hussey p 137 common households rural households of medieval peasant families were naturally smaller than those of aristocracy and as such resembled modern households more patterns of marriage fluctuated greatly over course of middle ages even though most of available evidence concerns higher classes and source material for southern europe is richer than for rest it is still possible to make some rough generalisations herlihy p 79 it seems clear that average age of marriage during early middle ages was comparatively high in early twenties and quite equal for men and women reason for this can be found in traditions brought forward from germanic tribes but equally in fact that habitation was confined to small areas a factor that enforced restrictions on population growth herlihy pp 77 8 barbara 1988 ties that bound peasant families in medieval england oxford university press pp 95 bruce wilson 2009 family life in age of shakespeare greenwood press pp 21 as more land was won for cultivation this trend changed during high and late middle ages women were increasingly married away in their teens leading to higher birth rates herlihy pp 103 7 while women would be married once they reached reproductive age men had to possess independent means of sustenance to be able to provide for a family before entering into marriage horrox ormrod pp 422 3 for this reason average age of marriage for men remained high in mid to late twenties herlihy pp 107 11 even though peasant households were significantly smaller than aristocratic ones wealthiest of these would also employ servants hollister p 169 service was a natural part of cycle of life and it was common for young people to spend some years away from home in service of another household horrox ormrod pp 420 1 this way they would learn skills needed later in life and at same time earn a wage this was particularly useful for girls who could put earnings towards their dowry herlihy p 153 houses of medieval peasants were of poor quality compared to modern houses floor was normally of earth and there was very little ventilation or sources of light in form of windows in addition to human inhabitants a number of livestock animals would also reside in house towards end of medieval period however conditions generally improved peasant houses became larger in size and it became more common to have two rooms and even a second floor urban medieval world was a much less urban society than either roman empire or modern world fall of roman empire had caused a catastrophic de population of towns and cities that had existed within empire between 10th and 12th centuries however a revival of european city occurred with an increase in urbanisation of society practice of sending children away to act as servants was even more common in towns than in countryside inhabitants of towns largely made their livelihood as merchants or artisans and this activity was strictly controlled by guilds members of these guilds would in turn employ young people primarily boys as apprentices to learn craft and later take a position as guild members themselves these apprentices made up part of household or family as much as children of master hollister pp 179 80 later perspectives thumb 300px thomas more with his immediate family painted by holbein presenting an ideal image of early modern family man towards end of middle ages functions and composition of households started to change this was due primarily to two factors first of all introduction of gunpowder to field of warfare rendered castle a less effective defence and did away with military function of household result was a household more focused on comfort and luxury and with a significantly larger proportion of women woolgar pp 197 204 second factor that brought about change was early modern ascendancy of individual and focus on privacy already in later middle ages castles had begun to incorporate an increasing number of private chambers for use both of lord and of his servants woolgar p 61 once castle was discarded to benefit of palaces or stately homes this tendency was reinforced this did not mean an end to employment of domestic servants or even in all cases a reduction in household staff what it did mean however was a realignment whereby family in a genealogical sense became cornerstone of household see also royal household medieval cuisine medieval demography medieval fortification medieval gardening medieval hunting notes a chronicler einhard sardonically wrote pepin short father of charlemagne held office for some years under if that is word king childeric iii b it should be mentioned that many if not most of these apprentices never achieved guild membership for themselves but ended up spending their whole life as wage laborers p 31 c idea of invention of individual in renaissance italy is primarily associated with jacob in spite of later criticism this thesis is still highly influential pp 244 5
