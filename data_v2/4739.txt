american cream draft is only draft horse breed developed in united states that is still in existence a rare horse breed today it is recognized by its cream color known as gold champagne produced by action of champagne gene upon a chestnut base color and by its amber eyes also characteristic of gene only other color found in breed is chestnut like several other breeds of draft horses american cream is at risk for autosomal recessive genetic disease junctional epidermolysis bullosa breed was developed in iowa during early 20th century beginning with a cream colored mare named old granny great depression threatened breed s existence but several breeders worked to improve color and type of breed and in 1944 a breed registry was formed mechanization of farming in mid 20th century led to a decrease in breed s population and registry became inactive for several decades it was reactivated in 1982 and population numbers have slowly grown since then however population numbers are still considered critical by livestock conservancy and equus survival trust characteristics american creams have refined heads with flat facial profiles that are neither concave nor convex they have wide chests sloping shoulders and short strong backs their ribs are well sprung and they are short coupled with well muscled hindquarters and with strong well proportioned legs set well apart they are sure footed with strong hooves and their movement is free and easy according to enthusiasts breed has a calm willing temperament particularly suited for owners who are new to handling draft horses mares stand high and weigh while stallions and geldings stand and weigh or more ideal coat color for breed is a medium cream with pink skin amber eyes and a white mane and tail characteristic cream color of breed is produced by champagne gene recognized colors include light medium and dark cream with amber or hazel eyes a cream mare with dark skin and a light mane and tail may be accepted by registry as foundation stock while stallions must have pink skin and white manes and tails to be registered purebred american cream foals that are too dark to be accepted into main breed registry may be recorded into an appendix registry appendix will also accept half bred cream draft horses crossed with other draft bloodlines if they meet certain requirements and registry provides an upgrade system that uses appendix horses to strengthen genes increase breed numbers and allow more diversified bloodlines color genetics champagne gene produces diluted color and gold champagne body color light skin light eyes and ivory mane and tail associated with american cream draft are produced by action of champagne gene on a chestnut base coat in adult horse skin is pink with abundant dark freckles or mottling and eyes are hazel or amber eyes of champagne foals are blue at birth darkening as they age and a foal s skin is bright pink breed registry describes foals eyes as almost white which is consistent with nature of champagne blue foal eye which is than other types of blue eye thumb left skin freckling is slightly visible around muzzle of this resting horse champagne is a dominant trait based on a mutation in gene mapping of gene was announced in 2008 and american cream draft cross was among breeds studied authors of this study noted that it was difficult to distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous animals thus distinguishing champagne from incomplete dominant such as cream gene however they noted that may have less mottling or a slightly lighter hair color than heterozygotes anecdotal reports also note mild differences including lighter freckling skin and hair coat though eye color remains same dark skinned american cream draft horses are actually chestnuts as breed is not homozygous for champagne gene only one allele is needed to produce proper color champagne dilutes any base coat color and in american cream draft underlying genetic base color is chestnut as of 2003 scientists have not found breed to carry cream gene even though breeders refer to desired color as cream american cream draft is never cremello or white and though gold coat color with a white mane and tail resembles palomino breed s defining characteristics are result of champagne gene junctional epidermolysis bullosa autosomal recessive genetic disease junctional epidermolysis bullosa jeb has been found in some american cream drafts this is a lethal genetic disorder that causes newborn foals to lose large areas of skin and have other abnormalities normally leading to euthanasia of animal it is most commonly associated with belgian horses but is also found in other draft breeds a dna test was developed in 2002 and jeb can be avoided as long as two carriers are not bred to one another american cream registry states that it has been pro active in testing its registered animals since jeb was discovered breed history thumb right head and shoulders of an american cream american cream is only breed of draft horse developed in united states that is still in existence today breed descends from a foundation mare named old granny she was probably foaled between 1900 and 1905 and was first noticed at an auction in story county iowa in 1911 and purchased by harry lakin a well known stock dealer she was eventually sold to nelson brothers farm in jewell iowa her breeding is not known but she was cream colored and many of her foals were as well they sold for above average prices because of their color her cream colored coat pink skin and amber eyes are defining standards for breed and color is now known as gold champagne in 1946 two years after breed registry was formed 98 percent of horses registered could be traced back to old granny in 1920 a colt of old granny s named nelson s buck no 2 impressed veterinarian eric christian to point that christian asked nelsons not to geld him they agreed to let him remain a stallion and he sired several cream colored foals though only one was registered a colt named yancy no 3 whose dam was a black mare of percheron breeding yancy sired knox 1st born in 1926 to an unregistered bay mare of mixed shire ancestry from this sire line in 1931 a great great grandson of nelson s buck was born named silver lace no 9 silver lace was to become one of most influential stallions of american cream breed his dam was a belgian mare with light chestnut coloring and she is credited with silver lace s size at he weighed considerably more than most of his bloodline silver lace quickly became a popular stallion in iowa however stallions standing for public stud service in iowa were required to be registered with iowa department of agriculture and this agency only allowed horses of recognized breeds as silver lace was not registered with any breed registry his owners created a breeding syndicate and mare owners who bought shares in silver lace horse company could breed their mares to him however his main breeding career coincided with economic struggles of great depression and silver lace was at one point hidden in a neighbor s barn to prevent his sale at auction another significant foundation stallion was ead s captain whose bloodlines appear in about one third of all american cream drafts around 1935 despite depression a few breeders started to and cream colored horses to fix their color and type in particular c t rierson began buying cream colored mares sired by silver lace and developing american cream breed in earnest in 1944 a breed association american cream association was formed by 20 owners and breeders and granted a corporate charter in state of iowa in 1950 breed was finally recognized by iowa department of agriculture based on a 1948 recommendation by national stallion enrollment board mechanization of farming in mid 20th century led to a decrease in overall draft horse population and with rierson s death in 1957 american cream draft numbers began to decline by late 1950s there were only 200 living american creams registered owned by only 41 breeders registry became inactive until 1982 when three families who had retained their herds reactivated and reorganized registry in 1994 organization officially changed its name to american cream draft horse association acdha 1990s to present in 1982 owners began blood typing their horses and by 1990 genetic testing found that compared with other draft breeds and based upon gene marker data creams form a distinct group within draft horses american cream draft was found to have a genetic relationship with belgian breed that was no closer than ones it had with percheron suffolk punch and breeds registry records dating to early 20th century show no bloodlines other than draft breeding as of 2000 there were 222 registered horses a number that increased to 350 as of 2004 of these 40 were tracking horses either purebred american creams that did not meet color requirements or crossbred horses that mix american cream and other draft blood but still meet physical requirements for registry these tracking horses are allowed by certain regulations to be used as breeding stock with resulting foals able to be registered as purebred american creams around 30 new horses are registered each year livestock conservancy considers breed to be at critical status meaning that estimated global population of breed is less than 2 000 and there are less than 200 registrations annually in us equus survival trust also considers population to be critical meaning that there are between 100 and 300 active adult breeding mares in existence today to help replenish numbers acdha has developed regulations to permit foals to be registered when produced via methods such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer careful use of appendix registry also allows numbers to increase american creams that live in colonial williamsburg have been called most famous of all american cream draft horses in village they are used for wagon and carriage rides and as of 2006 there is a breeding program run by colonial williamsburg that is working to increase breed numbers references external links american cream draft horse association
