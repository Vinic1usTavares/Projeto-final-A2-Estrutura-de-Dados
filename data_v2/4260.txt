thumb 300px england in late ninth century alt map of england in late ninth century aethelwold or aethelwald died 902 or 903 was younger of two known sons of aethelred i king of wessex from 865 to 871 aethelwold and his brother aethelhelm were still infants when their father king died while fighting a danish viking invasion throne passed to king s younger brother aethelwold s uncle alfred great who carried on war against vikings and won a crucial victory at battle of edington in 878 after alfred s death in 899 aethelwold disputed throne with alfred s son edward elder as senior aetheling prince of royal dynasty eligible for kingship aethelwold had a strong claim to throne he attempted to raise an army to support his claim but was unable to get sufficient support to meet edward in battle and fled to viking controlled northumbria where he was accepted as king in 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to essex where he was also accepted as king following year aethelwold persuaded east anglian danes to attack edward s territory in wessex and mercia edward retaliated with a raid on east anglia and when he withdrew men of kent lingered and met east anglian danes at battle of holme danes were victorious but suffered heavy losses including death of aethelwold which ended challenge to edward s rule background in eighth century mercia was most powerful kingdom in southern england but in early ninth wessex became dominant in 820s king egbert of wessex conquered south east england kent surrey sussex and essex his reign saw beginning of viking attacks but egbert and his son aethelwulf who succeeded in 839 were able to resist them aethelwulf died in 858 and he was followed by four sons in succession king aethelbald died in 860 and king aethelberht in 865 aethelwold s father aethelred then succeeded to throne in same year viking great heathen army invaded england within five years they had conquered northumbria and east anglia and forced mercia to buy them off in late 870 vikings invaded wessex and in early 871 they fought armies under aethelred and alfred in four battles in quick succession last two of which wessex lost aethelred died shortly after easter that year leaving young sons primogeniture was not established in this period and it was believed that kings should be adults so he was succeeded by his younger brother alfred by 878 vikings had seized eastern mercia and nearly conquered wessex and alfred was reduced to being a fugitive in somerset marshes but he fought back and won battle of edington this was followed by a period of peace and in late 880s alfred concluded a treaty with guthrum king of east anglian vikings setting boundary between wessex and english mercia on one hand and danelaw on other a further viking assault in mid 890s was unsuccessful early life very little is known of aethelwold s immediate family aethelred was born in about 848 and died in 871 so his sons must have been young children when he died aethelred s wife was probably wulfthryth who witnessed a charter in 868 aethelwold and his older brother aethelhelm are first recorded in king alfred s will in 880s aethelhelm is not heard of again and he probably died soon afterwards only other record of aethelwold before alfred s death is as a witness to a charter that probably dates to 890s thumb page from will of alfred great top part above i is end of preamble describing his councillors support against his nephews at langandene will itself starts below i alt page from will of alfred great after king aethelred s death in 871 his sons supporters complained about alfred keeping property that should have belonged to his nephews alfred justified his conduct in a preamble to his will which probably dates to 880s one of alfred s biographers richard abels describes text as rather tendentious and another alfred p smyth as ambiguous and vague and deliberately so patrick wormald views will as one of seminal documents of pre conquest history and like many such not easily understood dispute concerned property bequeathed in will of alfred s father aethelwulf this does not survive but alfred described some of its provisions in a preamble to his own will aethelwulf had left property jointly to three of his four surviving sons aethelbald aethelred and alfred stipulating that all of it was to be inherited by brother who lived longest when aethelred inherited throne in 865 alfred asked for property to be divided between them aethelred refused offering instead to leave it to alfred on his death together with any further property he acquired and alfred agreed viking invasion of wessex and need to provide for their children led to a revision of terms under an agreement in late 870 or early 871 survivor was still to keep property bequeathed jointly to three brothers but he would give his brother s children any lands which he had received separately from his father and any he had acquired later in preamble to his will alfred stated when we now heard many disputes about inheritance i brought king aethelwulf s will to our assembly at langandene and it was read before all councillors of west saxons when it had been read i urged them all for love of me and gave them my pledge that i would never bear a grudge against any one of them because they declared what was right that none of them would hesitate either for love or fear of me to expound common law lest any man should say that i had treated my young kinsmen wrongfully older or younger and then they all pronounced what was right and said that they could not conceive any title nor could they find one in will now everything has come into your possession and you may bequeath it or give it into hand of kinsman or stranger whichever you prefer historians have taken differing views of aethelwulf s will historians simon keynes and michael lapidge suggest that aethelwulf s other surviving son aethelberht was excluded from arrangement because he was provided for separately in eastern kingdom recently conquered south east england where he acted as king in 855 and 856 it was probably intended that he should establish a separate dynasty there bequest to three brothers would only have covered part of aethelwulf s property transmission of folkland was governed by customary law and another portion was reserved for holder of office of king keynes and lapidge argue that aethelwulf clearly intended that his personal property should be preserved intact and it seems to have been considered desirable that this should be held by reigning king so it is likely that he intended kingship of western wessex to be inherited by survivor of three brothers this plan was abandoned when aethelbald died in 860 and kingdom was reunited under aethelberht and aethelred s confirmation of arrangement when he acceded in 865 recognised alfred as heir apparent ann williams comments aethelred virtually his children in favour of alfred s in event of his own previous death at least in respect of lion s share of inheritance and therefore kingship this is in fact exactly what happened and aethelred s sons were not pleased at outcome in his life of alfred written in 893 asser states three times that alfred was aethelred s heir apparent an emphasis that in ryan lavelle s view reflects sensitivity on subject of alfred s succession smyth argues however that it is unlikely that aethelwulf intended to divide his kingdom or that kingship of wessex should be inherited by surviving brother joint property was probably provision for his youngest sons at a time when they appeared very unlikely to succeed to kingship with aethelbald included as a residual beneficiary in case both of them died young d p kirby argues that it cannot be assumed that disputed lands represented greater part of royal estates he believes that aethelwulf did intend to divide his kingdom but also that it is unlikely he intended surviving son to inherit kingship such an arrangement would have led to fratricidal strife with three older brothers alfred s chances of reaching adulthood would one feels have been minimal in his own will alfred left bulk of his property to edward while aethelhelm was left eight estates and aethelwold only three at godalming and guildford in surrey and steyning in sussex all in less important eastern part of kingdom largest of these was steyning aethelwulf s original burial place in patrick wormald s view alfred may have moved body to winchester because he was required to give estate to aethelwold under his agreement with aethelred and he did not want his nephew to have prestige of owning his grandfather s grave keynes and lapidge comment if only to judge from relatively small number of estates he received aethelwold in particular would have had cause to be aggrieved by this allocation of property and his resentment is shown by his rebellion against edward soon after alfred s death smyth argues that meeting of king s council witan was bound to support him alfred by c 885 in full control of wessex and at height of his power was clearly bent on trying to settle kingship on his son edward to exclusion of his brother aethelred s heirs that kingship was never in alfred s gift but clearly greater amount of landed wealth he could entail on edward stronger he made that son s position in any future contest for kingship we must therefore treat anything he tells us of terms of disputed inheritance of his rival nephews with utmost caution if not scepticism support which alfred tells us he received from witan counts for little as king alfred controlled immense patronage in relation to his thegns who stood to benefit from backing their lord against claims which his nephews made on his property it is significant that case ever came before witan at all that it did suggests that aethelhelm and aethelwold were by then young men who commanded some independent support and sympathy in wessex in abels view aethelred s sons attempted to shame alfred into handing over lands they claimed so as to strengthen their position in inevitable battle that would break out over succession when alfred died and langandene assembly was alfred s riposte alfred also assisted his own son by promoting men who could be relied on to support him and by giving him opportunities for command in battle once he was old enough in view of barbara yorke compilation of anglo saxon chronicle which magnified alfred s achievements may have been partly intended to strengthen case for succession of his own descendants however yorke also argues that aethelwold s position was not fatally undermined by alfred s will his mother had witnessed a charter as regina whereas alfred followed west saxon tradition in refusing to have his wife consecrated as queen and aethelwold s status as son of a queen may have given him an advantage over edward aethelwold was still senior aetheling and only surviving charter he witnessed shows both him and edward as filius regis son of a king but lists aethelwold above edward implying that he ranked above him aethelwold s revolt after alfred s death in 899 aethelwold made a bid for throne janet nelson comments that in eyes of many englishmen as well as scandinavians this aetheling had claims stronger than edward s own according to a version of anglo saxon chronicle aethelwold abducted a nun from her convent without permission of king edward and against command of bishop her identity is not known but it must have been intended to strengthen his claim and in view of historian pauline stafford chronicles account is biased in favour of edward and might have been intended to a politically important marriage aethelwold took her to royal manors of now christchurch and then wimborne minster symbolically important as his father s burial place and declared that he would live or die there lavelle sees wimborne as strategically significant close to roman roads to dorchester and salisbury and at a crossing point of rivers allen and stour it was southernmost point for control of access to western wessex and aethelwold may have intended a division of kingdom thumb 260px coin of alwaldus aethelwold however when edward s army approached and camped at badbury rings an iron age hill fort four miles west of wimborne aethelwold was unable to gain sufficient support to meet them in battle leaving behind his consort he fled to danes of northumbria who accepted him as king northumbrian coins were issued at this time in name of a king called alwaldus who is thought to have been aethelwold norse sagas record traditions of a danish king who briefly ruled northumbria around 900 he is said to have been at first repulsed by an english king called adalbrigt north of cleveland but then to have defeated him at scarborough in 1987 smyth suggested that adalbrigt could have been aethelwold but in 1995 smyth put forward alternative idea that northumbrian danes accepted aethelwold s claim to be king of west saxons rather than taking him as their own king aethelwold s reign in northumbria was short in david rollason s view because aethelwold saw it only as a base for gaining power in wessex in 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to essex where rollason states that he was accepted as king by local vikings however david dumville points out that in next year aethelwold persuaded danes in east anglia to wage war against edward and dumville argues that it is unlikely that there was an unknown separate viking army in essex in his view aethelwold was aiming to secure recognition in part of kingdom of wessex in order to strengthen his claim to throne and he succeeded in gaining submission of english rulers of essex east anglian danes joined aethelwold in a raid on mercia reaching as far as fortified burh at cricklade on border with wessex he then crossed thames into wessex itself to raid edward retaliated by ravaging danish east anglia but he withdrew without engaging aethelwold in battle men of kent lingered although according to anglo saxon chronicle edward sent seven messengers to recall them danes caught up with men of kent to fight battle of holme its location is unknown but may be holme in cambridgeshire danes were victorious but suffered heavy losses aethelwold was among leaders on danish side who were killed together with eohric viking king of east anglia two holds danish noblemen and and beorhtsige son of aetheling who was probably a kinsman of former king of mercia burgred kentish losses included their two ealdormen and sigehelm and an abbot cenwulf achievement of kentish contingent put edward s failure to engage danes with his whole army in a poor light in cyril hart s view undoubtedly there were recriminations which appear to have continued to threaten edward s authority for some considerable period especially in kent witness wessex chronicler s anxiety to find excuses for edward s failure to support kentish contingent edward was later to marry sigehelm s daughter eadgifu and hart thinks that this may have been designed to placate his kentish subjects various texts of anglo saxon chronicle give different versions of revolt hart states oldest and more authoritative is preserved in b text of anglo saxon chronicle supported in its essentials by latin east anglian chronicle official version in a text is clearly a late revision intended to justify king edward s position and to reinforce his authority b describes aethelwold as an aetheling indicating legitimacy of his claim for kingship a description omitted in a a says that he took possession of wimborne and without permission of king and his councillors b against their will b says that aethelwold rode away by night from wimborne a reads stole away according to b northumbrian danes accepted aethelwold as their king and gave allegiance to him but this is omitted in a however none of texts describe him as an aetheling after his flight to northumbria showing that his actions were no longer thought to have a claim to legitimacy in view of scott thompson smith dispute was over property as well as kingship and chronicle presents edward as successful protector of family property against outside interests legacy according to historian martin ryan what is striking about aethelwold s rebellion is level and range of support he was able to draw on he could call on allies from wessex northumbria east anglia and probably mercia and essex for a time aethelwold had a claim to be most powerful ruler in england edward s apparent reluctance to engage him in battle may have been well founded in view of james campbell bias in sources has led historians to see aethelwold s rebellion as a somewhat odd episode but he had a justifiable claim to kingship and he was nearly successful if he had not been killed at holme he might have united england with much less warfare than ultimately proved to be necessary had it not been for chances of battle and war aethelwold might very well have been regarded as one of greatest figures in our island s story lavelle argues that it is important to acknowledge audacity of aethelwold s actions and that he well deserves to be ranked amongst nearly men of early medieval europe twelfth century annals of st neots called him king of pagans it is not known whether he had any descendants but chronicler aethelweard was a great great grandson of king aethelred and this may have been through aethelwold shashi jayakumar suggests rivalry between king eadwig and his younger brother edgar in 950s dates back to conflict which resulted in battle of holme eadwig s wife aelfgifu was probably aethelweard s sister and one of eadwig s supporters byrhtnoth may have been descended from mercian royal family through aetheling whose son died fighting on aethelwold s side at holme opponents of eadwig included his grandmother eadgifu and eadwig confiscated her property in jayakumar s view emergence of aelfgifu descendant of aetheling aethelwold did not just threaten edgar s position it represented a revanche to a line and lineage with royal claims of its own ancestors of byrhtnoth and aethelweard had in all likelihood fought together with aethelwold on danish side at battle of holme opposite side to that which eadgifu s father sigehelm had fought for marriage between eadwig and aelfgifu was dissolved on grounds of consanguinity and edgar succeeded to throne when eadwig died without leaving children in view of nick higham aethelweard shows a lack of empathy for edward in his chronicle which higham attributes to edward s victory over aethelweard s ancestor aethelweard was ealdorman of western provinces in late tenth century showing that aethelred s descendants held on to land and power in century after his death aethelweard s grandson aethelnoth was an eleventh century archbishop of canterbury notes citations sources cited in british and irish archaeological bibliography category 9th
