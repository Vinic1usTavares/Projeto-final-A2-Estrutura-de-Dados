reception yes no received mixed reviews from critics robert canning of ign gave it a good rating of 7 out of 10 and noted hit and miss musical performances random quirky and funny bits and storytelling choices that kind of sort of work tvline michael slezak was more enthusiastic and said it was best episode of third season he credited both helen mirren and some righteous plot development that stays true to core characters jen chaney of washington post commented that glee had returned to its frequent habit of dropping plot twists on us that come out of nowhere and mtv s kevin p sullivan wrote that episode s promising bright spots couldn t escape from under weight of show s typical mistakes reviewers were unhappy with most of marriage storyline that involved will though they seemed satisfied with emma s portion of it emily vanderwerff of a v club said will acted like a jackass throughout and called storyline so pathetic and sad words echoed by entertainment weekly joseph brannigan lynch who wrote when schue told new directions you guys are my family i was a little sad for him and a lotta sad for his parents john kubicek of buddytv proclaimed will desperately needs to make some grown up friends a sentiment echoed by huffpost tv crystal bell lynch was critical of scene where will tells emma they cannot marry because of her illness he felt using phrase it s hopeless in reference to her mental disorder was too extreme to james poniewozik of time episode showed how series has squandered opportunity to make will into a person there was broad agreement regarding scene where will asks finn to be his best man not one reviewer approved lynch called it questionable and said it crossed a line of weirdness slezak and tv guide kate stanhope felt it was inappropriate if not unethical and bell said actual request was episode s biggest wtf moment will s statement that finn had taught him more about being a man was met with incredulity slezak declared finn has a lot of growing up to do before he s really a man and sullivan wrote that since finn acted like a petulant man boy on show will must have been referring to events in a season of glee that didn t air finn did receive some praise from lesley goldberg of hollywood reporter however she called sequence where he discovers truth about his father one of cory monteith s best scenes yet and slezak described it as beautifully handled by monteith finn s marriage proposal to rachel at end of episode was controversial reviewers thought it was a bad idea kubicek declared no one in high school should get engaged but poniewozik wrote that it made a lot of sense for finn as a character and vanderwerff said scene worked for him thumb left upright helen mirren pictured was acclaimed as mental voice of becky jackson s thoughts becky s storyline was acclaimed by most reviewers canning called it exceptional and most emotional and satisfying of episode poniewozik also praised it and wrote artie and becky s arc on other hand really worked it was sweet uncomfortable and messy in way that glee does well he continued it played out as it did not just because of artie and becky s condition but because of what they re like as people vanderwerff said story was handled with just right level of pathos and slezak praised writers for turning becky into a fully realized character while confronting head on dashed hopes and disappointments that can be a reality for a person with down syndrome sullivan wrote plot touched on a universal experience unrequited love from a very glee perspective treatment of handicapped people as people it ended on an appropriate down note and reaffirmed sue and becky s touching dynamic bell liked sue in this episode as she was helping plot which in turn made her one liners added treats rather than overdone cliches use of helen mirren to voice becky s thoughts was highly praised poniewozik called it kind of ridiculous but weirdly logical move i love from glee and lynch said it was one of most charming treats this show has offered in a while sullivan wrote that both actresses turned in great performances that elevated episode significantly not all reviewers agreed however futterman called mirren s vocal cameo bizarre and although kubicek thought mirren was pretty darn hilarious he said becky having a crush on artie story arc made him feel as uncomfortable as members of new directions and stated it s easy to say that everyone should just treat her like they treat everyone else but actually doing it is somewhat problematic cameo appearance of nene leakes as coach roz washington received plaudits from most reviewers poniewozik described her as pretty damn excellent and votta wrote she only has one generally pointless scene but is arguably best part of whole episode raymund flandez of wall street journal said leakes does well and bell stated she actually wasn t that bad kubicek however while he liked writing for character wrote that leakes was an embarrassingly terrible actress music and performances opening number of show received most disparate reviews from critics kubicek was one of most enthusiastic about summer nights and wrote this is kind of ridiculous over top hilariously cheesy stuff i want to see from glee all time he was also pleased that rory was given solo lines and sugar was being embraced as a part of group lynch thought that amber riley and chord overstreet harmonize surprisingly wonderfully and gave this easily most fun number of episode an a stanhope said that energy is infectious and you can feel sparks between former pair but performance was way too much of a copycat of original grease scene while flandez said that two leads lacked chemistry and that number was inexplicable vanderwerff was similarly unimpressed dumb and unnecessary chaney wrote that number was a high energy cute way for show to mark its comeback but said that rory sounded flat on one of his lines and sam couldn t quite hit ending high note in song and graded it a b wedding bell blues was described by bobby hankinson of houston chronicle as perfect combination of a great song plot relevance and princess beatrice hat stanhope agreed with him on all three points and added that it was a great pick for her vocals slezak described those vocals as a breath of dewy spring air and gave song an a but lynch thought emma was not much of a singer and gave number a b though he said curiosity of backup vocals from coach beiste and sue sylvester made this entirely worthwhile poniewozik characterized staging of song as phoned in first time i ever saw your face was given an a by lynch and an a by slezak latter called vocals pretty electrifying flandez said song was sublime and complimented lighting mood and direction by eric stoltz and vanderwerff described it as episode s best single number while futterman thought performers sang with controlled power she felt singing it dressed in black with tears rolling down was funereal rather than bridal and sullivan called it an odd song choice that was made worse by lea michele s cry singing chaney gave song her lowest grade of episode a c and characterized it as a flagrant eye watering fest thumb right upright artie kevin mchale pictured performed mash up of moves like jagger and jumpin jack flash and was said to outshine even mike and will who dance beside him flandez called propulsive mash up of moves like jagger and jumpin jack flash one of episode s highlights and billboard rae votta said it was impeccably choreographed by glee s often unsung hero zach woodlee she also lauded artie s jagger moves while sitting in a chair and said he outshines even mike and will who dance beside him sullivan described artie as consistently awesome and slezak said it was one of artie s more appealing musical moments this season and gave it a b lynch characterized song as a spunky diversion and gave it a b but he noted it was not a good song for marriage proposals by any stretch of imagination a point also made by rolling stone erica futterman who said number would have fared much better as a stand alone performance while chaney liked will and mike s moves she felt there was far too much quick cutting to shots of morrison in a tank top and gave song a b slezak and vanderwerff were also critical of these shots futterman was impressed that in without you glee crafted a cover to rival original and said it totally works slezak called it a vocally stunning reimagining and gave it an a both lynch and chaney gave it a b and latter wrote i can t deny that she sang heck out of it chaney was not so pleased with we found love to which she gave a c she wrote that it was part old esther williams movie part classic snl sketch with harry shearer and martin short and part music video for magic by cars in short it was kind of a train wreck however she and stanhope who said it was way too fast paced were in minority lynch called it sheer pleasure and gave it an a and slezak was even more enthusiastic with an a grade and described it as a sublimely ridiculously excessively terrific production number which he placed in show s all time top 10 vanderwerff praised nice sense of visual spectacle and hankinson called it really fantastic and something different futterman after she admitted to her unabashed love of song noted that show had found trifecta of a current song that both fits overall theme of show and characters singing it chart history five of six singles released from episode which included a total of
