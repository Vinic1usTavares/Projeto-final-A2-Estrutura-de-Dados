captured and bred in captivity and used as terroristic mccubbin 1999 p 277 and player eventually discovers that fungus and mindworms can think collectively a voice intrudes into player s dreams and soon waking moments threatening more attacks if industrial pollution and terraforming by colonists is not reversed mccubbin 1999 p 281 player discovers that planet is a dormant semi sentient hive organism that will soon experience a metamorphosis which will destroy all human life mccubbin 1999 p 282 to counter this threat player or a computer faction builds voice of alpha centauri secret project which artificially links planet s distributed nervous system into human datalinks delaying planet s metamorphosis into full self awareness but incidentally increasing its ultimate intelligence substantially by giving it access to all of humanity s accumulated knowledge mccubbin 1999 p 283 mccubbin 1999 p 284 mccubbin 1999 p 285 finally player or a computer faction embraces ascent to transcendence in which humans too join their brains with hive organism in its metamorphosis to godhood mccubbin 1999 p 287 thus alpha centauri closes with a swell of hope and wonder in place of expected triumphalism reassuring that events of game weren t entirety of mankind s future but just another step gameplay thumb alt horizontal rectangle video game screenshot that depicts a digital

ii are present but renamed or slightly tweaked players establish bases civilization ii s cities build facilities buildings and secret projects wonders of world explore territory research technology and conquer other factions civilizations in addition to conquering all non allied factions players may also win by obtaining votes from three quarters of total population similar to civilization ivs diplomatic victory cornering global energy market completing ascent to transcendence secret project or for alien factions constructing six subspace generators shah 2000 p 5 main map upper two thirds of screen is divided into squares on which players can establish bases move units and engage in combat through terraforming players may modify effects of individual map squares on movement combat and resources resources are used to feed population construct units and facilities and supply energy players can allocate energy between research into new technology and energy reserves unlike civilization ii new technology grants access to additional unit components rather than pre designed units allowing players to design and re design units as their factions priorities shift mccubbin 1999 p 230 energy reserves allow player to upgrade units maintain facilities and attempt to win by global energy market scenario bases are military strongpoints and objectives that are vital for all winning strategies they produce military units house population collect energy and build secret projects and subspace generators facilities and secret projects improve performance of individual bases and of entire faction in addition to terraforming optimizing individual base performance and building secret projects players may also benefit their factions through social engineering probe teams and diplomacy social engineering modifies ideologically based bonuses and penalties forced by player s choice of faction train 1998 08 11 p2 train 1998 08 11 p1 probe teams can sabotage and steal information units technology and energy from enemy bases while diplomacy lets player create coalitions with other factions it also allows trade or transfer of units bases technology and energy

secret projects game includes alien life structures and machines and sea fungus provide movement combat and resource penalties as well as concealment for mind worms and spore launchers immobile fungal towers spawn native life native life including seaborne isles of deep and and airborne locusts of chiron use psionic combat an alternate form of combat which ignores weapons and armor shah 2000 p 4

development leads to terraforming destroying fungus blooms and new native life alpha centauri provides a single player mode and supports customization and multiplayer players may customize game by

options include scenario game customized random map difficulty level and game rules that include victory conditions research control and initial map knowledge scenario and map editors allow players to create customized scenarios and maps scenario editor civilization gaming networks game s basic rules diplomatic dialog and factions starting abilities are in text files which designers have done their best to make it reasonably easy to modify even for non programmers reynolds 1999 p 207 alpha x txt editing v 1 3 civilization gaming networks alpha centauri supports play by email and tcp ip mode featuring simultaneous movement and introduces direct player to player negotiation allowing unconstrained trade of technology energy maps and other elements reynolds 1998 12 09 p2 development inspirations in 1996 microprose released lauded civilization ii designed by brian reynolds spectrum holobyte who owned microprose at time opted to consolidate their business under microprose name moving company from maryland to california by time game shipped harrison 2000 and laying off several microprose employees disagreements between new management and its employees prompted reynolds jeff briggs and sid meier designer of original civilization to leave microprose and found firaxis although unable to use same intellectual property as civilization ii new company felt that players wanted a new sweeping epic of a turn based game having just completed a game of human history up to present they wanted a fresh topic and chose science fiction reynolds 1998 11 23 p 237 with no previous experience in science fiction games developers believed future history was a fitting first foray reynolds 1998 06 04 p1 for elements of exploring and terraforming an alien world they chose a plausible near future situation of a human mission to colonize solar system s nearest neighbour and human factions reynolds 1998 11 23 pp 238 reynolds researched science fiction for game s writing his inspiration included classic works of science fiction including frank herbert s jesus incident and hellstrom s hive a fire upon deep by vernor vinge and mote in god s eye by larry niven and jerry pournelle for alien races kim stanley robinson s red mars slant by greg bear and stephen r donaldson s real story for future technology and science and dune by herbert and bear s anvil of stars for negative interactions between humans reynolds february 1999 p 228 reynolds february 1999 pp 229 alpha centauri set out to capture whole sweep of humanity s future including technology futuristic warfare social and economic development future of human condition spirituality and philosophy reynolds also said that getting philosophy into game was one of attractions of game believing good science fiction thrives on constraint developers began with near future technologies as they proceeded into future they tried to present a coherent logical and detailed picture of future developments in physics biology information technology economics society government and philosophy alien ecologies and mysterious intelligences were incorporated into alpha centauri as external natural forces intended to serve as for backstory and a catalyst for many player intelligences chris pine creator of in game map of planet strove to make planet look like a real planet which resulted in evidence of tectonic action another concern was that planet matched story which resulted in fungus being connected across continents as it is supposed to be a gigantic neural network pine 1999 p 70 terraforming is a natural outgrowth of colonizing an alien world reynolds 1998 06 04 p2 first playable prototype was just a map generator that tested climate changes during game this required designers to create a world builder program and climatic model far more powerful than anything they d done before temperature wind and rainfall patterns were modeled in ways that allow players to make changes for example creating a ridge line and then watching effects in addition to raising terrain player can also divert rivers dig huge boreholes into planet s mantle and melt ice caps in addition to scientific advances designers speculated on future development of human society reynolds 1998 06 04 p3 designers allow player to decide on a whole series of value choices and choose a ruthless moderate or idealistic stance reynolds said designers don t promote a single right answer instead giving each value choice positive and negative consequences this design was intended to force player to think and make game addictive he also commented that alpha centauris fictional nature allowed them to draw their characters a lot more sharply and distinctly than natural blurring and greyness of history chiron name of planet is name of only non barbaric centaur in greek mythology and an important and teacher for humanity name also pays homage to james p hogan s 1982 space opera novel voyage from yesteryear in which a human colony is artificially planted by an automatic probe on a planet later named by colonists as chiron in game chiron has two moons named after centaurs and with combined tidal force of earth s moon and is second planet out from alpha centauri a innermost planet being mercury like planet named after centaur alpha centauri b is also dubbed hercules a reference to him killing several centaurs in mythology and second star preventing formation of larger planets arrival on chiron is referred to as planetfall which is a term used in many science fiction novels including robert a heinlein s future history series and infocom s celebrated comic interactive fiction adventure planetfall vernor vinge s concept of technological singularity is origin of transcendence concept game s cutscenes use montages of live action video cgi or both most of former is from 1992 experimental documentary baraka alpha centauri in july 1996 firaxis began work on alpha centauri reynolds 1998 11 23 p 236 with reynolds heading project meier and reynolds wrote playable prototype code and jason coleman wrote first lines of development libraries because development of gettysburg took up most of firaxis time designers spent first year prototyping basic ideas by late 1996 developers were playing games on prototype and by middle of next year they were working on a multiplayer engine although firaxis intended to include multiplayer support in its games an important goal was to create games with depth and longevity in single player mode because they believed that majority of players spend most of their time playing this way reynolds felt that smart computer opponents are an integral part of a classic computer game and considered it a challenge to make them so reynolds 1998 04 14 p1 reynolds previous games omitted internet support because he believed that complex turn based games with many player options and opportunities for player input are difficult to facilitate online reynolds 1998 12 09 p1 reynolds said that most important principle of game design is for designer to play game as it is developed reynolds claimed that this was how a good artificial intelligence ai was built to this end he would track decisions he made and why he made them as he played game designer also watched what computer players did noting dumb actions and trying to discover why computer made them reynolds 1998 04 14 p2 reynolds then taught computer his reasoning process so ai could find right choice when presented several attractive possibilities he said ai for diplomatic personalities was best he had done up to that point doug kaufman a co designer of civilization ii was invited to join development as a game balancer reynolds cited alpha centauris balance for greater sense of urgency and more pressing pacing than in his earlier game sid meier s colonization according to producer timothy train in designing strengths and weaknesses of factions goal was to suggest without requiring certain strategies and give player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing game he didn t want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction s power to be dominant over rest train felt that fun meant factions always have something fun to do with their attributes train 1998 08 11 p3 around summer of 1997 staff began research on scientific realities involved in interstellar travel in late 1997 bing gordon then chief creative officer of electronic arts joined team and was responsible for planetary council extensive diplomacy and landmarks reynolds 1998 11 23 p 239 a few months before 1998 electronic entertainment expo e3 team incorporated explore discover build conquer marketing campaign into game game was announced in may 1998 at e3 in latter half of 1998 team produced a polished and integrated interface wrote game manual and foreign language translations painted faction leader portraits and terrain built 3d vehicles and vehicle parts and created music reynolds 1998 11 23 pp 240 1 michael ely directed secret project movies and cast faction leaders reynolds 1998 11 23 p 241 25 volunteers participated in firaxis first public beta test reynolds 1998 11 23 p 242 beta testers suggested diplomatic and economic victories and random events design team started with a very simple playable game they strengthen fun aspects and fixed or removed unenjoyable ones a process sid meier called surrounding fun after revision they played it again repeating cycle of revision and play playing game repeatedly and in depth was a rule at firaxis in single player mode team tried extreme strategies to find any sure fire paths to victory and to see how often a particular computer faction ends up at bottom goal was a product of unprecedented depth scope longevity and addictiveness where player is always challenged by game to come up with new strategies with no all powerful factions or unstoppable tactics according to reynolds process has been around since sid meier s early days at microprose at firaxis as iterations continue they expand group giving feedback bringing in outside gamers with fresh perspectives reynolds 1999 03 15 p2 alpha centauri was first firaxis game with public beta testers finally brian reynolds discussed use of demo in development process originally a marketing tool released prior to game they started getting feedback reynolds 1999 03 15 p3 they were able to incorporate many suggestions into retail version according to brian reynolds they made improvement in game s interface added a couple of new features and fixed a few glitches they also improved some rules fine tuned game balance and improved ai finally he adds that they continued to add patches to enhance game after game was released in months leading to release of alpha centauri multimedia producer michael ely wrote 35 weekly episodes of journey to centauri detailing splintering of u n mission to alpha centauri official site story alien crossfire a month after alpha centauris february 1999 release firaxis team began work on expansion pack sid meier s alien crossfire train 1999 08 25 p 45 alien crossfire features seven new factions two that are non human new technologies new facilities new secret projects new alien life forms new unit special abilities new victory conditions including new progenitor victory and several additional concepts and strategies development team included train as producer and designer chris pine as programmer jerome and greg as artists and doug kaufman as co designer and game balancer team considered several ideas including a return to a post apocalyptic earth and conquest of another planet in alpha centauri system before deciding to keep new title on planet premise allowed them to mix and match old and new characters and delve into mysteries of monoliths and alien artifacts backstory evolved quickly and main conflict centered on return of original alien inhabitants train 1999 08 25 p 46 idea of humans inadvertently caught up in an off world civil war focused story train wanted to improve build aspects feeling that god game genre had always been heavily slanted towards conquer end of spectrum he wanted to provide builders with tools to construct an empire in face of heated competition internet community provided invaluable feedback first call for features was posted around april 1999 and produced defense system algorithmic enhancement and terminus team had several goals factions should not be locked in to certain strategies players should have interesting things to do without unbalancing game and factions must be fun to play train 1999 08 25 pp 47 8 team believed coolness of progenitor aliens would determine success or failure of alien crossfire train 1999 08 25 p 47 they strove to make them feel significantly different to play but still compatible with existing game mechanics developers eventually provided aliens with battle ogres a planetary survey non blind research and other powers to produce a nasty and potent race that would take combined might of humanity to bring them down chris pine modified ai to account for additions team also used artwork sound effects music and diplomatic text to set aliens apart other than aliens pirates proved to be toughest faction to balance because their ocean start gave them huge advantages train 1999 08 25 p 48 upon completion team felt that alien crossfire was somewhere between an expansion and a full blown sequel in months leading to release of alien crossfire multimedia producer michael ely wrote 9 episodes of centauri arrival introducing alien crossfire factions game initially had a single production run electronic arts bundled alpha centauri and alien crossfire in alpha centauri planetary pack in 2000 and included both games in laptop collection in 2003 in 2000 both alpha centauri and alien crossfire were ported to classic mac os by aspyr media and to linux by loki software reception alpha centauri received wide critical acclaim upon its release with reviewers voicing respect for game s pedigree especially that of reynolds and meier video game review aggregator websites gamerankings and metacritic which collect data from numerous review websites listed scores of 92 and 89 respectively game was favorably compared to reynold s previous title civilization ii and shah of it world canada praised expansion for a believable plot however despite its critical reception it sold fewest copies of all games in civilization series it sold more than 100 000 copies in its first two months of release this was followed by 50 000 copies in april may and june in united states alpha centauri was tenth best selling computer game of 1999 s first half its sales in that country alone reached 224 939 copies by end of 1999 and rose to 281 115 units by september 2000 critical reaction game showed well at 1998 electronic entertainment expo e3 reynolds 1998 11 23 p 240 walter of gamespot said that alpha centauri was more than hi tech physics and new ways to blow each other up and that game would feature realistic aliens terry coleman of computer gaming world predicted that alpha centauri would be another huge hit awarded it most promising strategy game and one of top 25 games of e3 98 in a vote of 27 journalists from 22 gaming magazine alpha centauri won best turn based strategy of e3 show award aaron john loeb awards committee chairman said for those that understand intricacies wonder glory of turn based culture building this is game worth skipping class for alpha centauri s science fiction storyline received high praise ign considered game an exception to pc sci fi cliches and gamepro compared plot to works of writers stanley kubrick and isaac asimov j c herz of new york times suggested that game was a marriage of simcity and frank herbert s dune gamepros dan morris said as single player campaign builds to its final showdown ramifications of final theoretical discoveries elevate alpha centauri from great strategy game to science fiction epic game revolution said well crafted story admirable science fiction world fully realized scenario and quality core gameplay are sure to please edge praised uniqueness of expression saying it was same kind of old fashioned consensual storytelling that once drew universes out of ascii in game writing and faction leaders were also well received for their believability especially voice acting gamespot reviewer denny atkin called factions and their abilities alpha centauris most impressive aspect greg tito of escapist said genius of game is how it flawlessly blends its great writing with strategy elements alpha centauri s turn based gameplay including technology trees and factional warfare was commonly compared to civilization and civilization ii adrenaline vault s pete hines said while alpha centauri is evolutionary off spring to civilization and civilization ii it is not civilization ii in space although comparison is inevitable because of lineage it is still short sighted edge in 2006 praised alpha centauri s greater as a strategy game ign said alpha centauri is a better game than civilization ii it s deep rich rewarding thought provoking in almost every way game revolution s reviewer was less magnanimous saying alpha centauri is at least as good a game as civilization 2 but it is its great similarity that also does it most detriment alpha centauri simply does not do enough that is new it just doesn t innovate enough to earn a higher grade ability to create custom units was praised as was depth of tech tree artificial intelligence of computer controlled factions which featured adaptability and behavioral subtlety was given mixed comments some reviewers thought it was efficient and logical while others found it confusing or erratic edge was disappointed in game s diplomacy finding no more and no less than is expected from genre and unhappy with inability to sound out any real sense of relationship or rational discourse game s graphics were widely acknowledged to be above average at time of its release but not revolutionary its maps and interface were considered detailed and in accordance with a space theme but game was released with a limited color palette in game cutscenes particularly full motion video that accompanied technological advances were praised for their
