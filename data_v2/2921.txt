alekhine s play was mostly better than his competitors even capablanca s but he lacked confidence when playing his major rivals alekhine s main goal throughout this period was to arrange a match with capablanca he thought greatest obstacle was not capablanca s play but requirement under 1922 london rules at capablanca s insistence that challenger raise a purse of us 10 000 equivalent to about 391 000 in earnings for conversion if consumer prices are used result is about 257 000 of which defending champion would receive over half even if defeated alekhine in november 1921 and rubinstein and

to have him lead french team in first nation tournament to be held in london in july 1927 nevertheless alekhine had to wait for a new law on naturalization which was published on 10 august 1927 decree

preparation while alekhine got himself into good physical condition and had thoroughly studied capablanca s play according to kasparov alekhine s research uncovered many small inaccuracies which occurred because capablanca was unwilling to concentrate intensely vladimir kramnik has commented that this was first contest in which capablanca had no easy wins rematch offered never finalized immediately after winning match alekhine announced that he was willing to give capablanca a return match on same terms that capablanca had required as champion challenger must provide a stake of us 10 000 of which more than half would go to defending champion even if he was defeated negotiations dragged on for several years often breaking down when agreement seemed in sight their relationship became bitter and alekhine demanded much higher appearance fees for tournaments in which capablanca also played rematch never took place after capablanca s death in 1942 alekhine wrote that capablanca s demand for a 10 000 stake had been an attempt to avoid challenges grandmaster robert byrne wrote that alekhine consciously sought lesser opponents for his subsequent championship matches rather than

alexander alekhine had had a very close relationship publicly repudiated him and his anti soviet utterances shortly after but alexei may have had little choice about this decision main source is kotov 1975 p 140 in august 1939 alexei was murdered in russia probably due to his open support of nazis early 1930s according to reuben fine alekhine dominated chess into mid 1930s his most famous

drinking increasing amounts of alcohol hans kmoch wrote that alekhine first drank heavily during tournament at bled in 1931 and drank heavily through 1934 match with bogoljubov loss of world title 1935 1937 thumb right 175px max euwe took alekhine s world title in 1935 but lost it in their 1937 return match in 1933 alekhine challenged max euwe to a championship match euwe in early 1930s was regarded as one of three credible challengers others were jose raul capablanca and salo flohr euwe accepted challenge for october 1935 earlier that year dutch radio sports journalist han hollander asked capablanca for his views on forthcoming match in rare archival film footage where capablanca and euwe both speak capablanca replies dr alekhine s game is 20 bluff dr euwe s game is clear and straightforward dr euwe s game not so strong as alekhine s in some respects is more evenly balanced then euwe gives his assessment in dutch explaining that his feelings alternated from optimism to pessimism but in previous ten years their score had been evenly matched at 7 7 han interviews dutchman max euwe and capablanca dutch public broadcasting archives 18 may 2012 on october 3 1935 world championship match began in zandvoort netherlands although alekhine took an early lead from game thirteen onwards euwe won twice as many games as alekhine challenger became new champion on december 15 1935 with nine wins thirteen draws and eight losses this was first world championship match that officially had seconds alekhine had services of salo landau and euwe had geza maroczy euwe s win was a major upset kmoch wrote that alekhine drank no alcohol for first half match but later took a glass before most games however salo flohr who also assisted euwe thought overconfidence caused more problems than alcohol did for alekhine in this match and alekhine himself had previously said he would win easily 2001 later world champions vasily smyslov boris spassky anatoly karpov and garry kasparov analyzed match for their own benefit and concluded that euwe deserved to win and that standard of play was worthy of a world championship according to kmoch alekhine abstained from alcohol altogether for five years after 1935 match in eighteen months after losing title alekhine played in ten tournaments with uneven results tied for first with paul keres at bad nauheim in may 1936 first

jose raul capablanca had been unable to obtain after alekhine won world title in 1927 alekhine regained title from euwe in december 1937 by a large margin 10 4 11 in this match held in netherlands euwe was seconded by fine and alekhine by erich eliskases match was a real contest initially but euwe collapsed near end losing four of last five games fine attributed collapse to nervous tension possibly aggravated by euwe s attempts to maintain a calm appearance alekhine played no more title matches and thus held title until his death 1938 began well for alekhine who won montevideo 1938 chess tournament at carrasco in march and at margate in april and tied for first with sir george alan thomas at plymouth in september in november however he only tied for 4th 6th with euwe and samuel reshevsky behind paul keres reuben fine and mikhail botvinnik ahead of capablanca and flohr at avro tournament in netherlands this tournament was played in each of several dutch cities for a few days at a time it was therefore perhaps not surprising that rising stars took first three places as older players found travel very tiring though fine was dismissive of this explanation because distances were short immediately after avro tournament botvinnik who had finished in third place challenged alekhine to a match for world championship they agreed on a prize fund of us 10 000 with two thirds going to winner and that if match were to take place in moscow alekhine would be invited at least three months in advance so that he could play in a tournament to get ready for match other details had not been agreed when world war ii interrupted negotiations which two players resumed after war based on botvinnik s memoirs keres who had won avro tournament on tiebreak over fine also challenged alekhine to a world championship match negotiations were proceeding in 1939 when they were disrupted by world war ii during war keres home country estonia was invaded first by ussr then by germany then again by ussr at end of war soviet government prevented keres from continuing negotiations on grounds that he had collaborated with germans during their occupation of estonia by soviet standards

7 7 and caracas 10 10 at end of august 1939 both alekhine and capablanca wrote to augusto de muro regarding a possible world championship rematch whereas former spoke of a rematch as a virtual certainty even stating that cuban was remaining in buenos aires until it came about latter referred at length to financial burden in aftermath of olympiad chess notes by edward winter supported by latin american financial pledges jose r capablanca challenged alexander alekhine to a world title match in november tentative plans not however actually backed by a deposit of required purse 10 000 in

march 1943 he won in prague april 1943 and tied for first with keres in salzburg june 1943 by late 1943 alekhine was spending all his time in spain and portugal as german representative to chess events this also allowed him to get away from onrushing soviet invasion into eastern europe in 1944 he narrowly won a match against ramon rey ardid in zaragoza 1 0 3 april 1944 and won in gijon july

world championship match against botvinnik alekhine died aged 53 in his hotel room in estoril portugal on march 24 1946 circumstances of his death are still a matter of debate it is usually attributed to a heart attack but a letter in chess life magazine from a witness to autopsy stated that choking on meat was actual cause of death at autopsy a three inch long piece of unchewed meat was discovered blocking his windpipe some have speculated that he was murdered by a french death squad a few years later alekhine s son alexander alekhine jr said that hand of moscow reached his father canadian grandmaster kevin spraggett who has lived in portugal since late 1980s and who has thoroughly investigated alekhine s death favors this possibility spraggett makes a case for manipulation of crime scene and autopsy by portuguese secret police pide he believes that alekhine was murdered outside his hotel room probably by soviets alekhine s burial was sponsored by fide and remains were transferred to cimetiere du montparnasse paris france in 1956 moran 1989 assessment playing strength and style statistical ranking systems differ sharply in their views of alekhine warriors of mind rates him only 18th strongest player of all time and comments that victories over players such as bogoljubov and euwe are not a strong basis for an all time ranking keene 1989 but website chessmetrics ranks him between fourth and eighth best of all time depending on lengths of peak periods being compared and concludes that at his absolute peak he was a little stronger than emanuel lasker and capablanca although a little weaker than botvinnik jeff sonas author of website chessmetrics rates alekhine as sixth highest peak strength relative to other players of same era of all time on basis of comparable ratings he also assesses alekhine s victory at tournament of san remo in 1930 as sixth best performance ever in tournaments in his 1978 book rating of chessplayers past and present arpad elo gave retrospective elo ratings to players based on their performance over best five year span of their career he concluded that alekhine 2690 was joint fifth strongest player of those surveyed tied with paul morphy and vasily smyslov behind capablanca 2725 botvinnik 2720 emanuel lasker 2720 and mikhail tal 2700 elo 1978 alekhine s peak period was in early 1930s when he won almost every tournament he played sometimes by huge margins afterward his play declined and he never won a top class tournament after 1934 after alekhine regained his world title in 1937 there were several new contenders all of whom would have been serious challengers alekhine was one of greatest attacking players and could apparently produce combinations at will what set him apart from most other attacking players was his ability to see potential for an attack and prepare for it in positions where others saw nothing rudolf spielmann a master tactician who produced many brilliancies said i can see combinations as well as alekhine but i cannot get to same positions dr max euwe said alekhine is a poet who creates a work of art out of something that would hardly inspire another man to send home a picture post card an explanation offered by reti was he beats his opponents by analysing simple and apparently harmless sequences of moves in order to see whether at some time or another at end of it an original possibility and therefore one difficult to see might be hidden reti 1923 p 129 john nunn commented that alekhine had a special ability to provoke complications without taking excessive risks and edward winter called him supreme genius of complicated position some of alekhine s combinations are so complex that even modern champions and contenders disagree in their analyses of them nevertheless garry kasparov said that alekhine s attacking play was based on solid positional foundations and harry golombek went further saying that alekhine was most versatile of all chess geniuses being equally at home in every style of play and in all phases of game reuben fine a serious contender for world championship in late 1930s wrote in 1950s that alekhine s collection of best games was one of three most beautiful that he knew and golombek was equally impressed golombek 1955 alekhine s games have a higher percentage of wins than those of any other world champion and his drawn games are on average among longest of all champions his desire to win extended beyond formal chess competition when fine beat him in some casual games in 1933 alekhine demanded a match for a small stake and in table tennis which alekhine played enthusiastically but badly he would often crush ball when he lost bobby fischer in a 1964 article ranked alekhine as one of ten greatest players in history fischer who was famous for clarity of his play wrote of alekhine alekhine has never been a hero of mine and i ve never cared for his style of play there s nothing light or breezy about it it worked for him but it could scarcely work for anyone else he played gigantic conceptions full of outrageous and unprecedented ideas h e had great imagination he could see more deeply into a situation than any other player in chess history it was in most complicated positions that alekhine found his grandest concepts alekhine s style had a profound influence on kasparov who said alexander alekhine is first luminary among others who are still having greatest influence on me i like his universality his approach to game his chess ideas i am sure that future belongs to alekhine chess in 2012 levon aronian said that he considers alekhine greatest chess player of all time influence on game several openings and opening variations are named after alekhine in addition to well known alekhine s defence 1 e4 nf6 and albin alekhine attack in orthodox paulsen variation of french defense fine 1943 there are alekhine variations in budapest gambit vienna game exchange variation of ruy lopez winawer variation of french defense dragon variation of sicilian defense queen s gambit accepted slav defense queen s pawn game catalan opening and dutch defense where three different lines bear his name irving chernev commented openings consist of alekhine s games with a few variations alekhine also composed a few endgame studies one of which is shown in diagram a miniature a study with a maximum of seven pieces harold van der heijden endgame study database 2005 alekhine wrote over twenty books on chess mostly annotated editions of games in a major match or tournament plus collections of his best games between 1908 and 1937 unlike wilhelm steinitz emanuel lasker capablanca and euwe he wrote no books that explained his ideas about game or showed beginners how to improve their play his books appeal to expert players rather than beginners they contain many long analyses of variations in critical positions and singularities and exceptions were his forte not rules and simplifications although alekhine was declared an enemy of soviet union after his anti bolshevik statement in 1928 he was gradually rehabilitated by soviet chess elite following his death in 1946 alexander kotov s research on alekhine s games and career culminating in a biography kotov 1975 led to a soviet series of alekhine memorial tournaments first of these at moscow 1956 was won jointly by botvinnik and vasily smyslov in their book soviet school of chess kotov and devoted a chapter to alekhine called him russia s greatest player and praised his capacity for seizing initiative by concrete tactical play in opening kotov 1958 botvinnik wrote that soviet school of chess learned from alekhine s fighting qualities capacity for self criticism and vision botvinnik 1951 alekhine had written that success in chess required firstly self knowledge secondly a firm comprehension of my opponent s strength and weakness thirdly a higher aim artistic and scientific accomplishments which accord our chess equal rank with other arts accusations of improving games samuel reshevsky wrote that alekhine allegedly made up games against fictitious opponents in which he came out victor and had these games published in various chess magazines reshevsky 1976 p 78 in a recent book andy soltis lists alekhine s 15 improvements soltis 2002 most famous example is his game with five queens in moscow in 1915 in actual game alekhine playing as black beat grigoriev in moscow 1915 tournament but in one of his books he presented five queens variation starting with a move he rejected as black in original game as an actual game won by white player in moscow in 1915 he did not say in book who was who in this version nor that it was in tournament original game without five queens was grigoriev vs alekhine moscow 1915 which alekhine annotated for but he presented five queens version in a note to tarrasch vs alekhine st petersburg 1914 which is game 26 in alekhine 1985 in same book alekhine presented as a note to game 90 alekhine vs teichmann berlin 1921 a 15 move win against o tenner which tenner claimed was actually a variation that arose in their post game analysis of their 23 move draw in position of diagram which never arose in real play alekhine claimed that white wins by 24 rh6 as after some complicated play black is mated or goes into an endgame a queen down a later computer assisted analysis concludes that white can force a win but only by diverging from alekhine s move sequence at move 20 while there are only three queens chess historian edward winter investigated a game alekhine allegedly won in fifteen moves via a queen sacrifice at sabadell in 1945 some photos of game in progress were discovered that showed players during game and their chessboard based on position that chess pieces had taken on chessboard in this photo game could never have taken course that was stated in published version this raised suspicions that published version was made up even if published version is a fake however there is no doubt that alekhine did defeat his opponent in actual game and there is no evidence that alekhine was source of famous fifteen move win whose authenticity is doubted accusations of antisemitism during world war ii alekhine played in several tournaments held in germany or german occupied territory as did many strong players in occupied and neutral countries these players included among others keres bogoljubov stoltz erik lundin bjorn nielsen nicolaas karel jan mario napolitano and teodor in march 1941 a series of articles appeared under alekhine s name in pariser zeitung a german language newspaper published in paris by occupying german forces among other things these articles said that jews had a great talent for exploiting chess but showed no signs of chess artistry described hypermodern theories of nimzowitsch and reti as this cheap bluff this shameless self publicity hyped by majority of anglo jewish pseudo intellectuals and described his 1937 match with euwe as a triumph against jewish conspiracy http www com winter extra html during interviews with two spanish newspapers in september 1941 alekhine criticised jewish chess strategy in one of these he said that aryan chess was aggressive but semitic concept admitted idea of pure defence he also praised rival capablanca for taking world title from jew lasker almost immediately after liberation of paris alekhine publicly stated that he had to write two chess articles for pariser zeitung before germans granted him his exit visa articles which alekhine claims were purely scientific were rewritten by germans published and made to treat chess from a racial viewpoint he wrote at least two further in an open letter to organizer of 1946 london tournament w hatton ward and in his posthumous book legado these three denials are phrased differently extensive investigations by ken whyld have not yielded conclusive evidence of authenticity of articles chess writer jacques le monnier claimed in a 1986 issue of europe echecs that in 1958 he saw some of alekhine s notebooks and found in alekhine s own handwriting exact text of first antisemitic article which appeared in pariser zeitung on march 18 1941 in his 1973 book 75 parties d alekhine 75 of alekhine s games however le monnier had written it will never be known whether alekhine was behind these articles or whether they were manipulated by editor of pariser zeitung british chess historian edward g winter notes that articles in pariser zeitung misspelled names of several famous chess masters which could be interpreted as evidence of forgery or as attempts by alekhine to signal that he was being forced to write things that he did not believe but these could simply have been typesetting errors as alekhine s handwriting was not easy to read articles contained probably incorrect claims that lionel kieseritzky in english in polish was a polish jew although probably kieseritzky was neither polish nor jewish http www com text pdf winter concludes although as things stand it is difficult to construct much of a defence for alekhine only discovery of articles in his own handwriting will settle matter beyond all doubt under french copyright law alekhine s notebooks did not enter public domain until january 1 2017 winter cites many original documents including alekhine nazi articles a privately printed booklet edited by ken whyld that contains an english translation of pariser zeitung articles alekhine s disavowal of these articles in news review november 23 1944 also reported in british chess magazine december 1944 and chess january 1945 alekhine s posthumous book legado interviews in september 3 1941 editions of el alcazar and which report alekhine as making anti semitic statements about chess there is evidence that alekhine was not antisemitic in his personal or chess relationships with jews in june 1919 he was arrested by cheka imprisoned in odessa and sentenced to death yakov vilner a jewish master saved him by sending a telegram to chairman of ukrainian council of people s commissars who knew of alekhine and ordered his release alekhine accepted and apparently used chess analysis from charles jaffe in his world championship match against capablanca jaffe was a jewish master who lived in new york where alekhine often visited and upon his return to new york after defeating capablanca alekhine played a short match as a favour to jaffe without financial remuneration saidy 1974 p 190 191 alekhine s second for 1935 match with max euwe was master salo landau a dutch jew american jewish grandmaster arnold denker wrote that he found alekhine very friendly in chess settings taking part in consultation games and productive analysis sessions denker also wrote that alekhine treated younger and at that time virtually unproven denker to dinner on many occasions in new york during 1930s when economy was very weak because of great depression denker added that alekhine during early 1930s opined that american jewish grandmaster isaac kashdan might be his next challenger this did not in fact take place he gave chess lessons to 14 year old prodigy gerardo a german jew in paris in spring 1940 alekhine also married an american woman who may have had jewish ancestry grace as his fourth wife grace alekhine was women s champion of paris in 1944 writings alekhine wrote over twenty books on chess alexander alekhine on google books some of best known are originally published in two volumes as my best games of
