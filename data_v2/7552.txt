vandalic or vandal war polemos was a conflict fought in north africa largely in modern tunisia between forces of eastern roman or byzantine empire and vandalic kingdom of carthage in 533 534 it was first of justinian i s wars of reconquest of lost western roman empire vandals had occupied roman north africa in early 5th century and established an independent kingdom there under their first king geiseric formidable vandal navy carried out pirate attacks across mediterranean sacked rome and defeated a massive roman invasion in 468 after geiseric s death relations with surviving eastern roman empire normalized although tensions flared up occasionally due to vandals militant adherence to arianism and their persecution of chalcedonian native population in 530 a palace coup in carthage overthrew pro roman hilderic and replaced him with his cousin gelimer eastern roman emperor justinian took this as a pretext to interfere in vandal affairs and after he secured his eastern frontier with sassanid persia in 532 he began preparing an expedition under general belisarius whose secretary procopius wrote main historical narrative of war justinian took advantage of or even instigated rebellions in remote vandal provinces of sardinia and tripolitania these not only distracted gelimer from emperor s preparations but also weakened vandal defences through dispatch of bulk of vandal navy and a large portion of their army under gelimer s brother tzazon to sardinia roman expeditionary force set sail from constantinople in late june 533 and after a sea voyage along coasts of greece and southern italy landed on african coast at caputvada in early september to gelimer s complete surprise vandal king gathered his forces and met roman army at battle of ad decimum near carthage on 13 september gelimer s elaborate plan to encircle and destroy roman army came close to success but belisarius was able to drive vandal army to flight and occupy carthage gelimer withdrew to bulla regia where he gathered his remaining strength including army of tzazon which returned from sardinia in december gelimer advanced towards carthage and met romans at battle of tricamarum battle resulted in a roman victory and death of tzazon gelimer fled to a remote mountain fortress where he was blockaded until he surrendered in spring belisarius returned to constantinople with vandals royal treasure and captive gelimer to enjoy a triumph while africa was formally restored to imperial rule as praetorian prefecture of africa imperial control scarcely reached beyond old vandal kingdom however and moorish tribes of interior proved unwilling to accept imperial rule and soon rose up in rebellion new province was shaken by wars with moors and military rebellions and it was not until 548 that peace

mauretania sitifensis and most of numidia was recognized in 435 by western roman court but this was only a temporary expedient warfare soon recommenced and in october 439 capital of africa carthage fell to vandals in 442 another treaty exchanged provinces hitherto held by vandals with core of african diocese rich provinces of zeugitana and byzacena which vandals received no longer as foederati

sack of rome itself in 455 which allegedly lasted for two weeks taking advantage of chaos that followed valentinian s death in 455 geiseric then regained control albeit rather tenuous of mauretanian

empires under basiliscus bury 1923 vol i pp 331 1896 pp 3 4 in aftermath of this disaster and following further vandal raids against shores of greece eastern emperor zeno r 474 491 concluded a perpetual peace with geiseric 474 476 bury 1923 vol i p 1896 p 4 roman vandal relations until 533 vandal state was unique in many respects among germanic kingdoms that succeeded western roman empire instead of respecting and continuing established roman socio political order they completely replaced it with their own whereas kings of western europe continued to pay deference to emperors and minted coinage with their portraits vandal kings portrayed themselves as fully independent rulers vandals also consciously differentiated themselves from native romano african population through their continued use of their native language and peculiar dress which served to emphasize their distinct social position as elite of kingdom in addition vandals like most germanics adherents of arianism

chalcedonians exchanged gifts and embassies with justinian i r 527 565 even before latter s rise to throne and even replaced his image in his coins with that of emperor justinian evidently hoped that this rapprochement would lead to peaceful subordination of vandal state to his empire bury 1923 vol ii p 125 however hilderic s pro roman policies coupled with a defeat suffered against moors in byzacena led to opposition among vandal nobility which resulted in his overthrow and imprisonment in 530 by his cousin gelimer r 530 534 justinian seized opportunity demanding hilderic s restoration with gelimer predictably refusing to do so justinian then demanded hilderic s release to constantinople threatening war otherwise gelimer was unwilling to surrender a rival claimant to justinian who could use him to stir up trouble in his kingdom and probably expected war to come either way according to j b bury he consequently refused justinian s demand on grounds that this was an internal matter among vandals bury 1923 vol ii pp 125 1896 pp 5 2009 pp 71 72 justinian now had his pretext and with peace restored on his eastern frontier with sassanid persia in 532 he started assembling an

disaster of 468 was still fresh financial officials resented expenditure involved while military was weary from persian war and feared vandals sea power emperor s scheme received support mostly from church reinforced by arrival of victims of renewed persecutions from africa only powerful minister john cappadocian dared to openly voice his opposition to expedition however and justinian disregarded it and pressed on with his preparations bury 1923 vol ii pp 126 127diehl 1896 pp 7 8 diplomatic preparations and revolts in tripolitania and sardinia soon after his seizure of power gelimer s domestic position began to deteriorate as he persecuted his political enemies among vandal nobility confiscating their property and executing many of them hughes 2009 p 72 these actions undermined his already doubtful legitimacy in eyes of many and contributed to outbreak of two revolts in remote provinces of vandal kingdom in sardinia where local governor godas declared himself an independent ruler and shortly after in tripolitania where native population led by a certain pudentius rebelled against vandal rule although procopius narrative makes both uprisings seem coincidental ian hughes points out fact that both rebellions broke out shortly before commencement of roman expedition against vandals and that both godas and pudentius immediately asked for assistance from justinian as evidence of an active diplomatic involvement by emperor in their preparation hughes 2009 pp 72 73 in response to godas emissaries justinian detailed cyril one of officers of foederati with 400 men to accompany invasion fleet and then sail on to sardinia hughes 2009 p 76 gelimer reacted to godas rebellion by sending bulk of his fleet 120 of his best vessels and 5 000 men under his own brother tzazon to suppress it vandal king s decision played a crucial role in outcome of war for it removed from scene vandal navy main obstacle to a roman landing in africa as well as a large part of his army gelimer also chose to ignore revolt in tripolitania for moment as it was both a lesser threat and more remote while his lack of manpower constrained him to await tzazon s return from sardinia before undertaking further campaigns diehl 1896 p 2009 p 80 at same time both rulers tried to win over allies gelimer contacted visigoth king theudis r 531 548 and proposed an alliance while justinian secured benevolent neutrality and support of ostrogothic kingdom of italy which had strained relations with vandals over ill treatment of ostrogoth princess wife of thrasamund ostrogoth court readily agreed to allow roman invasion fleet to use harbour of syracuse in sicily and establish a market for provisioning of roman troops there bury 1923 vol ii p 1896 pp 14 2009 p 73 opposing forces thumb a member of retinue of emperor justinian i in mosaic in church of san vitale ravenna which is usually identified with belisarius justinian selected one of his most trusted and talented generals belisarius who had recently distinguished himself against persians and in suppression of nika riots to lead expedition as ian hughes points out belisarius was also eminently suited for this appointment for two other reasons he was a native latin speaker and was solicitous of welfare of local population keeping a tight leash on his troops both these qualities would be crucial in winning support from latin speaking african population hughes 2009 pp 74 75 belisarius was accompanied by his wife antonina and by procopius his secretary who wrote history of war according to procopius vandalic war i 11 army consisted of 10 000 infantry partly drawn from field army comitatenses and partly from among foederati as well as 5 000 cavalry there were also some 1 500 2 000 of belisarius own retainers bucellarii an elite corps it is unclear if their number is included in 5 000 cavalry mentioned as a total figure by procopius in addition there were two additional bodies of allied troops both mounted archers 600 huns and 400 army was led by an array of experienced officers among whom eunuch solomon was chosen as belisarius chief of staff domesticus and former praetorian prefect archelaus was placed in charge of army s provisioning whole force was transported on 500 vessels manned by 30 000 sailors under admiral calonymus of alexandria guarded by ninety two warships bury 1923 vol ii p 127diehl 1896 pp 16 2009 pp 75 76 traditional view as expressed by j b bury is that expeditionary force was remarkably small for task especially given military reputation of vandals and that perhaps it reflects limit of fleet s carrying capacity or perhaps it was an intentional move to limit impact of any defeat ian hughes however comments that even in comparison with armies of early roman empire belisarius army was a large well balanced force capable of overcoming vandals and may have contained a higher proportion of high quality reliable troops than armies stationed in east on vandal side picture is less clear vandal army was not a professional and mostly volunteer force like east roman army but comprised every able bodied male of vandal people hence modern estimates on available forces vary along with estimates on total vandal population from a high of between 30 000 40 000 men out of a total vandal population of at most 200 000 people diehl and bury to as few as 25 000 men or even 20 000 if their losses against moors are taken into account for a population base of 100 000 hughes bury 1923 vol ii p 1896 pp 8 2009 pp 81 82 despite their martial reputation vandals had grown less warlike over time having come to lead a luxurious life amidst riches of africa in addition their mode of fighting was ill suited to confronting belisarius veterans vandal army was composed exclusively of cavalry lightly armoured and armed only for hand to hand combat to point of neglecting entirely use of bows or javelins in stark contrast to belisarius heavily armoured cataphracts and horse archers account of procopius completely refutes this poorly chosen source diehl 1896 pp 9 12 2009 pp 82 84 vandals were also weakened by hostility of their roman subjects

slow as fleet spent five days at heraclea perinthus waiting for horses and a further four days at due to lack of wind fleet left dardanelles on 1 july and crossed aegean sea to port of methone where it was joined by last contingents of troops belisarius took advantage of an enforced stay there due to a lull in wind to train his troops and acquaint disparate contingents with each other it was at methone however that 500 men died of dysentery caused by mouldy bread according to procopius responsibility fell on john cappadocian who had cut costs by baking it only once with result that bread went bad justinian was informed but john does not appear to have been punished belisarius took steps to remedy situation and army soon recovered hughes 2009 p 78 from methone fleet sailed up ionian sea to from where they crossed over to italy crossing took longer than expected due to lack of wind and army suffered from lack of fresh water when supplies they had brought aboard went bad eventually fleet reached catania in sicily from where belisarius sent procopius ahead to syracuse to gather intelligence on vandals activities by chance procopius met a merchant friend of his there whose servant had just arrived from carthage latter informed procopius that not only were vandals unaware of belisarius sailing but that gelimer who had just dispatched tzazon s expedition to sardinia was away from carthage at small inland town of hermione procopius quickly informed belisarius who immediately ordered army to re embark and set sail for african coast after sailing by malta they reached cape caputvada on eastern shore of modern tunisia some 162 roman miles 240 km south from carthage bury 1923 vol ii p 1896 pp 17 2009 pp 79 80 advance on carthage and battle of ad decimum when roman fleet reached africa a council was held aboard belisarius flagship vandalic war i 15 where many of his officers advocated an immediate attack on carthage itself especially since it was only fortified city in vandal realm walls of other cities having been torn down to prevent a rebellion belisarius however mindful of fate of 468 expedition and wary of an encounter with vandal fleet spoke against it thus army disembarked and built a fortified camp to spend night hughes 2009 p 1896 pp 18 19 belisarius knew that success for his expedition relied on gaining support of local population which had largely retained its roman identity and to which he presented himself as a liberator thus on next day of landing when some of his men stole some fruit from a local orchard he severely punished them and assembled army and exhorted them to maintain discipline and restraint towards native population lest they abandon their roman sympathies and go over to vandals belisarius pleas bore results for as procopius reports vandalic war i 17 soldiers behaved with moderation and they neither began any unjust brawls nor did anything out of way and belisarius by displaying great gentleness and kindness won libyans to his side so completely that thereafter he made journey as if in his own land bury 1923 vol ii pp 130 1896 pp 19 2009 p 85 then roman army began its march north following coastal road 300 horse under john armenian were detached as an advance guard some 3 miles 4 5 km in front of main army while 600 huns covered army s left flank belisarius himself with his bucellarii led up rear to guard against any attack from gelimer who was known to be in vicinity fleet followed army sailing along coast hughes 2009 p 86 first town they encountered was which was captured by a detachment under by a ruse in an attempt to sow division among vandals belisarius gave a letter written by justinian and addressed to vandal nobles to a captured vandal messenger in which emperor claimed to be campaigning on behalf of legitimate king hilderic against usurper gelimer as messenger was too afraid to deliver letter this ploy came to nothing thumb right 250px gelimer s plan to encircle romans at ad decimum gelimer in meantime upon learning of romans arrival immediately notified his brother ammatas in carthage to assemble vandal forces in vicinity as well as to execute hilderic and his relatives while his secretary bonifatius was ordered to load royal treasure on a ship and sail for spain if romans won bury 1923 vol ii p 131 deprived of his best troops which were with tzazon gelimer contented himself with shadowing northward march of roman army all while preparing a decisive engagement before carthage at a place called ad decimum at tenth milepost where he had ordered ammatas to bring his forces diehl 1896 pp 20 21 romans advanced through thapsus leptis parva and hadrumetum to grasse where for first time they engaged in a skirmish with scouts of gelimer s army after exchanging blows both parties retired to their camps from grasse belisarius turned his army westwards cutting across neck of cape bon peninsula this was most dangerous part of route to carthage with fleet out of sight hughes 2009 p 87 thus on morning of 13 september tenth day of march from caputvada roman army approached ad decimum there gelimer planned to ambush and encircle them using a force under his brother ammatas to block their advance and engage them while 2 000 men under his nephew gibamund would attack their left flank and gelimer himself with main army would attack from rear and completely annihilate roman army in event three forces failed to synchronize exactly ammatas arrived early and was killed as he attempted a reconnaissance with a small force by roman vanguard while gibamund s force was intercepted by hunnic flank guard and was utterly destroyed unaware of all this gelimer marched up with main army and scattered roman advance forces present at ad decimum victory might have been his but he then came upon his dead brother s body and apparently forgot all about battle this gave belisarius time to rally his troops come up with his main cavalry force and defeat

belisarius realized extent of his victory cavalry spent night at battlefield in next morning as infantry and antonina caught up whole army made for carthage where it arrived as night was falling carthaginians had thrown open gates and illuminated city in celebration but belisarius fearing a possible ambush in darkness and wishing to keep his soldiers under tight control refrained from entering city and encamped before it bury 1923 vol ii p 135hughes 2009 p 97 in meantime fleet had rounded cape bon and after learning of roman victory had anchored at some 7 5 km from city ignoring belisarius instructions calonymus and his men proceeded to plunder merchant settlement of nearby on morning of next day 15 september belisarius drew up army for battle before city walls but as no enemy appeared he led his army into city after again exhorting his troops to show discipline roman army received a warm welcome from populace which was favourably impressed by its restraint while belisarius himself took possession of royal palace seated himself on king s throne and consumed dinner which gelimer had confidently ordered to be ready for his own victorious return fleet entered lake of tunis and army was billeted throughout city remaining vandals were rounded up and placed under guard to prevent them from causing trouble belisarius dispatched solomon to constantinople to bear emperor news of victory but expecting an imminent re appearance of gelimer with his army he lost no time in repairing largely ruined walls of city and rendering it capable of sustaining a siege

army at bulla regia by distributing money he had managed to cement loyalty of locals to his cause and sent messages recalling tzazon and his men from sardinia where they had been successful in re establishing vandal authority and killing godas while waiting for tzazon s arrival vandal king s army also increased by arrival of more and more fugitives from battle of ad decimum as well as by a contingent of his moorish allies hughes 2009 p 99 most of moorish tribes of numidia and byzacena however sent embassies to belisarius pledging allegiance to empire some even offered hostages and asked for insignia of office traditionally awarded to them by emperor a gilded silver staff and a silver crown a white cloak a white tunic and a gilded boot belisarius had been furnished by justinian with these items in anticipation of this demand and duly dispatched them along with sums of money nevertheless it was clear that as long as outcome of war remained undecided neither side could count on firm loyalty of moors during this period messengers from tzazon sent to announce his recovery of sardinia sailed into carthage unaware that city had fallen and were taken captive followed shortly after by gelimer s envoys to theudis who had reached spain after news of roman successes had arrived there and hence failed to secure an alliance belisarius was also reinforced by roman general cyril with his contingent who had sailed to sardinia only to find it once again in possession of vandals hughes 2009 pp 98 99 as soon as tzazon received his brother s message he left sardinia and landed in africa joining up with gelimer at bulla vandal king now determined to advance on carthage his intentions were not clear traditional interpretation is that he hoped to reduce city by blockading it but ian hughes believes that lacking reserves for a protracted war of attrition he hoped to force belisarius into a single decisive confrontation approaching city vandal army cut aqueduct supplying it with water and attempted to prevent provisions from arriving in city gelimer also dispatched agents to city to undermine loyalty of inhabitants and imperial army belisarius who was alert to possibility of treachery set an example by impaling a citizen of carthage who intended to join vandals greatest danger of defection came from huns who were disgruntled because they had been ferried to africa against their will and feared being left there as a garrison indeed vandal agents had already made contact with them but belisarius managed to maintain their allegiance at least for moment by making a solemn promise that after final victory they would be richly rewarded and allowed to return to their homes their loyalty however remained suspect and like moors huns probably waited to see who would emerge as victor and rally to him bury 1923 vol ii p 2009 pp 99 100 tricamarum and surrender of gelimer after securing loyalty of populace and army and completing repairs to walls belisarius resolved to meet gelimer in battle and in mid december marched out of carthage in direction of fortified vandal camp at tricamarum some 28 km from carthage as at ad decimum roman cavalry proceeded in advance of infantry and ensuing battle of tricamarum was a purely cavalry affair with belisarius army considerably outnumbered both armies kept their most untrustworthy elements moors and huns in reserve john armenian played most important role on roman side and tzazon on vandal john led repeated charges at vandal centre culminating in death of tzazon this was followed by a general roman attack across front and collapse of vandal army which retreated to its camp gelimer seeing that all was lost fled with a few attendants into wilds of numidia whereupon remaining vandals gave up all thoughts of resistance and abandoned their camp to be plundered by romans bury 1923 vol ii pp 136 2009 pp 100 106 like previous battle at ad decimum it is again notable that belisarius failed to keep his forces together and was forced to fight with a considerable numerical disadvantage dispersal of his army after battle looting and leaving themselves vulnerable to a potential vandal counter attack was also an indication of poor discipline in roman army and command difficulties belisarius faced for a critical consideration of both sides strategy and tactics cf diehl 1896 pp 27 32 hughes 2009 pp 85 89 96 104 106 as bury comments expedition s fate might have been quite different if belisarius had been opposed to a commander of some ability and experience in warfare and points out that procopius himself expresses amazement at issue of war and does not hesitate to regard it not as a feat of superior strategy but as a paradox of fortune bury 1923 vol ii p 137 thumb right 250px drawing

surrendered to roman general who promised that they would be well treated and sent to constantinople in spring belisarius was also fortunate in recovering vandal royal treasure which had been loaded on a ship at hippo bonifatius gelimer s secretary was supposed to sail with it to spain where gelimer too would later follow but adverse winds kept ship in harbour and in end bonifatius handed it over to romans in exchange for his own safety as well as a considerable share of treasure if procopius is to be believed hughes 2009 pp 106 107 belisarius also began to extend his authority over more distant provinces and outposts of vandal kingdom cyril was dispatched to sardinia and corsica with tzazon s head as proof of his victory john was sent to caesarea on coast of mauretania caesariensis

immediately after tricamarum justinian hastened to proclaim recovery of africa emperor was determined to restore province to its former extent and prosperity indeed in words of j b bury he intended to wipe out all traces of vandal conquest as if it had never been and to restore conditions which had existed before coming of geiseric to this end vandals were barred from holding office or even property which was returned to its former owners most vandal males became slaves while victorious roman soldiers took their wives and chalcedonian church was restored to its former position while arian church was dispossessed and persecuted as a result of these measures vandal population was diminished and emasculated it gradually disappeared entirely becoming absorbed into broader provincial population diehl 1896 pp 37 41 already in april 534 before surrender of gelimer old roman provincial division along with full apparatus of roman administration was restored under a praetorian prefect
