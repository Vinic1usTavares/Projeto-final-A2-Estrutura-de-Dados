minded friends from misrata armed forces offered only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged libyans and gaddafi recognized it as a potential instrument of political change under idris libya s armed forces were trained by british military this angered gaddafi who viewed british as imperialists and accordingly he refused to learn english and was rude to british officers ultimately failing his exams british trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour stating their suspicion that he was involved in assassination of military academy s commander in 1963 such reports were ignored and gaddafi quickly progressed through course with a group of loyal cadres in 1964 gaddafi founded central committee of free officers movement a revolutionary group

was increasingly unpopular by latter 1960s it had exacerbated libya s traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising country s federal system to take advantage of country s oil wealth corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout oil industry arab nationalism was increasingly popular and protests flared up following egypt s 1967 defeat in six day war with israel idris administration was seen as pro israeli due to its alliance with western powers anti western riots broke out in tripoli and benghazi while libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with egypt by 1969 u s central intelligence agency was expecting segments of libya s armed forces to launch a coup although claims have been made that they knew of gaddafi s free officers movement they have since claimed ignorance stating that they were instead monitoring abdul aziz s black boots revolutionary group in mid 1969 idris travelled abroad to spend summer in turkey and

coup s bloodless nature it was initially labelled white revolution although was later renamed one september revolution after date on which it occurred gaddafi insisted that free officers coup represented a revolution marking start of widespread change in socio economic and political nature of libya he proclaimed that revolution meant freedom socialism and unity and over coming years implemented measures to achieve this consolidating leadership 1969 1973 12 member central committee of free officers proclaimed themselves revolutionary command council rcc government of new republic lieutenant gaddafi became rcc chairman and therefore de facto head of state also appointing himself to rank of colonel and becoming commander in chief of armed forces jalloud became prime minister

libya used by gaddafi s government from 1969 to 1972 although theoretically a collegial body operating through consensus building gaddafi dominated rcc some of others attempted to constrain what they saw as his excesses gaddafi remained government s public face with identities of other rcc members only being publicly revealed on 10 january 1970 all young men from typically rural working and middle class backgrounds none had university degrees in this way they were distinct from wealthy highly educated conservatives who previously governed country coup completed rcc proceeded with their intentions of consolidating revolutionary government and modernizing country they purged monarchists and members of idris senussi clan from libya s political world and armed forces gaddafi believed this elite were opposed to will of libyan people and had to be expunged people s courts were founded to try various monarchist politicians and journalists many of whom were imprisoned although none executed idris was sentenced to execution in absentia in may 1970 revolutionary intellectuals seminar was held to bring intellectuals in line with revolution while that year s legislative review and amendment united secular and religious law codes introducing sharia into legal system ruling by decree rcc maintained monarchy s ban on political parties in may 1970 banned trade unions and in 1972

gaddafi sits in military uniform in middle surrounded by egyptian president gamal abdel nasser left and syrian president al right rcc s early economic policy has been characterized as being state capitalist in orientation many schemes were established to aid entrepreneurs and develop a libyan bourgeoisie seeking to expand acreage in libya in september 1969 government launched a green revolution to raise agricultural productivity so that libya could rely less on imported food hope was to make libya self sufficient in food production all land that had either been expropriated from italian settlers or which was not in use was expropriated and redistributed irrigation systems were established along northern coastline and around various inland oases production costs often outstripped value of produce and thus libyan agricultural production remained in deficit relying heavily on state subsidies with crude oil as country s primary export gaddafi sought to improve libya s oil sector in october 1969 he proclaimed current trade terms unfair benefiting foreign corporations more than libyan state and by threatening to reduce production in december jalloud successfully increased price of libyan oil in 1970 other opec states followed suit leading to a global increase in price of crude oil rcc followed with tripoli agreement of 20 march 1971 in which they secured income tax back payments and better pricing from oil corporations these measures brought libya an estimated 1 billion in additional revenues in its first year increasing state control over oil sector rcc began a program of nationalization starting with expropriation of british petroleum s share of british petroleum n b hunt sahir field in december 1971 in september 1973 it was announced that all foreign oil producers active in libya were to see 51 of their operation nationalized for gaddafi this was an essential step towards socialism it proved an economic success while gross domestic product had been 3 8 billion in 1969 it had risen to 13 7 billion in 1974 and 24 5 billion in 1979 in turn libyans standard of life greatly improved over first decade of gaddafi s administration and by 1979 average per capita income was at 8 170 up from 40 in 1951 this was above average of many industrialized countries like italy and u k in 1969 government also declared that all foreign owned banks must either close down or convert to joint stock operations thumb left 250px in 1971 egypt s anwar sadat libya s gaddafi and syria s hafez al assad signed an agreement to form a federal union of arab republics agreement never materialized into a federal union between three arab states rcc implemented measures for social reform adopting sharia as a basis consumption of alcohol was banned night clubs and christian churches were shut down traditional libyan dress was encouraged and arabic was decreed as only language permitted in official communications and on road signs rcc doubled minimum wage introduced statutory price controls and implemented compulsory rent reductions of between 30 and 40 gaddafi also wanted to combat strict social restrictions that had been imposed on women by previous regime establishing revolutionary women s formation to encourage reform in 1970 a law was introduced affirming equality of sexes and insisting on wage parity in 1971 gaddafi sponsored creation of a libyan general women s federation in 1972 a law was passed criminalizing marriage of any females under age of sixteen and ensuring that a woman s consent was a necessary prerequisite for a marriage gaddafi s regime opened up a wide range of educational and employment opportunities for women although these primarily benefited a minority in urban middle classes from 1969 to 1973 it used oil money to fund social welfare programs which led to house building projects and improved healthcare and education house building became a major social priority designed to eliminate homelessness and to replace shanty towns created by libya s growing urbanization health sector was also expanded by 1978 libya had 50 more hospitals than it had in 1968 while number of doctors had grown from 700 to over 3000 in that decade malaria was eradicated and and tuberculosis greatly curtailed compulsory education was expanded from 6 to 9 years while adult literacy programs and free university education were introduced beida university was founded while tripoli university and benghazi university were expanded in doing so government helped to integrate poorer strata of libyan society into education system through these measures rcc greatly expanded public sector providing employment for thousands these early social programs proved popular within libya this popularity was partly due to gaddafi s personal charisma youth and underdog status as a bedouin as well as his rhetoric emphasizing his role as successor to anti italian fighter omar mukhtar to combat country s strong regional and tribal divisions rcc promoted idea of a unified pan libyan identity in doing so they tried discrediting tribal leaders as agents of old regime and in august 1971 a sabha military court tried many of them for counter revolutionary activity long standing administrative boundaries were re drawn crossing tribal boundaries while pro revolutionary replaced traditional leaders but communities they served often rejected them realizing failures of gaddafi created arab socialist union asu in june 1971 a mass mobilization vanguard party of which he was president asu recognized rcc as its supreme leading authority and was designed to further revolutionary enthusiasm throughout country it remained heavily bureaucratic and failed to mobilize mass support in way gaddafi had envisioned foreign relations thumb 200px gaddafi left with egyptian president nasser in 1969 nasser privately described gaddafi as a nice boy but terribly naive influence of nasser s arab nationalism over rcc was immediately apparent administration was instantly recognized by neighbouring arab nationalist regimes in egypt syria iraq and sudan with egypt sending experts to aid inexperienced rcc gaddafi propounded pan arab ideas proclaiming need for a single arab state stretching across north africa and middle east in december 1969 libya signed tripoli charter alongside egypt and sudan this established arab revolutionary front a pan national union designed as a first step towards eventual political unification of three nations in 1970 syria declared its intention to join nasser died unexpectedly in november 1970 with gaddafi playing a prominent role at his funeral nasser was succeeded by anwar sadat who suggested that rather than creating a unified state arab states should create a political federation implemented in april 1971 in doing so egypt syria and sudan received large grants of libyan oil money in february 1972 gaddafi and sadat signed an unofficial charter of merger but it was never implemented because relations broke down following year sadat became increasingly wary of libya s radical direction and september 1973 deadline for implementing federation passed by with no action taken after 1969 coup representatives of four powers france united kingdom united states and soviet union were called to meet rcc representatives u k and u s quickly extended diplomatic recognition hoping to secure position of their military bases in libya and fearing further instability hoping to ingratiate themselves with gaddafi in 1970 u s informed him of at least one planned counter coup such attempts to form a working relationship with rcc failed gaddafi was determined to reassert national sovereignty and expunge what he described as foreign colonial and imperialist influences his administration insisted that u s and u k remove their military bases from libya with gaddafi proclaiming that armed forces which rose to express people s revolution will not tolerate living in their shacks while bases of imperialism exist in libyan territory british left in march and americans in june 1970 moving to reduce italian influence in october 1970 all italian owned assets were expropriated and 12 000 strong italian community was expelled from libya alongside smaller community of libyan jews day became a national holiday known as vengeance day italy complained that this was in contravention of 1956 italo libyan treaty although no u n sanctions were forthcoming aiming to reduce nato power in mediterranean in 1971 libya requested that malta cease allowing nato to use its land for a military base in turn offering malta foreign aid compromising malta s government continued allowing nato to use island but only on condition that nato would not use it for launching attacks on arab territory over coming decade gaddafi s government developed stronger political and economic links with dom s maltese administration and under libya s urging malta did not renew u k s airbases on island in 1980 orchestrating a military build up rcc began purchasing weapons from france and soviet union commercial relationship with latter led to an increasingly strained relationship with u s which was then engaged in cold war with soviets thumb left 250px a 1972 anti gaddafist british newsreel including an interview with gaddafi about his support for foreign militants gaddafi was especially critical of u s due to its support of israel and sided with palestinians in israeli palestinian conflict viewing 1948 creation of state of israel as a western colonial occupation forced upon arab world he believed that palestinian violence against israeli and western targets was justified response of an oppressed people who were fighting against colonization of their homeland calling on arab states to wage continuous war against israel in 1970 he initiated a jihad fund to finance anti israeli militants in june 1972 gaddafi created first volunteers centre to train anti israeli guerrillas like nasser gaddafi favoured palestinian leader yasser arafat and his group fatah over more militant and marxist palestinian groups as years progressed however gaddafi s relationship with arafat became strained with gaddafi considering him too moderate and calling for more violent action instead he supported militias like popular front for liberation of palestine popular front for liberation of palestine general command democratic front for liberation of palestine as sa iqa palestinian popular struggle front and abu nidal organization he funded black september organization whose members perpetrated 1972 munich massacre of israeli athletes in west germany and had killed militants bodies flown to libya for a hero s funeral gaddafi financially supported other militant groups across world including black panther party nation of islam 19th of april movement and sandinista national liberation front in nicaragua anc among other liberation movements in fight against apartheid in south africa provisional irish republican army eta action red brigades and red army faction in europe and armenian secret army japanese red army free aceh movement and moro national liberation front in philippines gaddafi was indiscriminate in causes which he funded sometimes switching from supporting one side in a conflict to other as in eritrean war of independence throughout 1970s these groups received financial support from libya which came to be seen as a leader in third world s struggle against colonialism and neocolonialism though many of these groups were labelled terrorists by critics of their activities gaddafi rejected this characterization instead considering them to be revolutionaries who were engaged in liberation struggles popular revolution 1973 1977 thumb right gaddafi with romanian communist leader nicolae ceausescu in bucharest romania 1974 on 16 april 1973 gaddafi proclaimed start of a popular revolution in a speech at zuwarah he initiated this with a 5 point plan first point of which dissolved all existing laws to be replaced by revolutionary enactments second point proclaimed that all opponents of revolution had to be removed while third initiated an administrative revolution that gaddafi proclaimed would remove all traces of bureaucracy and bourgeoisie fourth point announced that population must form people s committees and be armed to defend revolution while fifth proclaimed beginning of a cultural revolution to expunge libya of poisonous foreign influences he began to lecture on this new phase of revolution in libya egypt and france as a process it had many similarities with cultural revolution implemented in china as part of this popular revolution gaddafi invited libya s people to found general people s committees as conduits for raising political consciousness although offering little guidance for how to set up these councils gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of direct political participation that was more democratic than a traditional party based representative system he hoped that councils would mobilise people behind rcc erode power of traditional leaders and bureaucracy and allow for a new legal system chosen by people many such committees were established in schools and colleges where they were responsible for vetting staff courses and textbooks to determine if they were compatible with country s revolutionary ideology people s committees led to a high percentage of public involvement in decision making within limits permitted by rcc but exacerbated tribal divisions they also served as a surveillance system aiding security services in locating individuals with views critical of rcc leading to arrest of ba athists marxists and islamists operating in a pyramid structure base form of these committees were local working groups who sent elected representatives to district level and from there to national level divided between general people s congress and general people s committee above these remained gaddafi and rcc who remained responsible for all major decisions in crossing regional and tribal identities committee system aided national integration and centralization and tightened gaddafi s control over state and administrative apparatus third universal theory and green book thumb right an arabic copy of green book in june 1973 gaddafi created a political ideology as a basis for popular revolution third international theory this approach regarded both u s and soviet union as imperialist and thus rejected western capitalism as well as eastern bloc communism s atheism in this respect it was similar to three worlds theory developed by china s political leader mao zedong as part of this theory gaddafi praised nationalism as a progressive force and advocated creation of a pan arab state which would lead islamic and third worlds against imperialism gaddafi saw islam as having a key role in this ideology calling for an islamic revival that returned to origins of qur an rejecting scholarly interpretations and hadith in doing so he angered many libyan clerics during 1973 and 1974 his government deepened legal reliance on sharia for instance by introducing flogging as punishment for those convicted of adultery or homosexual activity gaddafi summarised third international theory in three short volumes published between 1975 and 1979 collectively known as green book volume one was devoted to issue of democracy outlining flaws of representative systems in favour of direct participatory gpcs second dealt with gaddafi s beliefs regarding socialism while third explored social issues regarding family and tribe while first two volumes advocated radical reform third adopted a socially conservative stance proclaiming that while men and women were equal they were biologically designed for different roles in life during years that followed gaddafists adopted quotes from green book such as representation is fraud as slogans meanwhile in september 1975 gaddafi implemented further measures to increase popular mobilization introducing objectives to improve relationship between councils and asu in 1975 gaddafi s government declared a state monopoly on foreign trade its increasingly radical reforms coupled with large amount of oil revenue being spent on foreign causes generated discontent in libya particularly among country s merchant class in 1974 libya saw its first civilian attack on gaddafi s government when a benghazi army building was bombed much of opposition centred around rcc member omar and with fellow rcc member bashir saghir al he began plotting a coup against gaddafi in 1975 their plot was exposed and pair fled into exile receiving asylum from sadat s egypt in aftermath only five rcc members remained and power was further concentrated in gaddafi s hands this led to rcc s official abolition in march 1977 in september 1975 gaddafi purged army arresting around 200 senior officers and in october he founded clandestine office for security of revolution in april 1976 he called upon his supporters in universities to establish revolutionary student councils and drive out reactionary elements during that year anti gaddafist student demonstrations broke out at universities of tripoli and benghazi resulting in clashes with both gaddafist students and police rcc responded with mass arrests and introduced compulsory national service for young people in january 1977 two dissenting students and a number of army officers were publicly hanged amnesty international condemned it as first time in gaddafist libya that dissenters had been executed for purely political crimes dissent also arose from conservative clerics and muslim brotherhood who accused gaddafi of moving towards marxism and criticized his abolition of private property as being against islamic sunnah these forces were then persecuted as anti revolutionary while all privately owned islamic colleges and universities were shut down foreign relations following anwar sadat s ascension to egyptian presidency libya s relations with egypt deteriorated over coming years two slipped into a state of cold war sadat was perturbed by gaddafi s unpredictability and insistence that egypt required a cultural revolution akin to that being carried out in libya in february 1973 israeli forces shot down libyan arab airlines flight 114 which had strayed from egyptian airspace into israeli held territory during a sandstorm gaddafi was infuriated that egypt had not done more to prevent incident and in retaliation planned to destroy a british ship chartered by american jews to sail to haifa for israel s 25th anniversary gaddafi ordered an egyptian submarine to target ship but sadat cancelled order fearing a military escalation thumb left gaddafi in 1976 with his son saif al islam gaddafi on his lap gaddafi was later infuriated when egypt and syria planned yom kippur war against israel without consulting him and was angered when egypt conceded to peace talks rather than continuing war gaddafi became openly hostile to egypt s leader calling for sadat s overthrow when sudanese president gaafar nimeiry took sadat s side gaddafi also spoke out against him encouraging sudan people s liberation army s attempt to overthrow nimeiry relations with syria also soured over events in lebanese civil war initially both libya and syria had contributed troops to arab league s peacekeeping force although after syrian army attacked lebanese national movement gaddafi openly accused syrian president hafez al assad of national treason he was only arab leader to criticize syria s actions focusing his attention elsewhere in africa in late 1972 and early 1973 libya invaded chad to annex uranium rich strip intent on propagating islam in 1973 gaddafi founded islamic call society which had opened 132 centres across africa within a decade in 1973 he converted gabonese president omar bongo an action which he repeated three years later with jean bedel bokassa president of central african republic between 1973 and 1979 libya provided 500 million in aid to african countries namely to zaire and uganda and founded joint venture companies throughout countries to aid trade and development gaddafi was also keen on reducing israeli influence within africa using financial incentives to successfully convince eight african states to break off diplomatic relations with israel in 1973 a strong relationship was also established between gaddafi s libya and prime minister ali bhutto s pakistani government with two countries exchanging nuclear research and military assistance this relationship ended after bhutto was deposed by muhammad zia ul haq in 1977 gaddafi sought to develop closer links in maghreb in january 1974 libya and tunisia announced a political union arab islamic republic although advocated by gaddafi and tunisian president habib bourguiba move was deeply unpopular in tunisia and it was soon abandoned retaliating gaddafi sponsored anti government militants in tunisia into 1980s turning his attention to algeria in 1975 libya signed messaoud defensive alliance allegedly to counter alleged moroccan expansionism also funding front of western sahara in its independence struggle against morocco seeking to diversify libya s economy gaddafi s government began purchasing shares in

people ruled themselves through 187 basic people s congresses bpcs where all adult libyans participated and voted on national decisions these then sent members to annual general people s congress which was broadcast live on television in principle people s congresses were libya s highest authority with major decisions proposed by government officials or with gaddafi himself requiring consent of people s congresses gaddafi became general secretary of gpc although stepped down from this position in early 1979 and appointed himself leader of revolution thumb left 200px flag of libya 1977 2011 although all political control was officially vested in people s congresses in reality libya s existing political leadership continued to exercise varying degrees of power and influence debate remained limited and major decisions regarding economy and defence were avoided or dealt with cursorily gpc largely remained a rubber stamp for gaddafi s policies on rare occasions gpc opposed gaddafi s suggestions sometimes successfully notably when gaddafi called on primary schools to be abolished believing that homeschooling was healthier for children gpc rejected idea in other instances gaddafi pushed through laws without gpc s support such as when he desired to allow women into armed forces at other times he ordered snap elections when it appeared that gpc would enact laws he opposed gaddafi proclaimed that people s congresses provided for libya s every political need rendering other political organizations unnecessary all non authorized groups including political parties professional associations independent trade unions and women s groups were banned despite these restrictions st john noted that system still introduced a level of representation and participation hitherto unknown in libya with preceding legal institutions abolished gaddafi envisioned jamahiriya as following qur an for legal guidance adopting sharia law he proclaimed man made laws unnatural and dictatorial only permitting allah s law within a year he was backtracking announcing that sharia was inappropriate for jamahiriya because it guaranteed protection of private property contravening green book s socialism his emphasis on placing his own work on a par with qur an led conservative clerics to accuse him of shirk furthering their opposition to his regime in july 1977 a border war broke out with egypt in which egyptians defeated libya despite their technological inferiority conflict lasted one week before both sides agreed to sign a peace treaty that was brokered by several arab states both egypt and sudan had aligned themselves with u s and this pushed libya into a strategic although not political alignment with soviet union in recognition of growing commercial relationship between libya and soviets gaddafi was invited to visit moscow in december 1976 there he entered talks with leonid brezhnev in august 1977 he then visited yugoslavia where he met its leader josip broz tito with whom he had a much warmer relationship revolutionary committees and furthering socialism 1978 1980 in december 1978 gaddafi stepped down as secretary general of gpc announcing his new focus on revolutionary rather than governmental activities this was part of his new emphasis on separating apparatus of revolution from government although no longer in a formal governmental post he adopted title of leader of revolution and continued as commander in chief of armed forces historian dirk vandewalle stated that despite s claims to being a direct democracy libya

fervour they performed ideological surveillance later adopting a significant security role making arrests and putting people on trial according to law of revolution qanun al thawra with no legal code

all women to enlist for training measure was hugely controversial and voted down by gpc in february 1983 gaddafi remained adamant and when it was again voted down by gpc in march 1984 he refused to abide by decision declaring that he who opposes training and emancipation of women is an agent of imperialism whether he likes it or not jamahiriya s radical direction earned government many enemies most internal opposition came from islamic fundamentalists who were inspired by events of 1979 iranian revolution in february 1978 gaddafi discovered that his head of military intelligence was plotting to kill him and began to increasingly entrust security to his tribe many who had seen their wealth and property confiscated turned against administration and a number of western funded opposition groups were founded by exiles most prominent was national front for salvation of libya nfsl founded in 1981 by mohammed magariaf which orchestrated militant attacks against libya s

instance by courting his brother businessman billy carter but in 1979 u s placed libya on its list of state sponsors of terrorism relations were further damaged at end of year when a demonstration torched u s embassy in tripoli in solidarity with perpetrators of iran hostage crisis following year libyan fighters began intercepting u s fighter jets flying over mediterranean signalling collapse of relations between two countries libyan relations with lebanon and shi ite communities across world also deteriorated due to august 1978 disappearance of imam musa al sadr when visiting libya

sadat in 1980 they proposed a political union with libya promising to pay off syria s ps1 billion debt to soviet union although pressures led assad to pull out they remained allies another key ally was uganda and in 1979 gaddafi sent 2 500 troops into uganda to defend regime of president idi amin from tanzanian invaders mission failed 400 libyans were killed and they were forced to retreat

political unity with morocco in august 1984 gaddafi and moroccan monarch hassan ii signed treaty forming arab african union such a union was considered surprising due to strong political differences

2011 major protests broke out against gaddafi s government unlike tunisia or egypt libya was largely religiously homogeneous and had no strong islamist movement but there was widespread dissatisfaction with corruption and entrenched systems of patronage while unemployment had reached around 30 accusing rebels of being drugged and linked to al qaeda gaddafi proclaimed that he would

three of his grandsons in tripoli this western military intervention was criticised by various leftist governments including those that had criticised gaddafi s response to protests because they regarded it as an imperialist attempt to secure control of libya s resources in june icc issued arrest warrants for gaddafi his son saif al islam and his brother in law abdullah senussi head of state security for charges concerning crimes against humanity that month amnesty international published their report finding that while gaddafi s forces were responsible for numerous war crimes many other allegations of mass human rights abuses lacked credible evidence and were likely fabrications by rebel forces that had been promoted by western media in july over 30 governments recognized ntc as legitimate government of libya gaddafi called on his supporters to trample on those recognitions trample on them under your feet they are worthless in august arab league recognized ntc as legitimate

mountains who had long been persecuted as non arabic speakers under gaddafi ntc armies surrounded gaddafi loyalists in several key areas of western libya in august rebels seized zliten and tripoli ending last vestiges of gaddafist power it is probable that without nato air strikes supporting rebels they would not have been able to advance west and gaddafi s forces would have ultimately retaken control of eastern libya capture and death september october 2011 only a few towns in western libya such as bani walid and sirte remained gaddafist strongholds retreating to sirte after tripoli s fall gaddafi announced his willingness to negotiate for a handover to a transitional government a suggestion rejected by ntc surrounding himself with bodyguards he continually moved residences to escape

misrata fleeing to a construction site gaddafi and his inner cohort hid inside drainage pipes while his bodyguards battled rebels in conflict gaddafi suffered head injuries from a grenade blast while defence minister abu bakr yunis jabr was killed misrata militia took gaddafi prisoner causing serious injuries as they tried to apprehend him events were filmed on a mobile phone a video appears to

then placed into an ambulance and taken to misrata upon arrival he was found to be dead official ntc accounts claimed that gaddafi was caught in a cross fire and died from his bullet wounds other eye witness accounts claimed that rebels had fatally shot gaddafi in stomach gaddafi s son mutassim who had also been among convoy was similarly captured and found dead several hours later most probably

severely wounded and tortured for several days one of those who had captured gaddafi 22 year old omran near bani walid in september 2012 who eventually died in france political ideology gaddafi s ideological worldview was moulded by his environment namely his islamic faith his bedouin upbringing and his disgust at actions of european colonialists in libya as a schoolboy gaddafi adopted ideologies of arab nationalism and arab socialism influenced in particular by nasserism thought of egyptian president nasser whom gaddafi regarded as his hero for his part nasser privately described gaddafi as a nice boy but terribly naive during early 1970s gaddafi formulated his own particular approach to arab nationalism and socialism known as third international theory which new york times described as a combination of utopian socialism arab nationalism and third world revolutionary theory that was in vogue at time he regarded this system as a practical alternative to then dominant international models of western capitalism and marxism leninism he laid out principles of this theory in three volumes of green book in which he sought to explain structure of ideal society libyan studies specialist ronald bruce st john regarded arab nationalism as gaddafi s primordial value stating that during early years of his government gaddafi was arab nationalist par excellence gaddafi called for arab world to regain its dignity and assert a major place on world stage blaming arab backwardness on stagnation resulting from ottoman rule european colonialism and imperialism and corrupt and repressive monarchies gaddafi s arab nationalist views led him to pan arabist belief in need for unity across arab world combining arab nation under a single nation state to this end he had proposed a political union with five neighbouring arab states by 1974 although without success in keeping with his views regarding arabs his political stance was described as nativist gaddafi also had international ambitions wanting to export his revolutionary ideas throughout world gaddafi saw his socialist jamahiriyah as a model for arab islamic and non aligned worlds to follow and in his speeches declared that his third international theory would eventually guide entire planet he nevertheless had minimal success in exporting ideology outside of libya along with arab nationalism anti imperialism was also a defining feature of gaddafi s regime during its early years he believed in opposing western imperialism and colonialism in arab world including any western expansionism through form of israel for many years anti zionism was a fundamental component of gaddafi s ideology he believed that state of israel should not exist and that any arab compromise with israeli government was a betrayal of arab people in large part due to their support of israel gaddafi despised united states considering country to be imperialist and lambasting it as embodiment of evil he rallied against jews in many of his speeches with blundy and lycett claiming that his anti semitism was almost his views later shifted in 2009 he stated that jews have been held captive massacred disadvantaged in every possible fashion they want and deserve their homeland he called for both jews and palestinians to move beyond old conflicts and look to a unified future based on shared culture and respect forging a single state that he termed islamic modernism and islamic socialism gaddafi rejected secularist approach to arab nationalism that had been pervasive in syria instead he deemed arabism and islam to be inseparable referring to them as one and indivisible and called on arab world s christian minority to convert to islam he insisted that islamic law should be basis for law of state blurring any distinction between religious and secular realms he desired unity across islamic world and encouraged propagation of faith elsewhere on a 2010 visit to italy he paid a modelling agency to find 200 young italian women for a lecture he gave urging them to convert according to gaddafi biographer jonathan bearman in islamic terms gaddafi was a modernist rather than a fundamentalist for he subordinated religion to political system rather than seeking to state as islamists sought to do he was driven by a sense of divine mission believing himself a conduit of god s will and thought that he must achieve his goals no matter what cost his interpretation of islam was nevertheless idiosyncratic and he clashed with conservative libyan clerics many criticized his attempts to encourage women to enter traditionally male only sectors of society such as armed forces gaddafi was keen to improve women s status although saw sexes as separate but equal and therefore felt women should usually remain in traditional roles gaddafi described his approach to economics as islamic socialism for him a socialist society could be defined as one in which men controlled their own needs either through personal ownership or through a collective although early policies pursued by his government were state capitalist in orientation by 1978 he believed that private ownership of means of production was exploitative and thus he sought to move libya away from capitalism and towards socialism extent to which libya became socialist under gaddafi is disputed bearman suggested that while libya did undergo a profound social revolution he did not think that a socialist society was established in libya conversely st john expressed view that if socialism is defined as a redistribution of wealth and resources a socialist revolution clearly occurred in libya under gaddafi s regime gaddafi was staunchly anti marxist and in 1973 declared that it is duty of every muslim to combat marxism because it promotes atheism in his view ideologies like marxism and zionism were alien to islamic world and were a threat to ummah or global islamic community nevertheless blundy and lycett noted that gaddafi s socialism had a curiously marxist undertone with political scientist sami arguing that gaddafi s model of socialism offered a simplification of karl marx and friedrich engels theories while acknowledging marxist influence on gaddafi s thought bearman stated that libyan leader rejected marxism s core tenet that of class struggle as main engine of social development instead of embracing marxist idea that a socialist society emerged from class struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie gaddafi believed that socialism would be achieved through overturning unnatural capitalism and returning society to its natural equilibrium in this he sought to replace a capitalist economy with one based on his own romanticized ideas of a traditional pre capitalist past this owed much to islamic belief in god s natural law providing order to universe personal life right thumb gaddafi right with nimeiry and nasser in 1969 a very private individual gaddafi was given to rumination and solitude and could be reclusive reporter bianco interviewed gaddafi s father who stated that his son was always serious even taciturn also being courageous intelligent pious and family oriented gaddafi s friends described him to bianco as a loyal and generous man more widely he was often regarded as being bizarre irrational or quixotic bearman noted that gaddafi was emotionally volatile and had an impulsive temperament with cia believing that libyan leader suffered from clinical depression gaddafi described himself as a simple revolutionary and pious muslim called upon by god to continue nasser s work gaddafi was an austere and devout muslim although according to vandewalle his interpretation of islam was deeply personal and idiosyncratic he was also a football enthusiast and enjoyed both playing sport and horse riding as a means of recreation he regarded himself as an intellectual he was a fan of beethoven and said his favourite novels were uncle tom s cabin roots and outsider gaddafi regarded personal appearance as important with blundy and lycett referring to him as extraordinarily vain gaddafi had a large wardrobe and sometimes changed his outfit multiple times a day he favoured either a military uniform or traditional libyan dress tending to eschew western style suits he saw himself as a fashion icon stating whatever i wear becomes a fad i wear a certain shirt and suddenly everyone is wearing it following his ascension to power gaddafi moved into bab al azizia barracks a 6 square kilometre 2 3 sq mi fortified compound located two miles from centre of tripoli his home and office at azizia was a bunker designed by west german engineers while rest of his family lived in a large two story building within compound were also two tennis courts a soccer field several gardens camels and a bedouin tent in which he entertained guests in 1980s his lifestyle was considered modest in comparison to those of many other arab leaders he was preoccupied with his own security regularly changing where he slept and sometimes grounding all other planes in libya when he was flying he made particular requests when travelling to foreign countries during his trips to rome paris madrid moscow and new york city he resided in a bulletproof tent following his bedouin traditions gaddafi was notably confrontational in his approach to foreign powers and generally shunned western ambassadors and diplomats believing them to be spies thumb left gaddafi with spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero in 2010 gaddafi has been described as a womanizer in 1970s and 1980s there were reports of his making sexual advances toward female reporters and members of his entourage starting in 1980s he travelled with his all female amazonian guard who were allegedly sworn to a life of celibacy after gaddafi s death libyan psychologist part of a team investigating sexual offences during civil war stated that five of guards told her they had been raped by gaddafi and senior officials after gaddafi s death french journalist annick cojean published a book alleging that gaddafi had had sexual relations with women some in their early teenage years who had been specially selected for him one of those cojean interviewed a woman named soraya claimed that gaddafi kept her imprisoned in a basement for six years where he repeatedly raped her urinated on her and forced her to watch pornography drink alcohol and snort cocaine gaddafi also hired several ukrainian nurses to care for him one described him as kind and considerate and was surprised that allegations of abuse had been made against him gaddafi married his first wife fatiha al nuri in 1969 she was daughter of general khalid a senior figure in king idris administration and was from a middle class
