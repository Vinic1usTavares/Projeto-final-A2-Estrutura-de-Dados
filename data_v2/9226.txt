battle of neville s cross took place during second war of scottish independence on 17 october 1346 half a mile 800 m to west of durham england an invading scottish army of 12 000 led by king david ii was defeated with heavy loss by an english army of approximately 6 000 7 000 men led by ralph neville lord neville battle was named after an anglo saxon stone cross that stood on hill where scots made their stand after victory neville paid to have a new cross erected to commemorate day battle was result of invasion of france by england during hundred years war king philip vi of france called on scots to fulfil their obligation under terms of auld alliance and invade england david ii obliged and after ravaging much of northern england was taken by surprise by english defenders ensuing battle ended with rout of scots capture of their king and death or capture of most of their leadership strategically this freed significant english resources for war against france and english border counties were able to guard against remaining scottish threat from their own resources eventual ransoming of scottish king resulted in a truce that brought peace to border for forty years background by 1346 england had been embroiled in second war of scottish independence since 1332 and hundred years war with france since 1337 in january 1343 french and english had entered into truce of which included scotland and was intended to last until 29 september 1346 in defiance of truce hostilities continued on all fronts although mostly at a lower level king david ii of scotland led a six day raid into northern england in october 1345 edward iii of england planned an invasion of northern france in 1346 and king philip vi of france sent an appeal to david ii to open a northern front philip vi wanted scots to divert english troops supplies and attention away from army under edward iii which was gathering in southern england auld alliance between france and scotland had been renewed in 1326 and was intended to deter england from attacking either country by threat that other would invade english territory in june philip vi asked david ii to attack pre emptively i beg you i implore you do for me what i would willingly do for you in such a crisis and do it as quickly as you are able edward iii landed in normandy with an army of 15 000 in july philip vi renewed his pleas to david ii as english had also committed troops to gascony brittany and flanders philip vi described northern england to david ii as a defenceless void david ii felt certain that few english troops would be left to defend rich northern english cities but when scots probed into northern england they were sharply rebuffed by local defenders david ii agreed a truce to last until 29 september in order to fully mobilise scottish army which was assembling at perth by time truce expired french had been decisively beaten at crecy and english were besieging calais french were also in difficulty in south west france where their front had collapsed with major city and provincial capital of poitiers from border of english gascony falling on 4 october prelude on 7 october scots invaded england with approximately 12 000 men many had modern weapons and armour supplied by france a small number of french knights marched alongside scots it was described by both scottish and english chroniclers of time and by modern historians as strongest and best equipped scottish expedition for many years border fort of liddell peel was stormed and captured after a siege of three days and garrison massacred carlisle was bypassed in exchange for a large indemnity and scottish army moved east ravaging countryside as they went they sacked hexham abbey taking three days to do so then advanced to durham they arrived outside durham on 16 october and camped at beaurepaire priory where monks offered scots ps1 000 ps as of in protection money to be paid on 18 october invasion had been expected by english for some time two years earlier chancellor of england had told parliament scots were saying quite openly that they will break truce as soon as our adversary france desires and will march into england once scots invaded an army was quickly mobilised at richmond in north yorkshire under supervision of william de la zouche archbishop of york who was lord warden of marches it was not a large army 3 000 4 000 men from northern english counties of cumberland northumberland and lancashire it is known that lancashire contributed 1 200 longbowmen and a small number of lightly armed border cavalry known as hobelars another 3 000 yorkshiremen were en route to reinforce english forces this was possible because edward iii when raising his army to invade france had exempted counties north of river humber on 14 october while scots were sacking hexham abbey archbishop decided not to wait for yorkshire troops and marched north west towards barnard castle and then rapidly north east to durham he was joined en route by yorkshire contingent and lord ralph neville took command of combined force of 6 000 7 000 men battle scots at beaurepaire only discovered english army on morning of 17 october when they were away around 500 men under william douglas stumbled upon them in morning mist during a raid near south of durham two rear divisions of english army drove them off with around 300 scottish casualties douglas raced back to david ii s camp alerting rest of army which stood to arms same morning two benedictine monks arrived from durham in an attempt to broker a peace but david ii thinking they were spies ordered their beheading monks escaped in confusion thumb alt weathered remains of a small stone monument david ii led scottish army to high ground at neville s cross less than half a mile 800 m to west of durham and within sight of durham cathedral where he prepared for battle both scots and english arranged themselves in three formations or battles on scottish side david ii took control of second battle and placed john randolph earl of moray in charge of first battle patrick dunbar earl of march took command of third battle contemporary sources are not consistent but it seems scots formed up in their traditional each battle forming a rectilinear formation front ranks were armed with axes and long spears carried by rear ranks protruded past them knights and other men at arms dismounted and stiffened formations usually at very front a screen of archers skirmished to front and each flank of army was shielded by hobelars and further archers as mist lifted it became clear scots were poorly positioned on broken ground and with their movement made difficult by ditches and walls they remembered their defeats at dupplin moor and halidon hill and so took a defensive stance waiting for english to attack english similarly divided their forces with lord henry percy commanding their first battle neville their second and archbishop of york their third neville remained in overall command english were entirely dismounted with each battle having men at arms in centre and longbowmen on each flank english also took a defensive stance knowing they had superior position and that time was on their side their morale was high resulting stalemate lasted until afternoon when english sent longbowmen forward to harass scottish lines on english left scottish light horse and archers withdrew under arrow fire and english were able to shoot into flank of moray s battle earl of menteith attempted to clear away english archers with a cavalry charge but this failed and he was taken prisoner archers succeeded in provoking scots into attacking moray s battle led assault but broken terrain and obstacles slowed their advance and made it difficult for them to maintain formation longbowmen were able to fall back behind their men at arms by time disorganised battle came to hand to hand combat it was easily dealt with seeing their first attack repulsed and also being harassed by english archers third and largest scottish battle on scottish left under earl of march and robert stewart broke and fled english stood off from remaining scots under david ii and poured in arrows english men at arms then attacked and after fighting described as ferocious scots attempted unsuccessfully to retreat and were routed english men at arms outfought superior numbers of scottish foot while performance of english archers was mixed most of them were participating in their first pitched battle or even their first combat many groups of bowmen conspicuously hung back while lancashire longbowmen received a post battle bonus of ps10 each ps in terms david ii badly wounded was captured after he fled field while rest of scottish army was pursued by english long into night more than 50 scottish barons were killed or captured scotland lost almost all its military leadership scottish dead included constable lord david de la hay marischal robert de keith chamberlain john roxburgh chancellor lord thomas two earls john randolph earl of moray and maurice de moravia earl of strathearn and niall bruce of carrick an illegitimate son of robert bruce an unknown number of scots were taken prisoner it is believed that only scots thought able to pay a ransom were spared others being slain out of hand scottish nobles who were captured included william douglas knight of liddesdale their most skilled guerilla fighter and four earls scottish chroniclers andrew of wyntoun and walter bower both wrote that a thousand scots were killed in battle while chronicle of lanercost said few english were killed modern historians given wilson and have estimated that some 3 000 scotsmen perished and fewer than a hundred were taken prisoner aftermath thumb alt substantial ruins of a medieval castle accounts of time state that after battle david ii was hiding under a bridge over river when his reflection was seen in water by a group of english soldiers david ii was then taken prisoner by john de coupland who was leading detachment and who had his teeth knocked out by king during battle david ii was twice shot in face with arrows surgeons attempted to remove arrows but tip of one remained lodged in his face rendering him prone to headaches for decades edward iii ordered david ii to be handed over to him rewarding coupland with a knighthood and an annuity of ps500 for life ps per year in terms despite having fled without fighting robert stewart was appointed lord guardian to act on david ii s behalf in his absence all scottish captives were ordered to london to disgust of their captors who had a legal right to ransom them a significant number of scottish prisoners were privately ransomed their captors subsequently attempting to deny they had been taken which outraged edward iii edward iii refused to ransom any of those who were passed on to him or release them on parole as was traditional he wished to cripple scottish capacity to make war for as long as possible by depriving them of their leaders in at least some cases he paid considerable sums to their captors to buy out their ransom rights john graham earl of menteith had previously sworn fealty to edward iii who considered him guilty of treason on king s direct orders he was tried condemned and then drawn hanged beheaded and quartered in early 1347 two english forces made large scale raids deep into scotland they met little opposition and devastated much of southern scotland border raids often accompanied by devastation of countryside and sometimes on a large scale continued to be launched by both scots and english battle removed strategic threat to edward iii s rear and by 1349 english border counties were able to guard against remaining scottish threat from their own resources on three separate occasions edward iii offered to release childless david ii for ps40 000 approximately ps in terms if he would accept one of edward iii s sons as his heir to scottish throne all three offers were refused eleven years after battle david ii was released in exchange for a ransom of 100 000 marks approximately ps in terms ransom was to be paid over ten years on 24 june st john baptist s day each year during which an anglo scottish truce prohibited any scottish citizen from bearing arms against edward iii or any of his men this truce lasted for four decades and marked end of second war of scottish independence battle of neville s cross is named after an old anglo saxon stone cross near beaurepaire after victory lord neville paid to have a new cross erected to commemorate day black rood venerated as a piece of true cross and previously belonging to former queen of scotland st margaret was taken from david ii and donated to shrine of st cuthbert in durham cathedral site of battle has
