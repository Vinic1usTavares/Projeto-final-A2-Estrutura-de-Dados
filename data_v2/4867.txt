showing two bloody severed fingers that was banned by motion picture association of america saw ii was immediately green lit after saws successful opening weekend a year earlier producers needed a script for a sequel but james wan and leigh whannell director and writer of saw were working on universal pictures s dead silence music video director darren lynn bousman had just completed a script for his first film desperate and was trying to sell it to studios but was getting reactions that script was very similar to saw a german studio eventually approached him with an offer to produce film for 1 million just as they were looking for a cinematographer american cinematographer david a armstrong who had worked on saw arrived on scene and suggested showing script to saw producer gregg hoffman hoffman read script and called bousman wanting to produce desperate after hoffman showed script to his partners mark burg and oren koules two decided that desperate was starting script they needed for saw ii and two months later bousman was flown to toronto to direct whannell polished script with input from wan in order to bring it into saw universe but kept characters traps and deaths from desperate script bousman said but you could read script for desperate and watch saw ii and you would not be able to draw a comparison wan and whannell also served as executive producers all previous film s crew members returned editor kevin greutert cinematographer armstrong and composer charlie clouser this was to be hoffman s last film he died unexpectedly on december 4 2005 only those key cast and crew members who were involved in film s ending were given full script rest received only first 88 pages if a particular page was rewritten old page was shredded members were also required to sign confidentiality agreements requiring them not to release any plot details reportedly four or five alternate endings were shot in order to keep ending a surprise bousman gave actors freedom to change dialogue in script he said that 95 of time actors went by script with about 5 being adlibs which he said made all of difference in world hoffman said in an interview with fangoria that they listened to fans suggestions for instance instead of only showing aftermath of a character violently dying in a flashback they would allow it to unfold as it happened this was in contrast to saw in which most of violence was implied off screen filming and post production saw ii was given a larger production budget of 4 million compared to saws budget of a little over 1 million marketing budget was an additional 2 million first shot which involved shooting police cars and a swat van driving around industrial docklands outside soundstage was filmed on in toronto after two months of pre production principal photography took place over 25 days at toronto s cinespace film studios from to ending was filmed on may 25 and 26 music and sound was recorded in july and saw ii was locked on it was completely finished by visual effects were performed by c o r e digital pictures and post production services were provided by deluxe trap designs david hackl film s production designer took three weeks to construct 27 sets on a single sound stage puppet billy used in series to give instructions to jigsaw s victims was originally created by wan out of paper towel rolls and papier mache given larger budget for sequel billy was upgraded with remote controlled eyes and a servo driven mouth in one trap needle room smith s character amanda is thrown into a pit of needles to find a key in order for this to be done safely four people over a period of four days removed needle tips from syringes and replaced them with fiber optic tips they modified a total of 120 000 fake needles however this number was insufficient and pit had to be filled with styrofoam and other materials to make it appear to have more needles needles that were apparently stuck into smith were actually blunted syringes stuck into padding under her clothing for certain shots a fake arm was used thumb right saw ii was bousman s first feature film bousman came up with an idea whereby a character s hands would get stuck in some sort of vessel and this resulted in hand trap it proved to be a challenge but after much discussion hackl property master jim murray and art director michele brady came up with a suitable design they arranged a glass box suspended by chains from ceiling which contained a hypodermic needle with antidote and which had two hand holes on underside as soon as vaugier s character addison put her hands into holes razor blades would close in on her hands and any attempt to withdraw from trap would cause her to bleed to death in order for trap to be used safely prop builders made handcuffs move inside box and fake blades that would retract from actress s hands thus allowing her to slide her hands out hackl subsequently commented that character did not have to put her hands into trap as there was a lock with a key on other side box that would have opened contraption original idea for furnace trap came from house having been a crematorium at some point but this would have involved turning house into a funeral parlor so it was instead decided that furnace would be part of house s boiler system furnace was visualized in form of a computer model so that bousman could better understand how shots could be filmed using computer model as a guide furnace was constructed in three days using cement board and tin with removable sides and top so timothy burd obi could be filmed crawling inside furnace produced real flames and in place of burd a stunt man using a fire retardant gel crawled into fire soundtrack saw ii soundtrack was released on october 25 2005 by image

rating average of 4 62 10 site s consensus was saw ii is likely to please gore happy fans of original though it may be too gruesome for those not familiar with first film s premise metacritic which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics gives film a score of 40 based on 28 reviews indicating mixed or average reviews robert koehler of variety gave film a negative review saying cooking up new rube goldberg torture contraptions isn t enough to get saw ii out of shadow of its unnerving predecessor gregory kirschling of entertainment weekly gave film a b minus saying saw ii is just barely a better b flick than saw and that both films are more clever and revolting than they are actually chilling he praised bell s performance as jigsaw saying as droopy lidded maniac in flesh tobin bell is for all film s saw ii horror a terence stamp look alike who calls to mind a seedy general zod lazily overseeing universe from his s lair he ended his review where saw ii lags behind in saw s novelty it takes lead with its smoother landing which is again primed to blow movie wide open but manages a more compelling job of it than original s cheat finish kevin crust of los angeles times gave film a positive review calling saw ii a worthy follow up to its grisly predecessor he said story was much more focused on an endgame than original film there are fewer credibility gaps and there are plenty of reversals to satisfy fans he criticized use of numerous flashbacks saying that it rob s us of pleasure of actually remembering for ourselves laura kern writing for new york times gave it a mixed review saying that bousman delivers similar hard core practically humorless and hair raising tension but only after getting past a shaky beginning that plays more like a forensics themed television show than a scary movie and called greutert s editing crafty she called sequel more trick than treat and that it doesn t really compare to its fine predecessor though it still manages to be eye opening and sometimes positively nauseating in itself empires kim newman gave film three out of five stars he said that film improves upon saw perverse fascination with seven style murders and brutally violent puzzles and that jigsaw s intellectual games make hannibal lecter look like compiler of suns quick crossword he ended his reviews saying morally dubious it may be but this gory melange of torture terror and darkly humorous depravity appeals to sick puppy within us all accolades tobin bell was nominated for best villain at 2006 mtv movie awards for his
