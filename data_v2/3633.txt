crucifix by cimabue at santa croce c 1265 is a wooden crucifix painted in distemper attributed to florentine painter and cimabue one of two large crucifixes attributed to him other is arezzo crucifix see chiellini 8 work was commissioned by franciscan friars of santa croce and is built from a complex arrangement of five main and eight ancillary timber boards it is one of first italian artworks to break from late medieval byzantine style and is renowned for its technical innovations and humanistic iconography gilding and monumentality of cross link it to byzantine tradition christ s static pose is reflective of this style while work overall incorporates newer more naturalistic aspects work presents a lifelike and physically imposing depiction of passion at calvary christ is shown nearly naked his eyes are closed his face lifeless and defeated his body slumps in a position contorted by prolonged agony a graphic portrayal of human suffering painting is of seminal importance in art history and has influenced painters from michelangelo caravaggio and velazquez to francis bacon bacon said you know great cimabue crucifixion i always think of that as a worm crawling down cross sylvester 14 work has been in basilica di santa croce in florence since late thirteenth century and at museo dell opera santa croce since restoration following flooding of arno in 1966 emmerson was in uffizi from 1948 to 1959 and is sometimes referred to as uffizi crucifix see cecchi 65 it remains in poor condition despite conservation efforts commission both of cimabue s surviving crucifixes were commissioned by franciscan order founded by saint francis of assisi their reformist religious and social views had a profound effect on visual arts in century after his death son of a wealthy cloth merchant francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid twenties he venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for beauty of nature byzantine depictions tended to show christ as invincible even in death imagery based on franciscan ideals in thirteenth century generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism infusing paintings with new values of humanism kleinhenz 49 church at santa croce was third that franciscans constructed at site first was begun in 1295 and is where cimabue s crucifix probably hung given its large size above rood screen it was later positioned at north transept in sacristy and by entrance on southern flank jacks 492 description cimabue achieves a masterful handling of colour medieval churches tended to be extremely colourful with frescoed walls painted capitals and gold leaf paintings chiellini 8 pale tonalities dominate with main contrast found in dark areas of christ s hair and beard which are utilised to make features of his face stand out more and position his head as focal point chiellini 15 crucifixion thumb upright 0 9 cimabue s arezzo crucifix c 1268 1271 this is earlier of two extant crucifixes attributed to him compared to earlier works of this type christ s body is more physically corporeal depicted as a real object and his anatomy more closely rendered his hands and feet seem to extend beyond pictorial space which is delineated by flat coloured borders of cross in turn made up of at least six boards both christ s body and his semi circular nimbus are placed at angles which rise outwards and above level of cross farthing 43 his body arches forcing his torso to raise against cross blood pours from wounds in his hands as his head falls to side from fatigue and physical reality of approaching death larson kay survival of greatest new york 27 september 1982 his body is naked except for a sheer and transparent loincloth that only just covers his thighs and buttocks choice of a white veil like loincloth dramatically more modest than red garment in arezzo work may be influenced by earlier crucifixions by giunta pisano gibbs robert cimabue grove art online oxford university press retrieved 30 october 2016 his nakedness highlights his vulnerability and suffering it seems influenced by a thirteenth century franciscan meditation on christ that emphasised pathos and human interest in suffering of passion turn your eyes away from his divinity for a little while and consider him purely as a man thumb left upright 0 9 giunta pisano crucifix tempera on wood 1240s papal basilica of saint mary of angels in assisi his eyes are open and his skin is unblemished cross is painted with deep blue paint perhaps evoking an eternal or timeless sky isaac 2 3 this evocation not present in main crucified figure was known as christus triumphant christ and for contemporary especially franciscan taste lacked verisimilitude as it bore little relation to actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion and overly distanced divine from human aspect of christ thompson 50 from about 1240 painters favoured christus suffering christ style a saviour who shared burden and pain of humanity santa croce crucifix is one of earliest and best known examples of type osborne 245 work surpasses cimabue s c 1268 arezzo crucifix in several ways it is more human and less reliant on idealised facial types paolettii 52 and anatomy is more convincing christ s face is longer and narrower and his nose less idealised these features according to art historian robert gibbs give him a coarser but more personal expression a similar approach is taken with cloth in background of cross itself which although highly ornamented lacks lavish ornamentation of equivalent cloth in arezzo cross his head hangs in exhaustion and his hands bleed from puncture wounds suffered during his nailing to cross his arms are placed higher above his head and strain to carry weight of his body which visibly slumps his body takes on a dramatic almost feminine curve result of contortions forced upon a body nailed to a vertical support paolettii 51 painting contains elements typical of cimabue s representations of christ including illusionism of drapery folds large halo long flowing hair dark angular faces and dramatic expressions bologna 333 but in other respects it conforms to then strict iconography of thirteenth century typical of depictions of crucified christ of this era with his outstretched arms he is as wide as he is long conforming to prevalent ideals of proportions chiellini 11 saints representations of virgin and john evangelist flank christ in small rectangular panels at either end of his outstretched arms both are dark skinned and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads on their hands and face inwards towards christ in keeping with franciscan idea gilding surrounding mourning saints is kept to a minimum size and positions of figures are reduced compared to usual byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on passion of christ hourihane 229 their cloaks are simpler and lack lavish gilding of arezzo crucifixion virgin wears a red dress her robe was originally blue but has darkened messina 45 carpentry crucifix measures 448 cm x 390 cm and consists of five basic physical components a vertical board reaching from base to onto which christ is nailed two horizontal cross arms and two vertical pieces acting as aprons adjacent to central board there are another eight minor pieces mostly terminals bases or framing devices brink 646 structure is reinforced by two full length vertical battens horizontal cross arms extend full width of his outstretched body and are slotted into ridges in vertical supports timber would have been cut and arranged by carpenters before cimabue applied his design and paintwork its dimensions are highly symmetrical and proportionate probably influenced by geometric ideals ratios and rules of design of ancient greeks balance of measurements especially between width and height of cross seem derived from sides and diagonals of squares and dynamic rectangles brink 647 cimabue was not rigid in his placement however and to accommodate sway of christ s body altered positioning of some of boards on lower half brink 651 attribution due to lack of surviving documentation it is difficult to attribute unsigned works from period with any degree of certainty origin of crucifix has often been contested but is generally thought to be by cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both vasari and nicolo albertini magill 272 it is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period hourihane 154 according to vasari crucifix s success led to commissions at pisa tuscany that established his reputation rejecting these views joseph archer crowe and giovanni battista cavalcaselle in 1903 concluded that santa croce crucifix in technical examination makes some approach to florentine master but it is rather of its time than by master himself crowe cavalcaselle 207 1966 damage and restoration thumb upright 0 8 left

and closer to waterline than santa croce church where it was located during earlier floods water level reached height of christ s halo and took large tracts of paint when it retreated water deposited
