british museum hired him in 1944 to work on sutton hoo finds newly removed from their world war ii hiding place in london underground his responsibilities included restoring shield drinking horns and iconic sutton hoo helmet which was publicised widely and proved influential academically and culturally maryon s work much of which was revised in 1970s created credible renderings upon which subsequent research relied one of his papers during this time coined term pattern welding to describe a method employed on sutton hoo sword to strengthen and decorate iron and steel initial work on sutton hoo finds was brought to a close in 1950 and maryon turned to other matters he proposed a widely publicised theory in 1953 on construction of colossus of rhodes influencing salvador dali and

studied from 1896 to 1900 at polytechnic probably regent street slade saint martin s school of art and under tutelage of alexander fisher and william lethaby central school of arts and crafts under fisher in particular maryon learned enamelling maryon further received a one year silversmithing apprenticeship in 1898 at c r ashbee s essex house guild of handicrafts and worked for a period of time in henry wilson s workshop sculpture from 1900 until 1939 maryon held various positions teaching sculpture design and metalwork during this time he created and exhibited many of his own works several of his works were also exhibited before he finished his education at end of 1899 he displayed a silver cup and a shield of arms with silver cloisonne at sixth exhibition of arts and crafts exhibition society an event held at new gallery that also included a work by maryon s sister edith exhibition was reviewed by international studio with his work singled out as agreeable keswick school of industrial art 1900 04 in march 1900 maryon became first director of keswick school of industrial art school had been opened by edith and hardwicke rawnsley in 1884 amid emergence of arts and crafts movement it offered classes in drawing design woodcarving and metalwork and melded commercial with artistic purposes school sold items such as trays frames tables and clock cases and developed a reputation for quality already by may a reviewer for studio of an exhibition at royal albert hall commented that a group of silver tableware by school was a welcome departure towards finer craftsmanship two of maryon s designs she wrote were singularly good a knocker executed by jeremiah richardson and a copper casket made by thomas spark and ornamented by thomas clark and designer she described casket s lock as enamelled in pearly blue and white and giving a dainty touch of colour to a form almost bare of ornament but beautiful in its proportions and lines under maryon s leadership keswick school expanded breadth and range of its designs and he executed several significant commissions his best works wrote one historian of school drew their inspiration from nature of material and his deep understanding of its technical limits they also tended to be in metal items like bryony a tray centre showing tangled growth concealed within a geometric framework continued school s tradition of repousse work of naturalistic interpretations of flowers while evoking vine like wallpapers of william morris these themes were particularly expressed in a 1901 plaque memorialising bernard gilpin unveiled in st cuthbert s church described by art historian sir nikolaus pevsner as arts and crafts almost art nouveau bronze tablet on oak is framed by trees with entwined roots and influenced by a norse and celtic aesthetic three other commissions in silver a loving cup a processional cross and a challenge shield were featured in studio and its international counterpart cup was commissioned by cumberland county council for presentation to and was termed a tour de force particularly in more utilitarian works maryon s designs at keswick school tended to emphasise form over design as he would write a decade later o ver insistence on technique craftsmanship which proclaims how clever am i quite naturally elbows out artistic feeling one idea must be principal one and if that happens to be technique other goes design should be determined by intention he wrote as an objet or as an object for use hot water jugs tea pots sugar bowls and other tableware that maryon designed were frequently raised from a single sheet of metal retaining hammer marks and a dull lustre many of these were exhibited at 1902 home arts and industries exhibition along with an altar cross designed by maryon for hexham abbey and were praised for showing a remarkably good year s work in finer kinds of craft and decoration at following year s exhibition manchester school of art purchased a copper jug he designed for its arts and crafts museum maryon s four year tenure at keswick was assisted by four designers who also taught drawing g m collinson isobel mcbean maude m and dorothea carpenter he also had help of his sisters edith maryon designed at least one work for school a 1901 relief plaque of hardwicke rawnsley while mildred maryon who 1901 census listed as living with her sister worked for a time as an at school both herbert and mildred maryon worked on an oxidised silver and enamel casket that was presented to princess louise upon her 1902 visit to keswick school herbert maryon was responsible for design and his sister for enamelling with resulting work being termed of a character highly creditable to school by magazine of art strife with colleagues eventually led to maryon s departure already in july 1901 collinson had left due to a poor working relationship maryon was also frequently in conflict with school s management committee which was chaired by edith rawnsley and frequently made decisions without his knowledge when in august 1904 carpenter in friction with maryon tendered her resignation committee decided to give maryon three months notice maryon left school at end of december 1904 he spent 1905 as a teacher of metalwork at storey institute in lancaster that october he also published his first article early irish metal work in art

gold and silversmiths work and their allied crafts was published in 1912 maryon described it as eschewing artistic or historical point of view in favor of an essentially practical and technical standpoint book focused on individual techniques such as soldering enamelling and stone setting rather than methods of creating works such as cups and brooches book was well received as a vade mecum for both students and practitioners of metalworking burlington magazine for connoisseurs wrote that maryon succeeds in every page in not only maintaining his own enthusiasm but what is better in communicating it and athenaeum declared that his critical notes on design are excellent one of these republished in jewelers circular in 1922 was a critique of celebrated sixteenth century goldsmith cellini maryon termed him one of very greatest craftsmen of sixteenth century but a very poor artist a dispassionate appraisal that led one time secretary of metropolitan museum of art to label maryon not only dean of ancient metalwork but also a discerning critic metalwork and enamelling went through four further editions in 1923 1954 1959 and posthumously in 1971 and as of 2019 is still in print by dover publications as late as 1993 a senior conservator at canadian conservation institute wrote that book has not been equalled during world war i maryon worked at reading with another instructor charles albert sadler to create a centre to train munition workers in machine tool work maryon began this work in 1915 officially as organising secretary and instructor at ministry of munitions training centre with no engineering school to build from by 1918 centre had five staff members could accommodate 25 workers at a time and had trained more than 400 based on this work maryon was elected to institution of mechanical engineers on 6 march 1918 maryon exhibited a child s bowl with signs of zodiac at ninth arts and crafts exhibition society exhibition in 1910 and following war like his friend w g collingwood who also taught at reading he designed several memorials he designed east war memorial and mortimer war memorial unveiled in 1920 and 1921 respectively three years

armstrong college then part of durham university where he stayed until 1939 at durham he was both master of sculpture and lecturer in anatomy and history of sculpture while there he published his second book modern sculpture its methods and ideals maryon wrote that his aim was to discuss modern sculpture from point of view of sculptors themselves rather than from an archaeological or biographical perspective book received mixed reviews maryon s decision to treat criticism as secondary to intent meant grouping together artworks of unequal quality some critics attacked his taste with new statesman and nation claiming that he can enjoy almost anything and among his 350 odd illustrations there are certainly some camels to swallow bookman that all bad sculptors will be found in mr maryon s book most of good sculptors are here as well even henry moore but all are equal in mr maryon s eye and spectator that few good works which have found their way into 356 plates look lost and unhappy maryon responded with explanations of his purpose saying that i do not admire all results and i say so and to one review in particular that i believe that sculptors of world have a wider knowledge of what constitutes sculpture than your reviewer realizes other reviews praised maryon s academic approach times stated that his book is remarkable for its extraordinary catholicity admitting works which we should find it hard to defend with works of great merit yet added that by a system of grouping however according to some primarily aesthetic aim their inclusion is justified manchester guardian praised maryon for a degree of natural good sense in his observations that cannot always be said to characterise current art criticism and stated that his critical judgments are often penetrating at durham as at reading maryon was commissioned to create works of art these included at least two plaques memorialising george stephenson and sir charles parsons in addition to an undated plaque to henry ayrton chaplin maryon also sculpted statue of industry for 1929 north east coast exhibition a world s fair held at newcastle upon tyne depicting a woman with cherubs at her feet statue was described by maryon as represent ing industry as we know it in north east one who has passed through hard times and is now ready to face future strong and statue was subject of adverse criticism reported manchester guardian on night of 25 october several hundred students of armstrong college tarred and feathered statue and were dispersed only with arrival of 80 police officers thumb alt colour photograph of a gold ornament discovered in one of kirkhaugh cairns one of gold ornaments from kirkhaugh cairns maryon s time at armstrong coincided with an interest in archaeology by early 1930s he was conducting excavations and frequently brought students to dig along hadrian s wall in 1935 he published two articles on bronze age swords and at end of year excavated kirkhaugh cairns two bronze age graves at kirkhaugh northumberland one of cairns was nearly 4500 year old grave of a metalworker like grave of amesbury archer and contained one of oldest gold ornaments yet found in united kingdom a matching ornament was found during a re excavation in 2014 maryon s account of excavation was published in 1936 and subsequent papers on archaeology and prehistoric metalworking followed in 1937 he published an article in antiquity clarifying a passage by ancient greek historian diodorus siculus on how egyptians carved sculptures in 1938 he wrote in both proceedings of royal irish academy and antiquaries journal on metalworking during bronze and iron ages and in 1939 he wrote articles about an ancient hand anvil discovered in and gold ornaments found in alnwick maryon retired from armstrong college by then known as king s college in 1939 when he was 64 or 65 he spent world war ii years from 1939 to 1943 engaged in munition work in 1941 he also published a two part article on archaeology and metallurgy part i on welding and soldering and part ii on metallurgy of gold and platinum in pre columbian ecuador in man british museum 1944 61 on 11 november 1944 maryon was recruited out of retirement by trustees of british museum to serve as a technical attache maryon working under harold plenderleith s leadership was tasked with conservation and reconstruction of material from sutton hoo ship burial an excavation in which he had previously expressed interest as early as 1941 he wrote a prescient letter about preservation of ship impression to t d kendrick museum s keeper of british and medieval antiquities nearly four years after his letter in dying days of world war ii and finds removed or about to be removed from safekeeping in aldwych tube station he was assigned what rupert bruce mitford who succeeded kendrick s post in 1954 termed real headaches notably crushed shield helmet and drinking horns composed in large part of iron wood and horn these items had decayed in 1 300 years since their burial and left only fragments behind helmet for one had corroded and then smashed into more than 500 pieces painstaking work needing keen observation and patience these efforts occupied several years of maryon s career much of his work has seen subsequent revision but as bruce mitford wrote afterwards by carrying out initial cleaning sorting and mounting of mass of fragmentary and fragile material he preserved it and in working out his reconstructions he made explicit problems posed and laid foundations upon which fresh appraisals and progress could be based when fuller archaeological study became possible maryon s restorations were aided by his deep practical understandings of objects he was working on causing a senior conservator at canadian conservation institute in 1993 to label maryon o ne of finest exemplars of a conservator whose wide understanding of structure and function of museum objects exceeds that gained by curator or historian in more classical studies of artefacts maryon was admitted as a fellow of society of antiquaries in 1949 and in 1956 his sutton hoo work led to his appointment as an officer of order of british empire asked by queen elizabeth ii what he did as she awarded him medal maryon responded well ma am i am a sort of back room boy at british museum maryon continued restoration work at british museum including on oriental antiquities and roman emesa helmet before retiring for a second time at age of 87 sutton hoo helmet thumb alt black and white photograph of valsgarde 6 helmet valsgarde 6 helmet was one of few published exemplar helmets at time of maryon s reconstruction from 1945 to 1946 maryon spent six continuous months reconstructing sutton hoo helmet helmet was only second anglo saxon example then known benty grange helmet being first and was most elaborate its importance had not been realized during excavation however and no photographs of it were taken in situ bruce mitford likened maryon s task to a jigsaw puzzle without any sort of picture on lid of box and as it proved a great many of pieces missing maryon had to base his reconstruction exclusively on information provided by surviving fragments guided by archaeological knowledge of other helmets maryon began reconstruction by familiarising himself with fragments tracing and detailing each on a piece of card after what he termed a long while he sculpted a head out of plaster and expanded it outwards to simulate padded space between helmet and head on this he initially affixed fragments with plasticine placing thicker pieces into spaces cut into head finally fragments were permanently affixed with white plaster mixed with brown umber this was also used to fill in between areas fragments of cheek guards neck guard and visor were placed onto shaped plaster covered wire mesh then affixed with more plaster and joined to cap maryon published finished reconstruction in a 1947 issue of antiquity maryon s work was celebrated and both academically and culturally influential helmet stayed on display for over 20 years with photographs making their way into television programmes newspapers and every book on anglo saxon art and archaeology in 1951 a young larry burrows was dispatched to british museum by life which subsequently published a full page photograph of helmet alongside a photo of maryon over succeeding quarter century conservation techniques advanced knowledge of contemporaneous helmets grew and more helmet fragments were discovered during 1965 69 re excavation of sutton hoo accordingly inaccuracies in maryon s reconstruction notably its diminished size gaps in afforded protection and lack of a moveable neck guard became apparent in 1971 a second reconstruction was completed following eighteen months work by nigel williams yet as bruce mitford wrote m uch of maryon s work is valid general character of helmet was made plain it was only because there was a first restoration that could be constructively criticized noted conservation scholar chris caple that there was impetus and improved ideas available for a second restoration similarly minor errors in second reconstruction were discovered while forging 1973 royal armouries replica in executing a first reconstruction that was reversible and retained evidence by being only lightly cleaned maryon s true contribution to sutton hoo helmet was in creating a credible first rendering that allowed for critical examination leading to second current reconstruction

most significantly 3 a statue composed of many hammered bronze plates maryon s work on sutton hoo finds carried him to 1950 at which point plenderleith decided that work had been finished to extent possible and that space in research laboratory was needed for other purposes maryon continued working at museum until 1961 turning his attention to other matters this included some travel in 1953 or 1954 he visited toronto lecturing on sutton hoo before a large audience at royal ontario museum and in 1957 or 1958 he paid a visit to at american school of classical studies at athens in 1955 maryon restored another helmet for british museum roman emesa helmet had been found in modern day city of homs in 1936 and underwent several failed restorations before being brought to museum last resort in these things according to maryon restoration was published following year by plenderleith around that time maryon and plenderleith also collaborated on several other works in 1954 they wrote a chapter on metalwork for history of technology series and in 1959 they co authored a paper on cleaning of westminster abbey s royal bronze effigies publications in addition to his two books metalwork and enamelling and modern sculpture maryon authored chapters in volumes one and two of charles singer s a history of technology series he also wrote some thirty archaeological and technical papers several of maryon s earlier papers described his restorations of shield and helmet from sutton hoo burial while a 1948 paper introduced term pattern welding to describe a method employed on sutton hoo sword and others of strengthening and decorating iron and steel by welding into them twisted strips of metal in 1953 and 1954 a talk and paper on colossus of rhodes received international attention for suggesting that statue was hollow and aside harbor rather than astride it made of hammered bronze plates less than a sixteenth of an inch thick he suggested it would have been supported by a tripod structure comprising two legs and a hanging piece of drapery although great ideas neither proved to be truly convincing in 1957 d e l haynes then keeper of greek and roman antiquities at british museum suggested that maryon s theory of hammered bronze plates relied on an errant translation of a primary source maryon s view was nevertheless influential likely shaping salvador dali s 1954

and at end of 1961 he left for fremantle australia arriving on 1 january 1962 in perth he visited a brother he had not seen in 60 years from australia maryon departed for san francisco arriving on 15 february much of his north american tour was done with buses and cheap hotels for as a colleague would recall maryon liked to travel hard way like an undergraduate which was to be expected since at 89 he was a young man maryon devoted much of his time during american stage of his trip to visiting museums and study of chinese magic mirrors a subject he had turned to some two years before by time he reached kansas city missouri where he was written up in kansas city times he had listed 526 examples in his notebook his trip also included guest lectures such as his talk metal working in ancient world at massachusetts institute of technology on 2 may 1962 and when he came to new york city a colleague later said that he wore out several much younger colleagues with an unusually long stint devoted to a meticulous examination of two large collections of pre columbian fine metalwork a field that was new to him maryon scheduled trip to end in toronto where his son john maryon a civil
