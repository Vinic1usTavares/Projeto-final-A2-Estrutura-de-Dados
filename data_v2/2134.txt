grade i listed building and part of a heritage site that also includes former monastic buildings to north which are also listed grade i cathedral typical of english cathedrals in having been modified many times dates from between 1093 and early 16th century although site itself may have been used for christian worship since roman times all major styles of english medieval architecture from norman to perpendicular are represented in present building cathedral and former monastic buildings were extensively restored during 19th century amidst some controversy and a free standing bell tower was added in 20th century in addition to holding services for christian worship buildings are a major tourist attraction in chester and cathedral is used as a venue for concerts and exhibitions history city of chester was an important roman stronghold there may have been a christian basilica on site of present cathedral in late roman era while chester was controlled by legio xx valeria victrix legend holds that basilica was dedicated to saint paul and saint peter this is supported by evidence that in saxon times dedication of an early chapel on this site was changed from saint peter to saint werburgh during early middle ages barloc of norbury a catholic celtic saint and hermit barloc of norbury in oxford dictionary of saints was venerated at chester cathedral with a feast day on 10 september he is known to history mainly through hagiography of manuscript stowe ms 944 british library he also occurs in a litany in ms tanner 169 of bodleian library oxford barloc at answers com in 907 chester was refortified against threat from vikings and shortly afterwards minster was founded or refounded and werburgh s remains were transferred there from hanbury probably by aethelflaed lady of mercians collegiate church as it was then was restored in 1057 by leofric earl of mercia and lady godiva this church was razed to ground around 1090 with secular canons evicted and no known trace of it remains in 1093 a benedictine abbey was established on site by hugh lupus earl of chester with assistance of st anselm and other monks from bec in normandy earliest surviving parts of structure date from that time abbey church was not at that time cathedral of chester from 1075 to 1082 cathedral of diocese was nearby church of st john baptist after which see was transferred to coventry in 1538 during dissolution of monasteries monastery was disbanded and shrine of saint werburgh was desecrated in 1541 st werburgh s abbey became a cathedral of church of england by order of henry viii at same time dedication was changed to christ and blessed virgin last abbot of st werburgh s abbey thomas clarke became first dean of new cathedral at head of a secular chapter although little trace of 10th century church has been discovered save possibly some saxon masonry found during a 1997 excavation of nave there is much evidence of monastery of 1093 this work in norman style may be seen in northwest tower north transept and in remaining parts of monastic buildings abbey church beginning with lady chapel at eastern end was extensively rebuilt in gothic style during 13th and 14th centuries at time of dissolution of monasteries cloister central tower a new south transept large west window and a new entrance porch to south had just been built in perpendicular style and southwest tower of facade had been begun west front was given a tudor entrance but tower was never completed in 1636 space beneath south west tower became a bishop s consistory court it was furnished as such at that time and is now a unique survival in england hearing its last case that of an attempted suicide of a priest in 1930s until 1881 south transept which is unusually large also took on a separate function as an independent ecclesiastical entity parish church of st oswald although 17th century saw additions to furnishings and fittings there was no further building work for several centuries by 19th century building was badly in need of restoration present homogeneous appearance that cathedral presents from many exterior angles is largely work of victorian restorers particularly george gilbert scott 20th century has seen continued maintenance and restoration in 1922 chester war memorial was installed in cathedral grounds and dedicated to fallen soldiers of first world war and later second world war in 1973 75 a detached belfry addleshaw tower designed by george pace was erected in grounds of cathedral in 2005 a new song school was added to cathedral during 2000s cathedral library was refurbished and relocated it was officially reopened in september 2007 cathedral and former monastic buildings were designated as grade i listed buildings on 28 july 1955 architecture cathedral plan chester cathedral has an east west axis common to many cathedrals with chancel at eastern end and facade to west plan is cruciform with a central tower as is usual in english monastic churches but is asymmetrical having a small transept on north side remaining from an earlier building and an unusually large south transept as plan shows asymmetry extends to west front where north tower remains from norman building and south tower is of early 16th century at eastern end symmetrical arrangement of aisles was lost when end of south aisle was demolished and rebuilt in an apsidal shape nave choir and south transept have wide aisles on either side and are lit by clerestory windows and large multi light windows in each of three cliff like ends to north of cathedral are monastic buildings including cloister refectory and a rectangular chapter house facade of building is abutted on north by later buildings 700px 1 west door 2 south tower consistory court 3 north tower 4 nave 5

is built of new red sandstone in this case keuper sandstone from cheshire basin stone lends itself to detailed carving but is also friable easily eroded by rain and wind and is badly affected by pollution with other red sandstone buildings chester is one of most heavily restored of england s cathedrals restoration which included much refacing and many new details took place mainly in 19th century because south transept is similar in dimension to nave and choir views of building from south east and south west give impression of a building balanced around a central axis with its tower as hub tower is of late 15th century perpendicular style but its four large battlemented turrets are work of restoration architect george gilbert scott with its rhythmic arrangement of large traceried windows pinnacles battlements and buttresses exterior of chester cathedral from south presents a fairly homogeneous character which is an unusual feature as england s cathedrals are in general noted for their stylistic diversity close examination reveals window tracery of several building stages from 13th to early 16th century richness of 13th century tracery is accentuated by presence of ornate drip mouldings around windows those around perpendicular windows are of simpler form facade of cathedral is dominated by a large deeply recessed eight light window in perpendicular style above a recessed doorway set in a screen like porch designed probably by seth and george derwall in early 1500s this porch formed part of same late 15th century building programme as south transept central and southwest towers and cloister neither of west towers was completed to north is lower stage of a norman tower while to south is lower stage of a tower designed and begun probably by seth and george derwall in 1508 but left incomplete following dissolution of monastery in 1538 cathedral s facade is abutted on north by a victorian building housing education centre and largely obscured from view by building previously used as king s school which is now a branch of barclays bank door of west front is not used as normal entrance to cathedral which is through southwest porch which is in an ornate tudor style interior interior of chester cathedral gives a warm and mellow appearance because of pinkish colour of sandstone proportions appear spacious because view from west end of nave to east end is unimpeded by a pulpitum and nave although not long is both wide and high compared with many of england s cathedrals piers of nave and choir are widely spaced those of nave carrying only clerestory of large windows with no triforium gallery proportions are made possible partly because ornate stellar vault like that at york minster is of wood not stone norman remnants present building dating from around 1283 to 1537 mostly replaced earlier monastic church founded in 1093 which was built in norman style it is believed that newer church was built around older one that few remaining parts of norman church are of small proportions while height and width of gothic church are generous would seem to confirm this belief aspects of design of norman interior are still visible in north transept which retains wall arcading and a broadly moulded arch leading to sacristy which was formerly a chapel transept has retained an early 16th century coffered ceiling with decorated bosses two of which are carved with arms of henry viii and cardinal wolsey north west tower is also of norman construction it serves as baptistry and houses a black marble font consisting of a bowl on a large baluster dating from 1697 lower part of north wall of nave is also from norman building but can only be viewed from cloister because interior has been decorated with mosaic early english early english gothic chapter house built between 1230 and 1265 is rectangular and opens off a charming vestibule leading from north transept chapter house has grouped windows of simple untraceried form alec clifton taylor describes exterior of this building as a modest but rather elegant example of composition in lancets while nikolaus pevsner says of interior it is a wonderfully noble room which is aesthetic climax of cathedral to north of chapter house is slype also early english in style and warming room which contains two large former fireplaces monastic refectory to north of cloister is of about same date as chapter house lady chapel to eastern end of choir dates from between 1265 and 1290 it is of three bays and contains shrine of st werburgh dating from 14th century vault of lady chapel is only one in cathedral that is of stone it is decorated with carved roof bosses representing trinity madonna and child and murder of thomas becket chapel also has a sedilia and a piscina decorated gothic thumb upright 1 5 building of nave begun in 1323 was halted by plague and completed 150 years later choir of five bays was built between 1283 and 1315 to design of richard and is an early example of decorated gothic architecture piers have strongly modelled attached shafts supporting deeply moulded arches there is a triforium gallery with four cusped arches to each bay vault which is a 19th century restoration is supported by clusters of three shafts which spring from energetic figurative corbels overall effect is robust and contrasts with delicacy of pinnacled choir stalls tracery of windows and rich decoration of vault which was carried out by ecclesiastical designers clayton and bell choir stalls dating from about 1380 are one of glories of cathedral aisles of choir previously both extended on either side of lady chapel south aisle was shortened in about 1870 by george gilbert scott and given an apsidal east end becoming chapel of st erasmus eastern end of north aisle contains chapel of st werburgh nave of six bays and large aisled south transept were begun in about 1323 probably to design of nicholas de there are a number of windows containing fine flowing decorated tracery of this period work ceased in 1375 in which year there was a severe outbreak of plague in england building of nave was recommenced in 1485 more than 150 years after it was begun architect was probably william remarkably for an english medieval architect he maintained original form changing only details nave was roofed with a stellar vault rather like that of lady chapel at ely and choir at york minster both of which date from 1370s like that at york vault is of wood imitating stone perpendicular gothic from about 1493 until 1525 architect appears to have been seth derwall succeeded by george derwall until 1537 seth derwall completed south transept to a perpendicular gothic design as seen in transomed windows of clerestory he also built central tower southwest porch and cloisters work commenced on south west tower in 1508 but it had not risen above roofline at time of dissolution of monasteries and has never been completed central tower rising to is a lantern tower with large windows letting light into crossing its external appearance has been altered by addition of four battlemented turrets by george gilbert scott in 19th century thumb left upright 1 25 cloister garth and refectory former monastic buildings perpendicular gothic cloister is entered from cathedral through a norman doorway in north aisle cloister is part of building programme that commenced in 1490s and is probably work of seth derwall south wall of cloister dating from later part of norman period forms north wall of nave of cathedral and includes blind arcading among earliest remaining structures on site is an undercroft off west range of cloisters which dates from early 12th century and which was originally used by monks for storing food it consists of two naves with groin vaults and short round piers with round scalloped capitals leading from south of undercroft is abbot s passage which dates from around 1150 and consists of two bays with rib vaulting above abbot s passage approached by a stairway from west cloister is st anselm s chapel which also dates from 12th century it is in three bays and has a 19th century gothic style plaster vault chancel is in one bay and was remodelled in early 17th century screen altar rails holy table and plaster ceiling of chancel date from 17th century north range of cloister gives access to a refectory built by simon de whitchurch in 13th century it contains an early english pulpit approached by a staircase with an ascending arcade only other similar pulpit in england is in beaulieu abbey restoration by 19th century fabric of building had become badly weathered with charles hiatt writing that surface rot of very perishable red sandstone of which cathedral was built was positively unsightly and that whole place previous to restoration struck one as and neglected it perpetually seemed to hover on verge of collapse and yet was without a trace of romance of average ruin between 1818 and 1820 architect thomas harrison restored south transept adding corner turrets this part of building served until 1881 as parish church of st oswald and it was ecclesiastically separate from 1844 r c hussey carried out a limited restoration including work on south side of nave most extensive restoration was carried out by gothic revival architect george gilbert scott who between 1868 and 1876 almost entirely re cased cathedral current building is acknowledged to be mainly product of this victorian restoration commissioned by dean john saul howson in addition to extensive additions and alterations to body of church scott remodelled tower adding turrets and crenellations scott chose sandstone from quarries at runcorn for his restoration work in addition to restoration of fabric of building scott designed internal fittings such as choir screen to replace those destroyed during civil war he built fan vault of south porch renewed wooden vault of choir and added a great many decorative features to interior scott s restorations were not without their critics and caused much debate in architectural circles scott claimed to have archaeological evidence for his work but liverpool architect samuel huggins argued in an 1868 address to liverpool architectural society that alterations were less like restoration and more like rebuilding one of larger changes was to shorten south aisle and it as an apse changes also proposed addition of a spire above existing tower but this proposal was later rejected samuel s further paper of 1871 entitled on so called restorations of our cathedral and abbey churches compelled dean to attempt to answer criticism debate contributed to establishment of society for protection of ancient buildings later in century from 1882 arthur blomfield and his son charles made further additions and modifications including restoring and reinstating shrine of st werburgh more work was carried out in 20th century by giles gilbert scott between 1891 and 1913 and by f h crossley in 1939 bell tower towards end of 1963 cathedral bells which were housed in central tower were in need of an overhaul and ringing was suspended in 1965 dean asked george pace architect to york minster to prepare specifications for a new bell frame and for electrification of clock and tolling mechanism due to structural difficulties and cost of replacing bells in central tower it was advised that consideration should be given to building a detached bell and clock tower in southeast corner of churchyard it was decided to proceed with that plan and in 1969 an announcement was made that first detached cathedral bell tower was to be erected since building of campanile at chichester cathedral in 15th century in february 1969 nine of ten bells in central tower were removed to be recast by john taylor co as a ring of twelve bells with a flat sixth new bells were cast in 1973 work on new bell tower began in february 1973 two old bells dating from 1606 and 1626 were left in

variety of subjects some humorous and some grotesque pevsner states that they are one of finest sets in country while alec clifton taylor calls them exquisite and says of misericords that for delicacy and grace they surpass even those at lincoln and beverley organ in 1844 an organ by gray davison of london was installed in cathedral replacing an instrument with parts dating back to 1626 organ was rebuilt and enlarged by whiteley bros of chester in 1876 to include harmonic flutes and reeds by cavaille coll it was later moved to its present position at front of north transept in 1910 william
