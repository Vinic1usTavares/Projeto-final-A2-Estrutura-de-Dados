161 he was son of attalus and his wife antiochis attalus won an important victory over galatians newly arrived celtic tribes from thrace who had been for more than a generation plundering and exacting tribute throughout most of asia minor without any serious check this victory celebrated by triumphal monument at pergamon famous for its dying gaul and liberation from gallic terror which it represented earned for attalus name of soter and title of king a courageous and capable general and loyal ally of rome he played a significant role in first and second macedonian wars waged against philip v of macedon he conducted numerous naval operations harassing macedonian interests throughout aegean winning honors collecting spoils and gaining for pergamon possession of greek islands of aegina during first war and andros during second twice narrowly escaping capture at hands of philip attalus was a protector of greek cities of p 314 attalus was both a strong protector of greek cities of anatolia and an opportunist in trying to expand pergamum s territory and power and viewed himself as champion of greeks against barbarians bradford p 121 attalus commissioned a series of sculptures that depicted defeat of gauls and glorified himself as champion of greeks against barbarians wilson p 593 by means of lavish sculpted dedications attalus depicted his victories as important achievements and himself as champion of greek freedom against a renewed barbarian threat during his reign he established pergamon as a considerable power in greek east bradford p 121 attalus established pergamum as a power in greek east but it was to reach its greatest power and prosperity by its alliance with rome he died in 197 bc shortly before end of second war at age of 72 having

by eumenes i incumbent dynast attalus mother antiochis was related to seleucid royal family being a granddaughter of seleucus i nicator with her marriage to attalus father likely arranged by philetaerus to solidify his power this would be consistent with conjecture that attalus father had been philetaerus heir designate but was succeeded by eumenes since attalus i was too young when his father died hansen pp 27 28 defeat of galatians thumb dying gaul representing defeat of galatians by attalus according to 2nd century ad greek writer pausanias greatest of his achievements was defeat of gauls pausanias 1 8 1 pausanias was referring to galatians immigrant celts from thrace who had recently settled in galatia in central asia minor and whom romans and greeks called gauls associating them with celts of what is now france switzerland and northern italy since time of philetaerus first attalid ruler galatians had posed a problem for pergamon indeed for all of asia minor by exacting tributes to avoid war or other repercussions eumenes i had probably along with other rulers dealt with galatians by paying these tributes attalus however refused to pay them being first such ruler to do so livy 38 16 hansen pp 28 31 as a consequence galatians set out to attack pergamon attalus met them near sources of river p 31 an inscription from gaul monument located in athena sanctuary on

information on attalus war with galatians see mitchell p 21 and won a decisive victory after which following example of antiochus i attalus took name of soter which means savior and claimed title of king hansen p 31 mitchell p 21 victory brought attalus legendary fame a story arose related by pausanias of an oracle who had foretold these events a generation earlier pausanias 10 15 3 then verily having crossed narrow strait of hellespont devastating host of gauls shall pipe and they shall ravage asia and much worse shall god do to those who dwell by shores of sea for a short while for right soon son of cronos shall raise a helper dear son of a bull reared by zeus who on all gauls shall bring a day of destruction pausanias adds that by son of a bull oracle meant attalus king of pergamon who was styled bull horned on acropolis of pergamon was erected a triumphal monument which included famous sculpture dying gaul commemorating this battle pollitt p 85 conquests in seleucid asia minor several years after first victory over gauls pergamon was again attacked by gauls together with their ally antiochus younger brother of seleucus ii callinicus and ruler of seleucid asia minor from his capital at sardis attalus defeated gauls and antiochus at battle of and again at a second battle in east subsequent battles were fought and won against antiochus alone in hellespontine phrygia where antiochus was perhaps seeking refuge with his father in law king of bithynia near sardis in spring of 228 bc and in final battle of campaign further south in caria on banks of a tributary of maeander hansen pp 34 35 green p 264 265 as a result of these victories attalus gained control over all of seleucid asia minor north of taurus mountains polybius 4 48 hansen p 36 kosmetatou p 162 green p 264 he was able to hold on to these gains in face of repeated attempts by seleucus iii eldest son and successor of seleucus ii to recover lost territory culminating in seleucus iii himself crossing taurus only to be assassinated by members of his army in 223 bc hansen p 36 green p 265 achaeus who had accompanied seleucus iii assumed control of army he was offered and refused kingship in favor of

philip from aiding hannibal having been achieved in 206 bc aetolians sued for peace on conditions imposed by philip a treaty was drawn up at phoenice in 205 bc formally ending first macedonian war attalus was included as an on side of rome he retained aegina but had accomplished little else since prusias was also included in treaty war between attalus and prusias must also have ended by that

league allies of macedon had had a change in leadership which favored rome with hope of inducing achaeans to abandon philip and join allies envoys were sent including attalus himself to sicyon where they offered incorporation of corinth into achaean league attalus apparently so impressed that they erected a colossal statue of him in their market place and instituted sacrifices in his honor a meeting of league was convened and after a heated debate and withdrawal of some of delegates rest agreed to join alliance attalus led his army from cenchreae now controlled by allies through isthmus and attacked corinth from north controlling access to corinthian port on gulf of corinth romans attacked from east controlling approaches to cenchreae with achaeans attacking from west controlling

45 hurwit p 271 apollonis was thought to be a model of motherly love paton p 149 polybius describes apollonis as a woman who for many reasons deserves to be remembered and with honor her claims upon a favourable recollection are that though born of a private family she became a queen and retained that exalted rank to end of her life not by use of meretricious fascinations but by virtue and integrity of her conduct in private and public life alike above all she was mother of four sons with whom she kept on terms of most perfect affection and motherly love to last day of her life polybius 22 20 filial affection of brothers as well as their upbringing is remarked on by several ancient sources a decree of antiochus iv praises king attalus and queen apollonis because of their virtue and goodness which they preserved for their sons managing their education in this way wisely and well hansen p 45 an inscription at pergamon represents apollonis as saying that she always considered
