thumb right 300px route of m11 link road overlaid over an older map of area with key protest sites marked m11 link road protest was a major anti road protest in east london england in early to mid 1990s opposing construction of a12 hackney to m11 link road also known as m11 link road link road was part of a significant local road scheme to connect traffic from east cross route a12 in hackney wick to m11 via leyton leytonstone wanstead and redbridge roundabout avoiding urban streets road had been proposed since 1960s as part of london ringways and was an important link between central london and docklands to east anglia however road protests elsewhere had become increasingly visible and urban road building had fallen out of favour with public a local member of parliament harry cohen representing leyton had been a vocal opponent of this scheme protests reached a new level of visibility during 1993 as part of a grassroots campaign where protesters came from outside area to support local opposition to road initial focus was on removal of a tree on george green east of wanstead that attracted attention of local then national media activity peaked in 1994 with several high profile protesters setting up micronations on property scheduled for demolition most notably on claremont road in leyton final stage of protest was a single building on fillebrook road in leytonstone which due to a security blunder became occupied by squatters road was eventually built as planned and opened to traffic in 1999 but increased costs involved in management and policing of protesters raised profile of such campaigns in united kingdom and contributed to several road schemes being cancelled or reviewed later on in decade those involved in protest moved on to oppose other schemes in country while opinions of road as built have since been mixed by 2014 road had become ninth most congested in entire country background origin of link road stems from what were two major arterial roads out of london a11 to newmarket and norwich and a12 to colchester ipswich and great yarmouth and subsequent improvements first of these was eastern avenue improvement that opened on 9 june 1924 which provided a bypass of old road through ilford and romford proposals for route first arose in 1960s as part of london ringways plan which would have seen four concentric circular motorways built in city together with radial routes with m11 motorway ending on ringway 1 innermost ringway at hackney marsh thumb left planned london ringways a section of ringway 1 known as east cross route was built to motorway standards in late 1960s and early 1970s and designated as a102 m a section of m11 connecting ringway 2 now part of north circular road and eastern avenue to harlow was completed in late 1970s opening to traffic in 1977 ringways scheme met considerable opposition there were protests when westway an urban motorway elevated over streets of paddington was opened in 1970 with local mp john wheeler later describing road s presence within 15 metres of properties as completely unacceptable environmentally and archway road public inquiry was repeatedly abandoned during 1970s as a result of protests by 1974 greater london council announced it would not be completing ringway 1 first link road action group to resist m11 link road was formed in 1976 and for next fifteen years activists fought government plans through a series of public inquiries their alternative was to build a road tunnel leaving houses untouched but this was rejected on grounds of cost drivers travelling in areas where new roads would have been built had to continue using long stretches of urban single carriageway roads in particular suburbs of leyton leytonstone and wanstead suffered serious traffic congestion roads for prosperity white paper published in 1989 detailed a major expansion of road building programme and included plans for m12 motorway between london and chelmsford as well as many other road schemes although harry cohen mp for leyton suggested in may 1989 that government should scrap scheme a public enquiry was held for scheme in november protest campaign in east london by 1980s planning blight had affected area and many of houses had become home to a community of artists and squatters eventually contractors were appointed to carry out work and a compulsory purchase of property along proposed route was undertaken in march 1993 in preparation for construction of road earl of caithness then minister of state for transport estimated that there would be 263 properties scheduled for demolition displacing 550 people of which he estimated 172 were seeking rehousing several original residents who had in some cases lived in their homes all their lives refused to sell or move out of their properties protesters from local area against link road scheme were joined by large numbers of anti road campaigners from around uk and beyond attracted by availability of free housing along route these experienced protesters who had participated in earlier events such as anti nazi league riots in welling gave impetus to campaign new arrivals used skills they had developed during prior protests to construct defences blocking original entrances to houses and creating new routes directly between them sophisticated techniques were used to delay construction of road sit ins and site invasions were combined with sabotage to stop construction work temporarily this led to large numbers of police and constant security patrols being employed to protect construction sites at great expense by december 1994 total cost of construction had been estimated at ps6 million and rising by ps500 000 every month protesters were successful in publicising campaign with most uk newspapers and tv news programmes covering protests on a regular basis desktop publishing then in its infancy was used to produce publicity materials for campaign and send out faxes to media when government began evicting residents along route and demolishing empty houses protesters set up so called autonomous republics such as wanstonia in some groups of houses extreme methods were used to force engineers to halt demolition including tunnels with protesters secured within by concrete chestnut tree on george green right thumb chestnut tree on george green wanstead became a focal point and a symbol for anti m11 link road protesters a chestnut tree later capitalized and given a definite article suddenly became focus for protesters and increasing numbers of locals protection of chestnut tree came quickly to symbolize what was under threat from road until late 1993 local opposition to m11 extension had been relatively limited while opposition had been going for nearly ten years institutional avenues of protest had been exhausted and local residents were largely resigned to road being built when outside protesters arrived in september 1993 few residents saw their mission as their campaign one section of m11 extension was due to tunnel under george green in wanstead residents had believed that this would save their green and a 250 year old sweet chestnut tree that grew upon it but because this was a cut and cover tunnel this required tree to be cut down support for protests started to extend to local community when jean gosling a lollipop lady in wanstead upon learning of tree s impending destruction rallied support of local children and was later fired from her job for doing so while wearing her uniform who in turn recruited their parents into protests it was then that non resident radicals realised that they had significant local support when local residents gathered for a tree dressing ceremony on 6 november they found their way barred by security fencing with support from protesters they pulled it down protesters continued to delay destruction of tree solicitors for campaign had even argued in court that receipt of a letter addressed to tree itself gave it status of a legal dwelling causing a further delay in early morning of 7 december 1993 several hundred police arrived to evict protesters which took ten hours to carry out protesters made numerous complaints against police police were accused of widespread brutality in evicting protesters forty nine complaints against police were recorded by protesters note that drury 2000 gives a figure of fifty seven police in turn denied these allegations attributing any misbehaviour to protesters media attention started to increase regarding protest with several daily newspapers putting pictures of tree on their front pages harry cohen mp for leyton started to become critical of scheme and its progress in march 1994 he said department of transport s pig headed approach to m11 link road has been a shambles and a costly one at that and described ongoing police presence as a miniature equivalent of iraqi occupation of kuwait according to him local resident hugh jones had been threatened by demolition men wielding sledgehammers and pickaxes adding project has cost ps500 000 in police time alone to take over and demolish a 250 year old chestnut tree and half a dozen houses claremont road thumb right upright view from tower in claremont road leyton by 1994 properties scheduled for demolition had been compulsory purchased and most were made uninhabitable by removing kitchens bathrooms and staircases notable exception was in one small street claremont road which ran immediately next to central line and consequently required every property on it to be demolished street was almost completely occupied by protesters except for one original resident who had not taken up department for transport s offer to move 92 year old dolly watson who was born in number 32 and had lived there nearly all her life she became friends with anti road protesters saying they re not dirty hippy squatters they re grandchildren i never had protesters named a watchtower built from scaffold poles after her a vibrant and harmonious community sprung up on road which even won begrudging respect of authorities houses were painted with extravagant designs both internally and externally and sculptures erected in road road became an artistic spectacle that one said had to be seen to be believed in november 1994 eviction of claremont road took place bringing an end to m11 link road resistance as a major physical protest bailiffs accompanied by police in full riot gear carried out eviction over several days and central line running adjacent to road was suspended as soon as eviction was completed remaining properties were demolished in end cost to taxpayer was over a million pounds in police costs alone quoting david maclean i understand from commissioner of police of metropolis that cost of policing protest in order to allow bailiffs to take possession of premises in claremont road was ps1 014 060 cohen complained in parliament about police brutality stating were not many of my constituents bullied including vulnerable people and others whose only crime was living on line of route then secretary of state for transport brian mawhinney pointed out that there had already been three public enquiries at which protesters could have lodged their objections against line of route towards end thumb left upright munstonia as pictured in an earth first leaflet following claremont road eviction non resident protesters moved on to other sites such as newbury meanwhile fillebrook road near leytonstone underground station had already had several houses demolished on it due to problems with vandalism by 1995 only house left standing was number 135 house was originally scheduled for demolition at same time as others but had been left standing in order to give tenant additional time to relocate after they had done so on 11 april 1995 department for transport removed water supply and part of roof and left two security guards on duty when guards decided to sleep overnight in their cars that evening leaving house unoccupied protesters moved in house was renamed munstonia after munsters thanks to its spooky appearance like wanstonia they proclaimed themselves a micro nation and designed their own national anthem and flag though author joe moran mentions their legitimacy was complicated by protesters continuing to claim unemployment benefits from mother country thumb right eviction on fillebrook road leytonstone in june 1995 a tower was built out of remains of roof similar to one that had existed at claremont road and a system of defences and blockades were built a core of around 30 protesters ensured that there were always people staying there a legal requirement for a squatted home as well as a defence against eviction they were finally evicted on 21 june 1995 whereupon as at claremont road building was immediately demolished total cost of removing protesters from munstonia was given to be ps239 349 52 not including additional costs of security guards construction of road already underway by this stage was then free to continue largely unhindered although systematic sabotage of building sites by local people continued it was completed in 1999 and given designation a12 its continuation former a102 m was also given this number as far as blackwall tunnel official opening of road in october 1999 took place without fanfare being opened by highways agency chief executive rather than a politician with only journalists with passes being admitted to ceremony consequences of protest campaign m11 link road protest was ultimately unsuccessful in its aim to stop building of link road total cost of compensation for project was estimated to be around ps15 million proposals for m12 motorway were cancelled in 1994 during first review of trunk road programme most significant response from government occurred when labour came into office following 1997 general election with announcement of new deal for trunk roads in england this proposal cancelled many previous road schemes including construction of m65 over pennines increased fuel prices and ensured that road projects would only be undertaken when genuinely necessary stating there will be no presumption in favour of new road building as an answer some protesters went on to join direct action campaign reclaim streets a protester arrested and detained on grounds of breach of peace unsuccessfully challenged uk government s legislation at european court of justice in 2002 in response to a major new road building programme and expansion of aviation a delegation of road protest veterans visited department for transport to warn of renewed direct action in response delivering a d lock as a symbol of past protests one such
