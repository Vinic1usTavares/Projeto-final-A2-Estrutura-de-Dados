reviews from several critics stacey plaisance of associated press commented that tour was another strong step in right direction and that spears delivered a tightly choreographed if perfunctory performance ann powers of los angeles times stated despite that first night stumble and several numbers in which her dancing was no more than adequate spears can safely call this performance a success jon caramanica of new york times said that show was less a concert than a las vegas style revue of intimidating complexity throughout though she spoke little ms spears appeared radiant and unfettered often smiling and never uncommitted dixie reid of sacramento bee commented that show was a mesmerizingly big production with entertaining videos including infamous spears madonna kiss confetti sparklers and even a stilt walker who could ask for more everyone seemed to have a good time at circus neil mccormick of daily telegraph said spears is queen of production line pop and reclaims that diamante crown with most perfectly plastic pop show ever staged people writer chuck arnold wrote that spears never really hit her old stride there was a lot more strutting than real choreographic feats from her jeff montgomery of mtv both praised and dismissed spears s performance saying yes welcome to britney s circus a big huge loud funny nonsensical three ring affair she looks great in her myriad of outfits and she can still move with best of them it s just well she s almost lost in sheer hugeness of production around her jane stevenson of toronto sun gave spears s performance three out of five stars stating there was so much was going on there were also martial artists bicyclists etc there was no time to really assess spears other than to note that she looked great she could lip synch words one can assume and strut around stage well enough but there was little in way of genuine passion joy or excitement on her part hollywood reporters craig rosen claimed that in end britney and company delivered an entertaining spectacle but one couldn t help but wish that she would strip it all down and show a little more of herself sean daly of st petersburg times summed up all reviews by stating when britney touring behind her new circus album plays times forum there will be as many people rooting for her success as her failure but in end we re all envious and thankful jealous and

debacle of 2008 summer olympics opening ceremony judge further explained her position saying let s be clear live means live if you are spending up to 200 i think you deserve better than a film clip tour director steve dixon defended spears claiming this is a pop spectacular this is a showband show you come for experience there is a lot to see about this show there s nothing like this in world britney spears will entertain you that s what people come for we absolutely give them a show after opening night in perth advertiser writer rebekah devlin reported that a number of fans had walked out of show they were apparently disappointed and outraged regarding spears s lip syncing and subdued dancing australian tour promoter paul dainty talked about situation saying it s biggest lie i ve ever heard i m so angry we can take heat if there s something wrong and people can review shows badly that s something you have to live with but to say people stormed out of show was an absolute fabrication britney is aware of all this and she s extremely upset by it she s a human being i m embarrassed with such a big international entourage here with britney to be part of australian media when i see that kind of totally inaccurate reporting it s been all over internet for nine months inference is that we tried to hide this it s been opposite this show is about an incredible spectacle which it is spears s manager adam leber responded in his twitter account saying it s unfortunate that one journalist in perth didn t enjoy show last night fortunately other 18 272 fans in attendance did spears s official website also posted a list of positive reviews from a number of fans burswood dome also issued a reading last night s concert friday saw record crowds turn out for her first performance in perth and from burswood s perspective event was a huge success early media reports that hundreds of fans left concert early cannot be substantiated and burswood has received no complaints about concert finally spears addressed situation according to bbc online she was quoted as saying i hear there is a lot of controversy in media about my show some reporters have said they love it and some don t i came to australia for my fans negative media attention continued after her show in melbourne when it was alleged that fans had placed tickets for remaining australian shows on sale on online shopping website ebay for as little as 99 cents however dainty said that holders of tickets were not spears s fans stating they re just profiteers they buy tickets for 200 and think they sic that when concerts sell out they will offload them for 500 broadcast and recordings during tour there were many speculations that shows in las vegas on september 26 27 2009 would be recorded
