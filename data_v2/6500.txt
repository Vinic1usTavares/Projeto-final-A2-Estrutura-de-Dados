waterbuck kobus ellipsiprymnus is a large antelope found widely in sub saharan africa it is placed in genus kobus of family bovidae it was first described by irish naturalist william ogilby in 1833 thirteen subspecies are grouped under two varieties common or waterbuck and defassa waterbuck head and body length is typically between and average height is between a sexually dimorphic antelope males are taller as well as heavier than females males reach approximately at shoulder while females reach males typically weigh and females coat colour varies from brown to grey long spiral horns present only on males curve backward then forward and are long waterbuck are rather sedentary in nature a gregarious animal waterbuck may form herds consisting of six to 30 individuals these groups are either nursery herds with females and their offspring or bachelor herds males start showing territorial behaviour from age of five years but are most dominant from age of six to nine waterbuck cannot tolerate dehydration in hot weather and thus inhabits areas close to sources of water predominantly a grazer waterbuck is mostly found on grassland in equatorial regions breeding takes place throughout year but births are at their peak in rainy season gestational period lasts for seven to eight months followed by birth of a single calf waterbuck inhabit scrub and savanna areas along rivers lakes and valleys due to their requirement for grasslands as well as water waterbuck have a sparse ecotone distribution iucn lists waterbuck as being of least concern more specifically common waterbuck is listed as of least concern while defassa waterbuck is near threatened population trend for both common and defassa waterbuck is downwards especially that of latter with large populations being eliminated from certain habitats because of poaching and human disturbance taxonomy and etymology scientific name of waterbuck is kobus ellipsiprymnus waterbuck is one of six species of genus kobus and belongs to family bovidae it was first described by irish naturalist william ogilby in 1833 generic name kobus is a new latin word originating from an african name koba specific name ellipsiprymnus refers to white elliptical ring on rump from greek ellipse and hind part animal acquired vernacular name waterbuck due to its heavy dependence on water as compared to other antelopes and its ability to enter into water for defence type specimen of waterbuck was collected by south african hunter explorer andrew steedman in 1832 this specimen was named antilope ellipsiprymnus by ogilby in 1833 this species was transferred to genus kobus in 1840 becoming k ellipsiprymnus it is usually known as common waterbuck in 1835 german naturalist eduard ruppell collected another specimen which differed from steedman s specimen in having a prominent white ring on its rump considering it a separate species ruppell gave it amharic name defassa waterbuck and scientific name antilope defassa modern taxonomists however consider common waterbuck and defassa waterbuck a single species k ellipsiprymnus given large number of instances of hybridisation between two interbreeding between two takes place in nairobi national park owing to extensive overlapping of habitats evolution not many fossils of waterbuck have been found fossils were scarce in cradle of humankind occurring only in a few pockets of on basis of valerius geist s theories about relation of social evolution and dispersal in ungulates during pleistocene ancestral home of waterbuck is considered to be eastern coast of africa with horn of africa to north and east african rift valley to west subspecies 37 subspecies of had been initially recognised on basis of coat colour they were classified into two groups ellipsen waterbuck group and defassa waterbuck group owing to large number of variations in coat colour in defassa waterbuck group as many as 29 subspecies were included in it ellipsen waterbuck group consisted of eight subspecies in 1971 however number of subspecies was reduced to thirteen four for ellipsen waterbuck group and nine for defassa waterbuck group though they occur in zambia as well their ranges are separated by relief features or by muchinga escarpment subspecies have been listed below along with notes about former subspecies which were recombined into a single subspecies k e

around 8 percent longer head and body length is typically between and average height is between males reach approximately at shoulder while females reach waterbuck is one of heaviest antelopes a newborn typically weighs and growth in weight is faster in males than in females males typically weigh and females tail is long waterbuck is of a robust build shaggy coat is reddish brown to grey and becomes progressively darker with age males are darker than females though apparently thick hair is sparse on coat hair on neck is however long and shaggy when sexually excited skin of waterbuck secretes a greasy substance with odour of musk giving it name greasy kob odor of this is so unpleasant that it repels predators this secretion also assists in water proofing body when animal dives into water facial features include a white muzzle and light eyebrows and lighter insides of ears there is a cream coloured patch called bib on throat waterbuck are characterised by a long neck and short strong and black legs females have two nipples preorbital glands foot glands and inguinal glands are absent common waterbuck and defassa waterbuck are remarkably different in their physical appearances measurements indicate greater tail length in latter whereas common waterbuck stand taller than defassa waterbuck however principal differentiation between two types is white ring of hair surrounding tail on rump which is a hollow circle in common waterbuck but covered with white hair in defassa waterbuck long spiral horns curve backward then forward found only on males horns range from in length to some extent length of horns is related to bull s age a rudimentary horn in form of a bone lump may be found on skulls of females ecology and behaviour 250px thumbnail a female herd in national park kenya waterbuck are rather sedentary in nature though some migration may occur with onset of monsoon a gregarious animal waterbuck may form herds consisting of six to 30 individuals various groups are nursery herds bachelor herds and territorial males herd size increases in summer whereas groups fragment in winter months probably under influence of food availability as soon as young males start developing horns at around seven to nine months of age they are chased out of herd by territorial bulls these males then form bachelor herds and may roam in female home ranges females have home ranges stretching over a few females may form spinster herds though females are seldom aggressive minor tension may arise in herds males start showing territorial behaviour from age of five years but are most dominant from age of six to nine territorial males hold territories in size males are inclined to remain settled in their territories though over time they may leave inferior territories for more spacious ones marking of territories includes no elaborate rituals dung and urine are occasionally dropped after age of ten years males lose their territorial nature and replaced by a younger bull following which they recede to a small and unprotected area there is another social group that of satellite males which are mature bulls as yet without their own territories who exploit resources particularly mating opportunities even in presence of dominant bull territorial male may allow a few satellite males into his territory and they may contribute to its defence however gradually they may deprive actual owner of his territory and seize area for themselves in a study in lake nakuru national park only 7 percent of adult males held territories and only half of territorial males tolerated one or more satellite males territorial males may use several kinds of display in one type of display white patch on throat and between eyes is clearly revealed and other displays can demonstrate thickness of neck these activities frighten trespassers lowering of head and body depict submission before territorial male who stands erect fights which may last up to thirty minutes involve threat displays typical of bovids accompanied by snorting fights may even become so violent that one of opponents meets its death due to severe abdominal or thoracic wounds a silent animal waterbuck makes use of flehmen response for visual communication and alarm snorts for vocal communication waterbuck often enter water to escape from predators which include lions leopards cheetahs african wild dogs and nile crocodiles leopards and spotted hyenas prey on juveniles however it has been observed that waterbuck does not particularly like being in water waterbuck may run into cover when alarmed and males often attack predators diseases and parasites waterbuck are susceptible to ulcers infection and kidney stones other diseases from which these animals suffer are foot and mouth disease fever yellow fever bluetongue bovine virus diarrhoea brucellosis and anthrax waterbuck is more resistant to rinderpest than are other antelopes they are unaffected by tsetse flies but ticks may introduce parasitic protozoa such as parva and 27 species of ixodid tick have been found on waterbuck a healthy waterbuck may carry a total of over 4000 ticks in their larval or nymphal stages most common among them being amblyomma cohaerens and rhipicephalus internal parasites found in waterbuck include tapeworms and several helminths diet thumbnail waterbuck is predominantly a grazer waterbuck exhibits great dependence on water it can not tolerate dehydration in hot weather and thus inhabits areas close to sources of water however it has been observed that unlike other members of its genus such as kob and waterbuck ranges farther into woodlands while maintaining its proximity to water with grasses constituting a substantial 70 to 95 percent of diet waterbuck is predominantly a grazer frequenting grasslands reeds and rushes like typha and phragmites may also be preferred a study found regular consumption of three grass species round year panicum echinochloa and andropogon gayanus acroceras and oryza barthii along with annual species were main preference in early rainy season while long life grasses and forage from trees constituted three fourths of diet in dry season though defassa waterbuck were found to have a much greater requirement for protein than african buffalo and oryx waterbuck was found to spend much less time on browsing eating leaves small shoots and fruits in comparison to other grazers in dry season about 32 percent of 24 hour day was spent in browsing whereas no time was spent on it during wet season choice of grasses varies with location rather than availability for instance in western uganda while pyramidalis was favoured in some places themeda triandra was main choice elsewhere common waterbuck and defassa waterbuck in same area may differ in their choices it has been observed that while former preferred heteropogon contortus and cynodon dactylon latter showed less preference for these grasses reproduction thumbnail a female waterbuck with her young waterbuck are slower than other antelopes in terms of rate of maturity while males become sexually mature at age of six years females reach maturity within two to three years females may conceive by age of two and a half years and remain reproductive for another ten years in equatorial regions breeding takes place throughout year and births are at their peak in rainy season however breeding is seasonal in sudan south of sahara with mating season lasting four months season extends for even longer periods in some areas of southern africa oestrus lasts for a day or less mating begins after male confirms that female is in oestrus which he does by sniffing her vulva and urine a resistive female would try to bite or even fight off an advancing male male exhibits flehmen and often licks neck of female and rubs his face and base of his horns against her back there are several attempts at mounting before actual copulation female shifts her tail to one side while male clasps her sides with his forelegs and rests on her back during copulation which may occur as many as ten times gestational period lasts for seven to eight months followed by birth of a single calf twins are rare pregnant females isolate themselves in thickets as parturition approaches newborn calves can stand on their feet within a half hour of birth mother eats afterbirth she communicates with calf by bleating or snorting calves are kept hidden from two to three weeks up to two months at about three to four weeks calf begins following its mother who signals it to do so by raising her tail though bereft of horns mothers will fiercely defend their offspring from predators calves are weaned at eight months following which time they join groups of calves of their own age young females remain with their mothers in nursery herds or may also join bachelor herds waterbuck lives to 18 years in wild and 30 years in captivity distribution and habitat thumbnail waterbuck inhabit grasslands close to water waterbuck is native to southern and eastern africa including countries such as angola botswana democratic republic of congo ethiopia kenya namibia south africa tanzania and uganda besides a few countries of western and northern africa such as chad cote d ivoire ghana mali niger nigeria and senegal though formerly widespread in sub saharan africa its numbers have now decreased in most areas common waterbuck is found east of eastern african rift its southern range extends to hluhluwe umfolozi game reserve kwazulu natal and to central namibia by contrast defassa waterbuck inhabits western and central africa defassa waterbuck occurs west of albertine rift and ranges from eritrea to guinea bissau in southern sahel its most northerly point of distribution being in southern mali its range also stretches east of congo basin through zambia into angola while another branch extends to zaire river west of congo basin while common waterbuck is now extinct in ethiopia defassa waterbuck has become extinct in gambia waterbuck inhabit scrub and savanna areas alongside rivers lakes and valleys due to their requirement for grasslands as well as water waterbuck have a sparse distribution across areas of interface between two different ecosystems a study in range showed that mean density of waterbuck was 5 5 per square mile and estimates in maasai mara were as low as 1 3 per square mile it has been observed that territorial size depends on quality of habitat age and health of animal and population density greater age of animal or denser populations smaller are territories in queen elizabeth national park females had home ranges in area whereas home ranges for bachelor males averaged between oldest female around 18 years old had smallest home range threats and conservation international union for conservation of nature and natural resources iucn lists waterbuck as of least concern lc more specifically common waterbuck is listed as of least concern while defassa waterbuck is near threatened nt population trend for both common and defassa waterbuck is decreasing especially that of latter with large populations being eliminated from their habitats due to poaching and human settlement their own sedentary nature too is responsible for this to some extent numbers have fallen in queen elizabeth national park murchison falls national park akagera national park lake nakuru national park and comoe national park population decrease in lake nakuru national park has been attributed to heavy metal poisoning while cadmium and lead levels were dangerously high in kidney and liver deficiencies of copper calcium and phosphorus were noted over 60 percent of defassa waterbuck populations thrive in protected areas most
