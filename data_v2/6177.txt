operation iskra a soviet military operation in january 1943 during world war ii aimed to break wehrmacht s siege of leningrad planning for operation began shortly after failure of sinyavino offensive german defeat in battle of stalingrad in late 1942 had weakened german front by january 1943 soviet forces were planning or conducting offensive operations across entire german soviet front especially in southern russia iskra formed northern part of wider soviet 1942 1943 winter counter offensive glantz p 259 operation was conducted by red army s leningrad front volkhov front and baltic fleet from 12 to 30 january 1943 with aim of creating a land connection to leningrad soviet forces linked up on 18 january and by 22 january front line had stabilised operation successfully opened a land corridor wide to city a railroad was swiftly built through corridor which allowed more supplies to reach city than road of life across frozen surface of lake ladoga significantly reducing possibility of capture of city and any german finnish linkup glantz pp 284 285 success led to operation polyarnaya zvezda less than two weeks later which aimed to decisively defeat army group north lifting siege altogether polyarnaya zvezda failed achieving only minimal progress glantz p 284 soviet forces made several other attempts in 1943 to renew their offensive and to lift siege completely but made only modest gains in each one corridor remained within range of german artillery and red army did not finally lift siege until a year later on 27 january 1944 glantz p 366 background siege of leningrad started in early autumn 1941 by 8 september 1941 german and finnish forces had surrounded city cutting off all supply routes to leningrad and its suburbs however original drive on city failed and city was subjected to a siege during 1942 several attempts were made to breach blockade but all failed last such attempt was sinyavino offensive after defeat of sinyavino offensive front line returned to what it was before offensive and again separated leonid govorov s leningrad front in city from kirill meretskov s volkhov front isayev p 441 despite failures of earlier operations lifting siege of leningrad was a very high priority so new offensive preparations began in november 1942 glantz p 264 in december operation was approved by stavka and received codename iskra spark operation was due to begin in january 1943 glantz p 265 by january 1943 conditions were improving for soviets german defeat in battle of stalingrad had weakened german front soviet forces were planning or conducting offensive operations across entire front especially in southwestern russia amidst these conditions operation iskra was to become first of several offensive operations aimed at inflicting a decisive defeat on germany s army group north preparations area south of lake ladoga is a heavily forested area with many wetlands especially peat deposits close to lake forest shielded both sides from visual observation both factors greatly hindered mobility of artillery and vehicles in area providing a considerable advantage to defending forces sinyavino heights were a key location with terrain higher than surrounding flat terrain because front line had changed very little since blockade was established german forces had built an extensive network of interconnected trenches and obstacles interlocking artillery and mortar fire glantz pp 216 217 neva river was partially frozen allowing infantry to cross glantz p 263 german preparations thumb german field defences germans were well aware that breaking blockade was very important for soviet side however due to reverse at stalingrad and soviet offensive at velikiye luki to south of leningrad army group north was ordered to go on defensive and was stripped of many troops 11th army which was to lead assault on leningrad in september 1942 and which had thwarted last soviet offensive was transferred to army group center in october nine other divisions were also reassigned to other sectors glantz p 262 at start of soviet offensive german 18th army led by georg lindemann consisted of 26 divisions spread across a wide front army was stretched very thin and as a result had no division level reserves instead each division had a tactical reserve of one or two battalions and army reserves consisted of portions of 96th infantry division and 5th mountain division 1st air fleet provided air support for army five divisions and part of another one were guarding narrow corridor which separated soviet leningrad and volkhov fronts corridor was only wide and was called bottleneck german divisions were well fortified in this area where front line had been virtually unchanged since september 1941 and hoping to repel soviet offensive soviet preparations thumb situation on front on january 11 plan for operation iskra was approved in december with combined efforts of volkhov and leningrad fronts defeat enemy in area of lipka shlisselburg and thus penetrate leningrad blockade finish operation by end of january 1943 isayev p 444 this meant recapturing bottleneck and opening a corridor to leningrad after that two fronts were to rest for 10 days and resume offensive southward in further operations biggest difference from earlier sinyavino offensive was location of main attack in september 1942 soviet forces were attacking south of town of siniavino which allowed them to potentially encircle several german divisions but also left army open to flanking attacks from north and it was this which ultimately caused offensive to fail in january 1943 offensive was conducted north of siniavino closer to ladoga lake shore which removed threat of flanking attacks and increased probability of success but forced soviets to abandon idea of encircling most of german forces in bottleneck offensive was to be conducted by leningrad front s 67th army and volkhov front s 2nd shock army commanded by major general m p and lieutenant general v z romanovsky respectively 8th army commanded by lieutenant general f n starikov was to conduct a limited offensive on 2nd shock army s flank and defend elsewhere glantz p 268 13th and 14th air armies provided air support two fronts spent december training and preparing for offensive and received significant reinforcements these included not just replenishment and additional rifle divisions and brigades but also significant additional artillery and engineer units which were vital for breaching heavy german defenses specialized winter units included three ski brigades and four battalions glantz p 266 to ensure soviet forces had air superiority which they had lacked in previous offensive air strength in area was increased to a total of over 800 planes predominantly fighters large tank forces could not operate well in swampy terrain so tank forces were used primarily as battalions reinforcing divisions or slightly larger brigades which were to operate independently glantz pp 269 270 originally operation was due to begin on 1 january but poor ice conditions on neva caused offensive to be delayed until 12 january a number of measures were taken to prevent details of operation being revealed to germans only a limited number of senior officers were involved in planning all redeployments took place in bad weather or at night and simulated attack preparations were made elsewhere to confuse german side glantz p 272 on january 10 stavka sent georgy zhukov as its representative to coordinate battle rifle divisions occupied their jumping off positions on 11 january and first echelon tanks moved into their advanced positions early on 12 january glantz p 273 battle start of battle thumb soviet advance on 12 january night before start of operations soviet night bombers attacked german divisional headquarters and artillery positions to disrupt german command and control bombers also attacked german airfields and communication centres to disrupt flow of reinforcements isayev p 454 operation iskra began at 9 30 on 12 january when two soviet fronts began their artillery preparation which lasted for nearly two and a half hours on western side and nearly two hours on eastern side of bottleneck soviet attack started five minutes before artillery preparation finished with a katyusha barrage to fully exploit its effects glantz p 274 leningrad front forces achieved their greatest success between shlisselburg and gorodok 1 here soviet 136th and 268th rifle divisions with supporting tanks and artillery captured a bridgehead approximately wide and deep at 18 00 sappers constructed bridges near mar ino to allow second echelon troops to advance attack further north at shlisselburg failed and attacks further south near gorodok only resulted in capture of first line of german trenches by evening front command decided to exploit formed bridgehead and troops attacking shlisselburg across neva were redeployed across river to attack it from south isayev p 455 volkhov front attack saw less success as forces of 2nd shock army managed to envelop but not destroy german strong points at lipka and workers settlement no 8 latter was an impressive defensive position with a garrison of 700 men and 16 bunkers heavy flanking fire from these strong points prevented any further advance but 2nd shock army penetrated german defenses between these points further south between workers settlement no 8 and grove advance was deep while even further south flanking attacks by 8th army only managed to capture first line of german trenches german side reacted by deploying their reserves to region throughout night one improvised battle group consisting of five battalions from 96th infantry division supported by artillery and four tiger tanks moved to gorodok no 2 to reinforce 170th infantry division to west another similar battle group using battalions from 96th infantry division was sent to workers settlement no 1 to support 227th infantry division glantz p 277 soviet advance thumb soviet advance by 18 january next five days saw very heavy fighting as soviets slowly advanced through heavy german defences and repelled german counterattacks on 13 january bad weather prevented soviet side from employing their air force that day they gained almost no ground and incurred heavy losses isayev pp 456 457 german side after their counterattacks had failed to throw back soviet troops started further reinforcing area by assembling battle groups using portions of divisions from quiet parts of front these included battle groups from 1st infantry division 61st infantry division 5th mountain division and ss police division glantz p 280 on 14 january weather improved enough to allow air support again and soviet advance resumed albeit at a slow pace to speed up encirclement of strong point at lipka soviet side used 12th ski brigade which crossed ice of ladoga lake and attacked german rear lines by end of day german forces in lipka and shlisselburg areas were almost completely cut off from rest of german forces isayev p 457 from 15 to 17 january soviet fronts fought towards each other capturing strong points at workers settlements nos 3 4 7 8 and most of shlisselburg by end of 17 january they were only apart between workers settlements nos 1 and 5 glantz pp 281 282 on 15 january govorov was promoted to colonel general p 140 linkup and land corridor thumb soviet advance by 22 january on 18 january at 9 30 lead elements from 67th army s 123rd rifle division and 2nd shock army s 372nd rifle division linked up near workers settlement no 1 thus technically breaking blockade and marking an important date in siege of leningrad german forces north of settlement were cut off group huhner made up of two battle groups under lieutenant general huhner commander of 61st infantry division was supposed to hold corridor between workers settlements nos 1 and 5 but was no longer able to do it later that day soviet forces captured workers settlement no 5 after repelling a strong german counterattack lead elements from 67th army s 136th rifle division and 2nd shock army s 18th rifle division linked up to north of settlement at 11 45 glantz p 282 group huhner became cut off too and was ordered to break out through forested area toward siniavino before main soviet forces arrived and made a breakout impossible group huhner abandoned its artillery and heavy equipment and ran gauntlet of fire before reaching siniavino on 19 january breakout was costly for both sides by early afternoon soviet forces cleared shlisselburg and lipka of german forces and started liquidating forces remaining in forests south of lake ladoga glantz p 283 from 19 to 21 january soviet forces eliminated encircled german forces and tried to expand their offensive southward towards siniavino however 18th army significantly reinforced its positions there with ss police 21st infantry and soon after 11th infantry and 28th mountain divisions soviet forces captured workers settlement no 6 but were unable to advance any further front line stabilises railway construction there were no changes in front line after 21 january as a result of operation iskra soviet forces were unable to advance any further and instead started fortifying area to thwart any german attempt at re establishing blockade on 21 january work started on rail line linking leningrad to rest of country through captured corridor plan from state defense committee written on 18 january ordered construction to be finished in 20 days work was completed ahead of schedule and trains began delivering supplies on 6 february operation officially ended on 30 january isayev p 461 aftermath operation iskra was a strategic victory for soviet forces from a military perspective operation eliminated possibility of capture of city and a german finnish link up as leningrad front was now very well supplied reinforced and able to co operate more closely with volkhov front for civilian population operation meant that more food was able to reach city as well as improved conditions and possibility of evacuating more civilians from city breaking blockade also had a significant strategic effect although it was overshadowed by surrender of german 6th army at stalingrad only a few days later notably first tiger tank captured by soviets was taken during this battle it was undamaged and evacuated by soviet forces for evaluation panzerkampfwagen vi tiger ausf e sd kfz 181 com also victory led to promotions for govorov who was promoted to colonel general on 15 january and zhukov who was promoted to marshal of soviet union on 18 january in addition govorov and meretskov were awarded order of suvorov 1st class on 28 january 136th and rifle divisions were awarded designation of 63rd and 64th guards rifle divisions while 61st tank brigade was designated 30th guards tank brigade for german side battle left 18th army very stretched and exhausted lacking sufficient reinforcements command of army group north made decision to shorten front line by evacuating demyansk pocket salient salient had been held throughout 1942 despite being encircled for a few months as it was an important strategic bridgehead together with salient which was also evacuated in spring 1943 it could potentially be used to encircle a large number of soviet forces however in situation that had developed retaining it was no longer possible isayev p 467 nevertheless stavka knew that operation iskra was incomplete as corridor it had opened was narrow and was still in range of german artillery and important heights and strong point at sinyavino remained under german control this led zhukov to plan operation polyarnaya zvezda polar star this much more ambitious offensive operation aimed to decisively defeat army group north but faltered early on soviet forces carried out several other offensives in area in 1943 slowly expanding corridor making other small gains before finally capturing siniavino in september glantz p 323 however city was still subjected to at least a partial siege as well as air and artillery bombardment until january 1944 when leningrad novgorod offensive broke through german lines lifting siege completely glantz p 303 notes references further reading google translation category conflicts in 1943
