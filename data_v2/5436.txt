ascocoryne sarcoides is a species of fungus in family helotiaceae species name is derived from greek fleshy formerly known as coryne sarcoides its taxonomical history has been complicated by fact that it may adopt both sexual and asexual forms colloquially known as jelly drops or purple this common fungus appears as a gelatinous mass of pinkish or purple colored discs distributed widely in north america europe and asia a sarcoides is a saprobic fungus and grows in clusters on trunks and branches of a variety of dead woods field studies suggest that colonization by a sarcoides of heartwood of black spruce confers some resistance to further infection by rot causing fungi a sarcoides contains antibiotic compound ascocorynin shown in laboratory to inhibit growth of several gram positive bacteria taxonomy thumb left nikolaus joseph von jacquin first described a sarcoides in 1781 taxonomical history of this fungus has been complicated by fact that its life cycle allows for both an imperfect making asexual spores or conidia or perfect making sexual spores form at various times authors have assigned names to one or other form but these names have often been at odds with accepted rules of fungal nomenclature it was originally described in 1781 by dutch scientist nikolaus joseph von jacquin as lichen sarcoides christian hendrik persoon called it peziza sarcoides in 1801 elias magnus fries in his 1822 publication systema mycologicum described imperfect state of fungus under name tremella sarcoides genus name coryne was first used in 1851 by who proposed coryne sarcoides for imperfect state in 1865 tulasne brothers charles and louis rene used coryne to refer to both perfect and imperfect forms it was designated type species for genus in a 1931 publication by clements and shear several decades later it became apparent that name coryne sarcoides violated naming conventions imposed by fungal taxonomists specifically species was named after imperfect state so in 1967 groves and wilson proposed new genus name ascocoryne to accommodate perfect state conidial state of this fungus is coryne dubia persoon ex s f gray synonymous with sarcoides von specific epithet is derived from greek and means fleshy flesh like from sarx sarx in compounds flesh and common adjectival ending oeides oeides similar like description this fungus is characterized by a fruiting body technically an apothecia with a pinkish purple color and more or less gelatinous consistency apothecia typically in diameter start with a roughly spherical shape then eventually flatten out to become shallowly cup shaped with a wavy edge and smooth upper surface lower surface may be covered with small particles granular and apothecia are either attached directly to growing surface sessile or have a rudimentary stem apothecia are accompanied by a conidial form where non sexual spores are generated conidial form consists of sporodochia a cushion like asexual fruiting body mass consisting of short conidiophores specialized stalks that bear conidia sporodochia are similar in color and consistency to apothecia but very variable in shape typically club spoon or tongue shaped and bearing minute cylindrical straight or curved conidia as fungus matures and apothecia enlarge and press against each other apothecia coalesce to form a gelatinous irregular mass flesh similar to appearance of fungus is pinkish purple and gelatinous odor and taste of a sarcoides are not distinctive ascocoryne sarcoides is not considered edible microscopic features spores are translucent hyaline smooth have an ellipsoid shape with dimensions of 12 16 by 3 5 um spores contain one or two oil droplets imperfect conidial form of fungus produces smooth hyaline spores that are 3 3 5 by 1 2 um asci sexual spore bearing cells have a cylindrical shape with dimensions of 115 125 by 8 10 um paraphyses sterile filamentous cells interspersed among asci are cylindrical with slightly swollen tips and few branches similar species ascocoryne another small and gelatinous violet colored species has apothecia that are more often cup shaped and has larger spores 20 24 by 5 5 6 um because of its resemblance to jelly fungi a sarcoides has been mistaken for basidiomycete species auricularia auricula and tremella foliacea t foliacea is larger brown and leafy in appearance auricularia auricula is also larger typically brown is disc or ear shaped with a ribbed undersurface microscopically tremella foliacea and auricularia auricula are easily distinguished from a sarcoides by presence of basidia rather than asci habitat and distribution this species has a broad distribution in forested areas of north america and europe a saprobic fungus it derives nutrients from decaying organic matter and as such is usually found growing on stumps and logs of fallen deciduous trees however it is also found on a variety of living trees as well for example in europe it has been found on stems of living spruce picea abies in finland france great britain norway and germany other collections sites include australia chile stinson m ezra d hess w m sears j and strobel g 2003 an gliocladium sp of producing selective volatile antimicrobial compounds plant science 165 913 922 china cuba iceland korea and taiwan in hawaii it grows on trunks of fallen and aleurites trees a sarcoides occurs most frequently in late summer and autumn role in tree decay thumb left specimen found in a beech and oak forest in belgium a number of field studies conducted in boreal forest region of northern ontario canada showed that a sarcoides was found to be frequently associated with various deciduous and coniferous tree hosts that had been affected by fungal disease known as heart rot this discovery was noted as unusual as most fungal tree infections are known to be caused by basidiomycetes not in case of commercially valuable tree species black spruce picea mariana it was determined that prior colonization by a sarcoides reduces incidence of subsequent infection by common fungal pathogens such as fomes pini and furthermore a sarcoides can exist in wood with no noticeable harmful effects on host a similar relationship was shown later to exist with jack pine trees species pinus whereby a sarcoides inhibited peniophora but had little effect on subsequent growth of fomes pini study also showed that a sarcoides is isolated more frequently from defective wood as age of tree increases trees examined in study were over 80 years old and that it can infect both uninfected heartwood as well as previously decayed wood in latter case it usually coexists with causal fungi bioactive compounds thumb skeletal formula of ascocorynin are chemical compounds that are widely distributed among fungi ascocoryne sarcoides has been shown to contain a named ascocorynin a chemical derivative of compound benzoquinone this pigment when in alkaline solution turns a dark violet similar in color to fruit bodies of fungus ascocorynin has moderate antibiotic activity and was shown in laboratory tests to inhibit growth of several gram positive bacteria including widely distributed food spoilage organism bacillus however it has no effect on growth on gram negative bacteria nor does it have any anti fungal activity volatile organic compounds in 2008 an isolate of a sarcoides was observed to produce a series of volatiles including 6 to 9 carbon alcohols ketones and alkanes this mixture was called because of its similarity to some existing fuel mixtures researchers have suggested that this combined with its ability to digest cellulose make it a potential source of biofuel isolate was originally identified at gliocladium but its taxonomy was later revised to sarcoides its genome was sequenced in 2012 in an effort to determine genetic basis for production of these volatiles references external links category helotiaceae category fungi described in 1781 category fungi of asia category fungi native to
