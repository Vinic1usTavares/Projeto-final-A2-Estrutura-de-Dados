recording techniques which they had applied in recording way i see it however for stone rollin they sought to eschew its predecessor s motown aesthetic for a more eclectic style in keeping with saadiq s other musical projects according to brungardt recording of project s earlier songs heart attack was critical in their decision for album song was recorded during saadiq s break from touring for way

as well on way i see it everything was pretty much tube pre s and tube compressors on this one i wanted to play around with some of more solid state gear some of album s songs were recorded by saadiq with his live band which included drummer lemar carter bassist calvin turner and guitarist rob bacon bacon who had played with saadiq since 2002 said of their grittier approach to guitar i have relative pitch as opposed to perfect pitch so there d be times when i d spend 15 or 20 minutes tuning my instrument then he d come in and pick up his guitar and just start playing it however it was

guitar mellotron percussion and drums and he also layered each recorded instrumental part afterwards brungardt used a neumann u 47 microphone to record each of saadiq s instrument parts saadiq recorded his vocals on a dynamic microphone alone in recording studio s control room an approach encouraged to him earlier in his career by record producer and audio engineer gerry brown according to brungardt saadiq s voice benefits from a dynamic mic because it tends to give him more bottom and presence plus dynamic mics can sound a little older when pushed with songs guitar parts brungardt wanted to create additional distortion in order to produce a grittier guitar sound for songs a stylistic preference saadiq and he had acquired from listening to a great deal of indie rock at time he applied several techniques to achieve this sound including increasing gain on saadiq s fender twin guitar amplifier using a software plug in for recordings in post production and re amping saadiq s guitar parts in his interview for eq magazine brungardt discussed using a massey one of his preferred plug ins in recording process stating i ll use that on a lot of things to get a little more grit

prince informs sound of this more than anybody it s a very early 70s sounding album on whole but there are influences that go back even further than that ray charles and little richard in particular inform some of this record s more energetic moments los angeles times journalist mikael wood said of album s sound and production where saadiq s previous efforts in layering and fine tuning made possible by modern recording gear stone rollin presents a rawer rowdier soul rock sound modeled after his energetic stage show music writer robert christgau said saadiq s compositions are characterized by groove rather than song andy kellman of allmusic wrote that songs are tied together by mellotron a vintage keyboard commonly associated with psychedelic and progressive rock recordings but not foreign to soul that evokes diseased flutes and wheezing strings adding that saadiq tends to use instrument for shading music journalist jim derogatis observed a little less motown
