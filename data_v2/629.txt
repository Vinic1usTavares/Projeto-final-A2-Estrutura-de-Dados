origins kaspersky s interest in it security began in 1989 when his pc was infected by cascade virus while working for ministry of defense he studied how virus worked and developed a program to remove it afterwards he continually found new viruses and developed software to remove them as a hobby early on kaspersky s anti virus software had just 40 virus definitions and was distributed mostly to friends in 1991 kaspersky was granted an early release from his military service and left defense ministry to take a job at information technology center of a private company kami in order to work on his antivirus product full time there he and his colleagues improved software and released it as a product called antiviral toolkit pro in 1992 at first software was purchased by about ten clients per month it earned about 100 per month mostly from companies in ukraine and russia kaspersky s then future wife natalya kaspersky became his coworker at kami in 1994 hamburg university in germany gave kaspersky s software first place in a competitive analysis of antivirus software this led to more business for kaspersky from european and american companies kaspersky lab was founded three years later by kaspersky his wife and kaspersky s friend natalya who pushed eugene to start company was ceo while eugene was head of research following year cih virus aka chernobyl virus created a boon for kaspersky s anti virus products which kaspersky said was only software at time that could cleanse virus according to wired their software was advanced for time for example it was first software to monitor viruses in an isolated quarantine kaspersky s company grew quickly in late 1990s from 1998 to 2000 its annual revenue grew 280 percent and by 2000 almost sixty percent of revenues were international by 2000 it had a staff of 65 people starting from 13 in 1997 antivirus product was renamed to kaspersky antivirus in 2000 after an american company started using product s original name which wasn t trademarked threat discoveries as head of research kaspersky authored papers on viruses and went to conferences to promote software he was often quoted in technology press as an antivirus expert he helped establish company s global research and expert analysis team great which helps corporations and governments investigate it security threats initially he told his team not to discuss cyber terrorism publicly to avoid giving governments ideas on how to sabotage their political opponents after american film live free or die hard aka die hard 4 0 2007 was released kaspersky said idea was now public he hired researcher that identified stuxnet worm which is believed to be first instance of state sponsored afterwards company exposed flame virus at request of international telecommunication union virus was believed to have been used for cyber espionage in middle eastern countries kaspersky lab developed a reputation for discovering cybersecurity threats in 2015 kaspersky and kaspersky lab discovered a group of hackers known as that were stealing money from banks they also exposed equation group which developed advanced spyware for monitoring computer use and was believed to be affiliated with national security agency in u s according to economist it was these discoveries kaspersky s relentless salesmanship and company s anti virus product that made kaspersky lab uncommon as an internationally recognized russian company ceo kaspersky became ceo of kaspersky lab in 2007 according to a 2008 article in usa today he traveled to 20 to 30 countries per year promoting kaspersky lab products in early 2009 said his personality contributed to company s growth from relative obscurity to now nipping at heels of its larger better known rivals at time kaspersky lab was fourth largest endpoint security company it introduced new products for enterprise market and expanded its channel programs in 2011 kaspersky made a decision against taking company public saying it would make decision making slow and prevent long term r d investments this led to a series of high level departures from company including his ex wife and co founder another series of departures occurred in 2014 due to disagreements over how to run company kaspersky lab has defended itself against allegedly frivolous patent claims more aggressively than most it companies in 2012 it was only one of 35 firms named in a suit by patent troll information protection and authentication ipac to take case to court rather than pay a fee case was ruled in kaspersky s favor also in 2012 another company sued kaspersky and 54 other companies for patent infringement and that case also resulted in claimant dropping case against kaspersky according to an article in techworld company s aversion to settling these claims is most likely because eugene just hates patent trolls in his blog he called them parasites and it racketeers kaspersky himself is co author of several patents including one for a constraint and attribute based security system for controlling software component interaction as of 2015 kaspersky lab employed more than 2 800 people as of 2012 kaspersky was working on developing software to protect critical infrastructure like power plants from cyberwarfare views kaspersky is influential among politicians and security experts he has warned about possibility of cyberwarfare that targets critical infrastructure he speaks at conferences advocating for an international cyberwarfare treaty that would ban government sponsored cyberattacks after stuxnet attack kaspersky proposed that internet needed more regulation and policing one idea was to have some parts of internet anonymous while more secure areas require user identification he argued that anonymity mostly benefited cybercriminals and hackers for example accessing a nuclear power plant network could require a verified identity through a digital passport kaspersky said anonymity on internet could be protected by using a proxy whereby a responsible international body maintains a record of which online identities correspond to which real world ones for example a person s identity would be revealed in cases of malicious activity some security experts believe that a centralized database of real world identities of internet users would be a privacy disaster and a highly attractive target for thieves age said it sounds a little too close for comfort to a big brother scenario and wired said kaspersky s views were highly aligned with russian government s agenda many organizations have been considering reducing privacy to improve security as a result of kaspersky s arguments in a more recent slashdot interview kaspersky said internet should be divided into three zones a red zone for voting online banking and other critical transactions that would require an internet id a grey zone that may require only verification of age to access site but not identity and a green zone for blogs news and everything related to your freedom of speech he proposes special proxies for red zone websites that allow disclosure of user s identity only in case of suspected malfeasance controversies alleged affiliations with russian intelligence kaspersky s prior work for russian military and his education at a kgb sponsored technical college has led to controversy about whether he uses his position to advance russian government interests and intelligence efforts according to kaspersky allegations of dubious connections with russian agencies began after he got his first clients in america he spends much of his working life trying to get governments and organizations to trust him and his software in spite of allegations wired said kaspersky s critics accuse him of using company to spy on users for russian intelligence russian telecommunications companies for example are required by federal law in russia to cooperate with government s military and spy operations if asked kaspersky said his company has never been asked to tamper with its software for espionage and called accusations cold war paranoia according to wired kaspersky staffers argue not unconvincingly that spying on users would hurt its business and its relationship with russian fsb kgb s successor is limited according to gartner there s no evidence that they have any back doors in their software or any ties to russian mafia or state but there is still a concern that you can t operate in russia without being controlled by ruling party computing mocked some of more extreme accusations of espionage but said it would be unlikely for a russian business to grow to size of kaspersky lab without relationships within russian government npr journalists also said it was unlikely kaspersky was using its software for espionage because it would be risky for company s business but said kaspersky showed an unusual disinterest in russia based cybercrime in august 2015 bloomberg

intelligence services some of these people actively aid criminal investigations by fsb using data from some of 400 million customers bloomberg and new york times also said kaspersky was less aggressive about identifying cyberattacks originating from russia than from other countries allegations kaspersky refutes for example he allegedly ignored or downplayed a series of denial of service attacks in december 2011 that were made to disrupt online discussion criticizing russian politicians kaspersky also allegedly ignored a russian based spyware called which is believed to have been used by russia against nato and eastern europe on other hand kaspersky also published information on russia based crouching yeti cyberattacks two days before bloomberg accused him of ignoring russia based cyberattacks at time company had published eleven reports on malicious russian programs competitor fireeye said it is awkward even in u s to investigate performed by one s own government a march 2015 article in bloomberg said an increasing number of executive staff at kaspersky lab previously worked for russian military and intelligence agencies according to news observer kaspersky published a mammoth response tearing down bloomberg s accusations and accusing them of throwing facts out window for sake of a juicy anti russian narrative competitor fireeye said many u s it companies also have executives that formerly worked for government military and intelligence agencies npr reported that kaspersky has been doing an increasing amount of business with russian cybersecurity agencies to catch cybercriminals kaspersky confirmed that russian agencies are among its government customers in may 2017 allegations resurfaced when us national security agency nsa director mike rogers told a us senate intelligence committee that nsa was reviewing us government s use of kaspersky software for fear it would allow russian intelligence services to conduct spy operations or launch cyber attacks against american digital infrastructure abc reported that department of homeland security had issued a secret report in february on possible connections between kaspersky lab and russian intelligence and that fbi was currently investigating matter according to defense intelligence agency dia director vincent stewart his agency is tracking kaspersky and their software in a press release eugene
