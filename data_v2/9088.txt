snoring rail aramidopsis plateni also known as celebes rail or platen s rail is a large flightless rail and only member of genus aramidopsis species is endemic to indonesia and it is found exclusively in dense vegetation in wet areas of sulawesi and nearby buton rail has grey underparts a white chin brown wings and a rufous patch on hind neck sexes are similar but female has a brighter neck patch and a differently coloured bill and iris typical call is snoring ee orrrr sound that gives bird its english name its inaccessible habitat and retiring nature mean that snoring rail is rarely seen and as a result little is known of its behaviour only adult plumage has been described and breeding behaviour is unrecorded it feeds on small crabs and probably other small prey such as lizards although protected under indonesian law since 1972 rail is threatened by habitat loss even within nature reserves hunting for food and predation by introduced species it is therefore evaluated as vulnerable on iucn red list taxonomy rails are a large and very widespread family with nearly 150 species they are small to medium sized terrestrial or wetland birds and their short bodies are often flattened laterally to help them move through dense vegetation island species readily become flightless of 53 extant or recently extinct taxa restricted to islands 32 have lost ability to fly snoring rail was first classified as rallus plateni by german ornithologist august wilhelm heinrich blasius in 1886 but was moved to its current monotypic genus aramidopsis by english zoologist richard bowdler sharpe in 1893 following taylor 1998 it was considered to be more similar to inaccessible island and white throated rails than to members of genus rallus but a 2012 mitochondrial gene study suggests that it should actually be placed in gallirallus with lewin s rail and slaty breasted rail as its closest relatives aramidopsis derives from genus name of and greek suffix resembling although rail shares origin of its name with south american species jobling 2010 p 52 its distinctive bill thick legs and barred lower belly distinguish it from that group species name plateni commemorates carl constantin platen a german doctor who collected birds and butterflies in malay 2010 p 309 and gave blasius his specimen of rail meyer wiglesworth 1898 vol 1 pp 7 8 common name refers to rail s distinctive call and was given to bird as der vogel snoring bird by german entomologist gerd heinrich when he rediscovered species in 1932 heinrich 2007 pp 103 105 description snoring rail is long and weighs it is flightless with short wings a very short tail and strong legs and feet back and underparts from to breast are grey apart from a white chin and sides and rear of neck are deep orange red most of rest of upperparts are brown and belly flanks and undertail have white barring male has black legs a yellow iris and a brown and greenish down curved bill female is similar but has a brighter hindneck colour less white on chin a red iris a cream and reddish bill and blue grey legs immature and juvenile plumages are undescribed visual confusion with sympatric rails is unlikely blue faced rail is similar in size but is chestnut above and black below and buff banded rail has strongly marked upperparts breast and head slaty breasted rail is smaller and has barred upperparts call given frequently is a short followed by a distinctive snoring ee orrrr a deep sound has also been recorded distribution and habitat species is an uncommon indonesian endemic of lowland and hill forests in northern north central and southeastern sulawesi another population was found on buton island in 1995 typical habitat of this species is dense vegetation in wet areas this may include impenetrable bamboo and liana in forests rattan in regrown forests or elephant grass and bushes on hillsides of peninsula claims of species occurring in rice fields are believed to be due to confusion with buff banded rail snoring rail occurs from sea level to behaviour its inaccessible habitat and sparse distribution means that little is known about this species a few birds were shot by platen and another expedition led by paul sarasin and his second cousin fritz between 1893 and 1898 meyer wiglesworth 1898 vol 2 pp 690 692 but rail was then not seen for more than thirty years until heinrich found it almost at end of a two year survey of sulawesi then known as celebes he described it as most priceless catch that i have ever hunted or will hunt more than a decade later dutch ornithologist louis de also took a year to find rail despite concentrating on known suitable habitat there were then no documented sightings until birds were observed in 1983 and 1989 sight records remain infrequent and only about ten specimen corpses have been studied snoring rail catches crabs in highland streams and these crustaceans may be a major dietary item it also forages in muddy areas and has been recorded as consuming lizards taylor van 1998 pp 329 331 nothing is known of its breeding behaviour other than a report of an adult seen feeding with two chicks in august 1983 but original report gives no details of claimed sighting status snoring rail is restricted to sulawesi and buton and has an estimated population of 3 500 15 000 individuals its numbers are thought to be decreasing and its restricted range and small population mean that species is classified as vulnerable by international union for conservation of nature iucn it may always have been thinly spread but there has been widespread deforestation within its range resulting in loss and fragmentation of suitable habitat rail has been protected under indonesian law since 1972 and large lore lindu and nani national parks are within its range but logging and rattan cutting occurs even in these protected areas and human encroachment is also a problem at lore lindu rail has been trapped for food in past and is sometimes killed by dogs cats and other introduced predators roots 2006 pp 56 57 a 2007 survey of protected areas of sulawesi failed to find rail suggesting that it is genuinely rare even in reserves references cited
