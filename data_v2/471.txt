rodrigues rail erythromachus leguati also known as leguat s or leguat s rail is an extinct species of rail family that was endemic to mascarene island of rodrigues east of madagascar in indian ocean it is generally kept in its own genus erythromachus but has sometimes been assigned to genus aphanapteryx along with its close relative red rail a bonasia of mauritius their relationship with other rails is unclear rodrigues rail was described as having grey plumage a red beak red legs and a naked red patch around eye beak varied between specimens from straight to curved but reason for this is unknown it was flightless and fed on tortoise eggs it was described as being attracted to red objects which humans exploited while hunting it rodrigues rail is believed to have become extinct in mid 18th century because of predation by introduced cats and destruction of its habitat by tortoise hunters bird was first documented from life by two contemporaneous accounts first by francois leguat a french huguenot refugee marooned on rodrigues in 1691 and then by julien tafforet marooned on island in 1726 subfossil remains were later discovered and connected with old accounts in 1874 and species was named e leguati in leguat s honour taxonomy thumb left first bones described by milne edwards in 1874 a tarsometatarsus 1 1e a fragmentary skull 3 3b and a sternum 4 4c alt an illustration of bird bones laid out in rows in 1848 english zoologist hugh edwin strickland called attention to a bird mentioned in french traveller francois leguat s 1708 memoir about his stay on mascarene island of rodrigues leguat referred to birds as translated as wood hens a name strickland thought implied grouse of europe though this was not consistent with form of beak described by leguat strickland was unable to classify bird further but noted similarities with dodo cucullatus and kiwi based on unidentified birds from mauritius illustrated by travellers pieter van den and sir thomas herbert which he thought related strickland also noted similarities with a bird from mauritius which would later be identified as red rail aphanapteryx bonasia in 1874 french zoologist alphonse milne edwards connected leguat s account with three subfossil bones a sternum a tarsometatarsus and a fragmentary skull found in caves of plaine corail region rodrigues he recognised their similarity to those of red rail while noting it supposedly had a straighter beak as described by leguat milne edwards coined generic name erythromachus from greek words for red and battle also translated as hostile to red in reference to its attraction to red objects and specific name is in honour of leguat name erythromachus was incorrectly explained as referring to sea by american ornithologist charles wallace richmond in 1908 name from red and hatred was used by english ornithologist alfred newton in 1874 originally only in a manuscript and also refers to rail s behaviour towards red but as a newer name it is a junior synonym milne edwards did not select a holotype specimen for species from bones he had loaned from cambridge university museum of zoology for his study but a syntype series was later listed from specimens there presumably by a newton in 1875 a newton also identified a reference to bird in 1726 account of french traveller julien tafforet which had then recently been rediscovered in 1879 more fossils including skulls were described by zoologists albert gunther and edward newton brother of alfred who confirmed that bird was a rail rallidae and also noted that some specimens had beaks as curved as that of red rail american ornithologist james greenway suggested that leguat s description referred to wind blown purple swamphens porphyrio since word grey is sometimes used synonymously with blue in old descriptions this idea has not been accepted by other commentators in 1999 french palaeontologist cecile mourer chauvire and colleagues pointed out that a carpometacarpus bone assigned to rodrigues rail and illustrated by gunther and e newton in 1879 does not belong to a rail and therefore not this bird more subfossils have since been discovered including an associated but incomplete skeleton with a complete skull and jaws found in poule rouge in 2005 evolution upright thumb left painting of related red rail by hoefnagel ca 1610 alt painting of red rail apart from being a close relative to red rail relationships of rodrigues rail are uncertain and two are commonly listed as separate genera aphanapteryx and erythromachus but have sometimes been united as species of aphanapteryx gunther and e newton first generically synonymised two in 1879 because of their skeletal similarities in 1945 french palaeontologist jean piveteau found skull features of two species different enough for generic separation and in 1977 american ornithologist storrs l olson stated that though two species were similar and derived from same stock they had also diverged considerably and should possibly be kept separate based on geographic location and morphology of nasal bones olson suggested that they were related to genera gallirallus dryolimnas atlantisia and rallus mourer chauvire and colleagues also considered two as belonging to separate genera rails have reached many oceanic archipelagos which has frequently led to speciation and evolution of flightlessness according to british researchers anthony s cheke and julian p hume fact that red rail lost much of its feather structure indicates it was isolated for a long time these rails may be of asian origin like many other mascarene birds in 2019 hume supported distinction of two genera and cited relation between mauritius owl otus and rodrigues owl otus as another example of diverging evolutionary paths on these islands he stated that relationships of rodrigues and red rails was more unclear than that of other extinct mascarene rails with many of their distinct features being related to flightlessness and modifications to their jaws due to their diet suggesting long time isolation speed of which these features evolved may also have been affected by gene flow resource availability and climate events and flightlessness can evolve rapidly n rails as well as repeatedly within same groups as seen in for example dryolimnas so distinctness of rodrigues and red rails may not have taken long to evolve some other specialised rails evolved in less than 1 3 million years hume suggested that two rails were probably related to dryolimnas but their considerably different morphology made it difficult to establish how in general rails are adept at colonising islands and can become flightless within few generations in suitable environments for example without predators yet this also makes them vulnerable to human activities description thumb alt an illustration of a bird with a long neck a long sharp red beak red legs and feet mid grey to black feathers and a large red naked area around its eye frohawk s 1907 restoration based on an old outline illustration and a description olson considered image rather fanciful rodrigues rail was about long smaller than red rail but with proportionally longer wings subfossil remains exhibit a large variation in size which may reflect sexual dimorphism it had bright grey plumage perhaps flecked with white its beak and legs were red and it had a red naked area or wattle around its eyes cranium of rodrigues rail was slightly elongate convex in every direction and was long and wide cranium had a narrow long frontal region at its least width beak varied greatly in size and shape some specimens had short and almost straight beaks and others had much longer beaks up to one third longer that were prominently curved it is unknown whether this was related to overall size of an individual bird or to sexual dimorphism culmen of beak was almost straight above nostril and nasal bone was slightly longer than cranium beak was up to long lower jaw up to long and at its greatest depth scapula shoulder blade was long humerus ranged from and ulna from pelvis was large and strongly built in proportion to size of bird was long wide at front and wide at back femur ranged from in length tibia from and metatarsus was long proportions of legs pelvis and sacrum of rodrigues and red rail were generally similar rodrigues rail differed from red rail by having a broader and shorter skull longer and lower nostrils a proportionately longer humerus a shorter stouter femur as well as a considerably different plumage based on early descriptions contemporary accounts thumb left leguat s 1708 map of rodrigues alt 1708 map of rodrigues decorated with solitaire birds rodrigues rail was first recorded by leguat in his 1708 memoir a new voyage to east indies he was leader of a group of nine french huguenot refugees which were first to colonise rodrigues from 1691 to 1693 after they were marooned there by their captain leguat s observations are considered some of first cohesive accounts of animal behaviour in wild and his full account of bird reads as follows thumb schlegel s 1854 outlines of dodo species second supposedly from rodrigues which were actually red rails seen by travellers on mauritius alt a line drawing of two flightless birds each with an ovoid body long neck and pointed beak another description of appearance and behaviour is found in a document called relation de l ile rodrigue attributed to tafforet who was marooned on rodrigues in 1726 unlike red rail and other extinct mascarene birds rodrigues rail was not illustrated by contemporaneous artists olson described reconstructions made for british zoologist walter rothschild s 1907 book extinct birds and japanese ornithologist s 1953 book dodo and kindred birds as rather fanciful english artist frederick william frohawk based his restoration in former book on an outline illustration which was in turn based on a sketch drawn by herbert which is now known to depict red rail german zoologist hermann schlegel thought it depicted a species of dodo which he called from rodrigues when he drew outline in 1854 and that it was species mentioned by leguat behaviour and ecology upright thumb frontispiece to leguat s 1708 memoir showing his settlement on rodrigues with tortoises and rats below alt drawing of houses on rodrigues according to tafforet s account rodrigues rail fed on eggs of now extinct cylindraspis tortoises three species of which lived on rodrigues as it took advantage of their breeding season hume considered it an opportunistic predator which perhaps also fed on hatchling tortoises a former tortoise breeding area in plaine corail shows that such sites were concentrated into small area with containing large numbers of eggs phalanx bone of a rodrigues rail has been found among egg remains rails would have fattened themselves seasonally but at other times of year they probably fed on snails and other invertebrates as well as scavenging sea bird colonies rodrigues rail probably fed on worms such as and now extinct by probing leaf litter or rotting wood if beak was sexually dimorphic this may have reflected differences in diet between sexes since leguat was unable to locate its nests rodrigues rail may have nested outside easily accessible open forest as was typical in coastal and lowland areas and rather nested deep in forested valleys or mountainous hills of interior according to hume its nests may have been well concealed in vegetation on ground as is case of flightless rails like red rail it was said to be attracted to colour red but significance of this is unknown according to milne edwards bird had legs made for running many other species endemic to rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived and island s ecosystem was heavily damaged before humans arrived forests covered island entirely but very little of those remain today rodrigues rail lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as rodrigues solitaire solitaria rodrigues parrot newton s parakeet psittacula exsul rodrigues starling necropsar rodericanus rodrigues owl rodrigues night heron and rodrigues pigeon nesoenas rodericanus extinct reptiles include domed rodrigues giant tortoise cylindraspis saddle backed rodrigues giant tortoise cylindraspis and rodrigues day gecko extinction many terrestrial rails are flightless and island populations are particularly vulnerable to man made changes as a result rails have suffered more extinctions than any other family of birds all six endemic species of mascarene rails are extinct caused by human activities rodrigues rail may have coexisted with rats for at least a century perhaps introduced when a group of sailors from a dutch ship were marooned there in 1644 though rats were well established and numerous by time leguat and tafforet stayed on island rails also remained common perhaps due to their aggressive nature french began settling rodrigues in 1735 to supply mauritius with tortoise meat which must have taken a toll on rails through hunting and deforestation but their rapid disappearance was probably caused by cats introduced to control rats around 1750 and species may have gone extinct within a decade after in 1763 french astronomer alexandre guy noted absence of this and other birds on rodrigues by
