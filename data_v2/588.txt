flammulated flycatcher deltarhynchus is a species of bird in family tyrannidae and is only species in monotypic genus deltarhynchus although it is closely related to birds of genus myiarchus it is endemic to dry deciduous forest arid thorn forest and scrubby woodland of mexico s pacific coast flycatcher is an olive to gray brown bird with a streaked pale gray chest white throat black bill dark gray feet and dark brown wings it is a skulking bird that typically remains hidden in underbrush it feeds by gleaning insects off of leaves and twigs that it spots from an exposed perch female lays approximately three eggs in a nest made in a shallow tree cavity taxonomy species was first described in 1875 by ornithologist george newbold lawrence who placed this species in genus myiarchus however in 1893 it was split from myiarchus into new monotypic genus deltarhynchus by robert ridgway because of its shorter and broader bill more rounded wings and partially streaked underparts this change was upheld in 1901 by richard bowdler sharpe and by subsequent authors however in 1977 ornithologist melvin alvah traylor jr while upholding its status as a monotypic genus said that species should be lumped back into myiarchus if its nesting habits were similar to those of that genus these doubts were put to rest by wesley lanyon s research of flycatcher in 1979 which confirmed bird s placement in a monotypic genus deltarhynchus is similar to genus myiarchus but is distinguished from it by a broader and shorter bill more rounded wings a different face pattern pale cinnamon wing and tail voice streaking on chest and bird s skulking habits flammulated flycatcher s generic name is derived from ancient greek words delta which means delta shaped or in this case wedge and rhynchos which means beak its specific epithet is derived from latin word which means little flame flycatcher has no subspecies description left thumb flammulated flycatcher flammulated flycatcher is approximately 6 to 6 5 inches 15 16 5 cm in length and has a chunky body adult males and females are similar in plumage with each possessing olive to a worn gray brown upperparts and head a whitish supraloral stripe and crescent are behind bird s eyes it also has a dusky lore throat is whitish and chest is a pale gray with inconspicuous dusky streaking while belly and undertail coverts are a pale yellow additionally this species has dark brown well rounded wings with pale cinnamon edged coverts and remiges wings are about long tail is also a dark brown edged with a narrow band of pale cinnamon it is barely shorter than wing and slightly rounded bird s bill is black broad and triangular with a slightly paler base and about half length of its head legs are a dark gray and end with large curved and sharp claws it has an orange mouth and a brown eye juvenile is similar to adult although tail has a broad band of pale cinnamon vocalization flammulated flycatcher mostly sings from april to august which includes its breeding season and tends to remain hidden while singing song of flycatcher is a plaintive whistle followed by a short but quick roll it can also give a plaintive and slurred chew call which is often sung three to five times in a descending series as well as a squeaky chatter calls are same for males and females and are given throughout day to give a location identify an individual sound an alarm and mark limits of a territory among other functions during breeding season males give what is known as a dawn song every morning which includes calls chee bee beet and churr r r bee bee in alternation distribution and habitat this flycatcher is endemic to pacific lowlands of mexico s western coast from sinaloa to western chiapas while possibly extending into guatemala although this has not been confirmed total area that it lives in is estimated to be its range is discontinuous and it is found in low densities when present it lives in dry deciduous forest arid and semi arid thorn forest and scrubby woodland at about 1000 1400 meters 3280 ft above sea level this species is non migratory status flammulated flycatcher is listed as being of least concern on iucn red list owing to its large range and belief that total population numbers over 10 000 individuals however no precise estimate on bird s population exists while species is known to be uncommon in parts of its range its population is not believed to be declining enough to pass threshold of 30 in ten years or three generations necessary to be listed as near threatened although exact population trends also have not been quantified ecology and behavior this flycatcher is a sluggish and skulking species that usually remains in underbrush when excited either by an intruder or when attempting to attract a mate this species raises feathers on its crown to form what appears to be a crest however unlike closely related genus myiarchus it does not bob its head while displaying crest feeding flammulated flycatcher forages by perching on an open branch and looking outward and downward for prey which primarily consists of insects once it spots a potential meal flycatcher rapidly and directly flies at insect which is normally on exposed upper surface of a leaf or twig it hovers briefly before insect before grabbing it in its beak and flying away to typically a new perch reproduction flycatcher breeds around june of each year it nests in shallow tree cavities that are surprisingly close to ground at approximately 90 centimeters above it nest is shaped like a cup and is composed of fine vegetable fibers dried leaves and shredded bark unlike similar myiarchus flycatchers it does not use snakeskin or other materials to build its nest female lays three eggs that are creamy to pinkish in color and are decorated with brown and gray splotches references external links photographs photographs and sound recording flammulated flycatcher category birds of mexico
