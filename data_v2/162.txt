operation paravane was a british air raid of world war ii that inflicted heavy damage on german battleship tirpitz at anchor in kaafjord in far north of german occupied norway attack was conducted on 15 september 1944 by 21 royal air force heavy bombers which flew from an airfield in north of soviet union battleship was struck by one bomb and further damaged by several near misses this damage rendered tirpitz unfit for combat and she could not be repaired as it was no longer possible for germans to sail her to a major port attack on 15 september followed a series of largely unsuccessful raids conducted against tirpitz by royal navy aircraft carriers between april and august 1944 that sought to sink or disable battleship at her anchorage so that she no longer posed a threat to allied convoys travelling to and from soviet union first of these raids was successful but other attacks failed due to shortcomings with fleet air arm s strike aircraft and formidable german defences as a result task of attacking battleship was transferred to raf s bomber command avro lancaster bombers from command s two elite squadrons flew to their staging airfield in soviet union on night of 11 12 september and attacked on 15 september using heavy bombs and air dropped mines all of british aircraft returned to base though one of lancasters later crashed during its flight back to united kingdom following operation paravane german navy s commander decided to use tirpitz as a static artillery battery to protect town of tromso allies were unable to confirm extent of battleship s damage and conducted two further heavy bomber raids against her in late 1944 operation obviate on 29 october and operation catechism on 12 november tirpitz was sunk with considerable loss of life during second of these attacks background from early 1942 tirpitz posed a significant threat to allied convoys transporting supplies through norwegian sea to soviet union stationed in fjords on norwegian coast battleship was capable of overwhelming close escort forces of arctic convoys or breaking out into north atlantic owing to superiority of allied navies tirpitz rarely put to sea and only conducted three brief combat operations into norwegian sea during her career allies needed to keep a powerful force of warships with british home fleet to counter threat she posed and capital ships accompanied most convoys part of way to soviet union royal air force raf heavy bombers conducted a series of abortive raids on tirpitz shortly after battleship arrived in norway from germany in january 1942 tirpitz was initially based at faettenfjord near trondheim which lay within range of british bombers flying from scotland first raid on 30 january involved nine handley page halifax and seven short stirling bombers owing to cloud over target area only one of bombers sighted tirpitz and none inflicted damage one halifax crashed into sea on its way back to scotland and its crew were rescued next raid on faettenfjord took place on 30 march with attacking force comprising 33 halifaxes operation was again frustrated by heavy clouds over target area four of halifaxes were shot down and two others crashed while returning to base another attack was mounted by 30 halifaxes and 11 avro lancasters on night of 27 28 april aircraft of first wave located and attacked tirpitz but no damage was inflicted and five bombers were lost final raid in this series took place next night and involved 21 halifaxes and 12 lancasters attackers found tirpitz covered in a protective smokescreen and battleship again escaped damage two british aircraft were destroyed thumb left upright 1 2 alt black and white photograph of a world war ii era warship in a small bay with a steep and snow covered shoreline clouds of smoke are being blown from shoreline towards ship a british aerial reconnaissance photograph of tirpitz moored at kaafjord in northern norway artificial smoke generators on shores of fjord have not yet obscured her plans for further heavy bomber attacks on tirpitz were developed throughout 1942 none took place one of options considered was to stage bombers through a base in northern soviet union but this was judged impractical as little was known about suitability of soviet airfields for heavy bombers two squadrons of raf coastal command handley page hampden torpedo bombers operated from vaenga in northern russia during mid september 1942 to counter tirpitz or any other german warships which attempted to attack allied convoys but these aircraft did not make contact with ship further plans for air attacks on tirpitz were developed during 1943 but none took place during 1942 and 1943 british inventor barnes wallis tried to develop a version of his bouncing bomb for use against tirpitz alongside larger weapons that were used to attack several german dams during operation chastise on 16 17 may 1943 no 618 squadron was formed in april 1943 and equipped with de havilland mosquitos for this attack but trials of highball bouncing bombs during year were unsuccessful and plan was abandoned in september tirpitz was transferred to a new base at kaafjord in far north of norway in late may 1943 this anchorage was well protected with defences including equipment capable of rapidly generating an artificial smokescreen as well as many anti aircraft guns located in shore batteries and warships during june 1943 consideration was given to attacking battleship with united states army air forces boeing b 17 flying fortress heavy bombers these aircraft would have flown from united kingdom to kaafjord landed in soviet union and made another attack against tirpitz on their return flight such a mission was judged to be impractical by raf as it was expected that german fighter aircraft would attack bombers and kaafjord would be covered by a smokescreen by time they arrived over target area only attack made against tirpitz at kaafjord by land based aircraft prior to september 1944 was a small raid conducted by 15 soviet bombers on night of 10 11 february 1944 but it did not inflict any damage on battleship royal navy attacked tirpitz at kaafjord from september 1943 until august 1944 on 23 september 1943 crews of two british midget submarines penetrated defences around battleship during operation source and placed explosive charges in water beneath her this attack caused extensive damage to tirpitz putting her out of service for six months further midget submarine attacks were not considered feasible and an air raid designated operation tungsten was conducted by royal navy aircraft carriers on 3 april 1944 as repairs to battleship neared completion tirpitz did not suffer heavy damage in this operation but was out of action for several more months while repairs were completed home fleet sortied to attack kaafjord on a further four occasions between april and july all but last of these operations were frustrated by bad weather and operation mascot raid on 17 july did not inflict any damage on tirpitz four more carrier attacks targeting tirpitz were undertaken between 22 and 29 august during operation goodwood but again resulted in only minor damage to battleship planning senior royal navy officers attributed failure of raids conducted between april and august 1944 to shortcomings with fleet air arm s main attack aircraft fairey barracuda although operation tungsten succeeded because germans were taken by surprise during subsequent raids slow speed of barracudas gave kaafjord s defenders time to cover area with artificial smoke before british aircraft arrived over target area moreover barracudas were unable to carry bombs large enough to significantly damage tirpitz when hits were achieved as a result before and after operation goodwood further consideration was given to using mosquitos to attack battleship under initial plans developed in mid august these aircraft would have been launched from aircraft carriers and attacked tirpitz with or armour piercing bombs before landing in northern russia these proposals came to nothing as supreme allied commander of allied expeditionary force general dwight d eisenhower was unwilling to release any mosquitos in july and in august mosquitos were also judged to be too slow to successfully reach kaafjord from aircraft carriers before it was covered by smoke in august raf bomber command which controlled force s heavy bombers began developing plans to strike tirpitz at kaafjord during a meeting on 28 august between head of bomber command air chief marshal sir arthur harris and vice chief of air staff air marshal douglas evill to discuss feasibility of dispatching mosquitos against kaafjord harris stated that he had ready a plan to attack battleship with lancaster bombers under this plan 24 lancasters were to depart a base in far north of scotland bomb tirpitz and return to an airstrip in shetland islands if return trip was judged impossible bombers would instead land at murmansk in northern russia before returning to united kingdom bomber command s staff had contacted soviet officials about latter element of plan and concluded that it would be feasible owing to complex nature of mission bomber command s two elite special duties units no 9 and no 617 squadrons would conduct attack this proposal was viewed favourably and was approved by eisenhower s headquarters on 5 september no 5 group was assigned responsibility for planning attack on tirpitz in late august group s staff officers judged that it was essential for raid to surprise kaafjord s defenders so that battleship was not covered in smoke by time lancasters arrived as seaward approaches to fjord were covered by a comprehensive radar network planners decided that attack force should approach region overland from south east and at a high speed to limit defenders warning time to eight minutes or less due to difficulty of damaging heavily armoured battleship main weapon selected for this operation was tallboy bomb largest then in service with raf and capable of penetrating well protected targets some of bombers were to be armed with johnnie walker commonly called jw mines which were designed to be dropped from aircraft and move through water by rapidly diving and surfacing until they struck their target tallboy had been successfully used by no 617 squadron against tunnels and other facilities but mines had not been used in combat and harris and several other senior raf officers were sceptical of their effectiveness thumb left alt black and white photo of a large bomb being hoisted two men wearing military uniforms are standing below bomb and steadying it with their hands a tallboy bomb being hoisted from a bomb dump prior to being used in a raid during 1944 as test flights conducted by no 617 squadron proved that it was not possible to make a return trip to kaafjord from scotland and an evaluation of main airstrip in shetland determined that it was unsuitable for lancasters no 5 group s staff officers judged that it would be necessary for aircraft to refuel in soviet union detailed investigation of airstrips near murmansk found that they were at best marginal for heavy bombers and had almost no accommodation or aircraft servicing facilities moreover airstrips were vulnerable to attack from fighters operating from nearby german bases instead it was decided that attack force should fly over northern sweden and finland after raiding kaafjord and refuel at yagodnik airstrip which was on an island near arkhangelsk this plan was accepted by air ministry on 6 september soviet naval aviation offered to attack german fighter bases at same time as british bombers arrived over target area but no 5 group rejected this proposal and requested that soviet aircraft not fly near kaafjord to avoid alerting germans also in early september five aircraft from no 192 squadron which specialised in monitoring enemy radars conducted sorties to locate german radar stations in northern norway and identify any gaps in their coverage operation order setting out how raid was to be conducted was issued by no 5 group on 7 september it stated that kaafjord was believed to be protected by 16 heavy and 16 light anti aircraft guns as well as tirpitzs guns and that it took defenders ten minutes to cover battleship with a smokescreen attack force was to be organised into two groups force a comprising twelve lancasters from no 9 squadron and an equal number from no 617 squadron armed with a single tallboy each was to continue to yagodnik after bombing force b was to comprise six lancasters from each of squadrons armed with twelve jw mines and return directly to either scotland or shetland islands a lancaster from raf film unit which was attached to no 463 squadron raaf would accompany force b and also return to united kingdom after bombers completed their attack it was intended that attack would be conducted in daylight and that lancasters would assemble into formations near kaafjord before attacking if fjord was covered by cloud or smoke force a was ordered to not drop its valuable bombs and continue onto yagodnik force b was directed to drop jw mines regardless of cloud or smoke cover as long as an aiming point could be identified entire attack group was to maintain strict radio silence two no 511 squadron consolidated b 24 liberator transport aircraft were assigned to carry maintenance personnel and supplies from united kingdom to yagodnik and a mosquito fitted for photo reconnaissance tasks from no 540 squadron would scout ahead of attack force all aircrew were briefed on this plan on either 8 or 9 september group captain c c mcmullen commander of no 9 squadron s home base of raf bardney was appointed overall leader of detachment no 617 squadron s commanding officer wing commander willy tait was selected to lead strike force to provide weather reports and damage assessments from kaafjord agents on ground were needed but last radio group in area had in may 1944 first attempt at re establishing a presence near tirpitz occurred in august 1944 when a norwegian secret intelligence service sis agent was dispatched to nearby village of alta agent infiltrated with a radio transmitter codenamed sinding from neutral sweden but only managed to begin transmissions to united kingdom on 22 september too late for preparation stage for operation in a second attempt at establishing an agent group in area norwegian sis agents knut moe and anton arild were dropped by parachute into wilderness between kaafjord and alta on 8 september by an american operation carpetbagger liberator during drop agents became separated from most of their equipment with exception of radio transmitter without weapons and equipment agents were forced to relocate to village of bossekop where moe s mother lived radio transmitter operated by sis team codenamed aslaug was operational by 13 september sending weather reports to united kingdom every other hour as well as reporting on weather moe and arild radioed assessments of damage tirpitz had suffered in air attacks prior to operation paravane local contacts helped agents in spying on tirpitz before and after 15 september attack by time of attack moe and arild had established an observation post overlooking tirpitzs anchorage in kaafjord preparations attack force was placed on alert to launch what had been designated operation paravane on 8 september good weather was vital for operation and airmen waited at their home bases for next two days as forecasts proved unfavourable meanwhile air ministry no 5 group and british military liaison officers in ussr continued to work with relevant soviet headquarters to finalise arrangements for force a s flight from norway to yagodnik subsequent forecasts indicated that weather conditions at kaafjord were changing rapidly and during morning of 11 september harris judged that it would not be feasible to launch bombers from scotland with confidence that kaafjord would be free of cloud by time they arrived accordingly he decided to change plans for operation with all of bombers now flying to yagodnik first and mounting attack from that airfield harris ordered attack force to depart that afternoon before advising air ministry or soviets of change in plans both british bomber squadrons began to take off at 5pm local time no 9 squadron dispatched 18 lancasters from raf bardney and 20 no 617 squadron lancasters departed from raf woodhall spa a total of 26 lancasters were armed with tallboys and remainder with jw mines film unit lancaster also flew out of bardney carrying three raf cameramen as well as an associated press journalist and a radio reporter from bbc liberators departed bardney just before bombers carrying mcmullen maintenance personnel and spare parts no 540 squadron mosquito left bardney

remaining aircraft passed over neutral sweden where aircrew most of whom had only conducted night flying over countries observing blackouts were pleased to see towns lit up after crossing gulf of bothnia lancasters continued over finland towards ussr several aircraft were fired on by swedish finnish and soviet anti aircraft defences but only one suffered any damage despite pre departure forecasts of good weather force encountered thick clouds after entering finnish airspace this continued for remainder of flight conditions made navigation difficult and forced pilots to fly at a low altitude so that they could use features on ground to determine their location only 26 of lancasters were able to locate yagodnik and land there during morning of 12 september other 13 touching down at other airfields or crash landing in open spaces five or six of latter aircraft were written off and two of seven which eventually reached yagodnik were too badly damaged to be used in operations despite number of crashes none of airmen on board these aircraft were injured mcmullen recorded that it was extraordinary that so few crashes occurred given adverse circumstances and that majority of aircraft dispatched could have been destroyed after being concentrated at yagodnik attack force was readied to strike kaafjord soviet personnel at airfield provided considerable assistance but process of refuelling aircraft could not be completed until 13 september due to inadequate facilities ground crew also repaired some of damaged bombers in some cases with parts salvaged from aircraft which had been written off british officers and senior non commissioned officers were accommodated in a boat and all other personnel slept in overcrowded underground huts both boat and huts were infested with bed bugs and almost all of airmen were bitten before accommodation was fumigated by detachment s medical officer by morning of 14 september 26 lancasters from attack forces and film unit aircraft were ready 20 of bombers were armed with tallboys and remainder with jw mines mosquito took off bound for kaafjord at 2 10am but planned departure of bombers at 8 00am was cancelled when it returned to yagodnik at 6 45 and reported that conditions over target area were unsuitable for remainder of day soviets provided hospitality including a formal lunch a football tournament and a film that night some of allied airmen were disturbed to see political prisoners being beaten by overseers while undertaking forced labour work on repairing damaged lancasters also continued on 14 september and an additional tallboy armed aircraft was ready by next morning plans for raid were further adjusted while no 9 and no 617 squadrons were waiting at yagodnik lancasters were to take off together and fly at low altitude until they reached border between finland and ussr to avoid detection by german radar stations located around kirkenes force a aircraft would then climb to around and six force b bombers to three lancasters from no 9 squadron would proceed ahead of main body to determine wind conditions over kaafjord when main body reached a position around from fjord at which point british expected that germans would have detected bombers lancasters would move into attack formations and commence their bombing run it was decided that all of aircraft should attack simultaneously with force a flying in four groups of five aircraft which would approach kaafjord from south and drop tallboys from altitudes between and force b was to fly in two lines abreast pass over fjord from south east to north west and release jw mines from between and attack no 540 squadron mosquito reconnoitred kaafjord again in morning of 15 september and at 7am yagodnik time reported that conditions were suitable for an attack 27 bombers and film unit lancaster began taking off shortly afterwards aircraft flew in a loose formation and journey to northern norway went as planned though six lancasters were forced to abort and return to yagodnik despite passing near several german bases british force was undetected and no german fighters were airborne over kaafjord at time of attack thumb left alt black and white film of attack described in article a film showing tirpitz under attack during operations paravane and catechism kaafjord s defenders detected lancasters approximately ten minutes before they arrived and protective smokescreen was beginning to form when attack commenced at 10 55am gmt only first group of lancasters led by tait were able to aim their bombs at tirpitz before she was obscured by smoke it is believed that bomb dropped from tait s aircraft struck battleship and other bombs dropped by this group landed in water nearby all other force a aircraft aimed their tallboys at anti aircraft gunfire rising from ship 17 of weapons were dropped several lancasters made more than one pass over target area as their bomb aimers sought to locate tirpitz or technical problems prevented their tallboy from being dropped on initial pass force b commenced its attack after tallboy lancasters had completed theirs so that shock waves from bomb explosions did not prematurely set off jw mines as none of force b aircrew were able to spot tirpitz due to smokescreen they dropped mines on battleship s estimated position these weapons did not cause any damage smokescreen over kaafjord prevented allied aircrew from being able to assess results of their bombing though several large spouts of water and explosions were observed tait was also pleased to see a column of black smoke rising through smokescreen some of bombs and mines landed up to a mile from battleship tirpitzs anti aircraft guns and a further 98 guns located in nearby shore batteries and warships fired on bombers throughout attack but only four lancasters suffered any damage all of lancasters had completed their attacks by 11 gmt and 21 bombers began return journey to yagodnik force a aircraft which had not been able to bomb brought their tallboys back this flight proved uneventful and all 27 lancasters landed at yagodnik in evening film unit aircraft flew directly from kaafjord to united kingdom and arrived at its home station after a fifteen and a half hour flight this was longest operational lancaster mission of world war ii mosquito conducted a reconnaissance sortie over kaafjord on afternoon of 15 september arriving at about 1 30pm gmt its crew found that fjord was covered with cloud and smoke they could briefly see tirpitz and reported that no damage was evident to battleship which remained afloat mosquito conducted further reconnaissance sorties on 16 september but fjord was completely obscured on all occasions mcmullen considered launching a second attack but decided against doing so as only two tallboys and one load of jw mines were available aftermath tirpitz was rendered unfit for combat by operation paravane tallboy bomb that struck battleship passed through foredeck and hull and exploded in water on starboard side of her bow this damage wrecked bow and left battleship s forward compartments flooded with 2 000 tons of water explosions of several other tallboys in water near tirpitz also buckled some of her hull plates and bulkheads battleship s casualties were not heavy with five men killed and fifteen wounded damage was assessed as needing nine months worth of work to repair after reporting on damage tirpitzs commanding officer kapitan zur see wolf junge recommended to german navy s high command that battleship be removed from service attack force returned to united kingdom in several groups tait led 16 lancasters out of yagodnik in evening of 16 september most of these aircraft flew over southern finland sweden and denmark one of lancasters went off course and crashed on a mountain near in norway killing all eleven airmen aboard only allied casualties of operation paravane nine other lancasters departed on 17 september followed by five next day and two on 21 september remaining lancasters had been judged to be damaged beyond repair and were handed over to soviets mosquito which had been damaged by anti aircraft fire during a sortie over kaafjord returned once repairs were complete on 26 september two liberators were final aircraft to depart and flew out of yagodnik carrying mcmullen on 27 september following attack british intelligence services sought to determine extent of tirpitzs damage during late september norwegian sis agents in kaafjord area reported that battleship had been struck by a bomb and appeared damaged german radio signals that were intercepted and decoded on 25 and 29 september also stated that tirpitz had suffered a single hit from a large bomb photographs taken by no 540 squadron mosquito and a soviet aircraft on 20 september indicated that bow of ship was damaged though it was not possible to determine how badly drawing on this evidence royal navy s naval intelligence division concluded on 30 september that tirpitz had almost certainly been struck by a tallboy and may have been further damaged by near misses and that damage to ship may have been considerable and rendered her unable to put to sea a report from a norwegian agent on 30 september was more specific stating that tirpitz had suffered a direct hit which had opened a gash on her bow further agent reports in early october provided little new evidence by late october with no major german warships left in kaafjord agents operating aslaug transmitter left area sending their last transmission to united kingdom on 22 october moe and arild made their way on foot across plateau to kautokeino and from there through finland to in sweden arriving on 5 december agents carried out march without of food as operation carpetbagger had ceased using soviet airbases after a liberator was inadvertently shot down by a soviet fighter during a follow up operation to finnmark shortly after insertion of moe and arild a meeting involving grossadmiral karl donitz commander of german navy was held in berlin on 23 september to discuss damage to tirpitz donitz was informed that it would take nine months to repair ship and that all work had to be done at kaafjord as battleship would be extremely vulnerable if she tried to sail to a major port as soviet forces were also rapidly advancing towards northern norway donitz judged that it was not feasible to either return ship to ocean going service or retain her at kaafjord instead he decided to use tirpitz as a floating artillery battery to defend town of tromso donitz also expressed hope that retaining ship in commission would continue to tie down enemy forces and by her presence confound enemies intentions commander of german navy s task force in northern norway konteradmiral rudolf peters was accordingly directed to anchor tirpitz at a location near tromso where water was shallow enough to prevent battleship from sinking completely if she suffered further damage as intelligence available to them was not conclusive allies believed that tirpitz still posed a potential threat accordingly nos 9 and 617 squadrons made two further attacks on battleship after she moved to tromso on 15 october these operations were more straightforward to conduct than operation paravane as port was within range of lancasters flying from airfields in northern scotland first raid operation obviate took place on 29 october but caused only minor damage to battleship during subsequent attack conducted on 12 november operation catechism
