sr merchant navy class originally known as 21c1 class and later informally known as bulleid pacifics spam cans or packets is a class of air smoothed 4 6 2 pacific steam locomotives designed for southern railway by oliver bulleid pacific design was chosen in preference to several others proposed by bulleid first members of class were constructed during second world war and last of 30 locomotives in 1949 incorporating a number of new developments in british steam locomotive technology design of merchant navy class was among first to use welding in construction process this enabled easier fabrication of components during austerity of war and post war economies arlett 1989 pp 29 30 in addition locomotives featured thermic syphons in their boilers and controversial bulleid chain driven valve gear class members were named after merchant navy shipping lines involved in battle of atlantic and latterly those which used southampton docks a publicity masterstroke by southern railway which operated southampton docks during period burridge 1975 p 60 due to problems with some of more novel features of bulleid s design all members of class were modified by british railways during late 1950s losing their air smoothed casings in process merchant navy class operated until end of southern steam in july 1967 a third of class has survived and can be seen on heritage railways throughout great britain background southern railway was most financially successful of big four but this was largely based on investment in suburban and main line electrification whitehouse thomas p 49 after successful introduction of sr schools class in 1930 railway had lagged behind others in terms of modernising its ageing fleet of steam locomotives following retirement of general manager of southern railway sir herbert walker and richard maunsell chief mechanical engineer cme in 1937 their successors considered that time had come to change this situation whitehouse thomas p 59 in march 1938 new general manager gilbert szlumper authorised oliver bulleid maunsell s replacement to prepare designs for twenty express passenger locomotives bradley 1976 p 3 52 deteriorating international situation prior to second world war was an additional factor in this decision bulleid s first suggestion was for an eight coupled locomotive with a 4 8 2 wheel arrangement for heavily loaded golden arrow and night ferry continental express trains although this was quickly modified to a 2 8 2 equipped with a helmholtz bissel bogie a system already successfully applied on continent bulleid 1977 pp 52 53 however both proposals for eight coupled locomotives were resisted by southern railway s chief civil engineer so a new 4 6 2 pacific design was settled upon instead harvey 2004 pp 6 9 new design was intended for express passenger and semi fast work in southern england though it had to be equally adept at freight workings due to nominal mixed traffic classification bulleid applied to class for them to be built during wartime administrative measures had been put in place by wartime government preventing construction of express passenger locomotives due to shortages of materials and a need for locomotives with freight hauling capabilities creer morrison 2001 p 7 classifying a design as mixed traffic neatly circumvented this restriction design most of detailed design for merchant navy class was undertaken by drawing office at brighton works but some work was also undertaken by ashford and eastleigh this division of responsibility was possibly due to bulleid s wish to restrict knowledge of new class to a limited number of personnel bradley 1976 p 4 design incorporated a number of novel features compared to then current steam locomotive practice in great britain cylinders valve gear wheels and brakes thumb 300px bulleid chain valve gear three diameter cylinders drove centre coupled axle inside cylinder was steeply inclined at 1 7 5 but outside cylinders were horizontal locomotive publishing co 1945 p 49 it was originally intended to use a gear driven valve gear but space restrictions within frames and wartime material shortages led bulleid to design his novel chain driven valve gear this component was unique amongst british locomotive design practices chain driven valve gear diagram retrieved 13 april 2007 it later gained a bad reputation because it could cause highly irregular valve events a problem compounded by fast moving bulleid steam reverser entire system was located in a sealed oil bath another unique design providing constant lubrication to moving parts locomotives were equipped with unusual 6 ft 2 in 1 88 m bulleid firth brown bfb driving wheels which were lighter yet stronger than spoked equivalent these proved to be successful and were later used on other bulleid classes leading bogie was based upon that of sr lord nelson class although it had a 6 ft 3 in 1 90 m wheelbase as opposed to maunsell s 7 ft 6 in 2 28 m design and featured 3 ft 1 in 0 94 m bfb wheels a long coupled driving wheelbase was incorporated into design to keep locomotives within lineal loading of southern railway s narrower bridges supporting rear trailing truck was a one piece steel casting that gave smoothest of rides design was utilised in future br standard class 7 thumb left upright alt an almost solid disc not spoked locomotive wheel with a series of cast in radial indentations and prominent round holes intended to reduce its weight a driving wheel of distinctive bulleid firth brown design seen here on 35010 blue star note balance weight on lower right a feature not present on merchant navy locomotives as built spaces between driving wheels housed steam powered clasp brakes that gripped wheels by way of a scissor action two middle brake hangers held two brake blocks each whilst two outside hanger on leading and rear driving wheels held one block each bradley 1976 p 9 these were connected together by outside for ease of access and whole system was operated from footplate boiler and welded firebox maximum boiler pressure was higher than any other british regular service locomotive except gwr county class at 280 psi bulleid decided on cheaper all welded fireboxes for boilers as opposed to more common riveted construction and a steel inner firebox which was lighter than a more usual copper example two welded steel thermic syphons were implemented to improve water circulation around firebox and these were subcontracted to beyer peacock however he soon discovered that southern railway lacked facilities to manufacture welded boilers of this size bradley 1976 p 8 so first ten boilers were ordered on outside contract from north british locomotive company air smoothed casing smokebox and blastpipe thumb british india line hauling bournemouth belle in 1946 boiler was enveloped by bulleid s air smoothed sheet steel casing which was not for purposes of streamlining as demonstrated by extremely flat front end but as a way of lifting exhaust gases bradley 1976 p 10 flat sides were also an aid to cleaning locomotive with mechanical carriage washers representing an attempt to reduce labour costs creer morrison 2001 p 21 it followed profile of belpaire firebox and extended to a curved profile forward of smokebox front spun glass mattresses were used for boiler lagging smokebox was a sheet metal fabrication to same profile as firebox acting as a former to maintain shape of air smoothed casing in between casing was supported by channel section steel crinolines strengtheners used to maintain shape attached to frames smokebox housed five nozzle lemaitre blastpipe arranged in a circle within a large diameter chimney tender bulleid designed a new tender which could carry 5 tons 5 1 t of coal on a six wheel chassis it featured bfb wheels and streamlined panels or raves that gave top of tender a similar cross sectional outline to carriages hauled by locomotive water tank was of welded sheet construction to save weight and tender was fitted with vacuum braking equipment of a clasp type similar to that used on locomotive three train brake vacuum reservoirs of cylindrical construction were grouped on tank top behind coal space unusually for a british locomotive two extra water filler caps were incorporated into tender front for access from footplate original tender design proved to be inadequately braced and subject to serious leakage if even slightly damaged or when water surges caused welded joints to split problem was not solved until 1944 when additional baffling was fitted other innovations electric lighting was also provided on both locomotive and footplate supplied by a steam powered generator fitted below footplate bulleids in retrospect gauges were lit by ultra violet light this enabled clearer night time vision of boiler steam pressure gauge and brake pipe vacuum gauge whilst eliminating dazzle making it easier for crew to see signals along track close attention was also paid to ergonomics of driving cab which was designed with controls required for operation grouped according to needs of both fireman and driver thus promoting safe operation day lewis 1964 pp 149 150 as an aid to fireman a steam operated treadle was provided that used steam pressure to open firehole doors where coal is shovelled into firebox footplate was entirely enclosed improving crew working conditions in winter construction for construction history of class see list of sr merchant navy class locomotives southern railway placed an order for ten of new locomotives to be built at eastleigh works although boilers had to be supplied from private industry and tenders were built at ashford prototype was completed in february 1941 numbered 21c1 and named channel packet at a ceremony at eastleigh works on 10 march 1941 it underwent extensive trials and minor modifications before joining southern railway stock 4 june 1941 a second prototype 21c2 union castle was completed in june and named at victoria railway station 4 july both prototypes were found to be seven tons over specified weight and at insistence of southern railway civil engineer production of remainder was halted until steps were taken to remedy this this was achieved by using thinner steel plates for frame stretchers and covering boiler cladding and enlarging existing lightening holes in main frames remaining eight locomotives in batch were delivered between september 1941 and july 1942 a second batch of ten followed beginning in december 1944 and culminating in june 1945 these were entirely constructed at eastleigh and equipped with tenders harvey 2004 p 33 merchant navy class spawned design and construction of a lighter version of same locomotive with consequently increased route availability these were west country and battle of britain class light pacifics first of which entered service in 1945 just prior to nationalisation of railways in 1948 southern railway placed an order for ten more merchant navy locomotives with larger tenders a shortage of materials meant that delivery was delayed until september 1948 and completed in 1949 batch never carried southern railway numbers herring 2000 pp 148 149 156 157 eastleigh was responsible for construction of final batch which were in series harvey 2004 pp 46 50 construction was undertaken in house by eastleigh works with boilers and tenders constructed at brighton frames at ashford and rest at eastleigh these were equipped with wedge shaped cab fronts from outset and greater use of welding ensured lighter locomotives batch was also fitted with tia traitement integral armand chemical feed water equipment used on light pacifics this precipitated scale forming constituents in hard water of southern england into a non adhesive mud that could be cleared from locomotive using a manual blow down valve bradley 1976 p 22 a delay in construction of new larger tenders for new locomotives meant that some were fitted with smaller examples intended for use with light pacifics that were under construction at time two spare boilers for class were also constructed at brighton and eastleigh during 1950 1 numbering and naming locomotives for details of merchant navy class locomotive names see list of sr merchant navy class locomotives thumb left alt a merchant navy class enamelled metal nameplate mounted on side of locomotive boiler nameplate comprises a circle containing a picture of company flag of shipping line and two rectangles on either side containing class name in a larger circle bordering central flag is name of shipping line nameplate configuration of merchant navy class here 35005 canadian pacific bulleid adopted a new numbering scheme for all his locomotives based on continental practice following his experiences at french branch of westinghouse electric before first world war and those of his tenure in rail operating department during that conflict southern railway numbers followed an adaptation of uic classification system of using letters and numbers to designate powered and unpowered axles together with a running number thus first 4 6 2 locomotive became 21c1 where 2 and 1 refer to number of unpowered leading and trailing axles respectively and c refers to number of driving axles in this case three remainder were numbered 21c2 scheme was abandoned by british railways in 1949 and existing locomotives were renumbered under british railways standard system in series 35001 final batch appeared in traffic as 35020 ian allan abc 1958 59 mn southern railway considered naming locomotives after victories of second world war to extent that a mocked up nameplate river plate was produced in event when early successes for british proved few and far between chairman of union castle line suggested naming them after shipping companies which had called at southampton docks in peacetime southern e group 2004 bulleid mn merchant navy class 4 6 2 retrieved april 16 2007 for details of naming process this idea resonated in 1941 because shipping lines were heavily involved in atlantic convoys to and from britain during second world war burridge 1975 p 61 a new design of nameplate was created featuring a circular plate with a smaller circle in centre inner circle carried colours of shipping company on a stylised flag on an air force blue background around outer circle was name of locomotive picked out in gilt lettering a horizontal rectangular plate was attached to either side of circular nameplate with merchant navy class in gilt lettering this acted as a class plate as indicated on nameplate photograph above left during their operational career class gained several nicknames most obvious bulleid pacific simply denoted designer and wheel arrangement colloquial name spam can arose from their utilitarian appearance enhanced by flat boxy air smoothed casing and resemblance of this to distinctive tin cans in which spam was sold nickname packets was also adopted by locomotive drivers as first member of class was named channel packet operational details as class appeared during war there were no heavily laden continental boat trains from dover and folkestone for which they had been designed they were however used on express trains on south western main line to southampton and to exeter in august 1945 a series of test runs were made between london victoria and dover and from october class were used on resumed continental expresses bradley 1976 p 19 prestigious bournemouth belle pullman train was reinstated in october 1946 and entrusted to class for next two decades however their heavy axle loading and length meant that they were banned from many areas of southern railway and later british railways southern region network subsequent development as mentioned main production batch of southern built locomotives differed from two prototypes channel packet and union castle steam operated firehole door treadle was removed and a new type of boiler cladding was utilised in response to worsening supply situation during second world war harvey 2004 p 21 modification was also made to air smoothed casing surrounding smokebox after reports were made of drifting smoke obscuring locomotive crew s vision ahead initially only form of smoke deflection was a narrow slot in front of chimney intended to enable air to lift smoke when locomotive was travelling this proved inadequate because of relatively soft exhaust blast that came from multiple jet blastpipe which failed to be caught by air flow harvey 2004 p 25 after several trials air flow was increased by extending casing roof over front of smokebox to form a cowling whilst side smoke deflector plates were also incorporated into front of air smoothed casing latter added to poor visibility from footplate and expedients combined never fully solved smoke drift problem harvey 2004 p 40 thumb belgian marine during 1948 locomotive exchange trials during time they operated under southern railway further modifications were applied to class such as reduction in boiler pressure to and redesign of footplate spectacle plates whitehouse thomas p 61 these are small windows on front face of cab which were redesigned to a wedge shaped profile a feature to be seen on all bulleid designed locomotives post nationalisation they had been introduced in britain in 1934 with gresley designed cock o north originally spectacle plates of bulleid pacifics were at conventional right angle to direction of locomotive and offered limited vision ahead along air smoothed casing creer morrison 2001 pp 40 41 southern built batches also had variations in material used for air smoothed casing with a change from sheet steel to an asbestos compound forced upon manufacturer by wartime expediency harvey 2004 p 21 this resulted in several class members having a horizontal strengthening rib running down length of casing final southern railway initiated experiment involved equipping canadian pacific with a berkeley mechanical stoker imported from canada little improvement in performance was seen when trialled under british railways auspices in 1948 and locomotive was re converted to hand firing as mentioned british railways batch had detail differences to previous versions most significant modification was reduction of weight using lighter materials unavailable during wartime from 1952 air smoothed casing ahead of cylinders was removed to ease maintenance and lubrication harvey 2004 p 50 this coincided with removal of tender raves on all locomotives as they quickly rotted obstructed packing of coal into bunker and restricted driver s view when reversing locomotive southern e group 2008 removal of raves retrieved 14 september 2009 resultant cut down tender included new enclosed storage for fire irons revised step ladders and glass spectacle plates to protect crew from flying coal dust when running tender first southern e group 2008 tender modifications retrieved 14 september 2009 performance of unmodified locomotives thumb united states lines hauling bournemouth belle in 1950 new locomotives demonstrated that they could generate enormous power using mediocre quality fuel due largely to bulleid s excellent boiler they also ran very smoothly at high speed bradley 1976 pp 11 14 partly as a result of having so many novel features first few years of service by merchant navy class were beset by a variety of technical problems some of these were merely teething troubles but others remained with class throughout their working lives these may be summarised as follows adhesion problems locomotives were often prone to wheelslip and required very careful driving when starting a heavy train from rest but once into their stride they were noted for their free running excellent steam production and being remarkably stable when hauling heavy expresses maintenance problems chain driven valve gear proved to be expensive to maintain and subject to rapid wear leaks from oil bath onto wheels caused oil to splash onto boiler lagging in service once saturated with oil lagging attracted coal dust and ash which provided a combustible material and as a result of heavy braking of locomotives sparks would set lagging on fire underneath air smoothed casing southern e group 2004 bulleid mn merchant navy class 4 6 2 notes from a bulleid fundamentalist retrieved 16 april 2007 for details on lagging fires which were common on both merchant navys and light pacifics fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto wheels when stationary to be flung upwards into boiler lagging in service southern e group 2004 bulleid mn merchant navy class 4 6 2 notes from a bulleid fundamentalist retrieved 25 august 2010 for cause of lagging fires which were common on both merchant navys and light pacifics in either case local fire brigade would invariably be called to put fire out with cold water coming into contact with hot boiler causing stress to casing many photographs show an unmodified locomotive with a buckled warped casing result of a lagging fire high fuel consumption this became very apparent in 1948 locomotive exchange trials and at trials at rugby locomotive testing plant in 1952 bradley 1976 pp 31 35 restricted driver visibility due to air smoothed casing exhaust problem was never adequately resolved and continued to beat down onto air smoothed casing when engine was on move obscuring driver s vision from cab creer morrison 2001 p 13 as a result of these problems in 1954 serious consideration was given to scrapping class and replacing them with britannia class locomotives bradley 1976 p 38 however locomotives had excellent boilers and several other good features and so decision was taken to rebuild them removing several of bulleid s less successful ideas incident at crewkerne on 24 april 1953 crank axle on central driving wheel of no 35020 bibby line fractured whilst approaching crewkerne station at speed leigh 1993 p 6 no one was injured but incident resulted in withdrawal of all merchant navy class locomotives from service whilst cause was ascertained leigh 1993 p 9 an examination of other class members showed that fracture caused by metal fatigue was a common fault leigh 1993 p 8 to cover motive power shortage caused by mass withdrawal of thirty locomotives classes from other british railways regions were drafted in to deputise leigh and strange 1993 p 13 incident resulted in a redesign and replacement of crank axle modification partially because of crewkerne incident and due to incessant modification of bulleid s original design british railways took decision to rebuild entire class to a more conventional design by r g jarvis adopting many features from br standard locomotive classes that had been introduced since 1950 southern e group 2004 modified bulleid mn merchant navy class 4 6 2 retrieved 16 april 2007 for more pictures of rebuilt locomotives air smoothed casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding and chain driven valve gear was replaced with three separate sets of walschaerts valve gear creer morrison 2001 p 94 rebuilds were provided with a completely revised cylindrical smokebox a new lord nelson type chimney and lms style smoke deflectors together with lack of air smoothed casing these helped reduce problem of smoke and steam obscuring driver s vision of line creer morrison 2001 pp 74 75 fast moving and unpredictable bulleid steam reverser was replaced with a screw link version whilst mechanical lubricators were

locomotive to be released from eastleigh was 35018 british india line in 1956 final example 35028 clan line was completed in 1960 success of modification programme for merchant navy class was also to influence design of future modification of 60 light pacifics creer morrison 2001 p 96 performance of modified locomotives there is no doubt that rebuilding class solved most of maintenance problems whilst retaining good features thereby creating excellent locomotives one minor drawback was that modifieds put greater loads on track as a result of hammerblow caused by balance weights for outside walschaerts valve gear whereas original valve gear design was largely self balanced on 26 june 1967 35003 royal mail recorded highest speed ever for class hauling a train comprising three carriages and two parcels vans 164 tons tare 180 tons gross between and waterloo mile between milepost 38 and milepost 37 located between and was covered in 34 seconds a speed of 105 88 mph this was also last authenticated speed in excess of 100 mph achieved by a steam locomotive in united kingdom until same mark was attained in 2017 by tornado withdrawal their principal work was on south western main line to southampton and bournemouth until 1967 however main reason why class began to be withdrawn in 1964 was transfer of main line between salisbury and exeter to western region and introduction of warship class diesel hydraulic locomotives on these services rebuilt locomotives were therefore withdrawn relatively soon after their rebuilding whilst still in excellent condition first two to be withdrawn were second prototype union castle and rotterdam lloyd in february 1964 nearly half of class had been withdrawn by end of 1965 but seven survived until end of steam on southern region in
