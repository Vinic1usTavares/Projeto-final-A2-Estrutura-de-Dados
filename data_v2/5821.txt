hydrogen is chemical element with symbol h and atomic number 1 with a standard atomic weight of hydrogen is lightest element in periodic table hydrogen is most abundant chemical substance in universe constituting roughly 75 of all baryonic mass however most of universe s mass is not in form of baryons or chemical elements see dark matter and dark energy non remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in plasma state most common isotope of hydrogen termed protium name rarely used symbol 1h has one proton and no neutrons universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during recombination epoch big bang at standard temperature and pressure hydrogen is a colorless odorless tasteless non toxic nonmetallic highly combustible diatomic gas with molecular formula h2 since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements most of hydrogen on earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid base reactions because most acid base reactions involve exchange of protons between soluble molecules in ionic compounds hydrogen can take form of a negative charge i e anion when it is known as a hydride or as a positively charged i e cation species denoted by symbol h hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton but in reality hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex as only neutral atom for which schrodinger equation can be solved analytically study of energetics and bonding of hydrogen atom has played a key role in development of quantum mechanics hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in early 16th century by reaction of acids on metals in 1766 81 henry cavendish was first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance and that it produces water when burned property for which it was later named in greek hydrogen means water former industrial production is mainly from steam reforming natural gas and less often from more energy intensive methods such as electrolysis of water most hydrogen is used near site of its production two largest uses being fossil fuel processing e g hydrocracking and ammonia production

hindenburg airship was a notorious example of hydrogen combustion and cause is still debated visible orange flames in that incident were result of a rich mixture of hydrogen to oxygen combined with carbon compounds from airship skin reactants h2 reacts with every oxidizing element hydrogen can react spontaneously and violently at room temperature with chlorine and fluorine to form corresponding hydrogen halides hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride which are also potentially dangerous acids electron energy levels thumb right depiction of a hydrogen atom with size of central proton shown

their relative diameters ground state energy level of electron in a hydrogen atom is 13 6 ev which is equivalent to an ultraviolet photon of roughly 91 nm wavelength energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using bohr model of atom which electron as orbiting proton in analogy to earth s orbit of sun however atomic electron and proton are held together by electromagnetic force while planets and celestial objects are held by gravity because of of angular momentum postulated in early quantum mechanics by bohr electron in bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from proton and therefore only certain allowed energies a more accurate description of hydrogen atom comes from a purely quantum mechanical treatment that uses schrodinger equation dirac equation or even feynman path integral formulation to calculate probability density of electron around proton most complicated treatments allow for small effects of special relativity and vacuum polarization in quantum mechanical treatment electron in a ground state hydrogen atom has no angular momentum at all illustrating how planetary orbit differs from electron motion elemental molecular forms thumb upright first tracks observed in liquid hydrogen bubble chamber at bevatron alt two bright circles on dark background both contain numerous thin black lines inside there exist two different spin isomers of hydrogen diatomic molecules that differ by relative spin of their nuclei in orthohydrogen form spins of two protons are parallel and form a triplet state with a molecular spin quantum number of 1 in parahydrogen form spins are antiparallel and form a singlet with a molecular spin quantum number of 0 at standard temperature and pressure hydrogen gas contains about 25 of para form and 75 of ortho form also known as normal form equilibrium ratio of orthohydrogen to parahydrogen depends on temperature but because ortho form is an excited state and has a higher energy than para form it is unstable and cannot be purified at very low temperatures equilibrium state is composed almost exclusively of para form liquid and gas phase thermal properties of pure parahydrogen differ significantly from those of normal form because of differences in rotational heat capacities as discussed more fully in spin isomers of hydrogen ortho para distinction also occurs in other hydrogen containing molecules or functional groups such as water and methylene but is of little significance for their thermal properties interconversion between para and ortho h2 increases with increasing temperature thus rapidly condensed h2 contains large quantities of high energy ortho form that converts to para form very slowly ortho para ratio in condensed h2 is an important consideration in preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen conversion from ortho to para is exothermic and produces enough heat to evaporate some of hydrogen liquid leading to loss of liquefied material catalysts for ortho para interconversion such as ferric oxide activated carbon asbestos rare earth metals uranium compounds chromic oxide or some nickel compounds are used during hydrogen cooling phases gaseous hydrogen liquid hydrogen slush hydrogen solid hydrogen metallic hydrogen compounds covalent and organic compounds while h2 is not very reactive under standard conditions it does form compounds with most elements hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electronegative such as halogens e g f cl br i or oxygen in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge when bonded to a more electronegative element particularly fluorine oxygen or nitrogen hydrogen can participate in a form of medium strength bonding with another electronegative element with a lone pair a phenomenon called hydrogen bonding that is critical to stability of many biological molecules iupac compendium of chemical terminology electronic version hydrogen bond hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements such as metals and metalloids where it takes on a partial negative charge these compounds are often known as hydrides hydrogen forms a vast array of compounds with carbon called hydrocarbons and an even vaster array with heteroatoms that because of their general association with living things are called organic compounds study of their properties is known as organic chemistry and their study in context of living organisms is known as biochemistry by some definitions organic compounds are only required to contain carbon however most of them also contain hydrogen and because it is carbon hydrogen bond which gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics carbon hydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of word organic in chemistry millions of hydrocarbons are known and they are usually formed by complicated synthetic pathways that seldom involve elemental hydrogen hydrides compounds of hydrogen are often called hydrides a term that is used fairly loosely term hydride suggests that h atom has acquired a negative or anionic character denoted h and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more electropositive element existence of hydride anion suggested by gilbert n lewis in 1916 for group 1 and 2 salt like hydrides was demonstrated by moers in 1920 by electrolysis of molten lithium hydride lih producing a stoichiometric quantity of hydrogen at anode for hydrides other than group 1 and 2 metals term is quite misleading considering low electronegativity of hydrogen an exception in group 2 hydrides is which is polymeric in lithium aluminium hydride anion carries centers firmly attached to al iii although hydrides can be formed with almost all main group elements number and combination of possible compounds varies widely for example more than 100 binary hydrides are known but only one binary aluminium hydride binary indium hydride has not yet been identified although larger complexes exist in inorganic chemistry hydrides can also serve as bridging ligands that link two metal centers in a coordination complex this function is particularly common in group 13 elements especially in boranes boron hydrides and aluminium complexes as well as in clustered protons and acids oxidation of hydrogen removes its electron and gives h which contains no electrons and a nucleus which is usually composed of one proton that is why is often called a proton this species is central to discussion of acids under bronsted lowry acid base theory acids are proton donors while bases are proton acceptors a bare proton cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals because of its unstoppable attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons except at high temperatures associated with plasmas such protons cannot be removed from electron clouds of atoms and molecules and will remain attached to them however term proton is sometimes used loosely and metaphorically to refer to positively charged or cationic hydrogen attached to other species in this fashion and as such is denoted without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species to avoid implication of naked solvated proton in solution acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain a less unlikely fictitious species termed ion however even in this case such solvated hydrogen cations are more realistically conceived as being organized into clusters that form species closer to h other ions are found when water is in acidic solution with other solvents although exotic on earth one of most common ions in universe is ion known as protonated molecular hydrogen or cation atomic hydrogen nasa has investigated use of atomic hydrogen as a rocket propellant it could be stored in liquid helium to prevent it from into molecular hydrogen when helium is vaporized atomic hydrogen would be released and combine back to molecular hydrogen result would be an intensely hot stream of hydrogen and helium gas liftoff weight of rockets could be reduced by 50 by this method most interstellar hydrogen is in form of atomic hydrogen because atoms can seldom collide and combine they are source of

deuterium and contains one proton and one neutron in nucleus all deuterium in universe is thought to have been produced at time of big bang and has endured since that time deuterium is not radioactive and does not represent a significant toxicity hazard water enriched in molecules that include deuterium instead of normal hydrogen is called heavy water deuterium and its compounds are used as a non radioactive label in chemical experiments and in solvents for nmr spectroscopy heavy water is used as a neutron moderator and coolant for nuclear reactors deuterium is also a potential fuel for commercial nuclear fusion is known as tritium and contains one proton and two neutrons in its nucleus it is radioactive decaying into helium 3 through beta decay with a half life of 12 32 years it is so radioactive that it can be used in luminous paint making it useful in such things as watches glass prevents small amount of radiation from getting out small amounts of tritium are produced naturally by interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric gases tritium has also been released during nuclear weapons tests it is used in nuclear fusion reactions as a tracer in isotope geochemistry and in specialized self powered lighting devices tritium has also been used in chemical and biological labeling experiments as a hydrogen is only element that has different names for its isotopes in common use today during early study of radioactivity various heavy radioactive isotopes were given their own names but such names are no longer used except for deuterium and tritium symbols d and t

muonium chloride or sodium namu analogous to hydrogen chloride and sodium hydride respectively history discovery and use in 1671 robert boyle discovered and described reaction between iron filings and dilute acids which results in production of hydrogen gas boyle r 1672 tracts written by honourable robert boyle containing new experiments touching relation betwixt flame and air london in 1766 henry cavendish was first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance by naming gas from a metal acid reaction inflammable air he speculated that inflammable air was in fact identical to hypothetical substance called phlogiston and further finding in 1781 that gas produces water when burned he is usually given credit for discovery of hydrogen as an element in 1783 antoine lavoisier gave element name hydrogen from greek hydro meaning water and genes genes meaning creator when he and laplace reproduced cavendish s finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned thumb upright 0 8 antoine laurent de lavoisier lavoisier produced hydrogen for his experiments on mass conservation by reacting a flux of steam with metallic iron through an incandescent iron tube heated in a fire anaerobic oxidation of iron by protons of water at high temperature can be represented by set of following reactions fe h2o feo h2 2 fe 3 h2o fe2o3 3 h2 3 fe 4 h2o 4 h2 many metals such as zirconium undergo a similar reaction with water leading to production of hydrogen hydrogen was liquefied for first time by james dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention vacuum flask he produced solid hydrogen next year deuterium was discovered in december 1931 by harold urey and tritium was prepared in 1934 by ernest rutherford mark oliphant and paul harteck heavy water which consists of deuterium in place of regular hydrogen was discovered by urey s group in 1932 francois isaac de rivaz built first de rivaz engine an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806 edward daniel clarke invented hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819 s lamp and limelight were invented in 1823 first hydrogen filled balloon was invented by jacques charles in 1783 hydrogen provided lift for first reliable form of air travel following 1852 invention of first hydrogen lifted airship by henri giffard german count ferdinand von zeppelin promoted idea of rigid airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called zeppelins first of which had its maiden flight in 1900 regularly scheduled flights started in 1910 and by outbreak of world war i in august 1914 they had carried 35 000 passengers without a serious incident hydrogen lifted airships were used as observation platforms and bombers during war first non stop transatlantic crossing was made by british airship r34 in 1919 regular passenger service resumed in 1920s and discovery of helium reserves in united states promised increased safety but u s government refused to sell gas for this purpose therefore h2 was used in hindenburg airship which was destroyed in a midair fire over new jersey on 6 may 1937 incident was broadcast live on radio and filmed ignition of leaking hydrogen is widely assumed to be cause but later investigations pointed to ignition of fabric coating by static electricity but damage to hydrogen s reputation as a lifting gas was already done and commercial hydrogen airship travel ceased hydrogen is still used in preference to non flammable but more expensive helium as a lifting gas for weather balloons in same year first hydrogen cooled turbogenerator went into service with gaseous hydrogen as a coolant in rotor and in 1937 at dayton ohio by dayton power light co because of thermal conductivity of hydrogen gas this is most common type in its field today

background with narrow lines superimposed on it one violet one blue one cyan and one red because of its simple atomic structure consisting only of a proton and an electron hydrogen atom together with spectrum of light produced from it or absorbed by it has been central to development of theory of atomic structure furthermore study of corresponding simplicity of hydrogen molecule and corresponding cation brought understanding of nature of chemical bond which followed shortly after quantum mechanical treatment of hydrogen atom had been developed in mid 1920s one of first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed but not understood at time was a maxwell observation involving hydrogen half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived maxwell observed that specific heat capacity of h2 unaccountably departs from that of a diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures according to quantum theory this behavior arises from spacing of quantized rotational energy levels which are particularly wide spaced in h2 because of its low mass these widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit same effect antihydrogen is antimatter

dark matter and dark energy this element is found in great abundance in stars and gas giant planets molecular clouds of h2 are associated with star formation hydrogen plays a vital role in powering stars through proton proton reaction and cno cycle of nuclear fusion states throughout universe hydrogen is mostly found in atomic and plasma states with properties quite different from those of molecular hydrogen as a plasma hydrogen s electron and proton are not bound together resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity producing light from sun and other stars charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields for example in solar wind they interact with earth s magnetosphere giving rise to birkeland currents and aurora hydrogen is found in neutral atomic state in interstellar medium large amount of neutral hydrogen found in damped lyman alpha systems is thought to dominate cosmological baryonic density of universe up to redshift z 4 under ordinary conditions on earth elemental hydrogen exists as diatomic gas h2 however hydrogen gas is very rare in earth s atmosphere 1 ppm by volume because of its light weight which enables it to escape from earth s gravity more easily than heavier gases however hydrogen is third most abundant element on earth s surface mostly in form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water hydrogen gas is produced by some bacteria and algae and is a natural component of flatus as is methane itself a hydrogen source of increasing importance a molecular form called protonated molecular hydrogen is found in interstellar medium where it is generated by ionization of molecular hydrogen from cosmic rays this ion has also been observed in upper atmosphere of planet jupiter ion is relatively stable in environment of outer space due to low temperature and density is one of most abundant ions in universe and it plays a notable role in chemistry of interstellar medium neutral hydrogen h3 can exist only in an excited form and is unstable by contrast positive hydrogen molecular ion is a rare molecule in universe production is produced in chemistry and biology laboratories often as a by product of other reactions in industry for hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates and in nature as a means of expelling reducing equivalents in biochemical reactions electrolysis of water electrolysis of water is a simple method of producing hydrogen a low voltage current is run through water and gaseous oxygen forms at anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at cathode typically cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage if however gas is to be burnt on site oxygen is desirable to assist combustion and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals iron for instance would oxidize and thus decrease amount of oxygen given off theoretical maximum efficiency electricity used vs energetic value of hydrogen produced is in range 88 94 2 l 2 g g when determining electrical efficiency of pem proton exchange membrane electrolysis higher heat value hhv is used this is because catalyst layer interacts with water as steam as process operates at 80 degc for pem electrolysers waste heat can be redirected through system to create steam resulting in a higher overall electrical efficiency lower heat value must be used for alkaline electrolysers as process within these electrolysers requires water in liquid form and uses alkalinity to facilitate breaking of bond holding hydrogen and oxygen atoms together lower heat value must also be used for fuel cells as steam is output rather than input steam reforming hydrogen is often produced using natural gas which involves removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons at very high temperatures with about 95 of hydrogen production coming from steam reforming around year 2000 commercial bulk hydrogen is usually produced by steam reforming of natural gas at high temperatures 1000 1400 k 700 1100 degc or 1300 2000 degf steam water vapor reacts with methane to yield carbon monoxide and co 3 this reaction is favored at low pressures but is nonetheless conducted at high pressures 2 0 mpa 20 atm or 600 inhg this is because high pressure is most marketable product and pressure swing adsorption psa purification systems work better at higher pressures product mixture is known as synthesis gas because it is often used directly for production of methanol and related compounds hydrocarbons other than methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios one of many complications to this highly optimized technology is formation of coke or carbon c 2 consequently steam reforming typically employs an excess of additional hydrogen can be recovered from steam by use of carbon monoxide through water gas shift reaction especially with an iron oxide catalyst this reaction is also a common industrial source of carbon dioxide co other important methods for production include partial oxidation of hydrocarbons 2 2 co 4 and coal reaction which can serve as a prelude to shift reaction above c co hydrogen is sometimes produced and consumed in same industrial process without being separated in haber process for production of ammonia hydrogen is generated from natural gas electrolysis of brine to yield chlorine also produces hydrogen as a co product metal acid in laboratory is usually prepared by reaction of dilute non oxidizing acids on some reactive metals such as zinc with kipp s apparatus zn 2 aluminium can also produce upon treatment with bases 2 al 6 2 2 3 an alloy of aluminium and gallium in pellet form added to water can be used to generate hydrogen process also produces alumina but expensive gallium which prevents formation of an oxide skin on pellets can be re used this has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy as hydrogen can be produced on site and does not need to be transported thermochemical there are more than 200 thermochemical cycles which can be used for water splitting around a dozen of these cycles such as iron oxide cycle cerium iv oxide cerium iii oxide cycle zinc zinc oxide cycle sulfur iodine cycle copper chlorine cycle and hybrid sulfur cycle are under research and in testing phase to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity a number of laboratories including in france germany greece japan and usa are developing thermochemical methods to produce hydrogen from solar energy and water anaerobic corrosion under anaerobic conditions iron and steel alloys are slowly oxidized by protons of water concomitantly reduced in molecular hydrogen anaerobic corrosion of iron leads first to formation of ferrous hydroxide green rust and can be described by following reaction fe 2 o in its turn under anaerobic conditions ferrous hydroxide can be oxidized by protons of water to form magnetite and molecular hydrogen this process is described by schikorr reaction 3 2 o ferrous hydroxide magnetite water hydrogen well crystallized magnetite is thermodynamically more stable than ferrous hydroxide this process occurs during anaerobic corrosion of iron and steel in oxygen free groundwater and in reducing soils below water table geological occurrence serpentinization reaction in absence of atmospheric oxygen in deep geological conditions

resembles schikorr reaction observed in anaerobic oxidation of ferrous hydroxide in contact with water formation in transformers from all fault gases formed in power transformers hydrogen is most common and is generated under most fault conditions thus formation of hydrogen is an early indication of serious problems in transformer s life cycle applications consumption in processes large quantities of are needed in petroleum and chemical industries largest application of is for processing upgrading of fossil fuels and in production of ammonia key consumers of in petrochemical plant include and hydrocracking has several other important uses is used as a agent particularly in increasing level of saturation of unsaturated fats and oils found in items such as margarine and in production of methanol it is similarly source of hydrogen in manufacture of hydrochloric acid is also used as a reducing agent of metallic ores hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in crystal lattice these properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks but gas s high solubility is a metallurgical problem contributing to embrittlement of many metals complicating design of pipelines and storage tanks apart from its use as a reactant has wide applications in physics and engineering it is used as a shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding h2 is used as rotor coolant in electrical generators at power stations because it has highest thermal conductivity of any gas liquid h2 is used in cryogenic research including superconductivity studies because is lighter than air having a little more than of density of air it was once widely used as a lifting gas in balloons and airships in more recent applications hydrogen is used pure or mixed with nitrogen sometimes called forming gas as a tracer gas for minute leak detection applications can be found in automotive chemical power generation aerospace and telecommunications industries hydrogen is an authorized food additive e 949 that allows food package leak testing among other anti oxidizing properties hydrogen s rarer isotopes also each have specific applications deuterium hydrogen 2 is used in nuclear fission applications as a moderator to slow neutrons and in nuclear fusion reactions deuterium compounds have applications in chemistry and biology in studies of reaction isotope effects tritium hydrogen 3 produced in nuclear reactors is used in production of hydrogen bombs as an isotopic label in biosciences and as a radiation source in luminous paints triple point temperature of equilibrium hydrogen is a defining fixed point on its 90 temperature scale at 13 kelvin coolant hydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a coolant in generators due to a number of favorable properties that are a direct result of its light diatomic molecules these include low density low viscosity and highest specific heat and thermal conductivity of all gases energy carrier hydrogen is not an energy resource except in hypothetical context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium a technology presently far from development sun s energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen but this process is difficult to achieve on earth elemental hydrogen from solar biological or electrical sources requires more energy to make than is obtained by burning it so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier like a battery hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources such as methane but these sources are unsustainable energy density per unit volume of both liquid hydrogen and compressed hydrogen gas at any practicable pressure is significantly less than that of traditional fuel sources although energy density per unit fuel mass is higher nevertheless elemental hydrogen has been widely discussed in context of energy as a possible future carrier of energy on an economy wide scale for example sequestration followed by carbon capture and storage could be conducted at point of production from fossil fuels hydrogen used in transportation would burn relatively cleanly with some nox emissions but without carbon emissions however infrastructure costs associated with full conversion to a hydrogen economy would be substantial fuel cells can convert hydrogen and oxygen directly to electricity more efficiently than internal combustion engines semiconductor industry hydrogen is employed to saturate broken dangling bonds of amorphous silicon and amorphous carbon that helps stabilizing material properties it is also a potential electron donor in various oxide materials including zno cdo zro2 hfo2 tio2 sio2 al2o3 zrsio4 and potential therapeutic claims molecular hydrogen dissolved in water has been marketed as a therapeutic product for a wide variety of illnesses but there is no scientific consensus that hydrogen water has any health benefits in humans biological reactions h2 is a product of some types of anaerobic metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms usually via reactions catalyzed by iron or nickel containing enzymes called hydrogenases these enzymes catalyze reversible redox reaction between h2 and its component two protons and two electrons creation of hydrogen gas occurs in transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called hydrogen cycle water splitting in which water is decomposed into its component protons electrons and oxygen occurs in light reactions in all photosynthetic organisms some such organisms including alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii and cyanobacteria have evolved a second step in dark reactions in which protons and electrons are reduced to form h2 gas by specialized hydrogenases in chloroplast efforts have been undertaken to genetically modify hydrogenases to efficiently synthesize h2 gas even in presence of oxygen efforts have also been undertaken with genetically modified alga in a safety and precautions hydrogen poses a number of hazards to human safety from potential detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure oxygen free form in addition liquid hydrogen is a and presents dangers such as frostbite associated with very cold liquids hydrogen dissolves in many metals and in addition to leaking out may have adverse effects on them such as hydrogen embrittlement leading to cracks and explosions hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite moreover hydrogen fire while being extremely hot is almost invisible and thus can lead to accidental burns even interpreting hydrogen data including safety data is confounded by a number of phenomena many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on parahydrogen orthohydrogen ratio it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach equilibrium ratio for which data is usually given hydrogen detonation
