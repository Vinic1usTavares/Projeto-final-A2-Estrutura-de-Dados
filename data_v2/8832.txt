operation gisela was codename for a german military operation of second world war gisela was designed as an aerial intruder operation to support german air defence system in its night battles with raf bomber command during defence of reich campaign it was last major operation launched by luftwaffe nachtjagdgeschwader night fighter wings during conflict by march 1945 luftwaffe had lost air superiority over all fronts western allied air forces held air supremacy over german reich and remaining german occupied territory german industrial cities were now subjected to intensive bombardment which inflicted enormous damage on german war effort united states army air forces attacked by day while raf bomber command operated by night allied armies had also reached pre war german territorial borders and now occupied some german towns and cities in west defeat in normandy and allied advance across western europe had significant consequences for luftwaffe s ability to defend germany from british night attacks kammhuber line german air defence system which had extended through occupied france belgium and netherlands was now broken and much of its early warning network had been lost along with battlefield reverses was inability of luftwaffe to produce enough experienced night fighter crews which was exacerbated by crippling shortage of fuel at this stage in war which contributed to collapse of training programs and grounded combat units equally serious was threat posed by raf de havilland mosquito night fighter intruders operating over germany boiten 1997 pp 198 199 in a desperate attempt to improve situation and hamper british operations a number of experienced night fighter commanders and pilots suggested restarting intruder operations over england in 1940 41 german night fighters lacking airborne radar sets and a means to locate them over germany had flown to british bomber bases and attempted to destroy raf bombers as they returned from their missions adolf hitler had ordered a cessation of these activities for propaganda and practical reasons but these operations had met with reasonable success in 1941 and it was felt they may do so again hermann goring commander in chief of luftwaffe sanctioned operation germans waited for an opportunity to begin intruder operation and one presented itself on night of 3 4 march 1945 when bomber command attacked targets in western germany operation failed to achieve results hoped for successes of attacking force were not sufficiently commensurate with losses sustained background intruder history german air doctrine had seen little need for development of an nocturnal night air defence system and luftwaffe concentrated on offensive use of air power boiten 1997 p 58 however failure of luftwaffe in battle of britain in 1940 ended hopes for an early victory and forced continuance of hostilities with british empire faced with german domination of continent only weapon british could use to exert immediate military pressure on germany was night bombing operations of raf bomber command connelly 1981 p 39 thumb right 200px boundary map drawn up by luftwaffe in 1940 it remained unchanged for duration of war intruders were to patrol areas bomber command had been forced to operate at night since december 1939 and battle of heligoland bight when debilitating losses in daylight forced raf to abandon these operations these raids though inaccurate and wholly ineffective were causing embarrassment to commander in chief of luftwaffe and second most powerful man in germany reichsmarschall imperial marshal hermann goring who had once boasted you may call me meyer if enemy bombers ever flew over germany he ordered creation a new force set up on 26 june 1940 to combat night raids parry 2003 pp 15 16 20 aders 1978 p 32 boiten 1997 p 14 goring appointed a respected and experienced pilot geschwaderkommodore wing commander wolfgang falck to develop a new organisation and consequently falck founded nachtjagdgeschwader 1 night fighter wing 1 or njg 1 within a year four more geschwader wings were founded nachtjagdgeschwader 2 njg 2 njg 3 njg 3 and njg 4 njg 4 all of these units were in existence by april 1941 parry 2003 pp 21 25 in order to improve management of expanding night fighter force erste nachtjagd division 1st night fighter division was established on 17 july 1940 commanded by oberst colonel josef kammhuber an aggressive commander kammhuber founded fernnachtjagd or long range night fighter intruder force nucleus of this force was derived from i njg 2 which would remain only intruder unit boiten 1997 p 15 boiten 1999 p 212 germans quickly developed a series of basic tactics for intercepting enemy intruders lack of airborne radar at this stage in war meant finding and destroying allied bombers at night was a difficult prospect thus it was decided to use fernnachtjagd in operations over britain aders 1978 p 17 major kuhlmann head of wireless telegraphy interception service played a significant part in assisting luftwaffe night fighter force as did wolfgang martini s luftnachrichtentruppe air signal corps intercepting british signal communications by monitoring radio traffic of enemy ground stations and aircraft germans could determine where and at what airfields raf night activity was occurring with british base identified falck could then move against them over their own airfields three waves could then be deployed one to attack bombers as they took off one to cover known routes taken by enemy over north sea and third to attack them on landing at a time when after a long flight enemy crews were tired and much less alert for operational purposes eastern england was divided into four regions or raume areas raum a was yorkshire bounded by hull leeds lancaster and newcastle raum b covered midlands and lincolnshire whilst raum c encompassed east anglia bounded by london peterborough luton and wash operations began in earnest in october 1940 parry

exchange for 18 raf aircraft claimed shot down despite claims made by german crews evidence showed a considerable amount of over claiming and difficulty in substantiating claims at night and over enemy territory became evident parry 2003 pp 31 33 35 37 in 1941 german night fighter intruders began achieving substantial successes british ground defences which had taken their toll on german units in 1940 were now side stepped by a decision to shift area of operations to north sea by english coast in june german night fighter units claimed 22 raf aircraft 18 over sea in july 19 british aircraft were claimed for four losses by october 1941 british loss records listed 54 aircraft of all types destroyed and a further 44 damaged in these operations to all causes german losses amounted to 27 destroyed and 31 damaged to all causes parry 2003 pp 66 68 173 179 180 186 while number of losses incurred against german night fighters was not significantly large psychological damage was substantial a high number of crashes owed much to nervous british bomber pilots who did not feel safe over their own airfields and consequently landed too hard and fast or refused to go around a second time for fear of enemy intruders just as it appeared night intruder sorties were showing promise adolf hitler ordered a cessation of operations for propaganda purposes he thought that morale of german people would be better served by seeing british bombers destroyed and wrecked over german territory hitler was also reticent owing fact there had been no noticeable reduction in british air raids and raf had not adopted these methods during blitz this order came into effect on 12 october 1941 aders 1978 pp 30 31 boiten 1997 p 43 held and nauroth 2006 p 89 kammhuber would unsuccessfully lobby to have intruder operations reinstated and his efforts to expand intruder force beyond a single unit were thwarted by an uninterested high command which was inundated with requests for reinforcements in other theatres boiten 1997 p 45 operational situation 1945 thumb right 300px ju 88 heavy fighters hidden beside a early 1945 strafing attacks by allied aircraft were a constant danger allied air superiority meant german units abandoned airfields known to allied intelligence and used roads as runways over next three years combined bomber offensive had forced luftwaffe to invest heavily in air defence in campaign against raf german air defence system named kammhuber line had become increasingly sophisticated in 1942 introduction of lichtenstein radar despite its early teething difficulties and greater improvements in armament and capability of german night fighters produced a force capable of inflicting heavy losses on british bomber streams aders 1978 pp 77 81 though british losses rarely reached more than ten percent of a raid considered a minimum target to irreparably damage british combat power night fighter force grew in size and potency aders 1978 pp 82 83 111 144 145 british losses in battle of ruhr march july 1943 and most notably in battle of berlin november 1943 march 1944 reached an all time high 569 bombers in latter campaign cooper 2013 p 223 murray 1983 pp 209 222 to increase toll on allied bombers further intruder operations restarted briefly in august 1943 and took place intermittently or on initiative of single crews since no organised fernnachtjagd existed after october 1941 boiten 1997 p 47 success was still possible on 22 april 1944 united states army air force usaaf 1st bombardment division and 3rd bombardment division

coincided with operation steinbock a bombing and intruder offensive against greater london and in response to british offensive against german industrial cities but operation was aimed at british capital rather than british bomber bases mackay 2010 p 39 in mid 1944 a series of developments impaired german night fighter defence permanently most serious was collapse of german front around normandy in august defeat led to advance of allied armies across france into belgium and southern netherlands kammhuber line which ran through these countries was eliminated leaving only northern portions in northern germany netherlands and denmark intact and exposing ruhr national archives 2000 p 279 night fighting over france and europe was also proving increasingly costly raf consistently struck on moonlit nights and bombers were accompanied by a strong number of long range de havilland mosquito night fighter intruder escorts from no 100 group raf aders 1978 p 159 as a consequence of these developments and just three months after german night fighter arm s most successful campaign over berlin it was fast becoming an insignificant force aders 1978 pp 166 167 although numerically stronger and with more formidable aircraft designs than ever before including heinkel he 219 british were winning electronics war and had succeeded in jamming german radar and radio communications to extent german countermeasures were useless german sn 2 radar and naxos radar detector had been negated by new bomber command tactics boiten 1997 p 203 these tactics resulted from capture of sets by british in july 1944 which allowed raf to develop counter measures boiten 1997 p 184 oil campaign over romania and against synthetic oil plants in ruhr in which most oilfields had been destroyed captured or damaged by 1945 triggered a critical fuel shortage from autumn of 1944 onwards which denied luftwaffe resources to capitalise on its numerical strength paradoxically production was able to replace relatively small losses and operational serviceability reached an all time high since ground crews had more opportunity to work on machines luftwaffe was still capable of taking a toll on bomber command on occasion but unless more powerful radars and communications could be introduced in time it was doubtful british air superiority at night could be challenged aders 1978 pp 167 168 impotence of night fighter force as an organisation was demonstrated during attack on dresden when second wave of allied bombers was hardly opposed operation clarion launched later that month was not adequately opposed either aders 1978 pp 207 211 german plan thumb right 300px joseph schmid architect of gisela removal of kammhuber as commanding officer of night air defences in september 1943 did not prevent further appeals for reinstatement of intruder operations boiten 1997 p 48 his replacement as general der nachtjagd general of night fighters was generalleutnant lieutenant general joseph schmid commanding 1 jagdkorps 1st fighter corps schmid had long argued for a repeat of intruder operations and first pressed for their resumption in december 1943 his proposals were rejected by goring on grounds that intruder operations were not his business schmid did not receive substantive support from other field commanders most notably hans jurgen stumpff who objected to operation after meeting with schmid in january and february 1944 on grounds that hitler opposed such operations and newer german radar was not to fall into allied hands four months later attitudes had not changed generalmajor dietrich commanding england bomber leader england and ix fliegerkorps showed little interest in intruder missions either since his remaining forces were engaged in night attacks against allied beachheads in normandy in october 1944 he finally won support from werner streib inspekteur der nachtjagd inspector of night fighters to press for an operation again plan was simple a large force of 600 700 night fighters were to be gathered and sent out in one simultaneous operation boiten 1997 pp 48 50 parry 2003 pp 112 113 independently of schmid s actions another figure has also been credited with ensuring gisela took place heinz wolfgang schnaufer who was to end war as most successful night fighter ace on 121 aerial victories was said to have attempted to gain support for a like minded offensive schnaufer pursued raf bombers regularly to english coast or least other side of frontline he experienced a lack of british interference beyond german held territory he recalled that he could fly around as if it was peace time since all british jamming and interference stopped immediately once he was in allied airspace aders 1978 pp 211 212 schnaufer submitted a proposal to his commander walter grabmann commanding 3 jagd division 3rd fighter division that an intruder operation be allowed to take place schnaufer proposed waiting until enemy had crossed beyond lines over north sea before attacking them grabmann was enthusiastic and suggested operation go further and attack enemy bombers while they were attempting to land in eastern england schnaufer also became aware of schmid s desire for an intruder operation at this time and personally urged him to approach high command once more boiten 1997 p 49 hitler was finally convinced of need to try every possible method to stop bomber command s night offensive over germany operation was sanctioned by okl in november secrecy of operation was paramount problem of preparing a large number of crews produced security fears which was recognised clearly when crews of njg 3 and njg 2 were called to a briefing on gisela they were locked behind guarded doors crews were told that all available night fighters would participate in an all out attack against bomber command over their airfields in england tactical deployment for operation they were told was for two waves of night fighters to cross coast in region of hull to avoid enemy radar raiders were told to fly at minimum altitude and then climb to 4 500 metres as they reached coast generally believed to be average operating height of british bombers luftwaffe western front intelligence summary service prepared dossiers for crews to study it advised on layout of british airfields and lighting systems such as system along with funnel lights and angle of glide indicators crews were warned about raf lighting codes on control towers which warned raf bomber crews of a possible intruder in vicinity parry 2003 p 113 intelligence breach unfortunately for germans security was breached within weeks on 1 january 1945 after participating in operation bodenplatte to support german ardennes offensive a ju 88 code d5 pt flown by unteroffizier corporal

ninth air force he divulged details of meeting and this information was passed to air ministry parry 2003 pp 114 115 raf fighter command and bomber command attempted to warn all of their airborne units of potential danger and bomber units were ordered to plan alternate landing sites in event of an attack on their airfields all bomber and fighter groups were linked by telephone and ground control passed on all details of intruder operations to pilots including height and heading when they occurred station commands organised blackouts of airfields and pilots could be ordered to switch navigation lights off at any time only mosquito groups remained active against intruders though majority of these units were supporting allied operations on continent british propaganda radio station calais soldiers radio calais was used to conspicuously broadcast to germans that they knew about a planned intruder operation station did so by playing contemporary song i dance with gisela tonight operation was suspended repeatedly until british relaxed vigilance aders 1978 p 212 bowman 2006 pp 26 27 operation british raid thumb left 300px a similar scene to one that occurred over ladbergen and kamen a raid on pforzheim 23 february 1945 at midday on 3 march 1945 teletype messages from bomber command headquarters at raf high wycombe began reaching airfields of raf squadrons in eastern england on this night a planned raid with moderate numbers of bombers was planned over western germany a complex plan of feint attacks and diversions to deceive german air defence system were drawn up main force was split into two separate groups in munster area no 4 group raf were ordered to destroy synthetic oil plant at kamen and no 5 group raf would attempt to eliminate aqueduct safety gates and canal boats on dortmund ems canal at ladbergen parry 2003 pp 116 125 nearly 5 000 raf airmen prepared to take part in 817 heavy bombers which were fueled and armed in evening a trigger plan was prepared which would act as a feint but this night bomber command amended feint which was partially compromised by weather conditions restrictions on flight path of bombers was also changed bomber streams were permitted to fly over ingoldmells point to filey but not over coastal areas where no ground defences were stationed route took them downstream to southern england by reading and across english channel as trigger plan required however they were then ordered to turn back toward north sea reason behind this was low lying cloud which was ever present over continent that night clouds made it difficult for pilots to see and steer clear of zones heavily guarded by allied ground defences near to frontline possibility of losing aircraft to friendly fire was too great at 18 00 first aircraft began to take off first raf aircraft over germany were medium bomber variants of de havilland mosquito no 8 group raf committed 89 to bomb berlin and wurzburg mosquitos marked area with

ground controllers into believing it was target bombers struck ladbergen and canal burst its banks safety gates were overwhelmed and canal boats were stranded attack lasted just 25 minutes jamming operations were effective but decision to pack a large number of aircraft into relatively small airspace made it certain that german night fighters would locate some aircraft at this time german policy was to commit only experten to battle as they had skill and experience to find and shoot down allied bombers first fighters were being vectored onto their targets as bombs began to fall on

wolfgang martini s luftnachrichtentruppe air signal corps had already busied themselves with searching air waves for signs of a british raid before first raf bombers had taken off they had already determined that a raid of at least 500 aircraft would take place that night luftwaffe defences were alerted shortly afterwards code word gisela was issued to fighter units some german units did not treat message with urgency required it is likely after several months unit officers did not remember significance of name and it took time for crews to recall that it signified offensive air patrol they were briefed about in late 1944 crews were given a re fresher briefing to compensate for three month time gap they were informed there was a wind blowing northerly at a strong front was moving across north sea which meant bombers would fly above it on return leg fighters would have to fly under it in heavy rain to keep below british radar defences parry 2003 p 126 first ju 88s took off at 23 00 and began heading toward dutch coast where they dived to sea level and stayed at approximately 50 metres while they flew out to sea crews were forbidden to engage enemy aircraft over north sea in order to preserve surprise until last possible moment rain and squall assisted crews in judging location and distance of water however with crews prone to human error it was decided to use very accurate fug 101 radar altimeter and ju 88s blind flying instruments strain on crews was enormous as a careful vigil was kept on them until british coast was reached and pilot began his ascent to

landing safely at raf oulton combat was opening salvo of gisela station commander at oulton reported an intruder over his station and soon after radar screens picked up large numbers of hostile aircraft headquarters of 100 group were alerted and a scramble order given to mosquito squadrons a scram order was also issued to bomber units still airborne it signified a warning to number crews that intruders were in vicinity and they were to divert to airfields in western or southern england and out of danger second victim of night was a mosquito of no 169 squadron raf which was probably shot down while en route to its alternative landing site a large number of bombers only began receiving their warning and diversion orders at 00 45 hours halifaxes of no 4 group were finally alerted

gisela did not achieve its intended outcome it did not deliver mass casualties that schmid hoped for and it did not disrupt british bombing operations very next night a small scale repeat operation was attempted but had made no impact size of german force was less than a quarter of what schmid had originally hoped could be mustered one source referred to gisela as swansong of german night fighter force during course of operation last german aircraft to be brought down over british soil crashed bright 2005 p 156 usherwood 1998 p 331 goodrum 205 p 16 some historians have claimed that had german intruder operations been maintained over britain in 1941 and thereafter british night flying training program which produced nucleus of huge bomber force that operated in 1944 45 could have been halted or disrupted decision not to continue intruder operations in their view allowed british to build their bomber force virtually unhindered for over four years a consequence of an effective german intruder campaign at this time may have given luftwaffe night fighter defences an unassailable lead in night war and may have stopped or diminished effectiveness of british bombing operations this omission could be regarded as one of major errors made by okl concerning air defence of germany boiten 1997 p 46 hooton 1997 pp 130 131 in last eight weeks of war bombing intensified until british bombing operations were suspended in late april 1945 by this time most of german airfields were under threat from advancing allied ground forces and mass surrender of nachtjagd was taking
