members command pilot virgil i gus grissom senior pilot ed white and pilot roger b chaffee and destroyed command module cm name apollo1 chosen by crew was made official by nasa in their honor after fire immediately after fire nasa convened apollo 204 accident review board to determine cause of fire and both houses of united states congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee nasa s investigation ignition source of fire was determined to be electrical and fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material and high pressure pure oxygen cabin atmosphere rescue was prevented by plug door hatch which could not be opened against internal pressure of cabin because rocket was unfueled test had not been considered hazardous and emergency preparedness for it was poor during congressional investigation senator walter mondale publicly revealed a nasa internal document citing problems with prime apollo contractor north american aviation which became known as phillips report this disclosure embarrassed nasa administrator james e webb who was unaware of document s existence and attracted controversy to apollo program despite congressional displeasure at nasa s lack of openness both congressional committees ruled that issues raised in report had no bearing on accident manned apollo flights were suspended for 20 months while command module s hazards were addressed however development and uncrewed testing of lunar module lm and saturnv rocket continued launch vehicle for apollo1 sa 204 was used for first lm test flight apollo5 first successful crewed apollo

facilities and performance of apollo saturn launch assembly and would have lasted up to two weeks depending on how spacecraft performed csm for this flight number 012 built by north american aviation naa was a block i version designed before lunar orbit rendezvous landing strategy was chosen therefore it lacked capability of docking with lunar module this was incorporated into block ii csm design along with lessons learned in block i block ii would be test flown with lm when latter was ready and would be used on moon landing flights director of flight crew operations deke slayton selected first apollo crew in january 1966 with grissom as command pilot white as senior pilot and rookie donn f eisele as pilot but eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard weightlessness training aircraft and had to undergo surgery on january 27 slayton replaced him with chaffee and nasa announced crew selection on march 21 1966 james mcdivitt david scott and russell schweickart were named as backup crew on september 29 walter schirra eisele and walter cunningham were named as prime crew for a second block i csm flight as 205 nasa planned to follow this with an uncrewed test flight of lm as 206 then third crewed mission would be a dual flight designated as 278 or as 207 208 in which as 207 would launch first crewed block ii csm which would then rendezvous and dock with lm launched uncrewed on as 208 in march nasa was studying possibility of flying first apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with final project gemini mission gemini 12 in november 1966 but by may delays in making apollo ready for flight just by itself and extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with gemini made that impractical this became moot when slippage in readiness of as 204 spacecraft caused last quarter 1966 target date to be missed and mission was rescheduled for february 21 1967 mission background thumb left command module 012 labeled apollo one arrives at kennedy space center august 26

portrait to aspo manager joseph shea on august 19 1966 apollo command and service module was much bigger and far more complex than any previously implemented spacecraft design in october 1963 joseph f shea was named apollo spacecraft program office aspo manager responsible for managing design and construction of both csm and lm in a spacecraft review meeting held with shea on august 19 1966 a week before delivery crew expressed concern about amount of flammable material mainly nylon netting and velcro in cabin which both astronauts and technicians found convenient for holding tools and equipment in place although shea gave spacecraft a passing grade after meeting they gave him a crew portrait they had posed with heads bowed and hands clasped in prayer with inscription shea gave his staff orders to tell north american to remove from cabin but did not supervise issue personally north american shipped spacecraft cm 012 to kennedy space center on august 26 1966 under a conditional certificate of flight worthiness 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes had to be completed at ksc but that was not all an additional 623 engineering change orders were made and completed after delivery grissom became so frustrated with inability of training simulator engineers to keep up with spacecraft changes that he took a lemon from a tree by his house and hung it on simulator command and service modules were mated in ksc altitude chamber in september and combined system testing was performed altitude testing was performed first uncrewed then with both prime and backup crews from october 10 through december 30 during this testing environmental control unit in command module was found to have a design flaw and was sent back to manufacturer for design changes and rework returned ecu then leaked water glycol coolant and had to be returned a second time also during this time a propellant tank in service module 017 had ruptured during testing at naa prompting separation of modules and removal from chamber so service module could be tested for signs of tank problem these tests were negative thumb mcdivitt scott and schweickart were training for second apollo mission on january 26 1967 in first block ii command module wearing early blue versions of block ii pressure suit in december second block i flight as 205 was canceled as unnecessary and schirra eisele and cunningham were reassigned as backup crew for apollo1 mcdivitt s crew was now promoted to prime crew of block ii lm mission re designated as 258 because as 205 launch vehicle would be used in place of as 207 a third crewed mission was planned to launch csm and lm together on a saturnv as 503 to an elliptical medium earth orbit meo to be crewed by frank borman michael collins and william anders mcdivitt scott and schweickart had started their training for as 258 in cm 101 at naa plant in downey california when apollo1 accident occurred once all outstanding csm 012 hardware problems were fixed reassembled spacecraft finally completed a successful altitude chamber test with schirra s backup crew on december 30 according to final report of accident investigation board at post test debriefing backup flight crew expressed their satisfaction with condition and performance of spacecraft this would appear to contradict account given in lost moon perilous voyage of apollo13 by jeffrey kluger and astronaut james lovell that when trio climbed out of ship schirra made it clear that he was not pleased with what he had seen and that he later warned grissom and shea that there s nothing wrong with this ship that i can point to but it just makes me uncomfortable something about it just doesn t ring right and that grissom should get out at first sign of trouble following successful altitude tests spacecraft was removed from altitude chamber on january 3 1967 and mated to its saturn ib launch vehicle on pad 34 on january 6 accident plugs out test thumb chaffee white and grissom training in a simulator of their command module cabin january 19 1967 launch simulation on january 27 1967 on pad 34 was a plugs out test to determine whether spacecraft would operate nominally on simulated internal power while detached from all cables and umbilicals passing this test was essential to making february 21 launch date test was considered non hazardous because neither launch vehicle nor spacecraft was loaded with fuel or cryogenics and all pyrotechnic systems explosive bolts were disabled at 1 00 pm est 1800 gmt on january 27 first grissom then chaffee and white entered command module fully pressure suited and were strapped into their seats and hooked up to spacecraft s oxygen and communication systems grissom immediately noticed a strange odor in air circulating through his suit which he compared to sour buttermilk and simulated countdown was put on hold at 1 20 pm while air samples were taken no cause of odor could be found and countdown was resumed at 2 42 pm accident investigation found this odor not to be related to fire three minutes after count was resumed hatch installation was started hatch consisted of three parts a removable inner hatch which stayed inside cabin a hinged outer hatch which was part of spacecraft s heat shield and an outer hatch cover which was part of boost protective cover enveloping entire command module to protect it from aerodynamic heating during launch and from launch escape rocket exhaust in event of a launch abort boost hatch cover was partially but not fully latched in place because flexible boost protective cover was slightly distorted by some cabling run under it to provide simulated internal power spacecraft s fuel cell reactants were not loaded for this test after hatches were sealed air in cabin was replaced with pure oxygen at higher than atmospheric pressure thumb audio recording from ground loop starting from grissom s talk between buildings remark first mention of fire is heard at 1 05 movement by astronauts was detected by spacecraft s inertial measurement unit and astronaut s biomedical sensors and also indicated by increases in oxygen spacesuit flow and sounds from grissom s stuck open microphone there was no evidence to identify movement or whether it was related to fire stuck microphone was part of a problem with communications loop connecting crew operations and checkout building and complex 34 blockhouse control room poor communications led grissom to remark how are we going to get to moon if we can t talk between two or three buildings simulated countdown was put on hold again at 5 40 pm while attempts were made to troubleshoot communications problem all countdown functions up to simulated internal power transfer had been successfully completed by 6 20 pm but at 6 30 count remained on hold at t minus 10 minutes fire thumb upright command module exterior blackened from eruption of fire crew members were using time to run through their checklist again when a momentary increase in ac voltage occurred nine seconds later at 6 31 04 7 one of astronauts some listeners and laboratory analysis indicate grissom exclaimed hey fire or flame this was followed by two seconds of scuffling sounds through grissom s open microphone this was immediately followed at 6 31 06 2 23 31 06 2 gmt by someone believed by most listeners and supported by laboratory analysis to be chaffee saying i ve or we ve got a fire in cockpit after 6 8 seconds of silence a second badly garbled transmission was heard by various listeners as they re fighting a bad fire let s get out open er up we ve got a bad fire let s get out we re burning up or i m reporting a bad fire i m getting out transmission lasted 5 0 seconds and ended with a cry of pain some blockhouse witnesses said that they saw white on television monitors reaching for inner hatch release handle as flames in cabin spread from left to right intensity of fire fed by pure oxygen caused pressure to rise to which ruptured command module s inner wall at 6 31 19 23 31 19 gmt initial phase of fire flames and gases then rushed outside command module through open access panels to two levels of pad service structure intense heat dense smoke and ineffective gas masks designed for toxic fumes rather than heavy smoke hampered ground crew s attempts to rescue men there were fears command module had exploded or soon would and that fire might ignite solid fuel rocket in launch escape tower above command module which would have likely killed nearby ground personnel and possibly have destroyed pad as pressure was released by cabin rupture convective rush of air caused flames to spread across cabin beginning second phase third phase began when most of oxygen was consumed and was replaced with atmospheric air essentially quenching fire but causing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and heavy smoke to fill cabin and large amounts of soot to be deposited on surfaces as they cooled it took five minutes for pad workers to open all three hatch layers and they could not drop inner hatch to cabin floor as intended so they pushed it out of way to one side although cabin lights remained lit they were at first unable to find astronauts through dense smoke as smoke cleared they found bodies but were not able to remove them fire had partly melted grissom s and white s nylon space suits and hoses connecting them to life support system grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on floor of spacecraft white s restraints were burned through and he was found lying sideways just below hatch it was determined that he had tried to open hatch per emergency procedure but was not able to do so against internal pressure chaffee was found strapped into his right hand seat as procedure called for him to maintain communication until white opened hatch because of large strands of melted nylon fusing astronauts to cabin interior removing bodies took nearly 90 minutes deke slayton was possibly first nasa official to examine spacecraft interior his testimony contradicted official report concerning position of grissom s body slayton said of grissom and white s bodies it is very difficult for me to determine exact relationships of these two bodies they were sort of jumbled together and i couldn t really tell which head even belonged to which body at that point i guess only thing that was real obvious is that both bodies were at lower edge of hatch they were not in seats they were almost completely clear of seat areas investigation thumb charred remains of apollo1 cabin interior as a result of in flight failure of gemini 8 mission on march 17 1966 nasa deputy administrator robert seamans wrote and implemented management instruction 1 on april 14 1966 defining mission failure investigation policy and procedures this modified nasa s existing accident procedures based on military aircraft accident investigation by giving deputy administrator option of performing independent investigations of major failures beyond those for which various program office officials were normally responsible it declared it is nasa policy to investigate and document causes of all major mission failures which occur in conduct of its space and aeronautical activities and to take appropriate corrective actions as a result of findings and recommendations immediately after apollo1 fire to avoid appearance of a conflict of interest nasa administrator james e webb asked president lyndon b johnson to allow nasa to handle investigation according to its established procedure promising to be truthful in assessing blame and to keep appropriate leaders of congress informed seamans then directed establishment of apollo 204 review board chaired by langley research center director floyd l thompson which included astronaut frank borman spacecraft designer maxime faget and six others on february 1 cornell university professor frank a long left board and was replaced by dr robert w van of u s bureau of mines next day north american s chief engineer for apollo george jeffs also left seamans immediately ordered all apollo1 hardware and software impounded to be released only under control of board after thorough stereo photographic documentation of cm 012 interior board ordered its disassembly using procedures tested by disassembling identical cm 014 and conducted a thorough investigation of every part board also reviewed astronauts autopsy results and interviewed witnesses seamans sent webb weekly status reports of investigation s progress and board issued its final report on april 5 1967 cause of death according to board grissom suffered severe third degree burns on over one third of his body and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed white suffered third degree burns on almost half of his body and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away chaffee suffered third degree burns over almost a quarter of his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged autopsy report confirmed that primary cause of death for all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide burns suffered by crew were not believed to be major factors and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem asphyxiation occurred after fire melted astronauts suits and oxygen tubes exposing them to lethal atmosphere of cabin major causes of accident review board identified several major factors which combined to cause fire and astronauts deaths an ignition source most probably related to vulnerable wiring carrying spacecraft power and vulnerable plumbing carrying a combustible and corrosive coolant a pure oxygen atmosphere at higher than atmospheric pressure a cabin sealed with a hatch cover which could not be quickly removed at high pressure an extensive distribution of combustible materials in cabin inadequate emergency preparedness rescue or medical assistance and crew escape ignition source review board determined that electrical power momentarily failed at 23 30 55 gmt and found evidence of several electric arcs in interior equipment they were unable to conclusively identify a single ignition source they determined that fire most likely started near floor in lower left section of cabin close to environmental control unit it spread from left wall of cabin to right with floor being affected only briefly board noted that a silver plated copper wire running through an environmental control unit near center couch had become stripped of its teflon insulation and abraded by repeated opening and closing of a small access door this weak point in wiring also ran near a junction in an ethylene glycol water cooling line that had been prone to leaks electrolysis of ethylene glycol solution with silver anode was discovered at manned spacecraft center on may 29 1967 to be a hazard capable of causing a violent exothermic reaction igniting ethylene glycol mixture in command module s pure oxygen atmosphere experiments at illinois institute of technology confirmed hazard existed for silver plated wires but not for copper only or nickel plated copper in july aspo directed both north american and grumman to ensure no silver or silver coated electrical contacts existed in vicinity of possible glycol spills in apollo spacecraft pure oxygen atmosphere thumb apollo 1 crewmen enter their spacecraft in altitude chamber at kennedy space center october 18 1966 plugs out test had been run to simulate launch procedure with cabin pressurized with pure oxygen at nominal launch level of above standard sea level atmospheric pressure this is more than five times partial pressure of oxygen in atmosphere and provides an environment in which materials not normally considered flammable will be highly flammable and burst into flame benson 1978 chapter 18 2 predictions of trouble high pressure oxygen atmosphere was similar to that which had been used successfully in mercury and gemini programs pressure before launch was deliberately greater than ambient in order to drive out nitrogen containing air and replace it with pure oxygen and also to seal plug door hatch cover during launch pressure would have been gradually reduced to in flight level of providing sufficient oxygen for astronauts to breathe while reducing fire risk apollo1 crew had successfully tested this procedure with their spacecraft in operations and checkout building altitude vacuum chamber on october 18 and 19 1966 and backup crew of schirra eisele and cunningham had repeated it on december 30 benson 1978 chapter 18 3 spacecraft comes to ksc investigation board noted that during these tests command module had been fully pressurized with pure oxygen four times for a total of six hours and fifteen minutes two and a half hours longer than it had been during plugs out test flammable materials in cabin review board cited many types and classes of combustible material close to ignition sources nasa crew systems department had installed of velcro throughout spacecraft almost like carpeting this velcro was found to be flammable in a high pressure 100 oxygen environment astronaut buzz aldrin states in his book men from earth that flammable material had been removed per crew s august 19 complaints and joseph shea s order but was replaced before august 26 delivery to cape kennedy hatch design thumb hatch as used on apollo1 consisted of two pieces and required pressure inside cabin be no greater than atmospheric in order to open a third outer layer boost protective hatch cover is not shown inner hatch cover used a plug door design sealed by higher pressure inside cabin than outside normal pressure level used for launch above ambient created sufficient force to prevent removing cover until excess pressure was vented emergency procedure called for grissom to open cabin vent valve first allowing white to remove cover but grissom was prevented from doing this because valve was located to left behind initial wall of flames also while system could easily vent normal pressure its flow capacity was utterly incapable of handling rapid increase to absolute caused by intense heat of fire north american had originally suggested hatch open outward and use explosive bolts to blow hatch in case of emergency as had been done in project mercury nasa did not agree arguing hatch could accidentally open as it had on grissom s liberty bell 7 flight so manned spacecraft center designers rejected explosive design in favor of a mechanically operated one for gemini and apollo programs before fire apollo astronauts had recommended changing design to an outward opening hatch and this was already slated for inclusion in block ii command module design according to donald k slayton s testimony before house investigation of accident this was based on ease of exit for spacewalks and at end of flight rather than for emergency exit benson 1978 chapter 18 2 fire that seared spaceport predictions of trouble emergency preparedness board noted that test planners had failed to identify test as hazardous emergency equipment such as gas masks were inadequate to handle this type of fire that fire rescue and medical teams were not in attendance and that spacecraft work and access areas contained many hindrances to emergency response such as steps sliding doors and sharp turns choice of pure oxygen atmosphere when designing mercury spacecraft nasa had considered using a nitrogen oxygen mixture to reduce fire risk near launch but rejected it based on a number of considerations first a pure oxygen atmosphere is comfortably by humans at five psi greatly reducing pressure load on spacecraft in vacuum of space second nitrogen used with in flight pressure reduction carried risk of decompression sickness known as bends but decision to eliminate use of any gas but oxygen was when a serious accident occurred on april 21 1960 in which mcdonnell aircraft test pilot g b north passed out and was seriously injured when testing a mercury cabin spacesuit atmosphere system in a vacuum chamber problem was found to be nitrogen rich oxygen poor air leaking from cabin into his spacesuit feed north american aviation had suggested using an oxygen nitrogen mixture for apollo but nasa overruled this pure oxygen design was judged to be safer less complicated and lighter in weight in his monograph project apollo tough decisions deputy administrator seamans wrote that nasa s worst mistake in engineering judgment was not to run a fire test on command module before plugs out test in first episode of 2009 bbc documentary series nasa triumph and tragedy jim mcdivitt said that nasa had no idea how a 100 oxygen atmosphere would influence burning similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in 2007 documentary film in shadow of moon other oxygen incidents several fires in high oxygen test environments had occurred before apollo fire in 1962 usaf colonel b dean smith was conducting a test of gemini space suit with a colleague in a pure oxygen chamber at brooks air force base in san antonio texas when a fire broke out destroying chamber smith and his partner narrowly escaped on february 16 1965 united states navy divers fred jackson and john youmans were killed in a decompression chamber fire at experimental diving unit in washington d c shortly after additional oxygen was added to chamber s atmospheric mix other oxygen fire occurrences are documented in reports archived in national air and space museum such as selection of space cabin atmospheres

policy of secrecy these were not disclosed until well after apollo1 fire cosmonaut valentin bondarenko died on march 23 1961 from burns sustained in a fire while participating in a 15 day endurance experiment in a high oxygen isolation chamber less than three weeks before first vostok crewed space flight this was disclosed on january 28 1986 during voskhod 2 mission in march 1965 cosmonauts pavel belyayev and alexei leonov could not completely seal spacecraft hatch after leonov s historic first walk in space spacecraft s environmental control system responded to leaking air by adding more oxygen to cabin causing concentration level to rise as high as 45 crew and ground controllers worried about possibility of fire remembering bondarenko s death four years earlier on january 31

simulator a pure oxygen chamber at school of aerospace medicine at brooks air force base like apollo1 fire school fire was caused by an electrical spark in a pure oxygen environment widows of apollo1 crew sent condolence letters to bartley and harmon s families political fallout right thumb 240px deputy administrator seamans administrator webb manned space flight administrator george e mueller and apollo program director phillips testify before a senate hearing on apollo accident committees in both houses of united states congress with oversight of space program soon launched investigations including senate committee on aeronautical and space sciences chaired by senator clinton p anderson seamans webb manned space flight administrator dr george e mueller and apollo program director maj gen samuel c phillips were called to testify before anderson s committee in february 27 hearing senator walter f mondale asked webb if he knew of a report of extraordinary problems with performance of north american aviation on apollo contract webb replied he did not and deferred to his subordinates on witness panel mueller and phillips responded they too were unaware of any such report however in late 1965 just over a year before accident phillips had headed a tiger team investigating causes of inadequate quality schedule delays and cost overruns in both apollo csm and saturn v second stage for which north american was also prime contractor he gave an oral presentation with transparencies of his team s findings to mueller and seamans and also presented them in a memo to north american president john l atwood to which mueller appended his own strongly worded memo to atwood during mondale s 1967 questioning about what was to become known as phillips report seamans was afraid mondale might actually have seen a hard copy of phillips presentation and responded that contractors have occasionally been subjected to on site progress reviews perhaps this was what mondale s information referred to mondale continued to refer to report despite phillips refusal to characterize it as such and angered by what he perceived as webb s deception and concealment of important program problems from congress he questioned nasa s selection of north american as prime contractor seamans later wrote that webb roundly chastised him in cab ride leaving hearing for volunteering information which led to disclosure of phillips memo on may 11 webb issued a statement defending nasa s november 1961 selection of north american as prime contractor for apollo this was followed on by seamans filing a seven page memorandum documenting selection process webb eventually provided a controlled copy of phillips memo to congress senate committee noted in its final report nasa s testimony that findings of phillips task force had no effect on accident did not lead to accident and were not related to accident but stated in its recommendations freshman senators edward w brooke iii and charles h percy jointly wrote an additional views section appended to committee report chastising nasa more strongly than anderson for not having disclosed phillips review to congress mondale wrote his own even more strongly worded additional view accusing nasa of evasiveness lack of candor patronizing attitude toward congress refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate congressional inquiries and solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy potential political threat to apollo blew over due in large part to support of president lyndon b johnson who at time still wielded a measure of influence with congress from his own senatorial experience he was a staunch supporter of nasa since its inception had even recommended moon program to president john f kennedy in 1961 and was skilled at portraying it as part of kennedy s legacy relations between nasa and north american deteriorated over assignment of blame north american argued unsuccessfully it was not responsible for fatal error in spacecraft atmosphere design finally webb contacted atwood and demanded either he or chief engineer harrison a storms resign atwood elected to fire storms harrison storms interview with historian james burke for bbc television see at 28 11 on nasa side joseph shea resorted to barbiturates and alcohol in order to help him cope nasa administrator james webb became increasingly worried about shea s mental state shea was asked to take an extended voluntary leave of absence but shea refused threatening to resign rather than take leave as a compromise he agreed to meet with a psychiatrist and to abide by an independent assessment of his psychological fitness this approach to remove shea from his position was also unsuccessful finally six months after fire shea s superiors reassigned him to nasa headquarters in washington d c shea felt that his new post was a non job and left after only two months ertel and newkirk apollo spacecraft vol iv p 119 program recovery gene kranz called a meeting of his staff in mission control three days after accident delivering a speech which has subsequently become one of nasa s principles pdf of update available from nasa here speaking of errors and overall attitude surrounding apollo program before accident he said we were too gung ho about schedule and we blocked out all of problems we saw each day in our work every element of program was in trouble and so were we he reminded team of perils and of their endeavor and stated new requirement that every member of every team in mission control be tough and competent requiring nothing less than perfection throughout nasa s programs in 2003 following space shuttle columbia disaster nasa administrator sean o keefe quoted kranz s speech applying it to columbia crew command module redesign after fire apollo program was grounded for review and redesign command module was found to be extremely hazardous and in some instances carelessly assembled for example a misplaced wrench socket was found in cabin it was decided that remaining block i spacecraft would be used only for uncrewed saturn v test flights all crewed missions would use block ii spacecraft to which many command module design changes were made cabin atmosphere at launch was adjusted to 60 oxygen and 40 nitrogen at sea level pressure during ascent cabin rapidly vented down to releasing approximately 2 3 of gas originally present at launch vent then closed and environmental control system maintained a nominal cabin pressure of as spacecraft continued into vacuum cabin was then very slowly purged vented to space and simultaneously replaced with 100 oxygen so nitrogen concentration fell asymptotically to zero over next day although new cabin launch atmosphere was significantly safer than 100 oxygen it still contained almost three times amount of oxygen present in ordinary sea level air 20 9 oxygen this was necessary to ensure a sufficient partial pressure of oxygen when astronauts removed their helmets after reaching orbit 60 of five psi is three psi compared to 60 of which is at launch and 20 9 of which is in sea level air environment within astronauts pressure suits was not changed because of rapid drop in cabin and suit pressures during ascent decompression sickness was likely unless nitrogen had been purged from astronauts tissues before launch they would still breathe pure oxygen starting several hours before launch until they removed their helmets on orbit avoiding bends was considered worth residual risk of an oxygen accelerated fire within a suit nylon used in block i suits was replaced in block ii suits with beta cloth a non flammable highly melt resistant fabric woven from fiberglass and coated with teflon block ii had already been planned to use a completely redesigned hatch which opened outward and could be opened in less than five seconds concerns of accidental opening were addressed by using a cartridge of pressurized nitrogen to drive release mechanism in an emergency instead of explosive bolts used on project mercury flammable materials in cabin were replaced with self extinguishing versions plumbing and wiring were covered with protective insulation aluminum tubing was replaced with stainless steel tubing that used brazed joints when possible thorough protocols were implemented for documenting spacecraft construction and maintenance new mission naming scheme astronauts widows asked that apollo 1 be reserved for flight their husbands never made and on april 24 1967 mueller as associate administrator for manned space flight announced this change officially as 204 would be recorded as apollo1 first crewed apollo saturn flight failed on ground test even though three uncrewed apollo missions as 201 as 202 and as 203 had previously occurred only as 201 and as 202 carried spacecraft therefore next mission first uncrewed saturn v test flight as 501 would be designated apollo4 with all subsequent flights numbered sequentially in order flown first three flights would not be renumbered and names apollo2 and would officially go unused mueller considered as 201 and as 202 first and second flights
