money song made because of legal issues from not having properly cleared samples american rapper azealia banks released a remix to harlem shake on her soundcloud page which was subsequently removed at

practice making beats he recorded harlem shake in 2012 in his bedroom studio in brooklyn new york with song he wanted to record a high pitched dutch house synthesizer over a hip hop track and make it

scottish dj featured song in his essential mix for bbc radio 1 record producer and mad decent label head diplo heard song and released it on may 22 as a free digital download through mad decent s imprint label jeffree s it was baauer s debut single music and lyrics harlem shake features harsh snares a mechanical bassline samples of growling lions and dutch house synth riffs it has a high tempo characteristic of hip hop and a dance music drop according to andrew ryce from resident advisor harlem shake is a hip hop and bass song while both david wagner of atlantic and khal from complex described it as trap a musical subgenre with stylistic origins in edm and southern hip hop featuring roland tr 808 beats and drops khal 10 best trap tracks of 2012 complex december 22 2012 ryce felt song s music represents hip hop contingent of bass music which is typified by rolling snares and jerky basslines finding it particularly symptomatic of a growing strain of music obsessed with trap by contrast jon caramanica from new york times argued that it isn t a hip hop song but it is hip hop influenced harlem shake begins with a sample of a voice shouting con los a spanish phrase which translates to with terrorists in english although listeners assumed it was a female voice sample was taken from 2006 reggaeton song by hector delgado who often used line as a refrain on his other songs in 2010 recorded phrase was used by philadelphia disc jockeys skinny friedman and dj apt one on their remix of gregor salto s dance track con baauer said he found vocal sample from an unidentified source on internet sampled voice is followed by building synths and snares and a syncopated sub bass sound before another voice commands listeners to do harlem shake line was sampled from plastic little s 2001 hip hop song miller time which baauer sampled after having a friend play it for him and getting it stuck in my head for a while plastic little member jayson musson said his line was inspired by a fist fight that he ended by performing harlem shake dance move this was my first fight and i didn t know how to properly end a fight so i just smiled at him and did harlem shake blood gushing from glass cuts on my face other kid i guess not wanting to fight anymore or maybe not wanting to fight someone who just danced at him got on his skateboard and took off without his shoes commercial performance thumb 230px left screenshots from one of numerous videos from harlem shake meme which skyrocketed song s sales and streams harlem shake was released commercially in june 2012 mad decent commissioned a music video for single at time but were not satisfied with result and shelved it it gradually received listens online and was re released as a single on january 8 2013 however it did not begin to sell significantly until february when a youtube video uploaded by filthy frank and featuring song developed into an internet meme of same name 30 second video showed people dancing to song and was parodied more than 3 000 times in other user submitted videos billboard magazine cited harlem shake as biggest viral sensation since psy s gangnam style baauer and mad decent generated income from both user submitted videos and baauer s original audio post on youtube because of site s content id service which allows artists labels and publishers to monetize songs according to msn money they earned 6 for every 1 000 views of video late week media response to meme helped single sell 12 000 units on itunes in week ending february 10 according to nielsen soundscan it consequently entered us dance electronic digital songs at number nine and dance electronic songs at number twelve mad decent s manager jasper goggins said that harlem shake was biggest thing they have released and it s happened within six days in united kingdom harlem shake reached number twenty two on uk singles chart during week of meme s phenomena by end of chart week single had climbed nineteen spots to number three martin talbot official charts company s managing director said that single s climb on chart underlines just how quickly this track has turned into a bone fide phenomenon at start of week it wasn t even selling enough to make top 20 but it is now one of uk s most popular tracks following week harlem shake debuted at number one on us billboard hot 100 and climbed to number one on dance electronic songs while selling 262 000 units it was first instrumental track to top hot 100 since jan hammer s 1985 miami vice theme it was also twenty first song in hot 100 s history to debut at number one and was aided by 103 million weekly video streams which was announced that week by billboard and nielsen soundscan as a new component of their charts according to billboards editorial director bill werde harlem shake s success prompted them to enact chart policy after two years of discussions with youtube however silvio pietroluongo magazine s director of charts said in an interview for a v club that their timing was coincidental and came after a period of negotiating chart policy and its logistics however because it lacked major label promotional support single registered low in airplay it also debuted at number one on aria singles chart and became 1000th number one song since australia began compiling charts in 1940 harlem shake remained at number one on hot 100 in its second week when it sold 297 000 digital units it also received more airplay after being promoted to radio by warner bros records who had agreed to a deal with mad decent on february 26 to distribute song worldwide harlem shake topped hot 100 for a third week and sold 228 000 units despite a decline in youtube streams by march 10 it had reached sales of one million digital units on march 12 sean michaels of guardian reported that song had earned more than ps50 000 from youtube harlem shake remained at number one for five consecutive weeks on hot 100 copyright infringement neither vocal sample used on harlem shake was contractually cleared with hector delgado or jayson musson who were both shocked to hear song after it became a hit in february delgado was told by his former manager javier gomez that he heard his voice on song and wanted to take legal action according to gomez diplo subsequently called delgado and told him that he was unaware harlem shake sampled his voice when it was released as a single gomez called harlem shake a clear breaking of intellectual property rights and said that since diplo s call lawyers for machete music have been negotiating with mad decent over compensation for sample musson received an enthusiastic call in late february from a past member of plastic little telling him that his voice was sampled on harlem shake musson did not have a problem with baauer using sample without his permission and found song s production phenomenal he subsequently called baauer to thank him for doing something useful with our annoying music however he felt that allusion to dance was peculiar and outdated i was like who fuck is rapping about harlem shake in 2012 musson said in an interview in march that he was negotiating with mad decent over compensation and that although no agreement had been reached label had been more than cooperative during this in april diplo told huffington post that he had reached an agreement to clear samples however in an august interview with pitchfork baauer said that he has not made any money from song despite diplo s reported agreement i m meeting with my lawyer so i m gonna find that out i think it s mostly because of all legal shit i didn t clear samples because i was in my fucking bedroom on grand street i wasn t going to think to call up delgado i didn t even know who it was who did that sample i knew jayson musson sample so i found myself in that fucking pickle legal letters and shit ugh lawyers so exposure wise it was fantastic but everything else critical reception pitchfork journalist larry fitzmaurice labelled song best new track upon its release in may 2012 and called it a disorienting banger with an irresistible appeal that owes almost everything to its menacing world smashing bassline fitzmaurice wrote in conclusion along with this purely visceral pleasure it s hard not to marvel at how awesome those growling lion samples sound randall roberts of los angeles times said that he liked song and viewed it as a syrupy instrumental that foreshadows convergence of hip hop dance and rock andrew ryce of resident advisor gave harlem shake a rating of three and a half out of five and found its musical climax admittedly satisfying that is until it resumes flailing like a novelty track writing that it s not hard to see why track is well liked but its ubiquity is a bit of a head scratcher simply because it s not all that interesting similarly jon caramanica of new york times said that after hearing a minute of it being played during power 105 1 fm s mixshow song felt more like a novelty than like part of a strategy caramanica felt that its success along with that of macklemore s 2012 song thrift shop reflects a future for hip hop and stated depending on your lens this reflects a tremendous cultural victory for hip hop or moment when hip hop as a construct begins to lose meaning remixes left thumb 190px azealia banks one of several rappers who remixed song on february 14 2013 american rapper azealia banks released a remix to harlem shake on soundcloud which was then removed at baauer s request banks disparaged baauer on twitter in response and claimed to have e mails sent from him giving her permission to use song she then said that diplo had sent her an e mail telling her that remix was removed because they would rather have rapper juicy j on it on february 16 banks shared a music video for her remix on vimeo and revealed a purported e mail from baauer saying he liked remix baauer responded in an interview for daily beast saying that they had planned to release a version of song with banks but felt that her verse did not meet their expectations jon caramanica of new york times cited banks remix as one of her best songs while chris martins of spin wrote that she delivers fire hot verse after fire hot verse and facetiously remarked that banks raps all over your dumb harlem shake meme pitbull and jim jones also recorded freestyle raps over song after releasing his version jones claimed in an interview that harlem shake was a song he originally recorded one year ago for an album by pauly d but that they ultimately scrapped it when i started to hear harlem shake and heard beat i was like damn i had record for a year so i just put record out track listing digital download harlem
