rue as a compilation album composition of its songs spans across a period of six years charting evolution of band s alternative rock sound opening tracks on album which are from band s first recording session exhibit band s early style noted for its abrasive guitar work heavily influenced by noise rock grindcore and no wave music and literate aggressive lyrics many of which mix derogatory language with cryptic and religious themes in particular retard girl is a narrative of a girl being abused and made fun of on a playground turpentine as well as retard girl feature historical and religious references as well turpentine features lyrics alluding to christianity i know all you devils by your christian names and i know all you bitches by your christian names bless my body and bless my soul wrap it in turpentine while a line from retard girl which reads as shines moon among lesser fires is directly referenced from odes a book of latin poems by roman poet horace burn black and dicknail also feature aggressive language and themes alluding to child molestation and incest beautiful son written and recorded in 1992 features a more mellow guitar riff and its lyrics make references to crossdressing love said songwriting process on track was an attempt to be a little dumber i was always trying to write a very complex song without ever having learned to write an easy beatles song noted in a 1994 interview it just had a riff it wasn t super smart but it sounded good and that s when i started learning things don t have to have lots and lots of notes that best songs are carried by simple lines and simple melodies this illustrates band s turning point from their noise rock beginnings to more mellow accessible sounds track old age whose organ intro was featured on band s cover of credit in straight world from live through this was revealed to have originally written by kurt cobain love stated in a 1997 interview that old age was partly someone else s composition it s something somebody had a little bit of and i said let me have rest of it and i wrote this thing in it and tried to make it goth i found it wrote it and recorded it same night it was later revealed that a version of song was recorded by nirvana during nevermind 1991 recording sessions but cobain threw song out later giving melody to love who rearranged musical pieces and rewrote lyrics two live cover versions were included on album season of witch by donovan and he hit me and it felt like a kiss which was written by carole king and recorded by crystals in 1960s love referred to it as a

published a middling review of album writing well i didn t ask for hole s new album but i got it anyway and you what do you want in your ripped black fishnet stocking this christmas season stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic gave album 3 5 out of 5 star rating but noted while rarity value of this music certainly makes it interesting music itself is pretty average with dreck outweighing good stuff spin gave album a positive review calling it a fairly scattered collection of singles outtakes live cuts etc that s totally worth it for four tracks that never made a proper album retard girl burn black beautiful son and drown soda they re essential love simon williams of nme gave album a middling five out of ten stars writing that courtney love makes astonishing leap from singing to sounding frankly completely drunk williams also characterized album as damned sloppy in spite of his view that hole always had more class than any green haired rock chick peers comparing band to l7 and he concluded while this experience may well be tremendously cathartic for courtney it gives everyone else a headache packaging and artwork thumb 190px front and back centerpieces of vinyl featuring marie antoinette dit a la rose 1783 cover artwork for album displays a dress worn by love in miss world music video while back artwork of lp depicts neck and breast of anne boleyn taken from

publicity photos of band as well as a 1783 portrait of marie antoinette by louise elisabeth vigee le brun and a photo of crushed car involved in road accident that killed actress jayne mansfield in an interview with melody maker in 1997 courtney love revealed significance of choice of artwork included in album interviewer artwork shows a dress you wore in early nineties as a sort of museum piece is it really in a museum courtney love dress is still very current people still design off that silly dress truth is i used to wear those dresses more than slips but those dresses never got as famous as slips and i wanted them to have their due interviewer artwork also has a car wreck and a picture of marie antoinette why did you choose them courtney love we actually show anne boleyn too she was henry viii s wife who had her head chopped off when i was little i used to see these pictures of her with this necklace that had a b on it i always had a fascination with ancient history roman especially and early english and i kept imagining her getting her head chopped off for my whole life then i told my friend joe who did art he always had an obsession with marie antoinette too she was also decapitated we also thought about jayne mansfield just idea of a woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her and hand grenades top comes off you just pull out pin and it explodes so if you take away someone s mouth and their eyes and their senses and their brain they explode i saw a grenade in my head i saw taking out clip and then i thought of a human body and what happens if you take out clip in 2010 hole reused portraits of marie antoinette and anne boleyn for front and back covers of their fourth studio album nobody s daughter however both of portraits were cropped so
