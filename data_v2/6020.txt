was recorded at two sold out shows in november 2010 during carlile s tour in support of her previous studio album give up ghost 2009 carlile who said that she and band had always wanted their fourth release to be a live album had initially hoped to record at a famous venue but decided to return to benaroya hall since she had performed there alongside symphony in 2008 prior to single rehearsal carlile had with 30 member strong seattle symphony string arrangers created charts and sent computer generated demos to carlile for approval carlile was reportedly shock ed to hear orchestra weaving in and out of her music according to carlile while recording process was not complicated she commented later on rehearsing with full symphony rehearsal process is really understated it s funny because it s not really needed it s not needed for us anyway because we know how to play songs and symphony charts don t change songs structurally at all but symphony charts are something that you re not used to hearing and then symphony doesn t need rehearsal because they sight read they sight read better than we could even imagine so when we get there they already know how to play our songs better than we do purpose of rehearsal is really honestly to prepare band for exactly how powerful concert is going to be when symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you re singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing it s so powerful that it causes you to take pause and you can t take pause and that s what rehearsal really is for composition thumb right

that our grandkids our great great grandkids will learn to sing in church it s one of those really really special songs thing that s going to make it that besides that it s so great is that everyone knows about it because hundreds of songwriters have been moved by that song and have covered it and that s just something really important that we do in every generation number of cover songs which
