gallium is a chemical element with symbol ga and atomic number 31 elemental gallium is a soft silvery blue metal at standard temperature and pressure however in its liquid state it becomes silvery white if too much force is applied gallium may fracture conchoidally it is in group 13 of periodic table and thus has similarities to other metals of group aluminium indium and thallium gallium does not occur as a free element in nature but as gallium iii compounds in trace amounts in zinc ores and in bauxite elemental gallium is a liquid at temperatures greater than above room temperature but below normal human body temperature of hence metal will melt in a person s hands melting point of gallium is used as a temperature reference point gallium alloys are used in thermometers as a non toxic and environmentally friendly alternative to mercury and can withstand higher temperatures than mercury an even lower melting point of well below freezing point of water is claimed for alloy galinstan 62 95 gallium 5 22 indium and 0 16 tin by weight but that may be freezing point with effect of since its discovery in 1875 gallium has been used to make alloys with low melting points it is also used in semiconductors as a dopant in semiconductor substrates gallium is predominantly used in electronics gallium arsenide primary chemical compound of gallium in electronics is used in microwave circuits high speed switching circuits and infrared circuits semiconducting gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride produce blue and violet light emitting diodes leds and diode lasers gallium is also used in production of artificial gadolinium gallium garnet for jewelry gallium is considered a technology critical element gallium has no known natural role in biology gallium iii behaves in a similar manner to ferric salts in biological systems and has been used in some medical applications including pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals physical properties thumb left crystallization of gallium from melt elemental gallium is not found in nature but it is easily obtained by smelting very pure gallium is a silvery blue metal that fractures conchoidally like glass gallium liquid expands by 3 10 when it solidifies therefore it should not be stored in glass or metal containers because container may rupture when gallium changes state gallium shares higher density liquid state with a short list of other materials that includes water silicon germanium antimony bismuth and plutonium greenwood and earnshaw p 222 gallium attacks most other metals by diffusing into metal lattice for example it diffuses into grain boundaries of aluminium zinc alloys and steel making them very brittle gallium easily alloys with many metals and is used in small quantities in plutonium gallium alloy in plutonium cores of nuclear bombs to stabilize plutonium crystal structure melting point of gallium at 302 9146 k 29 degc 85 degf is just above room temperature and is approximately same as average summer daytime temperatures in earth s mid latitudes this melting point mp is one of formal temperature reference points in international temperature scale of 1990 its 90 established by international bureau of weights and measures bipm triple point of gallium 302 k 29 degc 85 5799 degf is used by us national institute of standards and technology nist in preference to melting point melting point of gallium allows it to melt in human hand and then refreeze if removed liquid metal has a strong tendency to supercool below its melting point freezing point ga nanoparticles can be kept in liquid state below 90 k seeding with a crystal helps to initiate freezing gallium is one of four non radioactive metals with caesium rubidium and mercury that are known to be liquid at or near normal room temperature of four gallium is only one that is neither highly reactive rubidium and caesium nor highly toxic mercury and can therefore be used in metal in glass high temperature thermometers it is also notable for having one of largest liquid ranges for a metal and for having unlike mercury a low vapor pressure at high temperatures gallium s boiling point 2673 k is more than eight times higher than its melting point on absolute scale greatest ratio between melting point and boiling point of any element greenwood and earnshaw p 224 unlike mercury liquid gallium metal wets glass and skin along with most other materials with exceptions of quartz graphite and teflon making it mechanically more difficult to handle even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions gallium painted onto glass is a brilliant mirror greenwood and earnshaw p 221 for this reason as well as metal contamination and freezing expansion problems samples of gallium metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within other containers properties of gallium for different crystal b ca 25 degc um m 29 7 degc no m 0 degc no m 77 k no m 10130 814 3r 4 2 k po m 13 86 81 6 gallium does not crystallize in any of simple crystal structures stable phase under normal conditions is orthorhombic with 8 atoms in conventional unit cell within a unit cell each atom has only one nearest neighbor at a distance of 244 pm remaining six unit cell neighbors are spaced 27 30 and 39 pm farther away and they are grouped in pairs with same distance many stable and metastable phases are found as function of temperature and pressure phase diagrams of elements david a young prepared for u s energy research development administration under contract no w eng 48 1975 bonding between two nearest neighbors is covalent hence dimers are seen as fundamental building blocks of crystal this explains low melting point relative to neighbor elements aluminium and indium this structure is strikingly similar to that of iodine and forms because of interactions between single 4p electrons of gallium atoms further away from nucleus than 4s electrons and ar 3d10 core this phenomenon recurs with mercury with its pseudo noble gas xe electron configuration which is liquid at room temperature greenwood and earnshaw p 223 3d10 electrons do not shield outer electrons very well from nucleus and hence first ionisation energy of gallium is greater than that of aluminium physical properties of gallium are highly anisotropic i e have different values along three major axes a b and c see table producing a significant difference between linear a and volume thermal expansion coefficients properties of gallium are strongly temperature dependent particularly near melting point for example coefficient of thermal expansion increases by several hundred percent upon melting isotopes gallium has 31 known isotopes ranging in mass number from 56 to 86 only two isotopes are stable and occur naturally gallium 69 and gallium 71 gallium 69 is more abundant it makes up about 60 1 of natural gallium while gallium 71 makes up remaining 39 9 all other isotopes are radioactive with gallium 67 being longest lived half life 3 261 days isotopes lighter than gallium 69 usually decay through beta plus decay positron emission or electron capture to isotopes of zinc although lightest few with mass numbers 56 through 59 decay through prompt proton emission isotopes heavier than gallium 71 decay through beta minus decay electron emission possibly with delayed neutron emission to isotopes of germanium while gallium 70 can decay through both beta minus decay and electron capture gallium 67 is unique among light isotopes in having only electron capture as a decay mode as its decay energy is not sufficient to allow positron emission gallium 67 and gallium 68 half life 67 7 min are both used in nuclear medicine chemical properties gallium is found primarily in 3 oxidation state 1 oxidation state is also found in some compounds although it is less common than it is for gallium s heavier congeners indium and thallium for example very stable contains both gallium i and gallium iii and can be formulated as in contrast is unstable above 0 degc into elemental gallium and gallium iii chloride compounds containing ga ga bonds are true gallium ii compounds such as gas which can be formulated as s2 2 and complex 2 greenwood and earnshaw p 240 aqueous chemistry strong acids dissolve gallium forming gallium iii salts such as gallium sulfate and gallium nitrate aqueous solutions of gallium iii salts contain hydrated gallium ion gallium iii hydroxide may be precipitated from gallium iii solutions by adding ammonia dehydrating at 100 degc produces gallium oxide hydroxide gao oh alkaline hydroxide solutions dissolve gallium forming gallate salts not to be confused with identically named gallic acid salts containing anion gallium hydroxide which is amphoteric also dissolves in alkali to form gallate salts although earlier work suggested as another possible gallate anion it was not found in later work oxides and chalcogenides gallium reacts with chalcogens only at relatively high temperatures at room temperature gallium metal is not reactive with air and water because it forms a passive protective oxide layer at higher temperatures however it reacts with atmospheric oxygen to form gallium iii oxide reducing with elemental gallium in vacuum at 500 degc to 700 degc yields dark brown gallium i oxide is a very strong reducing agent capable of reducing to it disproportionates at 800 degc back to gallium and gallium iii sulfide has 3 possible crystal modifications it can be made by reaction of gallium with hydrogen sulfide at 950 degc alternatively can be used at 747 degc 2 3 6 reacting a mixture of alkali metal carbonates and with leads to formation of containing anion strong acids decompose these salts releasing in process mercury salt can be used as a phosphor gallium also forms sulfides in lower oxidation states such as gallium ii sulfide and green gallium i sulfide latter of which is produced from former by heating to 1000 degc under a stream of nitrogen other binary chalcogenides and have zincblende structure they are all semiconductors but are easily and have limited utility nitrides and pnictides gallium reacts with ammonia at 1050 degc to form gallium nitride gan gallium also forms binary compounds with phosphorus arsenic and antimony gallium phosphide gap gallium arsenide gaas and gallium antimonide gasb these compounds have same structure as zns and have important semiconducting properties gap gaas and gasb can be synthesized by direct reaction of gallium with elemental phosphorus arsenic or antimony they exhibit higher electrical conductivity than gan gap can also be synthesized by reacting with phosphorus at low temperatures gallium forms ternary nitrides for example similar compounds with phosphorus and arsenic are possible and these compounds are easily hydrolyzed by dilute acids and water halides gallium iii oxide reacts with fluorinating agents such as hf or to form gallium iii fluoride it is an ionic compound strongly insoluble in water however it dissolves in hydrofluoric acid in which it forms an adduct with water attempting to dehydrate this adduct forms adduct reacts with ammonia to form which can then be heated to form anhydrous gallium trichloride is formed by reaction of gallium metal with chlorine gas unlike trifluoride gallium iii chloride exists as dimeric molecules with a melting point of 78 degc compounds are formed with bromine and iodine and like other group 13 trihalides gallium iii halides are lewis acids reacting as halide acceptors with alkali metal halides to form salts containing anions where x is a halogen they also react with alkyl halides to form carbocations and when heated to a high temperature gallium iii halides react with elemental gallium to form respective gallium i halides for example reacts with ga to form 2 ga 3 gacl g at lower temperatures equilibrium shifts toward left and gacl disproportionates back to elemental gallium and gacl can also be produced by reacting ga with hcl at 950 degc product can be condensed as a red solid gallium i compounds can be stabilized by forming adducts with lewis acids for example gacl so called gallium ii halides are actually adducts of gallium i halides with respective gallium iii halides having structure for example gacl hydrides like aluminium gallium also forms a hydride known as gallane which may be produced by reacting lithium with gallium iii chloride at 30 degc 3 3 licl 4 in presence of dimethyl ether as solvent to if no solvent is used dimer is formed as a gas its structure is similar to having two hydrogen atoms bridging two gallium centers unlike a in which aluminium has a coordination number of 6 gallane is unstable above 10 degc decomposing to elemental gallium and hydrogen organogallium compounds organogallium compounds are of similar reactivity to organoindium compounds less reactive than organoaluminium compounds but more reactive than organothallium compounds and earnshaw pp 262 5 alkylgalliums are monomeric lewis acidity decreases in order al ga in and as a result organogallium compounds do not form bridged dimers as organoaluminum compounds do organogallium compounds are also less reactive than organoaluminum compounds they do form stable peroxides these alkylgalliums are liquids at room temperature having low melting points and are quite mobile and flammable is monomeric in solution but its crystals form chain structures due to weak ga c interactions gallium trichloride is a common starting reagent for formation of organogallium compounds such as in reactions gallium trichloride reacts with lithium cyclopentadienide in diethyl ether to form trigonal planar gallium cyclopentadienyl complex gallium i forms complexes with ligands such as hexamethylbenzene because this ligand is quite bulky structure of ga e6 is that of a half sandwich less bulky ligands such as mesitylene allow two ligands to be attached to central gallium atom in a bent sandwich structure benzene is even less bulky and allows formation of dimers an example is ga e6 2 history thumbnail small gallium droplets fusing together in 1871 existence of gallium was first predicted by russian chemist dmitri mendeleev who named it eka aluminium from its position in his periodic table he also predicted several properties of eka aluminium that correspond closely to real properties of gallium such as its density melting point oxide character and bonding in chloride class wikitable comparison between mendeleev s 1871 predictions and known properties of and earnshaw p 217 property mendeleev s predictions actual properties atomic weight 68 69 723 density 5 9 g cm3 5 904 g cm3 melting point low 29 767 degc formula of oxide m2o3 density of oxide 5 5 g cm3 5 88 g cm3 nature of hydroxide amphoteric amphoteric mendeleev further predicted that eka aluminium would be discovered by means of spectroscope and that metallic eka aluminium would dissolve slowly in both acids and alkalis and would not react with air he also predicted that m2o3 would dissolve in acids to give salts that eka aluminium salts would form basic salts that eka aluminium sulfate should form alums and that anhydrous should have a greater volatility than zncl2 all of these predictions turned out to be true gallium was discovered using spectroscopy by french chemist paul emile lecoq de boisbaudran in 1875 from its characteristic spectrum two violet lines in a sample of sphalerite later that year lecoq obtained free metal by electrolysis of hydroxide in potassium hydroxide solution he named element gallia from latin gallia meaning gaul after his native land of france it was later claimed that in one of those multilingual puns so beloved by men of science in 19th century he had also named gallium after himself le coq is french for rooster and latin word for rooster is gallus in an 1877 article lecoq denied this conjecture originally de boisbaudran determined density of gallium as 4 7 g cm3 only property that failed to match mendeleev s predictions mendeleev then wrote to him and suggested that he should density and de boisbaudran then obtained correct value of 5 9 g cm3 that mendeleev had predicted exactly from its discovery in 1875 until era of semiconductors primary uses of gallium were high temperature and metal alloys with unusual properties of stability or ease of melting some such being liquid at room temperature development of gallium arsenide as a direct bandgap semiconductor in 1960s ushered in most important stage in applications of gallium occurrence gallium does not exist as a free element in earth s crust and few high content minerals such as are too rare to serve as a primary source abundance in earth s crust is approximately 16 9 ppm this is comparable to crustal abundances of lead cobalt and niobium yet unlike these elements gallium does not form its own ore deposits with concentrations of 0 1 wt in ore rather it occurs at trace concentrations similar to crustal value in zinc ores and at somewhat higher values 50 ppm in aluminium ores from both of which it is extracted as a by product this lack of independent deposits is due to gallium s geochemical behaviour showing no strong enrichment in processes relevant to formation of most ore deposits united states geological survey usgs estimates that more than 1 million tons of gallium is contained in known reserves of bauxite and zinc ores some coal flue dusts contain small quantities of gallium typically less than 1 by weight however these amounts are not extractable without mining of host materials see below thus availability of gallium is fundamentally determined by rate at which bauxite zinc ores and coal are extracted production and availability thumb left 99 9999 6n gallium sealed in vacuum ampoule gallium is produced exclusively as a by product during processing of ores of other metals its main source material is bauxite chief ore of aluminium but minor amounts are also extracted from sulfidic zinc ores sphalerite being main host mineral in past certain coals were an important source during processing of bauxite to alumina in bayer process gallium accumulates in sodium hydroxide liquor from this it can be extracted by a variety of methods most recent is use of ion exchange resin achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on original concentration in feed bauxite at a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm about 15 of contained gallium is extractable remainder reports to red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams gallium is removed from ion exchange resin in solution electrolysis then gives gallium metal for semiconductor use it is further purified with zone melting or single crystal extraction from a melt czochralski process purities of 99 9999 are routinely achieved and commercially available thumb bauxite mine in jamaica 1984 its by product status means that gallium production is constrained by amount of bauxite sulfidic zinc ores and coal extracted per year therefore its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential supply potential of a by product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions i e technology and price reserves and resources are not relevant for by products since they cannot be extracted independently from main products recent estimates put supply potential of gallium at a minimum of 2 100 t yr from bauxite 85 t yr from sulfidic zinc ores and potentially 590 t yr from coal these figures are significantly greater than current production 375 t in 2016 thus major future increases in by product production of gallium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price average price in for low grade gallium was 120 per kilogram in 2016 and 135 140 per kilogram in 2017 in 2017 world s production of low grade gallium was ca 315 tons an increase of 15 from 2016 china japan south korea russia and ukraine were leading producers while germany ceased primary production of gallium in 2016 yield of high purity gallium was ca 180 tons mostly originating from china japan slovakia uk and u s 2017 world annual production capacity was estimated at 730 tons for low grade and 320 tons for refined gallium galium usgs 2018 china produced ca 250 tons of low grade gallium in 2016 and ca 300 tons in 2017 it also accounted for more than half of global led production applications semiconductor applications dominate commercial demand for gallium accounting for 98 of total next major application is for gadolinium gallium garnets greber j f 2012 gallium and gallium compounds in ullmann s encyclopedia of industrial chemistry wiley vch weinheim semiconductors thumb gallium based blue leds extremely high purity 99 9999 gallium is commercially available to serve semiconductor industry gallium arsenide gaas and gallium nitride gan used in electronic components represented about 98 of gallium consumption in united states in 2007 about 66 of semiconductor gallium is used in u s in integrated circuits mostly gallium arsenide such as manufacture of ultra high speed logic chips and for low noise microwave preamplifiers in cell phones about 20 of this gallium is used in worldwide gallium arsenide makes up 95 of annual global gallium consumption it amounted 7 5 billion in 2016 with 53 originating from cell phones 27 from wireless communications and rest from automotive consumer fiber optic and military applications recent increase in gaas consumption is mostly related to emergence of 3g and 4g smartphones which use 10 times more gaas than older models gallium arsenide and gallium nitride can also be found in a variety of optoelectronic devices which had a market share of 15 3 billion in 2015 and 18 5 billion in 2016 aluminium gallium arsenide algaas is used in high power infrared laser diodes semiconductors gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride are used in blue and violet optoelectronic devices mostly laser diodes and light emitting diodes for example gallium nitride 405 nm diode lasers are used as a violet light source for higher density blu ray disc compact data disc drives other major application of gallium nitride are cable television transmission commercial wireless infrastructure power electronics and satellites gan radio frequency device market alone was estimated at 370 million in 2016 and 420 million in 2016 photovoltaic cells developed for satellite power applications are made by molecular beam epitaxy or metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy of thin films of gallium arsenide indium gallium phosphide or indium gallium arsenide mars exploration rovers and several satellites use triple junction gallium arsenide on germanium cells gallium is also a component in photovoltaic compounds such as copper indium gallium selenium sulfide cu in ga se s 2 used in solar panels as a cost efficient alternative to crystalline silicon galinstan and other alloys thumb galinstan from a broken thermometer easily wetting a piece of ordinary glass thumb owing to their low melting points gallium and its alloys can be shaped into various 3d forms using 3d printing and additive manufacturing gallium readily alloys with most metals and is used as an ingredient in low melting alloys nearly eutectic alloy of gallium indium and tin is a room temperature liquid used in medical thermometers this alloy with trade name galinstan with stan referring to tin stannum in latin has a low freezing point of 19 degc 2 2 degf it has been suggested that this family of alloys could also be used to cool computer chips in place of water and is often used as a replacement for thermal paste in high performance computing gallium alloys have been evaluated as substitutes for mercury dental amalgams but these materials have yet to see wide acceptance because gallium wets glass or porcelain gallium can be used to create brilliant mirrors when wetting action of gallium alloys is not desired as in galinstan glass thermometers glass must be protected with a transparent layer of gallium iii oxide plutonium used in nuclear weapon pits is stabilized in d phase and made by alloying with gallium biomedical applications although gallium has no natural function in biology gallium ions interact with processes in body in a manner similar to iron iii because these processes include inflammation a marker for many disease states several gallium salts are used or are in development as pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine interest in anticancer properties of gallium emerged when it was discovered that 67ga iii citrate injected in tumor bearing animals localized to sites of tumor clinical trials have shown gallium nitrate to have antineoplastic activity against non hodgkin s lymphoma and cancers a new generation of gallium ligand complexes such as tris 8 gallium iii and gallium maltolate has emerged gallium nitrate brand name has been used as an intravenous pharmaceutical to treat associated with tumor metastasis to bones gallium is thought to interfere with function and therapy may be effective when other treatments have failed gallium maltolate an oral highly form of gallium iii ion is an anti proliferative to pathologically proliferating cells particularly cancer cells and some bacteria that accept it in place of ferric iron fe3 researchers are conducting clinical and preclinical trials on this compound as a potential treatment for a number of cancers infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases when gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron iii by bacteria such as pseudomonas ions interfere with respiration and bacteria die this happens because iron is redox active allowing transfer of electrons during respiration while gallium is redox inactive a complex amine phenol ga iii compound is selectively toxic to parasites resistant to chloroquine a common drug against malaria both ga iii complex and chloroquine act by inhibiting crystallization of a disposal product formed from digestion of blood by parasites salts gallium 67 salts such as gallium citrate and gallium nitrate are used as radiopharmaceutical agents in nuclear medicine imaging known as gallium scan radioactive isotope 67ga is used and compound or salt of gallium is unimportant body handles ga3 in many ways as though it were fe3 and ion is bound and concentrates in areas of inflammation such as infection and in areas of rapid cell division this allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques gallium 68 a positron emitter with a half life of 68 min is now used as a diagnostic radionuclide in pet ct when linked to pharmaceutical preparations such as a somatostatin analogue used for neuroendocrine tumors investigation and dota tate a newer one used for neuroendocrine metastasis and lung neuroendocrine cancer such as certain types of gallium 68 s preparation as a pharmaceutical is chemical and radionuclide is extracted by elution from germanium 68 a synthetic radioisotope of germanium in gallium 68 generators other uses gallium is used for neutrino detection possibly largest amount of pure gallium ever collected in a single spot is gallium germanium neutrino telescope used by sage experiment at neutrino observatory in russia this detector contains 55 57 tonnes 9 cubic metres of liquid gallium another experiment was neutrino detector operated in early 1990s in an italian mountain tunnel detector contained 12 2 tons of watered gallium 71 solar neutrinos caused a few atoms of to become radioactive which were detected this experiment showed that solar neutrino flux is 40 less than theory predicted this deficit was not explained until better solar neutrino detectors and theories were constructed see sno gallium is also used as a liquid metal ion source for a focused ion beam for example a focused gallium ion beam was used to create world s smallest book teeny ted from turnip town nano lab produces world s smallest book simon fraser university 11 april 2007 retrieved 31 january 2013 another use of gallium is as an additive in glide wax for skis and other low friction surface materials a well known practical joke among chemists is to fashion gallium spoons and use them to serve tea to unsuspecting guests since gallium has a similar appearance to its lighter homolog aluminium spoons then melt in hot tea precautions metallic gallium is not toxic however exposure to gallium halide complexes can result in acute toxicity ga3 ion of soluble gallium salts tends to form insoluble hydroxide when injected in large doses precipitation of this hydroxide resulted in in animals in lower doses soluble gallium is tolerated well and does not accumulate as a poison instead being excreted mostly
