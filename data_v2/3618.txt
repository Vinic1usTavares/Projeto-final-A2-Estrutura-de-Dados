director graeme harper was not informed of final scene until last possible second music as well as using existing music such as themes for daleks cybermen and rose murray gold specially composed a piece of music for rose s farewell entitled doomsday which featured vocal work from melanie pappenheim instead of using swelling violins that davies and rest of production team had expected gold took a minimalist approach when pitching track to production team gold described track as representing rose s unbridled energy and determination as she searches for doctor he later said i wanted to get that kind of throbbing sort of hurt sound of quite emotional rock because i thought that s what rose would do if she was hurting and ran up to her bedroom and locked herself in her room and had a good old cry really piece uses same vocal work from rose when rose first enters tardis thus creating a bookend effect it is a favourite among fans and of executive producer julie gardner and is one of
