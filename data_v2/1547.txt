max hit road was developed by a small team at lucasarts with prior experience on their adventure games including sean clark michael stemmle and sam max creator steve purcell and his future wife collette michaud prior to being employed at lucasarts steve purcell had developed sam max characters and started publishing stories about them around 1987 these had caught attention of some of lucasarts developers through a suggestion that lucasarts artist ken macklin purcell was brought into team by art director gary winnick purcell helped to draw cover art for zak and alien mindbenders then helped with character animations in indiana jones and fate of atlantis sam and max first appeared as video game characters as internal testing material for scumm engine programmers recently employed by lucasarts steve purcell created animated versions of characters and an office backdrop for programmers to practice on soon after sam max comic strips by steve purcell were published in lucasarts quarterly newsletter after a positive reaction from fans to strips and out of a wish to use new characters and settings after success of monkey island and maniac mansion franchises lucasarts offered in 1992 to create a video game out of characters game was based on 1989 sam max comic on road which featured two on a journey across united states several of game s tourist traps were based on real locations experienced by developers steve purcell recollects a childhood visit to a frog rock one of locations featured in game and remembered thinking that s it it doesn t even look like a frog a chain of snuckey s roadside stores and attractions was a tribute to stuckey s chain which purcell and his family often stopped at during road trips lucasarts planned a relatively short timetable for sam max of about eight months and team opted to use storyboarding for first time at lucasarts to plan out game sam max was one of first games to include a full speech soundtrack and music which for steve purcell was a dream opportunity to hear his creations speak steve purcell describes casting bill farmer in role of sam as his audition tape was very dry he wasn t trying too hard to sell lines actor nick jameson was cast to voice max game s jazz score was composed by lucasarts clint bajakian michael land and peter mcconnell and was incorporated into game using land and mcconnell s imuse engine which allowed for audio to be synchronized with visuals high quality versions of four of game s tracks were included on cd version of game sam max hit road was released simultaneously on floppy disk and cd rom only cd version of game contained full in game speech and music fans of game have since recreated game s midi soundtrack in higher quality mp3 format as sam max comics had a more adult tone steve purcell expected lucasarts to cut back edgier material from game however he expressed that he was pleased with how lucasarts allowed him to stay close to his original vision for game game s various minigames were included to allow players to take a break from solving main game s puzzles and play something short and silly sam max hit road also signified a major change in development for games on scumm engine user interface was entirely rehauled from that introduced in maniac mansion and built upon in subsequent games instead of selecting a verb function from a list at bottom of screen and clicking on an in game entity sam max hit road compressed all verb functions into mouse cursor which players could cycle through using right mouse button inventory was also moved off main screen to a sub screen accessible by a small icon on screen according to steve purcell this cleared space on screen to expand on excellent backgrounds and also made interaction much quicker and less laborious than lucasarts previous adventure games conversation trees were also affected by this michael stemmle proposed removing text based selection menu used in previous lucasarts adventure games in favor of icons representing topics of discussion as nothing would kill a joke worse than reading it before you hear it several of these innovations were retained for future lucasarts adventure games reception according to steve purcell sam max hit road was commercially successful he remarked in 2000 numbers never compared to star wars but it sold enough to be considered a hit by most standards sam max received a favorable reception from gaming industry s press holding a rating of 84 on review aggregator site gamerankings charles ardai of computer gaming world in 1994 liked it measurably less than day of tentacle he compared latter to a looney tunes cartoon and former to an underground comic book observing that sam maxs style of humor can all be funny but only to a point its main characters are basically jerks and story was unimportant even to them ardai cited completely optional and disconnected minigames as ing to feeling that sam max is more a computerized than a unified focused piece of fiction he liked graphics and simplified scumm interface but concluded that whole is rather less than sum of its parts sam max affords a couple of hours of somewhat similar amusement to tentacle edge noted that with most adventure games its hard to feel anything for character s you control but stated that sam max hit road broke this mold by being genuinely funny and players would be experimenting more than normally just to see what madcap pair will get up to next reviewer praised game s graphics as beautifully detailed and puzzles as intricate to solve but noted that a number of minigames were dismal joonas linkola writing for adventure gamers echoed many of these comments praising cartoon style graphics as appropriately cheesy and colorful on subject of game s humor linkola noted that there are many visual jokes but backbone of game is in its witty dialogue and as such this gave game a replayability value as players may pick up on jokes based on verbal acrobatics on use of polysyllabic words old english and other such oddities that they missed first time around linkola gave additional praise to soundtrack and audio work stating that very fitting voices adds to comical duo s wisecracking attitude allgame reviewer steve honeywell was also very positive with his comments describing plot as interesting graphics as appropriately cartoonish and fun and locations as well designed but noting that above all what makes sam max hit road work is humor on game s puzzles honeywell stated that some of puzzles are pretty simple while others are difficult in extreme one nice thing is almost complete absence of red herring items everything you find can be put to use somewhere as with other reviews allgame praised audio work noting that music is decent throughout game and voice talent is stellar closing with comment that game takes point and click adventures to insane new heights in terms of both fun and comedy praised graphics of game as superb but noted that it s not so friendly that it can only be played by kiddies although describing sound setup as a bit tricky reviewer praised voice acting as very good and music as top quality however although review noted that game had easy to use interfaces and menus it was critical of fact that at times it can be frustrating hunt for correct pixel syndrome game was one of four nominees for 1994
