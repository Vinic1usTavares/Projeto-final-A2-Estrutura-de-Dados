militants began clashing with government soldiers on 1 january 1991 us ambassador to somalia james keough bishop contacted department of state requesting an evacuation of embassy which was approved following day united states central command began planning and mobilizing forces that evening initial plan was to evacuate with a military transport plane through mogadishu international airport but this was later abandoned a helicopter evacuation via and was remaining option on morning of 5 january a 60 person marine and navy seal security detail was dispatched from guam aboard two ch 53e super stallion helicopters to secure embassy and prepare for main evacuation two helicopters returned to guam with first 61 evacuees throughout day foreign diplomats and civilians sought refuge at embassy

total operation eastern exit evacuated 281 with a 282d born aboard ship diplomats and civilians from 30 countries including 12 heads of missions eight ambassadors and four charges d affaires background in late 1980s there was increasing rebellion against rule of somali president siad barre a military dictator who maintained tight control of power and had a record of human rights abuses by 1990 what began as civil disobedience evolved into a civil war with several militias organized to overthrow central government in july 1989 embassy moved to a new compound from previous embassy and james k bishop was appointed as united states ambassador to somalia ambassador bishop had significant experience in crisis management at us embassies in 1967 he was at us embassy in beirut lebanon when six day war erupted about 3 600 americans were evacuated in 33 hours bishop was one of 26 diplomats and soldiers that remained in city as deputy assistant secretary of state for africa from 1981 87 bishop chaired several task forces for crises and gained experience in state department s operations center as evacuations were carried out during several coups d etat during his previous assignment as ambassador to liberia 1987 90 bishop was overseeing voluntary evacuation of embassy staff and civilians as a civil war in liberia spread when he left in march 1990 soon after returning to washington to prepare for his new appointment to somalia he was appointed to a taskforce to deal with crisis in liberia which included a gradual evacuation of american civilians and a rapid closure of embassy in august on 1 august before leaving us to take up his post in mogadishu ambassador bishop visited united states central command military command for middle east and northeast africa where he spent most of day with its commander gen norman schwarzkopf ambassador bishop aware of ongoing strife believed odds were better than even that we would have to leave mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances ambassador bishop understood from his past experiences in beirut and liberia importance of being prepared to deal with emergencies and spent afternoon working with military experts to review embassy s emergencies and evacuation e e plan until he was satisfied that central command realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from mogadishu and was prepared to do that in its analysis of operation eastern exit center for naval analyses cited ambassador bishop s previous experience and clear understanding of his role in operation as one of reasons operation eastern exit went so well hours after ambassador bishop s visit to central command iraq invaded kuwait in 1979 us negotiated access to an airport and port in both mogadishu and berbera because of limited access us had to locations in persian gulf area maintaining this access was a main interest for mogadishu embassy to pursue as us mobilized to intervene in kuwait though united states did not have any forces nor did it use somali facilities in support of operation desert shield an increasing level of criminal violence prompted ambassador bishop to request voluntary evacuation of dependents e g children and spouses of staff and non essential staff in early december although fighting between government and united somali congress a rebel militia remained no less than about away voluntary evacuation later became a mandatory evacuation by 19 december number of official us personnel in city was reduced from 147 to 37 around same time fighting between government and rebels came within about of mogadishu collapse of barre government thumb right president of somalia major general siad barre on 30 december violence escalated an order of magnitude as militants entered mogadishu which was quickly enveloped by a general state of lawlessness on 30 31 december diplomats including many stationed in offices elsewhere in city were collected and housed in embassy compound except two volunteers who remained in embassy s k 7 residential apartments located across afgoy road from embassy volunteers in k 7 building would be needed as look outs for embassy compound s main gate on morning of 31 december defense attache was nearly killed when his vehicle was sprayed with bullets and that evening a soldier at a roadblock shot tires of a vehicle carrying another defense official attempts by us and other nations diplomats in particular italian embassy to negotiate a ceasefire for foreigners to leave were unsuccessful afgoy road became a shooting gallery preventing those in safe havens outside embassy from reaching it on new year s day first american civilians began to seek refuge at embassy ambassador bishop requested an evacuation of american community on 1 january indicating that evacuation could be with planned italian french or german evacuation efforts but preferred an evacuation by us military state department authorized evacuation on 2 january and on that day ambassador bishop specifically requested an evacuation by us military thereby initiating operation eastern exit ambassador bishop had spent a considerable amount of time discussing contingency plans for evacuation with other diplomatic posts ultimately ten heads of missions eight ambassadors and two charges d affaires along with their staff sought refuge in us embassy compound and were evacuated plans mobilization and escalating violence ambassador bishop had visited central command in august 1990 where he worked with military experts to update embassy s e e plan first notice that an evacuation of mogadishu embassy would be needed came on morning of 1 january when top naval commander at central command sent a message to his naval operations staff better have crowd take a look at a helo neo of mogadishu time distance to get there from masirah op area following ambassador s 2 january evacuation request commander of central command ordered air force aircraft to region movement of amphibious ships to mogadishu and requested united states special operations command to prepare for a noncombatant evacuation operation initial plan was to evacuate via mogadishu international airport soon after evacuation request united states air force deployed c 130 transport planes and an ac 130 for gunfire support to nairobi kenya awaiting clearances to enter somalia and ability to safely transfer evacuees from embassy to airport however us and other foreign embassies were unable to contact anyone within government to obtain clearances it also became apparent that rebels had an ineffective command and control structure making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of safe passage likewise government troops faced a command and control problem reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with thus it became clear that safe passage to airport would not be possible several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach mogadishu but faced same problems of landing and transit of evacuees to airport on 4 january several incidents including a couple exchanges of gunfire suggested that embassy s security detail was insufficient to hold off armed somalis until uss guam and uss trenton arrived with their helicopters and soldiers at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 january embassy had just six marine guards whose job was limited to protecting chancery ambassador bishop made an urgent request to washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into embassy to defend it until ships arrived request was denied but ambassador was told that an advance element from vessels would reach embassy following morning thumb uss guam uss guam and uss trenton began transit from coast of oman towards mogadishu at 22 30 23 30 oman time on 2 january commander of amphibious group 2 phibgru two had initially proposed a seven ship amphibious task group composed of vessels anchored at masirah island off oman and dubai and including four amphibious ships so that full range of amphibious capabilities would be available for operation however intervention in kuwait seemed imminent and commander u s naval forces central command did not want to divert that many ships from persian gulf and was mindful of ongoing extended deployment of operation sharp edge off liberia thus decision to send just two ships although two vessels were selected by mid afternoon on 2 january transfer of some personnel from dubai to masirah and a decision to refuel two ships again due to potential risk of an extended operation like sharp edge delayed departure by about ten hours guam and trenton carried forces from 4th marine expeditionary brigade including a detachment of ch 53e super stallion helicopters largest helicopters operated by us military and two squadrons of ch 46 sea knight helicopters thumb left uss trenton planning began in earnest as ships got underway with a combined command center on guam on morning of 3 january task force s command questioned why they were not given option of an amphibious landing and requested a tank landing ship be added to task force seventh fleet command staff which were pacific based did not understand this request and denied request various military staffs were operating with different sets of information aboard guam a warrant officer who had previously served as a marine security guard msg at mogadishu embassy during mid 1980s was found former msg looked at aboard ship material and said it was incorrect former msg told planners that a new embassy had been planned and was under construction several years prior in fact new embassy was located further inland two ships were from phibgru two and marines from second marine expeditionary brigade meb both east coast commands they had received old intelligence material about mogadishu seventh fleet staff had up to date information with embassies actual location after receiving updated information task force commanders determined that a beach landing requiring troops to fight their way across city was too risky initial plans had ships launch their helicopters at 01 00 on 7 january from just off coast however in response to indications from ambassador bishop that conditions in mogadishu were deteriorating planners considered and later flights with ch while ships were still located in northern arabian sea situation in mogadishu stabilized somewhat and mission was delayed until 5 january evacuation thumb

above roundabout on evening of 4 january final execute order was issued for a 02 45 launch of two ch 53e super stallions to arrive at embassy at dawn 60 soldiers selected for security detail were issued weapons and ammunition two marine corps kc 130 refueling tankers were mobilized closer to operation from bahrain to oman to refuel helicopters en route to mogadishu and two helicopters transferred from trenton to guam security detail and first evacuees two ch 53e super stallions carrying a 60 man security detail 51 marines and nine navy seals departed guam at 02 47 from embassy and were expected to arrive at 06 20 they performed two aerial refuelings during first refueling a pipe burst on one of helicopters dousing marines in fuel and nearly forcing a return to guam problems with helicopters navigation system also complicated refueling rendezvous helicopters arrived in mogadishu at dawn crossing coast just south of harbor at in altitude on a route that was planned to avoid areas of more intense violence reported in northern parts of city on their arrival in mogadishu crew of helicopters were using an outdated 1969 map which showed embassy in an isolated area furthermore they had been told embassy could be discerned by its white stucco perimeter wall and golf course embassy was in fact surrounded by new development and crew saw white stucco walls around many buildings in city helicopters were flying too low to spot a strobe light which was placed on embassy s water tower highest point within embassy compound and golf course in embassy compound had a black oil coated surface not familiar green grass that helicopter crew would recognize after breaking radio silence their only direct communication with embassy was unencrypted to contact embassy they were able to discern it and land at 07 10 as they arrived a group of about 100 to 150 somalis were attempting to enter embassy compound via ladders on wall but scattered as helicopters arrived security detail moved to establish a perimeter around embassy compound and air force s ac 130 arrived to provide overhead support ambassador bishop gave security detail clear instructions on rules of engagement they could only use deadly force if people came over embassy compound s walls with obvious hostile intent he also identified three zones of defense stating a preference to retreat to third zone before use of deadly force entire embassy compound chancery joint administrative office jao building marine house and helicopter landing zone hlz chancery and jao buildings two safehaven buildings where evacuees were held ambassador bishop clearly explained his rationale to security detail which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in violence in mogadishu he feared that embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in clashes got impression that us was intervening in conflict to this effect he requested voice of america and bbc broadcast announcements that forces were present only to evacuate embassy and would not interfere in conflict marines who had been doused in fuel during refueling were able to take a shower and wash their clothes thumb marines board two ch 53e super stallion helicopters with refueling probes attached on uss bataan a ship similar to guam after an hour on ground helicopters left with first 61 evacuees including all american civilians and four heads of mission evacuees were provided blankets on one of flights to remain warm complications with only in flight refueling on return nearly prevented refueling which would have forced helicopters to divert to somali desert and await a rescue at 9 40 helicopters arrived on guam and unloaded evacuees embassy during day no threats came upon embassy during day although truckloads of armed somalis frequently drove by embassy along road only one incident seemed to directly target embassy a sniper and a spotter were positioned on embassy s water tower highest structure in compound and came under fire they were ordered to not return fire and soon thereafter ordered to leave their position on water tower office of military cooperation just one and a half blocks from embassy required evacuation despite its proximity to embassy an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by unrest a convoy of vehicles with several marines and seals left embassy at 8 47 and returned ten minutes later with 22 persons from omc four americans a filipino and 17 kenyans this was only excursion outside embassy by security detail throughout day foreign diplomats contacted embassy desiring to be evacuated us welcomed these requests but required all of them to find their own transportation to embassy a somali officer who had a previous relationship with embassy major siad agreed to travel to rescue german charge d affaires and british ambassador junior staff from british embassy had previously come to us embassy soviet union was unable to land a plane in mogadishu previous day and soviet ambassador asked ambassador bishop if he and his staff could be rescued ambassador bishop a tennis partner of his soviet counterpart agreed but only if they found their own way to embassy seeing helicopters on morning of 5 january they realized americans would not remain in city much longer at request of ambassador bishop major siad agreed to transport soviets but only if he was paid enough us embassy paid major siad who returned with soviet ambassador and 38 of his staff brother of president barre who was also a major general and chief of police showed up at embassy in afternoon with 25 members of his family requesting to be evacuated but was turned away after a vocal conversation with ambassador operation did not include soldiers to handle evacuation control center ecc which was set up in jao a 44 person force consisting primarily of soldiers to handle ecc was planned for insertion with ch 53e super stallions after they had returned to guam however this was cancelled over objections from commander of security detail deficit was partially handled by embassy staff who assisted a few soldiers from security detail evacuees were grouped into 15 person sticks to be loaded onto helicopters and were limited to one piece of luggage apiece some attempted to bring more resulting in problems coordinating their evacuation furthermore many evacuees had pets they wanted to bring which were not allowed most pets were killed by their owners some were given poison meanwhile soldiers were allowed to consume anything they wanted from embassy s commissary such as candy sodas and souvenirs most had been stationed on ships for several months they were also allowed use or take anything they needed from embassy medic filled several bags with medical supplies to return to ship as evening approached work began to prepare hlz for main evacuation area was used as a parking lot and several vehicles were left without keys by staff that had already been evacuated some cars had to be broken into to be moved chemical lights were placed in hlz in a nato y pattern entire mission would be conducted with night vision goggles which required all lights in embassy compound to be turned off main evacuation thumb two ch 46 sea knight helicopters departing uss kearsarge a ship similar to guam main evacuation occurred in early morning hours of 6 january and consisted of four waves of five ch 46 helicopters timing of this phase was determined by range of ch 46 sea knight which lack aerial refueling capability ships were about away during this phase an ac 130 was sent from saudi arabia to provide gunfire support during evacuation and two uh 1 iroquois helicopters were on standby to provide gunfire support but were not deployed first wave departed guam at 23 43 as second wave landed major siad arrived at embassy gate accompanied by two truckloads of soldiers and held a grenade in one hand and a radio in other his request to speak with ambassador was granted major siad demanded that evacuation cease immediately because somali government had not granted us permission to carry out such a military operation he claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down helicopters if operation continued second and third waves were able to depart without incident as ambassador negotiated with major who finally agreed to settle matter for several thousand dollars in cash and keys to ambassador s armored car ambassador bishop remained engaged in conversation with major until he reached helicopter landing zone to depart with final wave to prevent major from reneging on deal final wave departed embassy at 1 49 and landed on guam at 2 23 twenty minutes later ambassador bishop declared evacuation complete aftermath at embassy armed looters were observed entering embassy compound as final wave departed doors of chancery main building of embassy were reportedly blown open by rpgs within two hours of embassy s evacuation somali employees of embassy known as foreign service nationals fsns could not be evacuated ambassador bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees airlifted to safer parts of somalia many of fsns had sought refuge in embassy with their families and about 30 were hired as guards and protected embassy throughout ordeal local banks had been closed for some time and embassy was unable to pay fsns ambassador left fsns with keys to commissary and warehouse on embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed return
