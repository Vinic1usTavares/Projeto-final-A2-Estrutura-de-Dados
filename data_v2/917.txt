jurgen ehlers 29 december 1929 20 may 2008 was a german physicist who contributed to understanding of albert einstein s theory of general relativity from graduate and postgraduate work in pascual jordan s relativity research group at hamburg university he held various posts as a lecturer and later as a professor before joining max planck institute for astrophysics in munich as a director in 1995 he became founding director of newly created max planck institute for gravitational physics in potsdam germany ehlers research focused on foundations of general relativity as well as on theory s applications to astrophysics he formulated a suitable classification of exact solutions to einstein s field equations and proved ehlers geren sachs theorem that justifies application of simple general relativistic model universes to modern cosmology he created a spacetime oriented description of gravitational lensing and clarified relationship between models formulated within framework of general relativity and those of newtonian gravity in addition ehlers had a keen interest in both history and philosophy of physics and was an ardent populariser of science biography early life jurgen ehlers was born in hamburg he attended public schools from 1936 to 1949 and then went on to study physics mathematics and philosophy at hamburg university from 1949 to 1955 in winter term of 1955 56 he passed high school teacher s examination but instead of becoming a teacher undertook graduate research with pascual jordan who acted as his thesis advisor ehlers doctoral work was on construction and characterization of solutions of einstein field equations he earned his doctorate in physics from hamburg university in 1958 dissertation is cf prior to ehlers arrival main research of jordan s group had been dedicated to a scalar tensor modification of general relativity that later became known as jordan dicke theory this theory differs from general relativity in that gravitational constant is replaced by a variable field ehlers was instrumental in changing group s focus to structure and interpretation of einstein s original theory other members of group included wolfgang kundt rainer k sachs and manfred trumper as described in and group had a close working relationship with otto heckmann and his student engelbert at hamburger city s observatory guests at group s colloquium included wolfgang pauli joshua goldberg and peter bergmann in 1961 as jordan s assistant ehlers earned his habilitation qualifying him for a german professorship he then held teaching and research positions in germany and in us namely at university of kiel syracuse university and hamburg university from 1964 to 1965 he was at graduate research center of southwest in dallas from 1965 to 1971 he held various positions in alfred schild s group at university of texas at austin starting as an associate professor and in 1967 obtaining a position as full professor during that time he held visiting professorships at universities of wurzburg and bonn cf english version online as and associated cv in german english translation of title cv for prof dr jurgen ehlers dates and positions also summarized in munich in 1970 ehlers received an offer to join max planck institute for physics and astrophysics in munich as director of its gravitational theory department p 472 ehlers had been suggested by ludwig biermann institute s director at time when ehlers joined institute in 1971 he also became an adjunct professor at munich s ludwig maximilian university in march 1991 institute split into max planck institute for physics and max planck institute for astrophysics where ehlers department found a home p 634 over 24 years of his tenure his research group was home to among others gary gibbons john stewart and bernd schmidt as well as visiting scientists including abhay demetrios christodoulou and brandon carter as described in one of ehlers postdoctoral students in munich was reinhard breuer who later became editor in chief of spektrum der wissenschaft german edition of popular science journal scientific american potsdam when german science institutions reorganized after german reunification in 1990 ehlers lobbied for establishment of an institute of max planck society dedicated to research on gravitational theory on 9 june 1994 society decided to open max planck institute for gravitational physics in potsdam institute started operations on 1 april 1995 with ehlers as its founding director and as leader of its department for foundations and mathematics of general relativity p 676 ehlers then oversaw founding of a second institute department devoted to gravitational wave research and headed by bernard f schutz on 31 december 1998 ehlers retired to become founding director emeritus p 737 ehlers continued to work at institute until his death on 20 may 2008 see p 520 in max planck society s annual report for 2000 time as emeritus and death cf he left behind his wife anita ehlers his four children martin kathrin david and max as well as five grandchildren english version online as research ehlers research was in field of general relativity in particular he made contributions to cosmology theory of gravitational lenses and gravitational waves his principal concern was to clarify general relativity s mathematical structure and its consequences separating rigorous proofs from heuristic conjectures exact solutions for his doctoral thesis ehlers turned to a question that was to shape his lifetime research he sought exact solutions of einstein s equations model universes consistent with laws of general relativity that are simple enough to allow for an explicit description in terms of basic mathematical expressions these exact solutions play a key role when it comes to building general relativistic models of physical situations however general relativity is a fully theory its laws are same independent of which coordinates are chosen to describe a given situation one direct consequence is that two apparently different exact solutions could correspond to same model universe and differ only in their coordinates ehlers began to look for serviceable ways of characterizing exact solutions that is in ways that do not depend on coordinate choice in order to do so he examined ways of describing intrinsic geometric properties of known exact solutions b schmidt preface to during 1960s following up on his doctoral thesis ehlers published a series of papers all but one in collaboration with colleagues from hamburg group which later became known as hamburg bible p 2180 first paper written with jordan and kundt is a treatise on how to characterize exact solutions to einstein s field equations in a systematic way analysis presented there uses tools from differential geometry such as petrov classification of weyl that is those parts of riemann tensor describing curvature of space time that are not constrained by einstein s equations isometry groups and conformal transformations this work also includes first definition and classification of pp waves a class of simple gravitational waves a later version of this paper is for an assessment see j bicak p 14f in following papers in series were treatises on gravitational radiation one with sachs one with trumper work with sachs studies among other things vacuum solutions with special algebraic properties using 2 component spinor formalism it also gives a systematic exposition of geometric properties of bundles in mathematical terms of light beams spacetime geometry can influence propagation of light making them converge on or diverge from each other or deforming bundle s cross section without changing its area paper formalizes these possible changes in bundle in terms of bundle s expansion convergence divergence and twist and shear cross section area conserving deformation linking those properties to spacetime geometry one result is ehlers sachs theorem describing properties of shadow produced by a narrow beam of light encountering an opaque object tools developed in that work would prove essential for discovery by roy kerr of his kerr solution describing a rotating black hole one of most important exact solutions ehlers sachs theorem see sec 5 3 in an assessment of work and its connection with kerr solution is given by j bicak on p 14f of original work with sachs is last of these seminal papers addressed general relativistic treatment of mechanics of continuous media however useful notion of a point mass may be in classical physics in general relativity such an idealized mass concentration into a single point of space is not even well defined that is why relativistic hydrodynamics that is study of continuous media is an essential part of model building in general relativity paper systematically describes basic concepts and models in what editor of journal general relativity and gravitation on occasion of publishing an english translation 32 years after original publication date called one of best reviews in this area english translation by g f r ellis is quotation can be found on p 1225 in editor s comments section another part of ehlers exploration of exact solutions in his thesis led to a result that proved important later at time ehlers started his research on his doctoral thesis golden age of general relativity had not yet begun and basic properties and concepts of black holes were not yet understood in work that led to his doctoral thesis ehlers proved important properties of surface around a black hole that would later be identified as its horizon in particular that gravitational field inside cannot be static but must change over time simplest example of this is einstein rosen bridge or schwarzschild wormhole that is part of schwarzschild solution describing an idealized spherically symmetric black hole interior of horizon houses a bridge like connection that changes over time collapsing sufficiently quickly to keep any space traveler from traveling through wormhole changing views of what eventually be regarded as black holes can be found in ehlers thesis is ehlers group in physics duality means that two equivalent descriptions of a particular physical situation exist using different physical concepts this is a special case of a physical symmetry that is a change that preserves key features of a physical system a simple example for a duality is that between electric field e and magnetic field b electrodynamics in complete absence of electrical charges replacement e b b e leaves maxwell s equations invariant whenever a particular pair of expressions for b and e conform to laws of electrodynamics switching two expressions around and adding a minus sign to new b is also valid in his doctoral thesis ehlers pointed out a duality symmetry between different components of metric of a stationary vacuum spacetime which maps solutions of einstein s field equations to other solutions this symmetry between tt component of metric which describes time as measured by clocks whose spatial coordinates do not change and a term known as twist potential is analogous to aforementioned duality between e and b cf dieter maison s contribution duality and hidden symmetries in gravitational theories pp 273 323 in duality discovered by ehlers was later expanded to a larger symmetry corresponding to special linear group this larger symmetry group has since become known as ehlers group its discovery led to further generalizations notably infinite dimensional geroch group geroch group is generated by two non commuting subgroups one of which is ehlers group these so called hidden symmetries play an important role in kaluza klein reduction of both general relativity and its generalizations such as eleven dimensional supergravity other applications include their use as a tool in discovery of previously unknown solutions and their role in a proof that solutions in stationary symmetric case form an system maison op cit and for various applications cosmology ehlers geren sachs theorem thumb right 250px inhomogeneities in temperature of cosmic background radiation recorded in this image from satellite probe wmap amount to no more than 10 4 kelvins ehlers geren sachs theorem published in 1968 shows that in a given universe if all freely falling observers measure cosmic background radiation to have exactly same properties in all directions that is they measure background radiation to be isotropic then that universe is an isotropic and homogeneous friedmann lemaitre spacetime p original work is cosmic and homogeneity are important as they are basis of modern standard model of cosmology e g p 2 fundamental concepts in general relativity in 1960s ehlers collaborated with felix pirani and alfred schild on a constructive axiomatic approach to general relativity a way of deriving theory from a minimal set of elementary objects and a set of axioms specifying these objects properties basic ingredients of their approach are primitive concepts such as event light ray particle and freely falling particle at outset spacetime is a mere set of events without any further structure they postulated basic properties of light and freely falling particles as axioms and with their help constructed differential topology conformal structure and finally metric structure of spacetime that is notion of when two events are close to each other role of light rays in linking up events and a notion of distance between events key steps of construction correspond to idealized measurements such standard range finding used in radar final step derived einstein s equations from weakest possible set of additional axioms result is a formulation that clearly identifies assumptions underlying general relativity see a summary can be found in in 1970s in collaboration with rudolph ehlers addressed problem of rigid bodies in general relativity rigid bodies are a fundamental concept in classical physics however fact that by definition their different parts move simultaneously is incompatible with relativistic concept of speed of light as a limiting speed for propagation of signals and other influences while as early as 1909 max born had given a definition of rigidity that was compatible with relativistic physics his definition depends on assumptions that are not satisfied in a general space time and are thus overly restrictive ehlers and rudolph generalized born s definition to a more readily applicable definition they called pseudo rigidity which represents a more satisfactory approximation to rigidity of classical physics see original publication is gravitational lensing thumb right bending light most astrophysical modeling of gravitational lens systems makes use of quasi newtonian approximation with peter schneider ehlers embarked on an in depth study of foundations of gravitational lensing one result of this work was a 1992 monograph co authored with schneider and emilio falco it was first systematic exposition of topic that included both theoretical foundations and observational results from viewpoint of astronomy gravitational lensing is often described using a quasi newtonian approximation assuming gravitational field to be small and deflection angles to be minute which is perfectly sufficient for most situations of astrophysical relevance in contrast monograph developed a thorough and complete description of gravitational lensing from a fully relativistic space time perspective this feature of book played a major part in its long term positive reception a review of book itself is long term impact can be judged by way it is held up as a reference in reviews of later books on same topic e g and see also assessment of p 154 in following years ehlers continued his research on propagation of bundles of light in arbitrary cf section 3 5 of frame theory and newtonian gravity a basic derivation of newtonian limit of general relativity is as old as theory itself einstein used it to derive predictions such as anomalous perihelion precession of planet mercury later work by elie cartan kurt friedrichs and others showed more concretely how a geometrical generalization of newton s theory of gravity known as newton cartan theory could be understood as a degenerate limit of general relativity this required letting a specific parameter go to zero ehlers extended this work by developing a frame theory that allowed for constructing newton cartan limit and in a mathematically precise way not only for physical laws but for any spacetime obeying those laws that is solutions of einstein s equations this allowed physicists to explore what newtonian limit meant in specific physical situations for example frame theory can be used to show that newtonian limit of a schwarzschild black hole is a simple point particle also it allows newtonian versions of exact solutions such as friedmann lemaitre models or godel universe to be constructed a description can be found on p in luc s contribution post newtonian gravitational radiation pp 225 271 in since its inception ideas ehlers introduced in context of his frame theory have found important applications in study of both newtonian limit of general relativity and of post newtonian expansion where newtonian gravity is complemented by terms of ever higher order in in order to accommodate relativistic effects general relativity is non linear gravitational influence of two masses is not simply sum of those masses individual gravitational influences as had been case in newtonian gravity ehlers participated in discussion of how back reaction from gravitational radiation onto a radiating system could be systematically described in a non linear theory such as general relativity pointing out that standard quadrupole formula for energy flux for systems like binary pulsar had not yet been rigorously derived a priori a derivation demanded inclusion of higher order terms than was commonly assumed higher than were computed until then a description that includes historical context can be found in original work is his work on newtonian limit particularly in relation to cosmological solutions led ehlers together with his former doctoral student thomas buchert to a systematic study of perturbations and inhomogeneities in a newtonian cosmos this laid groundwork for buchert s later generalization of this treatment of inhomogeneities this generalization was basis of his attempt to explain what is currently seen as cosmic effects of a cosmological constant or in modern parlance dark energy as a non linear consequence of inhomogeneities in general relativistic cosmology see and current status of buchert s further work is summarized in history and philosophy of physics complementing his interest in foundations of general relativity and more generally of physics ehlers researched history of physics up until his death he collaborated in a project on history of quantum theory at max planck institute for history of science in berlin cf details about project can be found on its website in particular he explored pascual jordan s seminal contributions to development of quantum field theory between 1925 and 1928 throughout his career ehlers had an interest in philosophical foundations and implications of physics and contributed to research on this topic by addressing questions such as basic status of scientific knowledge in physics see and as well as its later english translation as well as science popularization ehlers showed a keen interest in reaching a general audience he was a frequent public lecturer at universities as well as at venues such as urania in berlin he authored popular science articles including contributions to general audience journals such as bild der wissenschaft he edited a compilation of articles on gravity for german edition of scientific american public lectures lists 25 popular talks p for that time frame alone compilation of articles is borner ehlers 1996 listed under selected publications an example for a popular article is ehlers directly addressed physics teachers in talks and journal articles on teaching of relativity and related basic ideas such as mathematics as language of physics lists 11
