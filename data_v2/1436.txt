fairey spearfish was a british carrier based single engined torpedo bomber dive bomber that was ordered from fairey aviation for fleet air arm during world war ii designed during war prototype did not fly until july 1945 much larger than earlier naval bombers it was designed for use aboard large s that were cancelled after war and was itself cancelled thereafter seven prototypes were ordered but only five were built of which four actually flew they were mostly used for experimental work until last aircraft was scrapped in 1952 design and development spearfish was designed by fairey aviation to admiralty specification o 5 43 as a replacement for fairey barracuda in torpedo dive bomber role brown p 20 in comparison to barracuda spearfish had a much more powerful engine an internal weapons bay and a retractable asv mk xv surface search radar mounted behind bomb bay spearfish was half as large again as barracuda as it was designed to be operated from malta class aircraft carriers then under development chorlton pp 86 87 in august 1943 company received an order for three prototypes to be built against specification o 5 43 and first prototype serial number was constructed at fairey s hayes factory and first flew on 5 july 1945 from heston aerodrome other two did not fly until 1947 in november 1943 company was ordered to build a dual control dive bombing trainer variant against specification t 21 43 and this was built at heaton chapel factory and assembled and flown at ringway on 20 june 1946 three further development aircraft were ordered in may 1944 to be built at heaton chapel with last two to be fitted with a rolls royce pennine engine only first centarus engined aircraft was built but never flew sturtivant p 301 production orders for 150 aircraft were placed to be built at heaton chapel first ten aircraft were intended to use bristol centaurus radial engine centaurus 59 engines on next 22 and centaurus 60s of remainder buttler p 59 in addition flaps were to be enlarged and lateral control was to be provided by spoilers with small feeler ailerons taylor p 353 with cancellation of malta class carriers fleet air arm no longer had a requirement for new torpedo bombers and programme was cancelled work continued on two other prototypes built at hayes after cancellation of contract albeit very slowly test pilot and naval aviator captain eric brown evaluated first prototype and found controls in cruising flight were very heavy and in fact lateral control was so solid that i could barely move ailerons with one hand at brown p 24 in bad weather a pilot circling a carrier while waiting to land would have been forced to fly such a wide circuit that he could not always keep carrier in sight buttler p 60 later prototypes had ailerons boosted by hydraulic power and artificial feel to stick from a spring as an interim measure but brown found second prototype was much less pleasant aircraft to fly as stick continually hunted either side of neutral and there was no build up of stick force with increase in speed spearfish lacked any sort of stall warning which would have been a problem in operational use as stall and approach speeds were fairly close for landing aircraft proved quite docile brown pp 24 25 first prototype was later used by napier son at luton for trials of firm s inflight de icing systems it was then briefly used for ground training purposes beginning on 30 april 1952 until it was scrapped shortly afterwards second prototype was used by royal navy carrier trials unit at rnas ford sussex until it was sold for scrap on 15 september third prototype conducted asv mk xv radar trials but was damaged in a heavy landing on 1 september 1949 and sold for scrap on 22 august 1950 as uneconomical to repair fourth prototype never flew and was used as a source of spares sole heaton chapel built aircraft was closest to planned production configuration and it was used for engine cooling and power assisted flying control trials until it was struck off charge on 24 july 1951 buttler pp 59 60 in a follow up to meet specification o 21 44 for a two seat strike fighter spearfish was redesigned to accommodate a twin coupled rolls royce merlin engine and contra rotating propellers a variety of other engines were considered and although a production order was placed for three examples in 1944 programme was eventually shelved remaining as an unfulfilled paper project buttler pp 61 62 description spearfish was a cantilever mid wing monoplane with an all metal monocoque fuselage centre wing section was built integral with fuselage and outer wing panels could be hydraulically folded for carrier operations a distinguishing feature of wing was large fairey youngman flaps that spanned 73 5 of wing s trailing edge spearfish had an outward retracting conventional landing gear with a tailwheel wings housed a pair of fuel tanks plus a tank in leading edge of starboard wing for a total of of fuel two man tandem cockpit had a hydraulically operated canopy brown pp 20 21 large internal weapons bay could alternatively carry up to four bombs four depth charges a torpedo or a auxiliary fuel tank spearfish was intended to carry four 0 5 inch 12 7 mm m2 browning machine guns two in a remote controlled fraser nash fn 95 barbette behind cockpit and two in wings only external offensive armament was 16 rp 3
