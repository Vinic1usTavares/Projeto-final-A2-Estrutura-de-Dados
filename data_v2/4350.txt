1922 atlantic hurricane season was first season since 1914 in which no hurricanes made landfall in united states although no hurricane season was defined at time present day delineation of such is june 1 to november 30 first system a tropical depression developed on may 12 while last also a tropical depression dissipated on october 31 of note seven of fourteen cyclones co existed with another tropical cyclone during season including three systems being simultaneously active on september 22 of season s fourteen tropical cyclones five became tropical storms and three strengthened into hurricanes furthermore one of those strengthened into a major hurricane category 3 or higher on modern day saffir simpson hurricane wind scale one of hurricanes was found in reanalysis in 2009 most intense tropical cyclone hurricane two peaked as a category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph 195 km h although a small hurricane in terms of size storm lashed bermuda with strong winds and rough seas while nearly striking island causing one death and about 250 000 1922 usd in damage earlier in season early stages and precursor of tropical storm one caused extensive flooding in el salvador in june leading to at least 100 deaths storm and its remnants later caused flooding along lower rio grande crop damages alone on texas side of river totaled about 2 million although no specific death toll is known several bodies were seen floating down river in october hurricane four caused severe damage and a few fatalities along coast of yucatan peninsula season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 55 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph 63 km h which is tropical storm strength toc systems tropical storm one observations from ships indicated that a tropical depression developed offshore cabo gracias a dios nicaragua on june 12 depression continued northwestward without significantly intensifying heavy rains fell in swan islands of honduras on june 12 and june 13 early on june 14 depression made landfall in quintana roo with winds of 35 mph 55 km h cyclone entered gulf of mexico later that day and began strengthening reaching tropical storm status early on june 15 around 18 00 utc storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph 85 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of system struck near la pesca tamaulipas at same intensity early on june 16 after moving inland storm quickly weakened and dissipated by 18 00 utc in precursor and early stages of storm heavy rains fell in el salvador acelhuate river overflowed flooding four densely populated neighborhoods in capital city of san salvador floodwaters destroyed or damaged homes buildings bridges and other infrastructure while killing hundreds of animals and at least 100 people storm and its remnants brought heavy rainfall to rio grande valley causing flooding in texas river at eagle pass reached above flood stage two bridges washed away while businesses and homes were damaged farther down river swollen crest of rio grande and san juan rivers merged causing significant flooding in cameron and hidalgo counties many towns in both counties suffered severe damage it was estimated that damage to crops alone reached about 2 million on mexico side of river water inundated more than of agricultural lands infrastructure such as roads bridges railroads and buildings were damaged telegraph reports noted that several bodies were seen floating down rio grande at ciudad mier floodwaters stranded nearly 1 000 farmers in both countries aviators acting on behalf of red cross dropped bags of food to those left isolated hurricane two a northeast southwest oriented trough developed into a tropical depression about east southeast of barbados early on september 13 initially moving west northwestward depression intensified into a tropical storm several hours later before curving northwestward next day french s s mont rose was first ship to encounter storm then centered about east of martinique on september 15 storm then strengthened significantly becoming a hurricane around 12 00 utc and then reaching major hurricane intensity by 06 00 utc on september 16 around that time hurricane passed very close to barbuda with island recording sustained winds of cyclone strengthened slightly over next few days with sustained winds peaking at 120 mph 195 km h on september 17 by later that day system curved northward while centered north of mona passage early on september 20 hurricane began moving north northeastward around 12 00 utc on september 21 hurricane passed almost directly over bermuda while still at major hurricane intensity significant damage occurred there as winds peaked at while coast experienced a storm surge reaching in height highest tides observed on island since hurricane of 1899 abnormally high tides flooded numerous homes and streets near harbor including flatts bridge one death occurred at dockyard after a sailor fell overboard from h m s which was anchored there winds severely damaged a number of buildings including bermuda cathedral and an old city hall in hamilton debris littered streets including fallen trees and toppled walls repairs costs to government buildings was estimated at roughly 221 209 with overall damage reaching approximately 250 000 storm began accelerating and weakening later on september 21 by 00 00 utc on september 23 system became extratropical about south of cape race newfoundland remnants slowly weakened while approaching british isles before dissipating over english channel on september 28 several locations in western europe recorded mostly light wind speeds in association with remnants of storm hurricane three a low pressure area developed into a tropical depression about 75 mi 120 km east of florida at 00 00 utc on september 18 it is estimated that depression reached tropical storm intensity about 12 hours later based on ships reporting near tropical storm force winds storm drifted northeast and slowly strengthened becoming a hurricane on september 20 system made have interacted with previous storm which was at category 3 intensity and located near bermuda on september 21 intensifying slightly further hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph 130 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of at 12 00 utc on september 22 with both estimated using observations from a ship and pressure wind relationship however by september 23 cyclone weakened to a tropical storm after briefly accelerating storm curved northward and drifted before being absorbed by an extratropical storm about 165 mi 265 km southeast of massachusetts by 00 00 utc on september 25 this hurricane was not considered a tropical cyclone until reanalysis in 2009 tropical storm force winds were reported in florida north carolina and new jersey hurricane four historical weather maps suggest that a tropical depression developed about north northwest of barranquilla colombia early on october 11 depression moved slowly westward and then northwestward without significant intensification for a few days by october 15 depression had reached tropical storm status late on october 16 cyclone began intensifying at a quicker pace becoming equivalent of a modern day category 2 hurricane on october 17 around 00 00 utc next day it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph 175 km h early on october 18 a ship reported a minimum pressure of 984 mbar 29 06 inhg near center lowest pressure measured during life span of storm hurricane weakened slightly prior to making landfall near playa del carmen quintana roo with winds of 100 mph 155 km h around 12 00 utc on october 18 crossing yucatan peninsula cyclone weakened to a tropical storm by 00 00 utc next day early on october 20 storm emerged into bay of campeche and quickly re strengthened into a hurricane system then drifted slowly south southwestward shortly after 18 00 utc on october 21 hurricane made landfall near paraiso tabasco with winds of 80 mph 130 km h storm rapidly weakened after moving inland and dissipated near cardenas by 06 00 utc next day storm s precursor caused extensive damage to banana plantations in magdalena department of colombia in quintana roo storm caused significant damage to property and crops along entire coast while cozumel and isla mujeres were reportedly left desolate hurricane destroyed nearly every home on latter a few fatalities occurred in yucatan peninsula yucatan governor felipe carrillo puerto estimated that damaged totaled about 60 000 mx several small vessels sank offshore including motor canoe nieves drowning one passenger sloop rosita also capsized with only one crewman surviving about two weeks after storm federal government distributed about 50 tons of corn and 10 tons of beans to destitute residents farther west several fishing vessels sank and some ocean liners including were stranded outside veracruz harbor because violent seas made it too dangerous to enter hurricane caused considerable damage to shipping in southern gulf of mexico tropical storm five a low pressure area previously associated with a frontal boundary developed into a tropical depression just north of honduras on october 12 initially moving northeastward depression intensified into a tropical storm around 12 00 utc on october 13 and then began heading northward around 06 00 utc on october 14 storm made landfall on isla de la juventud cuba with winds of 40 mph 65 km h shortly before striking modern day artemisa province at same intensity after emerging into gulf of mexico storm intensified further peaking with winds of 50 mph 85 km h early on october 15 cyclone then decelerated and weakened falling to tropical depression status by late following day around 09 00 utc on october 17 it made landfall near orange beach alabama with winds of 30 mph 45 km h storm quickly lost tropical characteristics and was absorbed by a frontal boundary several hours later it may have been a subtropical storm due to some hybrid characteristics system left minimal impact in cuba and gulf coast of united states tropical depressions in addition to five cyclones reaching at least tropical storm intensity nine other tropical depressions formed during season a trough moving westward through southwestern caribbean developed into a tropical depression on may 12 depression moved northwestward for a few days and failed to intensify it made landfall in nicaragua on may 15 and dissipated later that day on june 14 a low pressure area developed along tail end of a frontal boundary just offshore northeast florida by following day low acquired tropical characteristics and likely became a tropical depression depression moved generally eastward and dissipated on june 16 a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression just southwest of cape verde islands on august 1 depression moved slowly northward and then north northeastward before dissipating on august 3 about 60 mi 95 km south of sao vicente on august 17 a tropical depression developed in eastern gulf of mexico moving northeastward system struck florida before emerging in atlantic on august 18 storm moved along east coast of united states and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by august 20 its remnants crossed nova scotia later that day and newfoundland on following day a weak circulation developed along axis of a trough situated offshore north carolina in early september with a tropical depression forming on september 3 depression moved southward and likely dissipated by next day an inverted trough and a tropical wave merged and briefly developed into a tropical depression well offshore georgia on september 11 by next day circulation had either dissipated or merged with a cold front a strong tropical wave developed into a tropical depression between cape verde islands and senegal on september 21 moving generally westward depression was last noted between islands of fogo and santiago on september 22 latter island observed sustained winds of on october 2 a tropical depression likely formed over eastern gulf of mexico about south of panama city florida depression continued westward and may have made landfall in texas just north of corpus christi on october 5 however there is no evidence of a closed circulation beyond october 3 a tropical depression possibly subtropical formed on october 28 over central gulf of mexico depression moved northward and made landfall near alabama mississippi state line on october 31 and quickly dissipated pensacola florida recorded a 5 minute wind gust of depression dropped mostly light rainfall in area with 24 hour amounts ranging from see
