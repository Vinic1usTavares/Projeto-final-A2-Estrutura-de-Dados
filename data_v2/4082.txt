european and three american concert tours each song was separately recorded mixed and produced at various studios in uk and north america album was written on tour during periods of a couple of hours in between concerts a studio was booked and recording process begun necessarily resulting in spontaneity and urgency which is reflected in sound several songs resulted from improvisation while touring including during instrumental sections of dazed and confused and were recorded mostly live in studio album used a wide variety of recording studios in uk and us some of these were ill equipped one

engineering kramer later said famous whole lotta love mix where everything is going bananas is a combination of jimmy and myself just flying around on a small console every knob known to man kramer later gave great credit to page for sound that was achieved despite inconsistent conditions in which it was recorded we cut some of tracks in some of most bizarre studios you can imagine but in end it sounded bloody marvellous there was one guy in charge and that was mr page page and kramer spent two days mixing album at a r studios music and lyrics finished tracks reflect evolving sound of band and their live performances plant had his first songwriting credits on led zeppelin ii he had been unable to have his contributions to writing process credited for first album because of a prior contract with cbs records side one whole lotta love was built around a three note page riff lyrics were taken directly from willie dixon s you need love which led to group being sued for plagiarism eventually settling out of court arrangement also resembles small faces track you need loving middle section of track contained a variety of overdubbed instruments and vocals which were mixed live by page and kramer making full use of stereo panning and other controls available on desk song was edited down to a single in us where it became a top 5 hit in uk a single release was cancelled group

woman was purported to be written about a groupie band encountered while touring us group disliked track considering it to be little more than filler and consequently it was never played live by group plant performed track live on his 1990 solo tour ramble on was written by plant lyrics were inspired by j r r tolkien and similar themes appeared on subsequent led zeppelin albums track made good use of dynamics moving from a quiet acoustic guitar in opening to a variety of overdubbed electric guitars towards end it was never performed live by led zeppelin during their main career but plant has

review of record for rolling stone in which he mocked group s heavy sound and white blues while writing that until you ve listened to album eight hundred times as i have it seems as if it s just one especially heavy song extended over space of two whole sides in village voice robert christgau jokingly referred to band as best of wah wah mannerist groups so dirty they drool on demand while complaining that all songs sound alike before assigning album a b grade he nonetheless conceded in 1970 that led zeppelin simply out everyone previous year pitting jimmy page s repeated low register fuzz riffs against untiring freak intensity of robert plant s vocal this trademark has only emerged clearly on second album and more and more i am coming to understand it as an artistic triumph on 10

heavy metal bands that followed it album was described as a brilliant if heavy handed blues rock offensive by popular music scholar ronald zalkind according to robert santelli s big book of blues a biographical encyclopedia 2001 led zeppelin had already begun to move beyond its blues rock influences venturing into previously unexplored hard rock territories blues derived songs like whole lotta love heartbreaker lemon song moby dick and bring it on home have been seen as representing standards of metal genre where guitar based riff rather than vocal chorus or verses defines song and provides key hook such arrangements and emphasis were at time atypical in popular music page s guitar solo in heartbreaker featuring rapid fire runs of notes tapped only by left hand was a major inspiration to
