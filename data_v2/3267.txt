xerochrysum bracteatum commonly known as golden everlasting or strawflower is a flowering plant in family asteraceae native to australia described by etienne pierre ventenat in 1803 it was known as helichrysum bracteatum for many years before being transferred to a new genus xerochrysum in 1990 it grows as a woody or herbaceous perennial or annual shrub up to a metre 3 ft tall with green or grey leafy foliage golden yellow or white flower heads are produced from spring to autumn their distinctive feature is papery bracts that resemble petals species is widespread growing in a variety of habitats across country from rainforest margins to deserts and subalpine areas golden everlasting serves as food for various larvae of lepidopterans butterflies and moths and adult butterflies hoverflies native bees small beetles and grasshoppers visit flower heads golden everlasting has proven very adaptable to cultivation it was propagated and developed in germany in 1850s and annual cultivars in a host of colour forms from white to bronze to purple flowers became available many of these are still sold in mixed seed packs in australia many cultivars are perennial shrubs which have become popular garden plants sturdier long stemmed forms are used commercially in cut flower industry taxonomy french botanist etienne pierre ventenat described golden everlasting as bracteatum in his 1803 work jardin de malmaison retrieved 21 march 2012 a book commissioned by napoleon s first wife josephine de beauharnais to catalogue rare plants that she had collected and grown at chateau de malmaison latin species name bracteatum refers to papery bracts often mistakenly called petals of flower heads henry charles andrews transferred it to genus helichrysum based on morphology of its receptacle in 1805 retrieved 21 march 2012 and it was known as helichrysum bracteatum for many years leo henckel von donnersmarck described it as helichrysum lucidum in 1806 and christiaan hendrik persoon as helichrysum in 1807 it was given name bracteantha bracteata in 1991 retrieved 21 march 2012 when arne anderberg and laurie placed members that are known as of large genus helichrysum into a new genus bracteantha and designated b bracteata as type species however they were unaware that russian botanist nikolai had already placed x bracteatum in new and at time monotypic genus xerochrysum previous year this name was derived from greek words xeros dry and golden likely relating to nature of distinctive bracts confusion existed for a decade with bracteantha appearing in literature and horticultural trade until it was clarified in 2002 that latter name took precedence strawflower is popular name for x bracteatum in europe while in australia it is known as an everlasting or paper daisy an alternate name in 19th century europe was x bracteatum itself is very variable and may represent several cryptic species alternately tasmanian species xerochrysum bicolor may be combined with it in future taxonomic revisions australian daisy study group p 57 x bracteatum and its relatives belong to gnaphalieae or paper daisies a large tribe within daisy family asteraceae however a 2002 molecular study of gnaphalieae has indicated genus xerochrysum is probably polyphyletic as two species sampled x bracteatum and x viscosum were not closely related to each other x bracteatum has been recorded hybridising with x viscosum and x in cultivation and possibly also and c australian daisy study group p 41 description thumb left strawburst yellow bred in california showing yellow bracts and orange central disc plant is an erect perennial or occasionally annual herb that is simple or rarely branched at its base it generally reaches in height but can have a prostrate habit in exposed areas such as coastal cliffs green stems are rough and covered with fine hairs and are robust compared with those of other members of genus leaves are lanceolate elliptic or oblanceolate in shape and measure long and from wide they are also covered with cobwebby hairs sitting atop tall stems above foliage flower heads range from in diameter occasionally multiple heads arise from one stem like flowers of all asteraceae they are composed of a central disc which contains a number of tiny individual flowers known as florets these sit directly on an enlarged part of stem known as receptacle around disc is an of modified leaves bracts which in xerochrysum as in most gnaphalieae are petal like stiff and papery arranged in rows these bracts curl over and enclose florets shielding them before flowering australian daisy study group p 1 they create impression of a shiny and yellow corolla around disc intermediate bracts are sometimes white while outer ones are paler and often streaked reddish or brown a greater variety of colours are found in cultivars these bracts are papery and dry or scarious with a low water content unlike leaves or flower parts of other plants they are made up of dead cells which are unusual in that they have a thin primary and a thick secondary cell wall a feature only found in or structural cells not cells of flowers or leaves individual florets are yellow those on outer regions of disc are female while those in centre are bisexual female flowers lack stamens and have only a very short tube shaped corolla surrounding a pistil that splits to form two stigmas while bisexual or hermaphrodite flowers have a longer corolla and as in virtually all members of family five stamens fused at anthers with pistil emerging from center yellow corolla and pistil are located above an ovary with a single ovule and surrounded by pappus highly modified calyx of asteraceae it comprises a number of bristles radiating around florets australian daisy study group pp 2 3 yellow in colour they persist and are thought to aid in wind dispersal of long fruit australian daisy study group pp 4 57 smooth brown fruit known as a is 2 to 3 mm long with pappus radiating from one end in wild x bracteatum can be distinguished from x bicolor in tasmania by its broader leaves and cobwebby hairs on stems and from x macranthum in western australia by flower head colour latter species has white flower heads whereas those of x bracteatum are golden yellow xerochrysum from alpine and subalpine areas of new south wales victoria and tasmania is rhizomatous and has markedly pointed orange bracts australian daisy study group p 58 eastern australian species x viscosum may be distinguished by its rough and sticky leaves australian daisy study group p 65 distribution and habitat xerochrysum bracteatum occurs in all australian mainland states and territories as well as tasmania retrieved 8 march 2012 widespread it is found from north queensland across to western australia and in all habitats excluding densely shaded areas it grows as an annual in patches of red sand in central australia responding rapidly to bouts of rainfall to complete its lifecycle it is common among granite outcrops in southwest western australia and is found on heavier and more fertile soils in sydney region such as basalt shale or limestone based soils generally in areas with a high water table associated species in sydney basin include eucalyptus in open forest and shrubs minus and australe in swampy areas it has been reported growing in disturbed soil along roadsides and in fields in new england region in united states thumb xerochrysum bracteatum everlasting flower from ooty india ecology brightly coloured bracts act as petals to attract insects such as hoverflies native bees and small beetles that pollinate florets grasshoppers also visit flower heads caterpillars of have been recorded on this species as have those of australian painted lady vanessa tiny fruits are dispersed by wind and germinate and grow after fire or on disturbed ground flower production is related to increasing day length and in general plants produced most flowers from december to march varying planting times or artificially changing light levels might be ways to increase production of flowers outside these months water mould oomycete has infected commercial crops in italy and california in 2002 on ligurian coast widespread infection of several cultivars most severely florabella pink and to a lesser extent florabella gold and florabella white resulted in leaf blistering and development of chlorotic lesions on leaves and white patches on undersides particularly in areas of poor ventilation there was an outbreak of downy mildew in a cultivated crop of xerochrysum bracteatum in san mateo county california in 2006 in which leaves developed large chlorotic lesions a infection damaged x bracteatum crops in czech republic between 1994 and 2001 causing poor growth of foliage and malformation of flower heads genetically pathogen was indistinguishable from agent of aster yellows root knot nematode incognita attacks and forms galls on roots which leads to morbidity or death of plant cultivation thumb right a european colour form x bracteatum had been introduced to cultivation in england by 1791 australian daisy study group p x german horticulturist herren obtained material and developed it at his nursery in arnstadt near erfurt in germany he bred and sold cultivars of many colours from bronze to white to purple which spread across europe in 1850s bracts of these early forms tended to remain cupped around flower head rather than flatten out like native australian forms these were also annual rather than perennial forms many were given cultivar names such as dark scarlet flower heads dark blood red flower heads golden yellow flower heads bicolor red tipped yellow flower heads compositum large multicoloured flower heads macranthum large rose edged white flower heads and flower heads with many bracts although today they are generally sold in mixed seed for growing as annuals some coloured forms of south african helichrysum are thought to have been introduced to breeding program which resulted in huge array of colours x bracteatum was one of several species that became popular with european royalty and nobility from early 19th century yet were little noticed in australia until 1860s when they became more prominent in australian gardens thumb left an orange red flowered cultivar most of cultivars brought into cultivation in australia in latter part of 20th century are perennials stewart p 146 dargan hill monarch was first of these and many more have followed profusely flowering these grow in many colours including white yellow orange bronze pink and red their commercial lifespans are generally around three years australian daisy study group p 60 queensland based company aussie winners has a range of compact plants ranging from orange to white known as sundaze plants of this series usually have larger leaves this range won gran premio d oro at exposition in geneva in 2001 for best new plant series in previous three years florabella gold a member of florabella series won award for best new pot plant vegetative in society of american florists competition of 1999 wallaby cultivars are range of taller forms with narrow leaves and white yellow or pink flowers other commercial ranges include nullarbor series and queensland federation daisies including sunshine and golden nuggets x bracteatum is easy to grow both from seeds and from cuttings although named cultivars only grow true from cuttings plants benefit from pruning of old growth in winter to allow for new growth in spring dead heading or pruning off old flower heads promotes production of more flowers fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 20 days and require no special treatment plants grow best in acid well aerated soils of ph 5 5 to 6 3 with low levels of phosphorus they are sensitive to iron deficiency which presents as yellowing chlorosis of youngest leaves while leaf veins remain green x bracteatum can be grown in large pots or window boxes and is a good pioneer plant in garden until other plants become more established lower growing cultivars are suitable for hanging baskets and border plantings flowers attract butterflies to garden dried flowers are long lasting up to some years and are used in floral arrangements and cut flower industry more robust longer stemmed forms are used for commercial cut flowers main factor limiting lifespan of dried flowers is wilting of stems so flowers are sometimes wired into arrangements immersing flowers in glycerol or polyethylene glycol also lengthens lifespan australian daisy study group pp 30 31 cultivars bright bikini has gained royal horticultural society s award of garden merit thumb dargan hill monarch dargan hill monarch was a natural form collected around inland from cunninghams gap in southern queensland in may 1961 and registered in february 1977 it is a low perennial shrub high and across foliage is grey and large flowers are 7 9 cm in diameter and golden yellow in colour it grows best in full sun and fair drainage cuttings strike readily as does seed although seedlings may differ from parent cockatoo arose as a spontaneous hybrid between dargan hill monarch and a white flowered perennial form of x bracteatum in garden of victorian doug mckenzie in ocean grove near geelong in victoria he applied to australian cultivar registration authority acra for registration which was granted in 1980 it is a dense perennial shrub which reaches around high and wide oblanceolate leaves measure long and are covered with fine hairs that give them a greyish cast fine hairs also cover stems flower heads have light lemon yellow bracts and orange discs and average in diameter they are held on long stems around above foliage like all forms it prefers full sun although a perennial it loses vigour after a few years at which time it is best replaced name cockatoo was chosen as shape and colour of ray florets are reminiscent of wing feathers of sulphur crested cockatoo golden bowerbird is a hybrid bred by a deliberate of cockatoo to dargan hill monarch by doug mckenzie who applied for registration with acra in 1980 it was granted in 1981 it has much larger flower heads than both parents yet is a smaller shrub which reaches high by wide denser than that of other forms foliage is covered in fine grey hair on stalks around above foliage flower heads measure up to in diameter although larger ones up to 10 cm are occasionally seen they have around 300 bracts per flower head compared with 80 for dargan hill monarch and 200 in cockatoo giving them a doubled look it is reported as producing fewer flower heads than princess of wales princess of wales is a spontaneous hybrid arising from a cross between dargan hill monarch and an annual form arising in australian national botanic gardens in canberra it was selected by employee peter ollerenshaw in summer 1983 he applied to register cultivar with acra in march 1985 it was named in honour of a visit by diana princess of wales to gardens in november 1985 same month registration was granted with compact foliage this form reaches high and wide unlike its parent dargan hill monarch its foliage has hair only on midrib on leaf underside it flowers very profusely and large flower heads are borne on stalks above foliage unlike other forms stems wither and die naturally after flowering making way for more new growth and flowers flower heads are golden yellow and measure across diamond head was a natural form collected around diamond head in new south wales where it is quite common on bluffs and cliffs john wrigley curator of australian national botanic gardens at time applied to acra to have it registered which it was in february 1977 found on an exposed headland in nature it grows as a low mat like perennial shrub high and across foliage is green and rough and flowers are 3 cm in diameter and yellow in colour with an orange disc it makes an ideal plant for rockeries and strikes easily from cuttings during spring growing period thumb right colour forms in cultivation strawburst yellow centre kimberley sunset cream bottom left small bronze flowered form sundaze mambo far right hastings gold was a natural form from hastings point to east of on new south wales far north coast it is a perennial herb with green bushy foliage reaching high and wide golden

introduced into cultivation in 1997 that produces abundant red flowers with yellow discs and a diameter of plant grows to tall and wide pink sunrise was developed by nurseries in victoria in 1986 of unknown origin presumably a hybrid it is a compact perennial that reaches high and wide flower heads are pink in bud before opening as cream with orange discs white monarch was a spontaneous garden hybrid that resembles dargan hill monarch but with white flower heads with orange discs measuring up to in diameter stewart p 147 lemon monarch resembles cockatoo but its lemon coloured flower heads have fewer bracts it has bushy foliage strawburst yellow patented as is a form with large bright yellow flower heads averaging around in diameter result of a planned breeding program in gilroy california it was bred by jason of goldsmith seeds from a lemon yellow flowered form crossed with a yellow flowered form in 2005 pollination occurred in may resultant seed was sown in september and what was to become clone was chosen in december for its large flower size colour and compact foliage lemon princess is thought to be a hybrid between x bracteatum and x viscosum australian daisy study
