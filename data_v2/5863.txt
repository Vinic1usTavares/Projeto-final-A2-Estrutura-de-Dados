kidwelly and llanelly canal was a canal and tramroad system in carmarthenshire wales built to carry anthracite coal to coast for onward transportation by coastal ships it began life as kymer s canal in 1766 which linked pits at pwll y llygod to a dock near kidwelly access to dock gradually became more difficult as estuary silted up and an extension to llanelli was authorised in 1812 progress was slow and new canal was linked to a harbour at pembrey built by thomas gaunt in 1820s until company s own harbour at burry port was completed in 1832 tramways served a number of collieries to east of burry port in 1832 engineer james green advised on extending system and suggested a line with three inclined planes to reach cwmmawr further up gwendraeth valley although green had experience with inclined planes on other canals he underestimated cost and could not complete work he was sacked in 1836 but canal company finished new route following year canal was moderately successful and shareholders received dividends from 1858 in 1865 company changed its name to become kidwelly and burry port railway amalgamated with company running burry port in following year and canal became burry port and gwendraeth valley railway in 1869 kymer s dock at kidwelly continued to be used for export of coal by coasters for another 50 years it was used as a rubbish dump during 1950s but together with a short section of canal was restored in 1980s a few of structures of canal can still be traced in landscape and route of now closed railway can be followed for most of its length history area around kidwelly is rich in coal reserves and contains ironstone it was to exploit these reserves that canal and tramway system was built much of coal was good quality anthracite although other grades were also mined kymer s canal thomas kymer began mining at pwll y llygod and great forest near carway in 1760 and sought parliamentary approval to construct a canal at his own expense in early 1766 act of parliament was granted on 19 february 1766 canal was to run from his coal pits at pwll y llygod on banks of gwendraeth fawr river to about half a mile 0 8 km to west of kidwelly where he built a dock on southern bank of gwendraeth fach river act included powers to divert course of gwendraeth fawr from pwll y llygod to pont where kidwelly to llanelli turnpike road crossed river canal was operational by may 1768 as built canal was about long and channel was approximately wide wider sections were constructed at morfa and at to allow barges to pass one another and there was also a wider section below terminal wharf at pwll y llygod to allow barges to be turned from wharf a tramway crossed gwendraeth fawr to connect with coal pits canal served mines well for almost 30 years but dock and river were affected by silting a new channel across sands was created in 1797 but this too was affected by silting and by 1809 navigation to kymer s dock was becoming dangerous kidwelly and llanelly canal a series of meetings took place in 1811 to consider how situation could be improved two engineers edward martin and david davies proposed an extension of canal to top of gwendraeth valley and another which would cross pinged marsh and would terminate at llanelli this would pass through pembrey providing improved access to harbour proposal was adopted and an act of parliament passed on 20 june 1812 created kidwelly and llanelly canal and tramroad company act envisaged an upper terminus beyond cwmmawr at cwm y glo and a series of feeder canals or tramroads to connect to pits and levels where extraction of coal was taking place it listed a total of 13 collieries which would be served in this way wharfs at llanelli terminus would be built next to dock owned by carmarthenshire railroad company special provision including construction of a lock and weir was made for point where new canal would cross existing ashburnham canal newly formed company was required to complete extension from pwll y llygod to pontyates and first section of llanelly branch to point where it crossed ashburnham canal within six years anthony bower was engineer and construction was contracted to pinkerton and allen canal reached new aqueduct across gwendraeth fawr in 1815 but little progress was made between then and 1817 much of limited capital raised had been spent on attempts to re open harbour with little success a second act of parliament was obtained on 28 may 1818 which extended time limit for building canal and removed requirement to clear river channels to harbour pinkerton and allen pressed on with construction completing routes to pontyates and ashburnham canal crossing in 1824 while company directors asked engineers john rennie and edward bankes to examine issue of a suitable harbour rennie suggested extending canal towards what is now burry port and construction of a new harbour on sands at tywyn bach pembrey canal while pinkerton and allen were building southern extension thomas gaunt had been active in area he was extracting iron ore to be processed in new furnaces at pembrey had obtained colliery and had constructed a harbour on sands at pembrey rennie and bankes had dismissed idea of a connection to gaunt s harbour as it was not felt to be adequate for likely volumes of coal traffic but gaunt was keen for a canal link between late 1823 and april 1824 he built two miles 3 2 km of canal including a lock at cross lane cottage at its northern end it joined kidwelly and llanelly canal at ty gwyn just to north of disused ashburnham canal and at its southern end a short tramway linked its terminus to gaunt s harbour cambrian newspaper carried reports of a ceremonial opening on 30 april 1824 and a formal opening on 26 may by 1843 canal had become disused with traffic going to new harbour at pembrey instead pembrey new harbour an act of parliament dated 10 june 1825 created new harbour company with powers to build harbour at tywyn bach on sands near pembrey act included powers to build a short section of canal to link with line of kidwelly and llanelli canal new harbour was completed in 1832 community of burry port did not exist in 1825 and it was not until 1835 that name of company was changed to burry port company by another act of parliament james green s extensions thumb right alt photograph bridge which carried stanley s tramway over canal near pembrey old harbour once construction of a new harbour had begun kidwelly and llanelli canal company constructed a tramway from llanelli to pwll colliery another tramway was built from burry port to coal levels at new lodge with a branch to company planned to link new lodge to pwll in due course so that there would be a tramway link from burry port harbour to llanelli connection was eventually opened on 8 july 1837 in 1832 canal company asked engineer james green to advise on further extensions to system his first report was critical of much of work completed by pinkerton and recommended completing link from ashburnham canal to new pembrey harbour this would require a lock at ty mawr with water supplied by dyvatty brook and a new reservoir to be constructed at cwm capel in dyvatty valley a second report supplied three months later recommended an extension along gwendraeth valley and construction of three inclined planes to reach a terminus just above cwmmawr water supply for upper sections would be from a new reservoir to be built above cwm y glo idea of using inclined planes was an innovation that green had pioneered elsewhere he had been engineer for bude canal which included six planes five powered by water wheels and one by a descending bucket mechanism he was at time engineer for grand western canal which included seven vertical boat lifts and an inclined plane at wellisford again to be powered by a descending bucket mechanism rise on final section of canal to cwmmawr was and three inclined planes would be much quicker and use much less water than alternative of 20 or more locks wooden aqueduct which was prone to river flowing over its top was replaced by an iron one built on a slightly higher level to provide more room for river to flow under it pinkerton s two locks were rebuilt and banks of kymer canal were raised by to allow water level to be raised this had also required kidwelly basin walls to be raised at southern end access to burry port harbour required a deep cutting to be constructed and this was completed by march 1835 above pontyates two more locks were built followed by an inclined plane with a rise of at capel ifan one with a rise of at pont henry and a third with a rise of at hirwaunissa with level sections of canal in between upper terminus consisted of a walled basin reached by another aqueduct over gwendraeth fawr in october 1835 green announced that he was unable to complete inclined planes because of cost overruns company raised more capital to finish work by calling on shareholders and on 30 january 1836 dismissed green as engineer grand western canal company had taken a similar action three days earlier when wellisford inclined plane had failed to work because of a design fault in sizing of descending bucket all construction was completed by 1837 inclines details of inclined planes have been subject of some speculation largely because contemporary documents from time of their construction are unknown a local writer called ap huw stated that inclined planes were manipulated by hydraulic pumps which were considered to be great discoveries he also noted that only two of inclines were used but whether this was because hirwaunissa was unfinished or because there was no traffic on upper section is not clear railway engineer w robinson described balance caissons with hydraulic brakes apparatus to check barges in their descent and to arrange that full ones coming down pull empty ones up w robinson letter in carmarthen journal 25 june 1868 quoted in colliery guardian carried an eye witness report of their operation in which they were described as self acting inclines and it is stated that all three were in operation at time colliery guardian 4 october 1867 quoted in other main sources of information are maps particularly those published at time canal was to be converted into a railway these clearly show twin track inclines at capel ifan and pont henry and because most of traffic was in downhill direction a simple counterbalanced system was probably employed although it has also been suggested that barge may have been balanced by a water tank on second track to more easily control speed of descent hirwaunissa incline was longer and narrower than other two and only included a single track recent research has suggested that incline was powered by a water wheel with waste water running down incline in a side channel in order to supply lower levels of canal subsequent development no further changes were made to canal after extensions were completed and satisfactory levels of traffic were carried fifty two barges were operational in 1835 although their size is unknown canal was dredged in 1858 and shareholders began to receive dividends on their investments that same year most of traffic was anthracite coal which was shipped through burry port some culm was still shipped through kidwelly major users in 1863 consisted of two collieries at pwll y llygod and one at pontyberem success was short lived however as railways started to appear in region faced with threat of carmarthenshire railway building a branch to pontyberem canal company obtained a new act of parliament and became kidwelly and burry port railway company in 1865 following year burry port and valley railway company was formed by amalgamating with burry port harbour company spelling of gwendraeth was wrong in act of parliament new company built a railway from burry port to pontyberem along towpath over pinged marsh and on bed of canal elsewhere this opened in july 1869 an extension to kidwelly harbour followed in june 1873 and one to cwmmawr in june 1886 although main canal was replaced by railway kymer s dock continued to be used for transfer of coal to coastal ships for another 50 years principal destinations included laugharne carmarthen st clears and llanstephan kidwelly corporation took out a lease on dock in 1872 and railway built a branch to it in 1873 which ran alongside old canal most of traffic had transferred to railway by 1914 but some coasters continued to transport coal last recorded sailing was in early 1920s and was bound for llanstephan legacy kymer s dock was used as a refuse tip in 1950s in 1988 a two year scheme funded by manpower services commission excavated and restored both dock and of canal from dock to point where its course is cut by south wales railway gwendraeth fawr aqueduct is still in situ as are parts of hirwaunissa inclined plane and final
