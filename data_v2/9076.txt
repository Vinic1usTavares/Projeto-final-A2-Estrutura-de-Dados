band members made album available for purchase on their website as a digital download on 21 august 2008 minimal promotion was undertaken in uk record was released in compact disc form on 24 october 2008 with wichita recordings as primary label it peaked at number 8 on uk albums chart and entered billboard 200 in united states at number 18 bloc party wanted to create an album that further distanced band from traditional rock set up by incorporating more electronic elements and unconventional musical arrangements as record s title suggests its tracks are about personal relationships and are loosely based on one of frontman kele okereke s break ups in 2007 three songs were released as singles mercury talons and one month off first two tracks entered uk top 40 intimacy was generally well received by critics reviewers often focused on its rush release and central theme and considered them either bold steps or poor choices origins and recording bloc party s second album a weekend in city released in 2007 allowed quartet to evolve sonically by including more electronically tampered soundscapes but band members were not entirely comfortable with more daring musical arrangements when making record according to multi instrumentalist gordon moakes impromptu november 2007 single flux opened a door to fact that we could go in any direction in future works after nme big gig in february 2008 band members took a month off from touring and did not interact with each other during that period moakes felt that there were no rules when band re assembled for studio work chief lyricist okereke completed most of songwriting before recording process in mid 2008 bloc party attended secret sessions at studios in south east of england band aimed to use a similar process to creation of flux which was crafted in a week paul epworth and jacknife lee from bloc party s previous albums silent alarm and a weekend in city respectively returned to production staff for intimacy because band members felt that they had unfinished business with both okereke has stated that having two producers allowed for musical experimentation epworth focused on capturing dynamic of a live band by working on fully developed songs and emphasising rhythm section in mix lee aided band members evolution towards a more electronic style by creating tracks with them each producer worked on five of record s original ten tracks according to okereke bloc party wanted to make something as stylised as r b or electronica combining rawness of silent alarm and recording experience gained from a weekend in city frontman drew inspiration from siouxsie and banshees 1988 song peek a boo and aimed to create rock interpretations of band worked by initially performing soundchecks with only guitar chords keyboard notes and drum beats discussing interplay between rhythm guitarist okereke and lead guitarist russell lissack epworth has stated that kele will do one thing that creates a great deal of impact whereas russell s very good at subtle embellishments and leading melodic side of things outside of vocal band members decided to record first ten tracks crafted after judging first ideas to often be best they thrived under pressure of timed sessions which lasted only two weeks moakes has indicated that there was no worry about whether a song could be recreated live in concert in same way as it would appear on record a brass section and a chamber choir were hired as additional musicians drum machines and distorted guitars were used more extensively than in bloc party s previous works to create a sense of manipulation to basic rock palette drummer matt tong was initially sceptical of moulding songs with programmed drums as opposed to using his physical output but agreed to idea when band recorded some of tracks in their entirety on some songs guitars were disregarded and band focused solely on beat okereke s voice was often used as an instrument by being looped vocoded or run through effects pedals promotion and release after studio sessions bloc party embarked on a tour of north american and european summer festivals one of recorded tracks mercury was released as a single on 11 august 2008 and peaked at number 16 on uk singles chart at time band confirmed existence of further material but noted that a record release date was scheduled for end of 2008 at earliest bloc party unexpectedly announced completion of intimacy on 18 august 2008 via a webcast and confirmed a release within 60 hours band members wanted to revive importance of a new album s release in an era in which excitement has dissipated because of extensive internet coverage they were inspired by radiohead s marketing of in rainbows in 2007 but did not consider a free sale option little press was undertaken in uk to promote record because of okereke s reluctance to discuss personal aspects of his life thumb right alt two guitarists a drummer and a bassist are performing on a smoky stage

website on 21 august 2008 ten mp3 tracks were sold with a plain black jpeg cover for ps5 and a ps10 option for online songs and future expanded cd was also available album title was picked as a double bluff with regard to people s expectations okereke has explained you d think of wet you don t think it s gonna be ugly or harsh but that s what relationships are really like it s not just about good times release was called rushed by publications such as billboard and independent tong disagreed with label and stated that bloc party wanted to make a statement that was surprising to anyone interested in their work band showcased tracks from intimacy at reading festival at end of august 2008 and embarked on a north american tour during september uk appearances on mtv2 gonzo tour and release of second single talons preceded physical release of album in october which entered uk albums chart at number eight in u s record sold 24 000 copies during first week of release and debuted at number 18 on billboard 200 by august 2012 it had sold 85 000 copies in united states comprehensive sales figures have not been published because digital download data has not been publicly reported by bloc party chosen cover art is a stylised shot of a couple kissing taken by freelance photographer perry curties it was ranked at number 23 on gigwise s list of best album covers of 2008 in which publication called it intimate and rather ambiguous content lyrics lyrics of intimacy were inspired by a relationship break up okereke went through at end of 2007 lyricist told rolling stone i wouldn t want anyone to think it s cliched break up record but i haven t written about true personal experiences all that much in past move to more intimate subject matter was semi conscious because band members did not want to focus on socio political issues as they had in their previous works three tracks allude to greek mythology ares draws its name from god of war trojan horse is named after trojan war military ruse and zephyrus draws its name from god of west wind narrative in songs occurs between two people and focuses on relations between lovers friends and enemies okereke indicated that it s about moments of shared vulnerability better than heaven references garden of eden and corinthians 15 22 because lyricist wanted to explore themes of sex and death especially in a biblical context biko means please or more accurately i implore you in igbo a language spoken in nigeria homeland of okereke s parents and is used when you re beseeching someone to do something okereke denied that it is about murdered south african anti apartheid protester steve biko lyrics of one month off reference feelings of anger and are about being in love with someone younger and unfaithful while zephyrus concerns an apology following neglect lyrics in chorus of ion square last track on original download release are based on e e cummings poem i carry your heart with me okereke considers song a personal favourite because it evokes initial exciting stages of a new relationship when everything is going right composition okereke has discussed a natural progression in bloc party s compositional style to a more explorative electronic direction for opening track on intimacy ares okereke was inspired to rap his lyrics after listening to old school hip hop of afrika bambaataa according to heather phares of allmusic song includes siren like guitar chords and loud complex drumming in vein of dance acts prodigy and chemical brothers mercury continues complex drumming theme by incorporating layered percussion and contains a vocally manipulated chorus track is an attempt at drum and bass and features brass dissonance effects okereke has called harsh glacial layered and energetic zephyrus begins with a solitary vocal line accompanied only by a drum machine pattern while exmoor singers provide background vocals in rest of composition signs is only song that does not include guitars instead it is made up of a synthesiser pulse and multitracked samples of glockenspiel and mbira resembling work of minimalist composer steve reich okereke has conceded that intimacy covers bloc party s typical indie rock elements but noted that guitars have an artificial and manipulated sound almost like all humanity has been bleached out halo has a fast tempo coupled with a guitar melody that uses only four chords while trojan horse features syncopated guitars and distortion commercial sheet music for intimacy wichita recordings music publishing october 2008 distributed by international music publications talons also incorporates distortion from both lead and rhythm guitars while final single one month off consists of tribal rhythms and sixteenth note guitar riffs biko has a slower tempo and includes guitar arpeggi throughout while ion square incorporates guitar overdubbing and use of hi hat patterns throughout according to nick southall of drowned in sound better than heaven encapsulates what bloc party had been trying to achieve in their previous works namely aligning all their different directional desires to swoon to rock and to experiment all at once track features broken beats and layered vocals critical reception media response to intimacy was generally favourable aggregating website metacritic reports a normalised rating of 69 based on 27 critical reviews steven robertshaw of alternative press described album as arguably bloc party s finest career moment and noted that it offers sweat and circuitry savagery and submission and a captivating energy that s severely lacking in many music scenes on planet kyle anderson of rolling stone claimed that by replacing bloc party s distant cool with vivid honesty okereke makes intimacy a confident new peak for his band while popmatters ross explained that record might not actually be all that intimate but it is a thing of rough recycled beauty adam mazmanian of washington times commented that album s final mix showed that producers epworth and lee preserved essence of bloc party s signature sound minor key rock with rhythmic intensity while taking band in new musical directions dave simpson of guardian concluded that it would please old and new fans alike by being brave individual and heartfelt pitchfork s ian cohen was less receptive and asserted that record seems like a document of a band disconnected from its musical strengths josh modell of spin felt that intimacy sometimes gets sonically or lyrically precarious while john robinson of uncut commented that there s an air of slightly hedged bets drowned in sound s nick southall claimed that record is not quite radical statement bloc party set out to achieve but concluded that it is definitely a little bit of invigorating redemption at a time when doubts were beginning to cloud what was initially a flawless reputation in its year end music review for 2008 under radar stated about band members they are so solid and so confident that it seems inevitable that they will get many chances to slowly drift into more daring lands but without more risk they may be destined to make albums like intimacy accomplished and intriguing but not life changing not classic record figured in several publications end of year best album lists for 2008 notably at number 14 by gigwise at number 36 by
