thirteenth amendment amendment xiii to united states constitution abolished slavery and involuntary servitude except as punishment for a crime in congress it was passed by senate on april 8 1864 and by house on january 31 1865 amendment was ratified by required number of states on december 6 1865 on december 18 1865 secretary of state william h seward proclaimed its adoption it was first of three reconstruction amendments adopted following american civil war since american revolution states had divided into states that allowed or states that prohibited slavery slavery was implicitly permitted in original constitution through provisions such as article i section 2 clause 3 commonly known as three fifths compromise which detailed how each slave state s enslaved population would be factored into its total population count for purposes of apportioning seats in united states house of representatives and direct taxes among states though many slaves had been declared free by president abraham lincoln s 1863 emancipation proclamation their post war status was uncertain on april 8 1864 senate passed an amendment to abolish slavery after one unsuccessful vote and extensive legislative maneuvering by lincoln administration house followed suit on january 31 1865 measure was swiftly ratified by nearly all northern states along with a sufficient number of border states up to death of lincoln but approval came with president andrew johnson who encouraged reconstructed southern states of alabama north carolina and georgia to agree which brought count to 27 states and caused it to be adopted before end of 1865 though amendment formally abolished slavery throughout united states factors such as black codes white supremacist violence and selective enforcement of statutes continued to subject some black americans to involuntary labor particularly in south in contrast to other reconstruction amendments thirteenth amendment was rarely cited in later case law but has been used to strike down peonage and some race based discrimination as badges and incidents of slavery thirteenth amendment applies to actions of private citizens while fourteenth and fifteenth amendments apply only to state actors thirteenth amendment also enables congress to pass laws against sex trafficking and other modern forms of slavery text slavery in united states thumb abolitionist imagery focused on atrocities against slaves 1863 photo of gordon slavery existed in all of original thirteen british north american colonies prior to thirteenth amendment united states constitution did not expressly use words slave or slavery but included several provisions about unfree persons three fifths compromise article i section 2 clause 3 of constitution allocated congressional representation based on whole number of free persons and three fifths of all other persons this clause was a compromise between southerners who wished slaves to be counted as persons for congressional representation and northerners rejecting these out of concern of too much power for south because representation in new congress would be based on population in contrast to one vote for one state principle in earlier continental congress under fugitive slave clause article iv section 2 clause 3 no person held to service or labour in one state would be freed by escaping to another article i section 9 clause 1 allowed congress to pass legislation outlawing importation of persons but not until 1808 however for purposes of fifth amendment which states that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law slaves were understood as property although abolitionists used fifth amendment to argue against slavery it became part of legal basis in dred scott v sandford 1857

for immediate or gradual abolition of slavery most of slaves involved were household servants no southern state did so and slave population of south continued to grow peaking at almost 4 million

south american colonization society an alliance between abolitionists who felt races should be kept separated and slaveholders who feared presence of freed blacks would encourage slave rebellions

as it was by landless peasants world over give us our land and we can take care of ourselves said a group of south carolina negroes to a northern journalist in 1865 without land old masters can hire

that his party should stop defending institution senator reverdy johnson vorenberg final freedom 2001 p 74 antislavery amendment caught johnson s eye however because it offered an indisputable constitutional solution to problem of slavery and powerful new york political machine known as tammany hall vorenberg final freedom 2001 p 203 thumb celebration erupts after amendment is passed by house of representatives president lincoln had had concerns that emancipation proclamation of 1863 might be reversed or found invalid by judiciary after war he saw constitutional amendment as a more permanent solution foner 2010 pp 312 1996 p 396 he had remained outwardly neutral on amendment because he considered it politically too dangerous vorenberg final freedom 2001 p 48 president worried that an abolition amendment might foul political waters amendments he had recommended in december 1862 had gone nowhere mainly because they reflected an outdated program of gradual emancipation which included compensation and colonization moreover lincoln knew that he did not have to propose amendments because others more devoted to abolition would especially if he pointed out vulnerability of existing emancipation legislation he was also concerned about negative reactions from conservatives particularly potential new recruits from democrats nonetheless lincoln s 1864 party platform resolved to abolish slavery by constitutional amendment after winning reelection in election of 1864 lincoln made passage of thirteenth amendment his top legislative priority beginning with his efforts in congress during its lame duck session goodwin 2005 pp 686 final freedom 2001 p 176 177 180 popular support for amendment mounted and lincoln urged congress on in his december 6 1864 state of union address there is only a question of time as to when proposed amendment will go to states for their action and as it is to so go at all events may we not agree that sooner better vorenberg final freedom 2001 p 178 lincoln instructed secretary of state william h seward representative john b alley and others to procure votes by any means necessary and they promised government posts and

elections for senate and house vorenberg final freedom 2001 p 187 but clearest sign of people s voice against slavery argued amendment supporters was recent election following lincoln s lead republican representatives like s orth of indiana claimed that vote represented a popular verdict in unmistakable language in favor of amendment 1864 democratic vice presidential nominee representative george h pendleton led opposition to measure goodwin 2005 p 688 republicans toned down their language of radical equality in order to broaden amendment s coalition of supporters vorenberg final freedom 2001 p 191 necessity of keeping support for amendment broad enough to secure its passage created a strange situation at moment that republicans were promoting new far reaching legislation for african americans they had to keep this legislation detached from first constitutional amendment dealing exclusively with african american freedom republicans thus gave freedom under antislavery amendment a vague construction freedom was something more than absence of chattel slavery but less than absolute equality in order to reassure critics worried that amendment would tear apart social fabric some republicans explicitly promised that amendment would leave patriarchy intact vorenberg final freedom 2001 pp 191 192 one of most effective methods used by amendment supporters to convey measure s conservative character was to proclaim permanence of patriarchal power within american family in face of this or any textual change to constitution in response to democrats who charged that antislavery was but first step in a republican design to dissolve all of society s foundations including hierarchical structure of family iowa republican john a kasson denied any desire to interfere with rights of a husband to a wife or right of a father to his child in mid january 1865 speaker of house schuyler colfax estimated amendment to be five votes short of passage ashley postponed vote vorenberg final freedom 2001 pp 197 198 at this point lincoln intensified his push for amendment making direct emotional appeals to particular members of congress vorenberg final

brother died to save republic from death by slaveholders rebellion i wish you could see it to be your duty to vote for constitutional amendment ending slavery on january 31 1865 house called another

signature was not essential to an act of this kind and on fourth of february senator trumbull offered a resolution which was agreed to three days later that approval was not required by constitution

wore on administration officials began including assurances of measure s limited scope with their demands for ratification johnson himself suggested directly to governors of mississippi and north carolina that they could proactively control allocation of rights to freedmen though johnson obviously expected freed people to enjoy at least some civil rights including as he specified right to testify in court he wanted state lawmakers to know that power to confer such rights would remain with states vorenberg 2001 final freedom p 229 when south carolina provisional governor benjamin franklin perry objected to scope of amendment s enforcement clause secretary of state seward responded by telegraph that in fact second clause is really restraining in its effect instead of enlarging

three fifths compromise was a provision in constitution that required three fifths of population of slaves be counted for purposes of apportionment of seats in house of representatives and taxes among

black workers in south these workers remained destitute and persecuted forced to work dangerous jobs and further confined legally by racist jim crow laws that governed south peonage differed from

swell of attention during this period but from brown v board of education 1954 until jones v alfred h mayer co 1968 it was again eclipsed by fourteenth amendment goluboff lost origins of civil rights pp 1680 1683 penal labor exemption thirteenth amendment exempts penal labor from its prohibition of forced labor this allows prisoners who have been convicted of crimes not those merely awaiting trial to be required to perform labor or else face punishment while in custody few records of committee s deliberations during drafting of thirteenth amendment survived and debate in both congress and state legislatures that followed featured almost no discussion of this provision it was apparently considered noncontroversial at time or at least legislators gave it little thought drafters based amendment s phrasing on northwest ordinance of 1787 which features an identical exception thomas jefferson authored an early version of that ordinance s anti slavery clause including exception of punishment for a crime and also sought to prohibit slavery in general after 1800 jefferson was an admirer of works of italian criminologist cesare beccaria beccaria s on crimes and punishments suggested that death penalty should be abolished and replaced with a lifetime of enslavement for worst criminals jefferson likely included clause due to his agreement with beccaria beccaria while attempting to reduce legal barbarism of 1700s considered forced labor one of few harsh punishments acceptable for example he advocated slave labor as a just punishment for robbery so that thief s labor could be used to pay recompense to their victims and to society penal hard labor has ancient origins and was adopted early in american history as in europe often as a substitute for capital or corporal punishment various commentators have accused states of abusing this provision to re establish systems similar to slavery or of otherwise exploiting such labor in a manner unfair to local labor black codes in south criminalized vagrancy which was largely enforced against freed slaves later convict lease programs in south allowed local plantations to rent inexpensive prisoner labor while many of these programs have been phased out leasing of convicts was forbidden by president franklin roosevelt in 1941 prison labor continues in u s under a variety of justifications prison labor programs vary widely some are uncompensated prison maintenance tasks some are for local government maintenance tasks some are for local businesses and others are closer to internships modern rationales for prison labor programs often include reduction of recidivism and re acclimation to society idea is that such labor programs will make it easier for prisoner upon release to find gainful employment rather than relapse to criminality however this topic is not well studied and much of work offered is so menial as to be unlikely to improve employment prospects as of 2017 most prison labor programs do compensate prisoners but generally with very low wages what wages they do earn are often heavily garnished with as much as 80 of a prisoner s paycheck withheld in harshest cases in 2018 entertainer kanye west advocated for repealing thirteenth amendment s exception for penal labor in a meeting with president donald trump calling exception a trap door judicial interpretation in contrast to other reconstruction amendments thirteenth amendment was rarely cited in later case law as historian amy dru stanley summarizes beyond a handful of landmark rulings striking down debt peonage flagrant involuntary servitude and some instances of race based violence and discrimination thirteenth amendment has never been a potent source of rights claims black slaves and their descendants united states v rhodes 1866 one of first thirteenth amendment cases tested constitutionality of provisions in civil rights act of 1866 that granted blacks redress in federal courts kentucky law prohibited blacks from testifying against whites an arrangement which compromised ability of nancy talbot a citizen of united states of african race to reach justice against a white person accused of robbing her after talbot attempted to try case in federal court kentucky supreme court ruled this federal option unconstitutional noah swayne a supreme court justice sitting on kentucky circuit court overturned

fosters two young daughters kentucky courts would not allow foster children to testify against blyew and kennard federal courts authorized by civil rights act found blyew and kennard guilty of murder supreme court ruled that foster children did not have standing in federal courts because only living people could take advantage of act in doing so courts effectively ruled that thirteenth amendment did not permit a federal remedy in murder cases swayne and joseph p bradley dissented maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects thirteenth amendment would have to address systemic racial

university of california berkeley hall school of law held on may 7 2007 ref as u s supreme court explicated in slaughter house cases with respect to fourteenth and fifteenth amendment and thirteenth amendment in special undoubtedly while negro slavery alone was in mind of congress which proposed thirteenth article it forbids any other kind of slavery now or hereafter if mexican peonage or chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of mexican or chinese race within our territory this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void and so if other rights are assailed by states which properly and necessarily fall within protection of these articles that protection will apply though party interested may not be of african descent but what we do say and what we wish to be understood is that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments it is necessary to look to purpose which we have said was pervading spirit of them all evil which they were designed to remedy and process of continued addition to constitution until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished as far as constitutional law can accomplish it slaughter house cases 83 u s 36 wall at 72 1873 in civil rights cases 1883 supreme court reviewed five consolidated cases dealing with civil rights act of 1875 which outlawed racial discrimination at inns public conveyances on land or water theaters and other places of public amusement court ruled that thirteenth amendment did not ban most forms of racial discrimination by non government actors in majority decision bradley wrote again in non binding dicta that thirteenth amendment empowered congress to attack badges and incidents of slavery however he distinguished between fundamental rights of citizenship protected by thirteenth amendment and social rights of men and races in community tsesis thirteenth amendment and american freedom 2004 p 70 majority opinion held that it would be running slavery argument into ground to make it apply to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit to make as to guests he will entertain or as to people he will take into his coach or cab or car or admit to his concert or theatre or deal with in other matters of intercourse or business in his solitary dissent john marshall harlan a kentucky lawyer who changed his mind about civil rights law after witnessing organized racist violence argued that such discrimination practiced by corporations and individuals in exercise of their public or quasi public functions is a badge of servitude imposition of which congress may prevent under its power tsesis thirteenth amendment and american freedom 2004 p 73 court in civil rights cases also held that appropriate legislation under amendment could go beyond nullifying state laws establishing or upholding slavery because amendment has a reflex character also establishing and decreeing universal civil and political freedom throughout united states and thus congress was empowered to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in united states court stated about scope amendment this amendment as well as fourteenth is undoubtedly self executing without any ancillary legislation so far as its terms are applicable to any existing state of circumstances by its own unaided force and effect it abolished slavery and established universal freedom still legislation may be necessary and proper to meet all various cases and circumstances to be affected by it and to prescribe proper modes of redress for its violation in letter or spirit and such legislation may be primary and direct in its character for amendment is not a mere prohibition of state laws establishing or upholding slavery but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of united states attorneys in plessy v ferguson 1896 argued that racial segregation involved observances of a servile character coincident with incidents of slavery in violation of thirteenth amendment in their brief to supreme court plessy s lawyers wrote that distinction of race and caste was inherently unconstitutional tsesis thirteenth amendment and american freedom 2004 p 76 supreme court rejected this reasoning and upheld state laws enforcing segregation under separate but equal doctrine in 7 1 majority decision court found that a statute which implies merely a legal distinction between white and colored races a distinction which is founded on color of two races and which must always exist so long as white men are distinguished from other race by color has no tendency to destroy legal equality of two races or reestablish a state of involuntary servitude harlan dissented writing thin disguise of equal accommodations for passengers in railroad coaches will not mislead any one nor atone for wrong this day done tsesis thirteenth amendment and american freedom 2004 p 78 in hodges v united states 1906 203 u s 1 1906 court struck down a federal statute providing for punishment of two or more people who conspire to injure oppress threaten or intimidate any citizen in free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by constitution or laws of united states a group of white men in arkansas conspired to violently prevent eight black workers from performing their jobs at a lumber mill group was convicted by a federal grand jury supreme court ruled that federal statute which outlawed conspiracies to deprive citizens of their liberty was not authorized by thirteenth amendment it held that no mere personal assault or trespass or appropriation operates to reduce individual to a condition of slavery harlan dissented maintaining his opinion that thirteenth amendment should protect freedom beyond physical restraint tsesis thirteenth amendment and american freedom 2004 p 79 80 corrigan v buckley 1922 reaffirmed interpretation from hodges finding that amendment does not apply to restrictive covenants enforcement of federal civil rights law in south created numerous peonage cases which slowly traveled up through judiciary supreme court ruled in v united states 1905 that peonage was involuntary servitude it held that although employers sometimes described their workers entry into contract as voluntary servitude of peonage was always by definition involuntary wolff thirteenth amendment and slavery in global economy 2002 p 983 in bailey v alabama u s supreme court again reaffirmed its holding that thirteenth amendment was not solely a ban on chattel slavery but also covers a much broader array of labor arrangements and social deprivations in addition to aforesaid court also ruled on congress enforcement power under thirteenth amendment court said plain intention of amendment was to abolish slavery of whatever name and form and all its badges and incidents to render impossible any state of bondage to make labor free by prohibiting that control by which personal service of one man is disposed of or coerced for another s benefit which is essence of involuntary servitude while amendment was self executing so far as its terms were applicable to any existing condition congress was authorized to secure its complete enforcement by appropriate legislation bailey v alabama 219 u s 219 241 1910 jones and beyond legal histories cite jones v alfred h mayer co 1968 as a turning point of thirteen amendment jurisprudence colbert liberating thirteenth amendment 1995 p 2 supreme court confirmed in jones that congress may act rationally to prevent private actors from imposing badges and incidents of servitude tsesis thirteenth amendment and american freedom 2004 p 3 after reconstruction however a series of supreme court decisions substantially diminished amendment s significance in achieving genuine liberation court did not revisit amendment s meaning until 1968 during heyday of civil rights movement in jones v alfred h mayer court found that thirteenth amendment not only ended forced labor but that its second section also empowered congress to develop legislation that is rationally related to ending any remaining badges and incidents of servitude joneses were a black couple in st louis county missouri who sued a real estate company for refusing to sell them a house court held blockquote congress has power under thirteenth amendment rationally to determine what are badges and incidents of slavery and authority to translate that determination into effective legislation this court recognized long ago that whatever else they may have encompassed badges and incidents of slavery its burdens and disabilities included restraints upon those fundamental rights which are essence of civil freedom namely same right to inherit purchase lease sell and convey property as is enjoyed by white citizens civil rights cases 109 u s 3 109 u s 22 ref jones v alfred h mayer co 392 u s 409 1968 ref blockquote just as black codes enacted after civil war to restrict free exercise of those rights were substitutes for slave system so exclusion of negroes from white communities became a substitute for black codes and when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on color of their skin then it too is a relic of slavery negro citizens north and south who saw in thirteenth amendment a promise of freedom freedom to go and come at pleasure and to buy and sell when they please would be left with a mere paper guarantee if congress were powerless to assure that a dollar in hands of a negro will purchase same thing as a dollar in hands of a white man at very least freedom that congress is empowered to secure under thirteenth amendment includes freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy right to live wherever a white man can live if congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much then thirteenth amendment made a promise nation cannot keep alison shay remembering jones v alfred h mayer co publishing long civil rights movement 17 june 2012 court in jones reopened issue of linking racism in contemporary society to history of slavery in united states colbert liberating thirteenth amendment 1995 pp 3 4 jones precedent has been used to justify congressional action to protect migrant workers and target sex trafficking tsesis thirteenth amendment and american freedom 2004 p 3 court s holding in jones enables congress to pass statutes against present day human rights violations such as trafficking of foreign workers as sex slaves and exploitation of migrant agricultural workers as peons direct enforcement power found in thirteenth amendment contrasts with that of fourteenth which allows only responses to institutional discrimination of state actors tsesis thirteenth amendment and american freedom 2004 pp 112 113 thirteenth amendment remains principal constitutional source requiring federal government to protect individual liberties against arbitrary private and public infringements that resemble incidents of involuntary servitude moreover thirteenth amendment is a positive injunction requiring congress to pass laws to that end while fourteenth amendment is responsive to unconstitutional behavior other cases of involuntary servitude supreme court has taken an especially narrow view of involuntary servitude claims made by people not descended from black african slaves in robertson v baldwin 1897 a group of merchant seamen challenged federal statutes which criminalized a seaman s failure to complete their contractual term of service court ruled that seamen s contracts had been considered unique from time immemorial and that amendment was not intended to introduce any novel doctrine with respect to certain descriptions of service which have always been treated as exceptional in this case as in numerous badges and incidents cases justice harlan authored a dissent favoring broader thirteenth amendment protections wolff thirteenth amendment and slavery in global economy 2002 p 977 in selective draft law cases supreme court ruled that military draft was not involuntary servitude

servitude gpo access u s government printing office p goluboff 2001 13th amendment and lost origins of civil rights duke law journal vol 50 no 228 p 1609 kozminski defined involuntary servitude for purposes of criminal prosecution as a condition of servitude in which victim is forced to work for defendant by use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury or by use or threat of coercion through law or legal process this definition encompasses cases in which defendant holds victim in servitude by placing him or her in fear of such physical restraint or injury or legal coercion u s courts of appeals in v rye neck school district herndon v chapel hill and v bethlehem school district have ruled that use of community service as a high school graduation requirement did not violate thirteenth amendment prior proposed thirteenth amendments during six decades following 1804 ratification of twelfth amendment two proposals to amend constitution were adopted by congress and sent to
