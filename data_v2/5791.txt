script particularly adjusting parts where dark humor went a little bit too far in original script story was intended to take place at scripps national spelling bee in washington d c setting was changed to fictional golden quill spelling bee in los angeles since bateman did not expect to receive permission from scripps to use their name in film pre production bateman did not initially intend to star in film but after approaching two other actors who turned down role of guy he decided to play main character himself he felt that it would be easier to play role himself than to direct another actor to strike tricky tone required and to ensure that character remained likeable despite his bad qualities allison janney and kathryn hahn were already friends of bateman s before making bad words
