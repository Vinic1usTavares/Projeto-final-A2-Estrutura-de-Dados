beyonce commenting that i care is one of many ballads which take on matters of heart in february 2013 bhasker revealed that song was initially written for his first studio album born on fourth of july released in july 2013 he described sound of his version of i care as a little more pure version production thumb left 165px chad hugo pictured played rhythm guitar and co wrote song with jeff bhasker and beyonce jordan young aka dj swivel mixed i care at new york s kma studio he told sound on sound i didn t really know i was going to mix i care until last minute luckily during course of album i had a couple of days to myself and i mixed it just because i felt like it so demo was already somewhat mixed and b eyonce let me do final mix also i care comprised 75 tracks in total 35 for music and 40 for vocals according to swivel main challenge in mixing i care was hand aligning every single drum shot as it was time consuming he said it s super monotonous but it s best way i can do it if you beat detective drums to grid it s never perfect as layering of drums had to be right on millisecond swivel did one kick and snare at a time this helped him ensure that kicks line up with programmed drums hence preventing any phase inversion accordingly each drum punched through as strongly as last inspiration for main drum sound on i care came to swivel at around four o clock in morning during a mixing session he took a large plate sound from avid s d verb plug in rolled high frequencies off at 8 6 khz and sent it through an ssl channel strip with a gate on it setting release time to 0 6 seconds he said it s a really basic plug in and i used a very 19 80s sounding gated reverb once he had sound he rolled off bottom to take out it was actually double reverbed gated reverb was only on snares and toms and rest of kit as a whole had another plate reverb which came off lexicon 960 for smoothing it out swivel said that it actually took him five minutes according to him sound obtained was a little unorthodox and therefore he tried to refine it beyonce thought that it was better way swivel did it originally swivel commented and in all honesty whatever works first is usually going to work best you end up finding something you like about it and that s where emotional attachment to a sound comes into play swivel often replaces or augments sounds with samples trying to realise producer s vision similarly in i care he added a couple of kicks underneath original kick and pitched them down an octave so that listener could not hear them but could feel them on big speakers swivel further said that it started with a dark almost warehouse sounding kick and he then added a little thump to it swivel dedicated much time in getting vocal sound right which according to him is crucial while working with beyonce s music he further explained i only put a quick eq on vocal at end of a recording session if i have been cutting her but mixing is far more particular so i spent a lot of time dialling in perfect frequency for delay throws in verses on i care he sent it through a large hall reverb at 50 percent half reverb half clean then through an amp farm plug in for grittiness and that then went through a quarter note delay in bridge e matches guitar solo vocally that was doubled and one of vocal tracks has an amp farm on it to add to that grittiness to do justice to multitude of vocal tracks within song swivel created a stereo field using some clever panning techniques and a waves s1 imager plug in he said that it was worth noting that whenever he mixes a record i hate hard panned l r to get right width i pan them all differently in pairs 40 40 60 60 70 70 80 80 90 90 and ok maybe one is 100 100 but this process is ultimately what creates stereo field swivel used waves ssl e channel plug in to shape beyonce s lead vocal he took a waves s1 imager and spread with that without isolating he width he added that something is hard panned it feels too isolated and also confuses listener s ears swivel explained further i like smooth sound and with b eyonce that works fine as she s so good at matching everything i like a wall of background vocals it s best way of putting your vocal in every area of stereo field a wide sound but you ve still got something there in middle composition and lyrical interpretation i care is an r b power ballad according to cameron adams of herald sun song contains elements of futuristic soul music and rock music it is built on a hand clapped rhythm various melodies pulsating as well as beats and a lone synth note underneath i care is instrumentally complete with screeching guitars synthesizers a thrashing drum machine dense percussion instrument and a piano holly gleason of paste magazine commented that i care aurally resembles peter gabriel s solsbury hill 1977 joey guerra of houston chronicle and matthew horton of bbc felt that emotion and chords present in i care are reminiscent of prince s purple rain 1984 horton added that it near equals 1 1 and i miss you tug heartstrings too jim farber of daily news wrote that beyonce s vocals over guitar solo on i care could have spun off a song by journey new york times jon caramanica compared song with janet jackson s earlier materials melinda newman of website hitfix compared echo chamber beats with phil collins work and also noted that it was similar with leona lewis material throughout song beyonce airs out her feelings to an indifferent partner and delivers indignation and beauty in equal measure as stated by greg kot of chicago tribune this view was echoed by erika ramirez of billboard magazine who wrote that beyonce endorses beauty in honesty and ironically power in admitting her vulnerability and lewis corner of digital spy who noted that raspy and husky growls that she adopts occasionally show offering moments of raw heartfelt emotion gleason wrote that song writhes through ache and obsession that come from being one left in love newman noted that in i care beyonce was spurred and left for dead by her lover but despite her best efforts she still cares about him she sings over cooing background vocals and her voice moves from silken to powerful torn to potent over ominous keys a keyboard opening and a repeating drum loop in first verse beyonce sings about how her relationship turned sour and puts all her cards on table i told you how you hurt me baby but you don t care now i m crying and deserted baby but you don t care ain t nobody tell me this is love you re immune to all my pain i need you to tell me this love you don t care well that s ok while singing first and second verses she pulls out power in her lower register each time her voice slowly builds until commanding chorus is reached where towards end she sings la la la in a muted saxophone line her voice expresses anger as she sings chorus lines in second verse beyonce continues wild eyed pleas as stated by guerra and sings lines even since you knew your power you made me cry and now every time our love goes sour you won t sympathize her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at second chorus leading up to bridge after bridge beyonce this time scats chorus alongside a multi octave guitar solo critical reception i care was highly acclaimed by critics joanne dorken of mtv uk wrote that i care proves why beyonce is still best in business further adding that her vocals are flawless as she belts out notes we didn t even realise were possible similarly david amidon of popmatters who stated that 1 1 provides beyonce a song that can compete with favorites of this generation s parents later wrote that 1 1 and i care are equally competent if safer attempts at same formula he added that songs explain why she is head and shoulders above her clear channel competition in r b however he concluded that two songs are misplaced on of album as i care is a jilted lover track directly after a pure love song as 1 1 chicago sun times thomas conner commented that i care is a sad but superb song holly gleason of paste magazine noted that i care creates a backdrop for knowles shaft of vocal power hinting that she played etta james in musical biopic cadillac records 2008 genevieve koski of a v club commented that 4 sees beyonce stretching out vocally particularly on heart rending i care rich juzwiak of village voice commented that i care is one of several four songs in which deceptive calm gives way to intensity cum chorus and commended how beyonce s essence trembles with feeling she seizes with emotion and her voice flutters with intensity of a hummingbird brandon lewis of blogcritics commended how she makes maximum use of power in her lower register which according to him is very effective with song s relatively short punchy phrasing ian walker of absolutepunk commented that beyonce and backing production ebb and flow as song proceeds and added that toward end she channels her inner mariah carey and ultimately puts older star to shame similarly craig jenkins of prefix magazine praised how effortlessly beyonce scats along with multi octave guitar solo matthew perpetua of rolling stone wrote that though song may not be an obvious single it remains one of finest tracks on record ben cardew of music week called i care an early highlight on 4 further praising its instrumentation and fact that song feels touched with sadness largely thanks to a fantastic chorus he also noted that i care bears resemblance to some of neptunes classy early tracks andy gill of independent wrote that i care makes good use of surfer blood s 2010 song twin peaks two chord motif chad grischow of ign commented i care is one of songs on which beyonce s vocals are superior to lyrics as lame hook pleads but i care i know you don t care too much but i still care nmes hamish macbain showed depreciation guitar solo lyrics and off kilter drums and moody synths on i care neil mccormick of daily telegraph viewed i care as an old fashioned power ballad live performances thumb beyonce performing i care during mrs carter show world tour in 2013 beyonce performed i care live for first time on august 14 2011
