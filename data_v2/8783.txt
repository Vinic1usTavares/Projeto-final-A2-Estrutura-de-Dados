vision and i want you to express that vision producer malek akkad speaking to writer director rob zombie in 2008 at 30 years of terror convention halloween producer malek akkad confirmed that a sequel to rob zombie s 2007 film was in works french filmmakers julien maury and alexandre bustillo were in negotiations to direct sequel in november 2008 but on december 15 2008 variety reported that rob zombie had officially signed on to write and direct halloween sequel in an interview zombie expressed how exhaustion of creating first halloween made him not want to come back for a sequel but after a year of cooling down he was more open to idea writer director explained that with sequel he was no longer bound by a sense of needing to retain any john carpenter ness as he felt free to do whatever producer malek akkad said original intention when they believed zombie was not returning was to create a normal sequel akkad and his producing company hired various writers to come up with drafts for a new film but none worked akkad and weinstein brothers then turned to bustillo and whose film inside had recently been bought for distribution by weinstein company according to akkad producers really wanted zombie to return as akkad felt that there was something lost in translation when french filmmakers took over project after his work on 2007 remake zombie had earned trust of akkad who told him to ignore any rules they had set for him on previous film akkad said that he wanted zombie to move franchise away from some of its established rules characters for sequel mane mcdowell taylor compton harris moon zombie and dourif returned to roles of michael myers dr loomis laurie strode annie brackett deborah myers and sheriff brackett respectively although daeg faerch who portrayed a young michael myers in 2007 remake was initially signed on to reprise his role for halloween ii then known as h2 after filming briefly in georgia as young michael he was later recast because he had grown taller he was replaced by chase wright vanek zombie had to recast role much to his own dismay because faerch s physical maturity did not fit what was in script although faerch is not in sequel first trailer for halloween ii contained images of faerch zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either trailer or film as laurie is michael s sister i m playing it like he s clearly insane and so is she but her insanity doesn t manifest itself in same way she s slipping into insanity throughout whole movie zombie describing laurie s psychological state taylor compton described her character as having these bipolar moments where her emotions are spontaneously changing from points of happiness to agitation actress stated that zombie wanted to see laurie strode travel into these really dark places taylor compton clarified that when film starts laurie is still not aware that michael is her older brother and as film progresses more and more pieces of information are given to her and she does not know how to deal with them actress explained that darkness brewing inside laurie is manifested externally generally through her physical appearance and clothes she chooses to wear zombie characterized look as grungy instead of focusing on michael zombie chose to look more at psychological consequences on laurie after events of remake as zombie explains after michael murdered her friends and family laurie became a wreck who continually sinks lower as film moves forward even sheriff brackett goes through changes brackett who receives more screen time in this film allows laurie to move in with him and his daughter after events of first film zombie explained he s old he s worn out he s just this beat down guy with these two girls he can t deal with zombie characterized loomis in sequel as more of a sellout who exploits memories of those who were killed by michael in 2007 film zombie explained that he tried to channel vincent bugliosi a lawyer who prosecuted charles manson and then wrote a book about it into loomis s character for sequel noting that he wanted loomis to seem more ridiculous this time as for michael myers character is given almost an entirely new look for film which is being used according to taylor compton to illustrate a new emotion for character as he spends much of his time trying to hide himself zombie said that of all of characters that return in sequel michael is only one that does not change all other characters are very different laurie loomis they re having all kinds of problems in their life but michael just moves along michael is no different he s exactly same as he was ten years old and he killed everybody he has no concept of world around him so he can never be affected by it filming with a 15 million budget production began on february 23 2009 in atlanta georgia zombie acknowledged that filming in georgia provided certain tax breaks for company but real reason he chose that location was because other locations he was planning to use were still experiencing snowy weather for him georgia s landscapes and locations provided look that he wanted for his film during production zombie described sequel as being ultra gritty ultra intense and very real and said that he was trying to create almost exact opposite of what people would expect known for filming multiple sequences during production of his films zombie filmed an alternate ending to halloween ii in alternate ending loomis and michael crash through shed police have surrounded and out into open air as loomis grasps at michael s mask and pleads for him to stop michael stabs him in stomach telling him to die with loomis injured and unconscious it is not revealed whether he lived or died police open fire on michael killing him laurie now completely insane leaves shack picks up michael s knife and walks over to loomis unconscious body against brackett s orders police open fire on laurie apparently killing her too music for sequel zombie only used carpenter s original theme music in final scene of film though director admits that he and music composer tyler bates tried to find other places to include it according to zombie carpenter s music did not fit with what was happening in film whenever he or bates would insert it into a scene it just wouldn t feel right to director zombie also used popular culture songs throughout film with nights in white satin appearing most prominently zombie chose songs that he liked and that would enhance a given scene within film an official soundtrack for film was released on august 25 2009 in addition an album featuring music of band captain clegg and night creatures was released in conjunction with halloween ii on august 28 2009 captain clegg and

in fourth place just behind original halloween critical reception based on 79 reviews collected by rotten tomatoes halloween ii has an overall 22 approval rating from critics with an average score of 3 81 out of 10 with general consensus reading zombie shows flashes of vision in follow up to his halloween reboot but they re smothered by mountains of gore and hackneyed brutal violence rob nelson of variety felt use of deborah and white horse was nothing more than silly and he disagreed with zombie s choice to film halloween ii in 16mm film as opposed to wider format of 35mm that he used on his 2007 remake nelson also stated that hospital scene was nothing more than a butcher version of carpenter s 1981 sequel with rest of film feeling like it was rushed and slapped together at last minute in contrast time out believed hospital scene at start of film bested 1981 sequel in just about every respect time out stated that compton s portrayal of laurie strode showed an intense dedication to role that kept interest while storyline of dr loomis s egocentricity hinders overall storyline time out also said that zombie hurt film by trying to show how violence lingers with and perverts all who are touched by it but then undercutting himself with carnivalesque violence although new york post s kyle smith did not believe character of laurie strode was a balance for michael myers or dr loomis he agreed ghostly images of deborah myers were a relief from blood streaked brutality of michael s murders boston globe s tom russo had varied reactions to film russo pointed out that zombie attempted to be more inventive with halloween ii but only achieved mixed results for his efforts russo referred to dream sequences of deborah myers and white horse as pretentiously silly but agreed that scenes did help to break up standard genre violence and even went so far as to compare sensation created by those scenes to tim burton doing straight horror in end russo claimed that only most hardcore fans would want film series to continue joe neumaier of daily news stated that zombie has found himself with halloween ii neumaier describes film as a successful character based monster flick zombie s use of music from 1970s like moody blues nights in white satin and 10cc s things we do for love is terrifically odd throughout film neumaier also said that imagery of deborah myers and ethereal white horse were a nice visual relief from michael s violent attacks cancelled sequel in 2009 rob zombie declined to return to direct sequel to halloween ii on august 30 2009 next film in series halloween 3d was announced by weinstein company and planned to be released in 2010 film was ultimately cancelled as bob and harvey weinstein decided to green light and prioritize scream 4 instead references
