1827 north carolina hurricane caused severe impacts along its track through northeastern caribbean sea and up east coast of united states in late august 1827 first observed over leeward islands on august 17 storm continued northwest passing over puerto rico and northern coastline of hispaniola it moved through turks and caicos islands and then bahamas by august 21 and curved northward although there is some discrepancy in its track hurricane moved ashore somewhere along north carolina coastline on august 25 perhaps at category 4 intensity on modern day saffir simpson hurricane wind scale cyclone emerged back into atlantic ocean around norfolk virginia and grazed new england coastline before last being observed offshore nova scotia on august 28 along its track numerous vessels were damaged capsized or run aground combination of heavy rainfall and ferocious winds caused severe crop damage damaged or destroyed structures and snapped and uprooted trees overall storm was responsible for more than six deaths and at least two injuries meteorological synopsis origin of 1827 north carolina hurricane is unclear in absence of reliable data across atlantic ocean but it is surmised storm began as a classic cape verde hurricane on a west northwest track hurricane moved through lesser antilles on august 17 and august 18 grazing coastline of hispaniola following day it reached turks and caicos islands on august 20 and bahamas on august 21 subsequently curving northward east of florida and south carolina a few days later ludlum 1963 p 119 on august 25 storm thought to have been as strong as category 4 strength on modern day saffir simpson hurricane wind scale moved ashore along north carolina coastline its exact landfall point remains unclear with one study suggesting a landfall along outer banks fraser 2009 p 99 and a second study concluding a landfall along carolinas border on basis of surface observations from wilmington north carolina 2008 nonetheless storm then turned northeast and emerged into atlantic around norfolk virginia it grazed new england coastline before being last documented around sable island offshore nova scotia on august 28 impact and aftermath thumb 300px map of carolinas in 1827 1827 hurricane first made its presence known in antigua and saint croix on august 17 where on latter island wind was regarded as worst in forty years and continued for up to ten hours in nearby saint kitts storm was considered most violent in half a century puerto rico bore brunt of cyclone on august 18 where severe crop damage was reported offshore southeastern united states ship lavinia en route to new orleans from new york city intercepted powerful hurricane a combination of high waves and strong winds caused severe damage to vessel and it was saved only by storm s passage almost simultaneously ship brandt from charleston south carolina bound for new york encountered winds that blew a perfect hurricane with its sails torn apart and reduced to bare poles tumbled about by southwesterly winds and a strong current vessel soon found itself in waves with up to of standing water in hold a 14 year old boy was washed overboard aided by a french frigate as well as a lessening of tumultuous weather ship eventually found ground in norfolk fraser 2009 p 98 in late august passengers aboard schooner mary ellen from baltimore observed a second schooner partially disassembled she soon also intercepted system and was knocked on its side by a large wave it was righted and continued on its course to charleston but not before sustaining substantial damage another schooner solon from new orleans passed through hurricane offshore georgia or south carolina coastlines massive waves wrecked ship washing overboard all passengers except captain and his crew member both men were rescued by mary eleanor of savannah georgia but captain died a day later from fatigue although eye of cyclone passed well east of charleston winds blew with great violence for six hours only minimal damage occurred in city and surrounding areas as storm passed by during low tide throughout north carolina 1827 hurricane was considered more severe than a similar tracked cyclone that impacted region 12 years prior in city of wilmington a few buildings saw their chimneys destroyed roofs ripped off and fences flattened one resident recounted that waves washed above garden fences up to inland while other reports suggested that storm tides surpassed above normal levels less than a dozen vessels were driven ashore along banks of cape fear river outside city hurricane widened sound by at least and destroyed several of accompanied saltworks fayetteville recorded a 30 hour period of gales and rain where an abundant corn crop sustained insignificant loss cotton and tobacco crops did not fare so well and many roads were rendered impassible by fallen trees or high water raleigh meanwhile saw many of its water courses flooded mills and bridges carried off and trees and chimneys downed corn and cotton crops were in some cases torn to pieces and piles of wheat which had been stacked in fields were swept downstream in or modern day winston salem hurricane s onslaught downed fences tore off roofs and damaged orchards and forests several bridges were swept away by floodwaters and numerous washed out roadways impeded travel for weeks following storm s passage in washington floodwaters rose to as much as in first floor of houses along water street ludlum 1963 p 120 while storm tides exceeded one schooner was driven aground causing damage to a wharf while several others combined to dislodge and carry away a bridge most crops were destroyed in nearby new bern residents were forced to navigate city by canoe across ocracoke five out of six vessels harbored in wallace s channel were driven aground with remaining craft being blown into pamlico sound two packet boats from new york were pushed ashore and smashed to pieces a newly placed lightship off ocracoke inlet broke loose and was pushed onto ocracoke island where captain his wife and their three daughters were rescued at cedar hummock a large ship en route from bay of honduras to london ran aground during height of hurricane but was set back on its way after storm passed ships amphibious and mary were both wrecked and pushed ashore near portsmouth and both captains drowned most well known encounter with this hurricane came about offshore cape hatteras where diamond shoals lightship was positioned just four years prior rough seas created by hurricane broke ship from its moorings and drove it ashore on core banks near portsmouth drowning carpenter and ship s mate in process no new lightship was replaced in this position for another half a century around cape itself only two out of twenty sails along portsmouth road were spared from running aground or being carried out to sea only one mill in remained standing after hurricane s passage after departing north carolina hurricane tracked through southern virginia where it was described as a severe gale which continued for three days changed climate here entirely thanks to a subsiding tide damage along coastline of virginia was not nearly as severe as 1821 norfolk and long island hurricane although winds were said to have been just as intense still fodder was rendered useless and many corn crops were damaged a two story building on talbot street in norfolk had its second floor carried downwind numerous cattle were swept away and a mill dam was completely destroyed with bridge above it removed in process in nansemond county fruit trees were severely damaged along james river low grounds were completely submerged crops along waterway were also ruined a brick building was destroyed a team boat was sunk at its wharf and some ships at navy yard were ripped from their fasts but otherwise sustained no damage schooner albion was gravely injured when nearly all of its sails were blown away when it lost its main jib boom and fore top mast and when all objects were swept off ship s deck including caboose two crew members sustained injuries around hampton pilot boats james barron virginia and mary ann were both run aground in gloucester county corn crops were damaged sloop flag was capsized on middle ground of chesapeake river with no survivors brig liberty from boston ran aground on south side of portsmouth while schooner mulberry sustained severe damage passengers overthrew cargo to prevent ship from sinking as far north as baltimore it is said considerable mischief was inflicted by hurricane in new york city two vessels were pushed ashore while two pleasure boats were overturned along east river heavy rainfall and gale force winds were recorded throughout connecticut massachusetts and cape cod as president john quincy adams had previously disallowed trade between united states and west indies during his tenure however following passage of 1827 hurricane politician allowed free trade for three months presidential candidate andrew jackson soon became outspoken against cutting ties between two regions and his support for free trade garnered support from shipping interests that helped him win presidency a year later barnes 1998 p 55 notes footnotes citations references 1827 1827 north carolina 1827 1827 1827 1827 1827 1827 1827 1827
