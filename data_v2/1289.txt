black bean aphid aphis fabae is a small black insect in genus aphis with a broad soft body a member of order hemiptera other common names include bean aphid and beet leaf aphid in warmer months of year it is found in large numbers on undersides of leaves and on growing tips of host plants including various agricultural crops and many wild and ornamental plants both winged and wingless forms exist and at this time of year they are all females they suck sap from stems and leaves and cause distortion of shoots stunted plants reduced yield and spoiled crops this aphid also acts as a vector for viruses that cause plant disease and honeydew it secretes may encourage growth of sooty mould it breeds profusely by live birth but its numbers are kept in check especially in later part of summer by various predatory and parasitic insects ants feed on honeydew it produces and take active steps to remove aphid s enemies it is a widely distributed pest of agricultural crops and can be controlled by chemical or biological means in autumn winged forms move to different host plants where both males and females are produced these mate and females lay eggs which overwinter taxonomy specific name of black bean aphid fabae comes from latin faba meaning a bean a plant on which this aphid often feeds aphis fabae is in superfamily and subgenus aphis some taxonomists consider it a group of related species or possibly u california ipm black bean aphid fauna europaea lists six subspecies a f a f a f a f fabae a f a f description thumb left wingless aphids feeding on a stem black bean aphid is a small soft bodied meaning that part of exoskeleton is greatly reduced insect under morphology and physiology exoskeleton line 3 retrieved 2019 04 17 insect that has specialised piercing and sucking mouthparts which are used to suck juice from plants this aphid is usually seen in large numbers and is a tiny plump insect about two millimetres long with a small head and bulbous abdomen body is blackish or dark green in colour many adults are devoid of wings a state known as winged forms known as alates are longer and more slender than and have shiny black heads and thoraxes membranous wings of alates are held angled over body antennae are less than two thirds of length of body and both they and legs are pale yellow in colour with black tips tibiae of hind legs are swollen in egg laying females near rear of abdomen is a pair of slender elongated tubes known as or their function is production of a defensive waxy secretion they are twice as long as finger like tail and both are brownish black life cycle thumb winged adult black bean aphid has both sexual and asexual generations in its life cycle it also alternates hosts at different times of year primary host plants are woody shrubs and eggs are laid on these by winged females in autumn adults then die and eggs overwinter aphids that hatch from these eggs in spring are wingless females known as stem mothers these are able to reproduce asexually giving birth to live offspring nymphs through parthenogenesis lifespan of a parthenogenetic female is about 50 days and during this period each can produce as many as 30 young offspring are also females and able to reproduce without mating but further generations are usually winged forms these migrate to their secondary host plants completely different species that are typically herbaceous plants with soft young growth further parthenogenesis takes place on these new hosts on undersides of leaves and on growing tips all offspring are female at this time of year and large populations of aphids develop rapidly with both winged and wingless forms produced throughout summer winged individuals develop as a response to overcrowding and they disperse to new host plants and other crops by midsummer number of predators and parasites has built up and aphid populations cease to expand as autumn approaches winged forms migrate back to primary host plants here both males and sexual females are produced parthogenetically mating takes place and these females lay eggs in crevices and under lichens to complete lifecycle each female can lay six to ten black eggs which can survive temperatures as low as more than 40 of eggs probably survive winter but some are eaten by birds or flower bugs and others fail to hatch in spring host plants thumb upright left aphids adopting a characteristic stance when feeding on a broad bean stalk black bean aphid can feed on a wide variety of host plants its primary hosts on which eggs overwinter are shrubs such as spindle tree europaeus viburnum species or mock orange philadelphus species its secondary hosts on which it spends summer include a number of crops including sugar beets spinach beans runner beans celery potatoes sunflowers carrots tobacco and tomatoes it colonises more than 200 different species of cultivated and wild plants among latter it shows a preference for poppies species burdock fat hen chenopodium album saltbush atriplex rosea chamomile thistles cirsium and docks rumex spp two conflicting factors are involved in host preferences species and age of leaf offered spindle and beet leaves on growing plants throughout year winged aphids moved from one to other depending on active growth state of each and senescence of each host plant thus in late summer and autumn beet leaves were old and unattractive to aphids in comparison with leaves of spindle whereas in spring young unfolding leaves of beet were more attractive than those of spindle damage black bean aphid is a major pest of sugar beet bean and celery crops with large numbers of aphids cause stunting of plants beans suffer damage to flowers and pods which may not develop properly early sown crops may avoid significant damage if they have already flowered before number of aphids builds up in spring celery can be heavily infested plants are stunted by removal of sap stems are distorted harmful viruses are transmitted and aphid residues may contaminate crop as a result of infestation by this aphid leaves of sugar beet become swollen roll and cease developing roots grow poorly and sugar content is reduced in some other plants leaves do not become distorted but growth is affected and flowers abort due to action of toxic saliva injected by aphid to improve flow of sap to obtain enough protein aphids need to suck large volumes of sap excess sugary fluid honeydew is secreted by aphids it adheres to plants where it promotes growth of sooty molds these are unsightly reduce surface area of plant available for photosynthesis and may reduce value of crop these aphids are also vectors of about 30 plant viruses mostly of variety aphids may not be original source of infection but are instrumental in spreading virus through crop various chemical treatments are available to kill aphids and organic growers can use a solution of soft soap ecology thumb wasp laying egg inside an aphid s body upright thumb aphids tended by ants natural predators of black bean aphids include both adults and larvae of ladybirds and lacewings and larvae of hoverflies certain species of tiny parasitic wasps lay their eggs inside aphids and developing wasp larvae devour their hosts from inside members of wasp genera and behave in this way and may provide a measure of control of aphids ants climb host plants and feed on honeydew secreted by aphids many species of ants have developed behaviours to enable them to protect and encourage their aphids black garden ants lasius niger for example remove predators such as ladybirds from vicinity of aphids thus keeping their milch cows safe on a test plot of field beans vicia faba plants without black bean aphids yielded an average of 56 seeds per plant those with aphids and no ants yielded 17 seeds and those with both ants and aphids averaged eight seeds per plant distribution black bean aphid may have originated in europe and asia but it is now one of most widely distributed species of aphids it is found throughout temperate areas of western europe asia and north america and in cooler parts of africa middle east and south america in warmer parts of its range apterous individuals can survive winter and they may continue to reproduce asexually all year round it is known to be migratory johnson c g 1963 aerial migration of insects
