kashrut also kashruth or is a set of dietary laws dealing with foods that jews are permitted to eat and how those foods must be prepared according to jewish law food that may be consumed is deemed kosher in english from ashkenazi pronunciation of hebrew term kasher meaning fit in this context fit for consumption although details of laws of kashrut are numerous and complex they rest on a few basic principles only certain types of animals birds and fish meeting specific criteria are kosher consumption of flesh of any animals that do not meet these criteria such as pork and shellfish is forbidden kosher mammals and birds must be slaughtered according to a process known as shechita blood may never be consumed and it must be removed from meat by a process of salting and soaking in water for meat to be permissible for use meat and milk and their derivatives may never be mixed and separate equipment for storage and preparation of meat based and dairy based foods must be used every food that is considered kosher is also categorized as follows meat products also called b sari or fleishig are those that contain kosher meat such as beef bison or lamb or kosher poultry such as chicken goose duck or turkey or derivatives of meat such as animal gelatin non animal products that were processed on equipment used for meat or meat derived products must also be considered as meat b chezkat basar dairy products also called or milchig contain milk or any derivatives of milk such as butter or cheese non dairy products that were processed on equipment used for milk or milk derived products must also be considered as milk b chezkat parev products contain neither meat nor milk or their derivative ingredients and include foods such as fish eggs grains fruit and produce they remain parev if they are not mixed with or processed using equipment that is used for any meat or dairy products while any produce that grows from earth such as fruits grains vegetables and mushrooms are always permissible laws regarding status of certain agricultural produce especially that grown in land of israel such as tithes and produce of sabbatical year impact their for consumption most of basic laws of kashrut are derived from torah s books of leviticus and deuteronomy their details and practical application however are set down in oral law eventually codified in mishnah and talmud and elaborated on in later rabbinical literature although torah does not state rationale for most kashrut laws some suggest that they are only tests of obedience maimonides guide for perplexed ed m friedlander part iii chapter 26 new york 1956 p 311 while others have suggested philosophical practical and hygienic reasons maimonides guide for perplexed ed m friedlander part iii chapter 48 new york 1956 p commentary to leviticus 11 ha chinuch commandments 73 and 148 over past century many kashrut certification agencies have started to certify products manufacturers and restaurants as kosher usually authorizing use of a proprietary symbol called a hechsher on products or issuing a certificate also called a hechsher to be displayed by food establishment to indicate their approval that they are in compliance with kosher laws explanations philosophical jewish philosophy divides 613 commandments or into three groups laws that have a rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without torah s command and laws that do not have a rational explanation some jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as laws for which there is no particular explanation since human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions in this line of thinking dietary laws were given as a demonstration of god s authority and man must obey without asking why december 1998 archived from original however maimonides believed that jews were permitted to seek out reasons for laws of torah mishneh torah 4 13 in eds frankel l am some theologians have said that laws of kashrut are symbolic in character kosher animals represent virtues while non kosher animals represent vices 1st century bce letter of aristeas argues that laws have been given to awake pious thoughts and to form character letter of aristeas 145 154 this view reappears in work of 19th century rabbi samson raphael hirsch torah prohibits seething kid goat sheep calf in its mother s milk while bible does not provide a reason it has been suggested that practice was perceived as cruel and insensitive quoting deuteronomy rabbah 6 1 hasidic judaism believes that everyday life is imbued with channels connecting with divinity activation of which it sees as helping divine presence to be drawn into physical world hasidism argues that food laws are related to way such channels termed sparks of holiness interact with various animals these sparks of holiness are released whenever a jew manipulates any object for a holy reason which includes eating however not all animal products are capable of releasing their sparks of holiness hasidic argument is that animals are imbued with signs that reveal release of these sparks and signs are expressed in biblical categorization of ritually clean and ritually unclean org archived from original on august 29 2007 according to christian theologian gordon j wenham purpose of kashrut was to help jews maintain a distinct and separate existence from other peoples he says that effect of laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non jews preventing jewish identity from being diluted gordon j wenham theology of unclean food evangelical quarterly 53 january march 1981 pp 6 15 wenham argued that since impact of food laws was a public affair this would have enhanced jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as jews medical there have been attempts to provide empirical support for view that jewish food laws have an overarching health benefit or purpose one of earliest is that of maimonides in guide for perplexed in 1953 david macht an orthodox jew and proponent of theory of biblical scientific foresight conducted toxicity experiments on many kinds of animals and fish his experiment involved lupin seedlings being supplied with extracts from meat of various animals macht reported that in 100 of cases extracts from ritually unclean meat inhibited seedling s growth more than that from ritually clean meats op cit at same time these explanations are controversial scholar lester l grabbe writing in oxford bible commentary on leviticus says a n explanation now almost universally rejected is that laws in this section have hygiene as their basis although some of laws of ritual purity roughly correspond to modern ideas of physical cleanliness many of them have little to do with hygiene for example there is no evidence that unclean animals are intrinsically bad to eat or to be avoided in a mediterranean climate as is sometimes asserted oxford bible commentary eds j barton and j oxford oxford university press 2001 99 laws of kashrut prohibited foods thumb kosher airline meal approved by

are barred from merely applying these regulations alone an established tradition masorah is necessary to allow birds to be consumed even if it can be substantiated that they meet all four criteria only exception to this is turkey there was a time when certain authorities considered signs sufficient so jews started eating this bird without a masorah because it possesses all signs in hebrew fish

very thick when salting arukh yoreh de ah ss 69 5 yemenite jewish practice however follows rabbi gaon who required that meat not be larger than half a i e ca 216 grams when salting this allows effects of salt to penetrate some orthodox jewish communities require additional stricture of raw meat in boiling water prior to cooking it a practice known as halitah blanching maimonides mishne torah ma 6 10 cf babylonian talmud hullin 111a this was believed to constrict blood lodged within meat to prevent it from oozing out when meat was eaten raw meat is left in pot of boiling water for as long as it takes for meat to whiten on its outer layer if someone wanted to use water for soup after making halitah in same pot he could simply scoop out film froth and scum that surface in boiling water halitah is not required when roasting meat over a fire as fire constricts blood kosher utensils thumb kosher dairy dishes from 19th century in jewish museum berlin utensils used for non kosher foods become

shulchan aruch orach chayim 318 1 passover laws thumb left label on a bottle of orange juice certifying that it is kosher for passover passover has stricter dietary rules most important of which is prohibition on eating leavened bread or derivatives of this which are known as chametz this prohibition is derived from exodus 12 15 utensils used in preparing and serving chametz are also forbidden on passover unless they have been ritually cleansed shulchan aruch orach chayim 431 452 observant jews often keep separate sets of meat and dairy utensils for passover use only in addition some groups follow various eating restrictions on passover that go beyond rules of kashrut such as not eating or garlic produce of land of israel biblical rules also control use of agriculture produce for example with respect to their tithing or when it is permitted to eat them or to harvest them and what must be done to make them suitable for human consumption for produce grown in land of israel a modified

forbidden for eating or any other use as orlah produce grown in land of israel on seventh year obtains k it and unless managed carefully is forbidden as a violation of sabbatical year some rules of

a cocoon found among in a commercially available bag of barley foods such as seeds nuts and vegetables need to be checked to avoid eating insects many vegetarian restaurants and producers of vegetarian foods acquire a hechsher certifying that a rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher hechsher usually certifies that certain vegetables have been checked for insect infestation and steps have been taken to ensure that cooked food meets requirements of bishul yisrael vegetables such as spinach and cauliflower must be checked for insect infestation proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species growing conditions and views of individual rabbis pareve foods a pareve or parve food is one which is neither meat nor dairy fish fall into this category as well as any food which is not animal derived eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product some processes convert a meat or dairy derived product into a pareve one for example rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese rennet must be kosher either microbial or from special productions of animal rennet using kosher calf stomachs org retrieved august 10 2005 derived from kosher animal sources which were ritually slaughtered are also pareve other gelatin like products from non animal sources such as agar agar and are pareve by nature fish gelatin like all kosher fish products is pareve jewish law generally requires that bread be kept parve i e not kneaded with meat or dairy products nor made on meat or dairy equipment with sweat of thou brow shall thou eat bread kashrut has procedures by which equipment can be cleaned of its previous non kosher or meat dairy use but those may be inadequate for vegetarians those with allergies or adherents to other religious statutes for example dairy manufacturing equipment can be cleaned well enough that rabbis grant pareve status to products manufactured with it but someone with a strong allergic sensitivity to dairy products might still react to dairy residue that is why some products that are legitimately pareve carry milk warnings cannabis if smoked under normal circumstances there is no reason cannabis marijuana would not be kosher although some rabbis apply this only to medical cannabis not recreational usage however this is excepting that smoking it typically involves lighting a spark so it would not be appropriate for example after sundown on shabbat if cannabis is eaten as cannabis edibles are on other hand issue is not as clear cut as there may be small insects inside which are not kosher for observant it is recommended to only use brands that are certified as kosher for cannabis grown in israel plants must observe but this does not apply to cannabis from elsewhere tobacco though it is not a food product some tobacco receives a year long kosher certification this year long certification means that tobacco is certified also for passover where different restrictions may be in place tobacco may for example come into contact with some chametz grains that are strictly forbidden during passover and certification is a guarantee that it is free from this type of contamination in israel this certification is given by a private kashrut rabbinic group beit yosef but chief rabbinate has objected to granting of any certification by rabbis because of health risks from tobacco genetically modified foods with advent of genetic engineering a whole new type of food has been brought into world and scholars in both academia and judaic faith have differing viewpoints on whether these new strains of foods are to be considered kosher or not first genetically modified animal approved by fda for human consumption is aquadvantage salmon and while salmon is normally an acceptably kosher food this modified organism has a gene from a nonkosher organism in 2015 committee on jewish law and standards of rabbinical assembly released a document regarding genetically modified organisms stating that modification of gene sequences via introduction of foreign dna in order to convey a specific capability in new organism is allowable that entirely new species should not be intentionally created and that health implications of genetically modified foods must be considered on an individual basis nevins rabbi david s 10 november 2015 perspectives on genetically modified organisms rabbinical assembly some put forth that this of species is against teachings of talmud and thus against jewish law and nonkosher others argue that one in sixty parts law of kashrut is of significance and that foreign gene accounts for less than 1 60 of animal and thus modified salmon is kosher supervision and marketing certain foods must be prepared in

product labeling standards thumb circled u indicates that this product is certified as kosher by orthodox union ou word pareve indicates that this product contains neither milk nor meat derived ingredients thumb right ok kosher certification circled k symbol with a dairy designation on a bag of trader joe s chocolate chips although reading label of food products can identify obviously non kosher ingredients some countries allow manufacturers to omit identification of certain ingredients such hidden ingredients may include lubricants and flavorings among other additives in some cases for instance use of natural flavorings these ingredients are more likely to be derived from non kosher substances furthermore certain products such as fish have a high rate of mislabeling which may result in a non kosher fish being sold in a package labeled as a species of kosher fish producers of foods and food additives can contact jewish religious authorities to have their products certified as kosher this involves a visit to manufacturing facilities by an individual rabbi or a committee from a rabbinic organization who will inspect production methods and contents and if everything is sufficiently kosher a certificate would be issued manufacturers sometimes identify products that have received such certification by adding particular graphical symbols to label these symbols are known in judaism as due to differences in kashrut standards held by different organizations of certain jewish authorities may at times be considered invalid by other jewish authorities certification marks of various rabbis and organisations are too numerous to list but one of most commonly used in united states of america is that of union of orthodox congregations who use a u inside a circle o u symbolising initials of orthodox union in britain a commonly used symbol is logo of london beth din a single k is sometimes used as a symbol for kosher but since many countries do not allow letters to

but legal classification does not d dairy de dairy equipment m meat including poultry pareve food that is neither meat nor dairy fish p passover related p is not used for pareve in many cases constant supervision is required because for various reasons such as changes in manufacturing processes products that once were kosher may cease to be so for example a kosher lubricating oil may be replaced by one containing tallow which many rabbinic authorities view as non kosher such changes are often coordinated with supervising rabbi or supervising organization to ensure that new packaging does not suggest any hechsher or kashrut in some cases however existing stocks of pre printed labels with hechsher may continue to be used on now non kosher product an active grapevine among jewish community discusses which products are now questionable as well as products which have become kosher but whose labels have yet to carry hechsher some newspapers and periodicals also discuss kashrut products products labeled kosher style are non kosher products that have characteristics of kosher foods such as all beef hot dogs or are flavored or prepared in a manner consistent with ashkenazi practices like dill pickles designation usually refers to delicatessen items history of kosher supervision and marketing thumb kosher mcdonald s in buenos aires argentina food producers often look to expand their markets or marketing potential and offering kosher food has become a way to do that uniqueness of kosher food was advertised as early as 1849 in 1911 procter gamble became first company to advertise one of their products as kosher over next two decades companies such as lender s bagels maxwell house and empire evolved and gave kosher market more shelf space in 1960s hebrew national launched a we answer to a higher authority campaign to appeal to jews and non jews alike from that point on kosher became a symbol for both quality and value kosher market quickly expanded and with it more opportunities for kosher products menachem founder of trade fair estimates as many as kosher consumers and in sales of kosher products in usa in 2014 israeli defense forces decided to allow female kosher supervisors to work in its kitchens on military bases and first women kosher inspectors were certified in israel legal usage advertising standards laws in many jurisdictions prohibit use of phrase kosher in a product s labeling unless producer can show that product conforms to jewish dietary laws however different jurisdictions often define legal qualifications for conforming to jewish dietary laws differently for example in some places law may require that a rabbi certify kashrut nature in others rules of kosher are fully defined in law and in others still it is sufficient that manufacturer only believes that product complies with jewish dietary regulations in several cases laws restricting use of term kosher have later been determined to be illegal religious interference costs in united states cost of certification for mass produced items is typically minuscule and is usually more than offset by advantages of being certified in 1975 new york times estimated cost per item for obtaining kosher certification at 6 5 millionths of a cent 0 per item for a general foods frozen food item according to a 2005 report by burns mcdonnell most us national certifying agencies are non profit only charging for supervision and on site work for which on site supervisor typically makes less per visit than an auto mechanic does per hour however re engineering an existing manufacturing process can be costly certification usually leads to increased revenues by opening up additional markets to jews who keep kosher muslims who keep halal seventh day adventists who keep main laws of kosher diet vegetarians and lactose intolerant who wish to avoid dairy products products that are reliably certified as pareve meet this criterion according to orthodox union one of largest kashrut organizations in united states when positioned next to a competing non kosher brand a kosher product will do better by 20 in some european communities there is a special tax imposed on purchase of kosher meat to help support community s educational institutions in 2009 delegates at a meeting of rabbinical council of europe broadly agreed that tax which supports rabbinate os and other communal facilities should be reduced while supermarket tesco sells a whole chicken for ps2 its kosher counterpart of similar weight costs five to six times more society and culture adherence many jews observe kashrut partially by abstaining from pork or shellfish or by not drinking milk with a meat dish some keep kosher at home but will eat in a non kosher restaurant in 2012 one analysis of specialty food market in north america estimated that only 15 of kosher consumers were jewish muslims hindus and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider kosher pareve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal derived ingredients including milk and all of its derivatives however since kosher pareve foods may contain honey eggs or fish vegans cannot rely on certification about a sixth of american jews or 0 3 of american population fully keep kosher and there are many more who do not strictly follow all rules but still abstain from some prohibited foods especially pork seventh day adventist church a christian denomination has a health message that expects adherence to kosher dietary laws a 2013 survey found that 22 of american jews surveyed claimed to keep kosher in home linguistics in ancient hebrew word kosher means be advantageous proper suitable or succeed according to brown driver briggs hebrew and english lexicon in modern hebrew it generally refers to kashrut but it can also sometimes mean proper for example babylonian talmud uses kosher in sense of virtuous when referring to darius i as a kosher king darius a persian king reigned 522 486 bce fostered building of second temple tractate rosh hashanah 3b edition mesorah publications ltd in colloquial english kosher often means legitimate acceptable permissible genuine or authentic word kosher can form part of some common product names sometimes it is used as an abbreviation of meaning process for making something kosher for example kosher salt is a form of salt with irregularly shaped crystals making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to rules of kashrut because increased surface area of crystals absorbs blood more effectively at other times kosher can occur as a synonym for jewish tradition for example a kosher dill pickle is simply a pickle made in traditional manner of jewish new york city pickle makers using a generous addition of
