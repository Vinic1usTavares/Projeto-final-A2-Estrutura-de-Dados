premiere in italy it was ordered to be seized by a local magistrate and deodato was arrested on obscenity charges he was later charged with multiple counts of murder due to rumors that claimed several actors were killed on camera although deodato was cleared of these charges film was banned in italy australia and several other countries due to its graphic content including sexual assault and genuine violence toward animals although some nations have since revoked ban it is still upheld in several countries in retrospective analyses film s violence has been noted as commentary on ethics in

monroe insists on viewing raw footage before making a decision executives first introduce him to alan s work by showing an excerpt from his previous documentary last road to hell which depicts

three surviving team members try to escape faye is captured and alan insists that they attempt to rescue her mark continues to film as she is stripped naked gang raped beaten and beheaded yanomamo

leaves station he ponders to himself who real cannibals are cast robert kerman as professor harold monroe luca giorgio barbareschi as mark tomaso gabriel yorke as alan yates francesca ciardi as faye daniels perry pirkanen as jack anders salvatore basile as chaco ricardo fuentes as lieutenant ochoa paolo as executive lucia costantini as adulteress pio di savoia as executive rocchi as native enrico papa as tv interviewer david sage as mr yates ruggero deodato as man on university campus production development right upright thumb director ruggero deodato production on cannibal holocaust began in 1979 when director ruggero deodato was contacted by german film producers to make a film similar to last cannibal world which he had also directed he accepted project and immediately went in search of a producer choosing his friend francesco palaggi two first flew to colombia to scout for filming locations leticia colombia was chosen as principal filming location after deodato met a colombian documentary filmmaker at airport in bogota who suggested town as a location ideal for filming other locations had been considered specifically those where gillo pontecorvo s burn had been shot but deodato rejected these due to lack of suitable rainforest leticia was only accessible by aircraft and from there cast and crew had to travel by boat to reach set locale presented many problems for production in particular heat and sudden rain storms which sporadically delayed filming deodato said he conceived of film while talking to his son about news coverage of terrorism of red brigades deodato thought that media focused on portraying violence with little regard for journalistic integrity and believed that media staged certain news angles in order to obtain more sensationalized footage he reflected this behavior in film team in cannibal holocaust whom he said symbolized italian media italian screenwriter gianfranco clerici wrote script under working title green inferno he had collaborated with deodato in his previous films ultimo mondo cannibale and house on edge of park latter of which was filmed before cannibal holocaust but released afterward names of certain characters in film were changed from clerici s screenplay name mark williams was changed to mark tomaso and shanda tommaso was changed to faye daniels clerici gianfranco cannibal holocaust screenplay last road to hell alternate version supplementary material on dvd release of cannibal holocaust dvd grindhouse releasing 2005 clerici also wrote several scenes that did not make film s final cut one of which depicted a group of yanomamo cutting off leg of a shamatari warrior and feeding him to piranhas in river this scene was to take place directly after monroe s team rescues a smaller group of yanomamo from shamatari attempts were made to film this scene but underwater camera did not operate properly and piranha were difficult to control as a result deodato abandoned his efforts and still photographs taken during scene are its only known depiction casting for film deodato cast several inexperienced actors from actors studio in new york city luca giorgio barbareschi and francesca ciardi were cast in part because they were italian actors who also spoke english deodato decided to make film in english to appeal to a wider audience and to lend film credibility however he also needed to establish a european nationality so that film could be more easily distributed among european countries under italian law for film to be recognized as italian deodato had to have at least two native italian speaking actors to star in film deodato also hired perry pirkanen and another actor from actors studio to play jack anders and alan yates respectively latter dropped out shortly before production team left for amazon although he appears in film as an ex colleague of yates casting director bill williams subsequently chose carl gabriel yorke to replace him for role yorke a stage actor who had studied under uta hagen was chosen in part because he was right size for costumes and boots which had already been purchased because cannibal holocaust was a non union production yorke originally wanted to be credited under alias christopher savage but ultimately decided against doing so robert kerman had years of experience working in adult films under pseudonym r bolla including well known debbie does dallas kerman was recommended to deodato for his previous film concorde affair in which kerman played an air traffic controller kerman went on to star in italian cannibal films eaten alive and cannibal ferox both directed by umberto lenzi kerman s girlfriend at time was cast as one of station executives as production needed an actress to be available in both new york city and rome direction deodato drew influence from works of paolo cavara gualtiero jacopetti and franco prosperi documentary filmmakers of whom deodato was a fan prosperi and jacopetti produced several mondo films which are documentaries similar to one made in cannibal holocaust these documentaries focused on sensationalistic and graphic content from around world including bizarre local customs death and general cruelty deodato followed suit in ways of similar content such as graphic violence and animal slayings although fictional deodato created a similar expose of worldly violence such as cavara s prosperi s and jacopetti s mondo cane deodato filmed cannibal holocaust using cinema verite technique he learned from his mentor roberto rossellini a style which production designer massimo antonello called film historian david kerekes contends that film s sense of reality is based on direction and treatment of film team s recovered footage noting that shaky hand held camerawork commands a certain realism and green inferno ill fated team s film within a film here is no exception and that this very instability gives green inferno film its authentic quality david carter of cult horror webzine savage cinema says that deodato s methods added a first person quality to film team s footage writing viewer feels as if they are there with crew experiencing horrors with them deodato was proud of other aspects of cinematography namely numerous moving shots using a standard shoulder mounted camera foregoing use of a steadicam kerekes noted animal slaughter and inclusion of footage from last road to hell as adding to sense of reality of film lloyd kaufman of entertainment compares these scenes to vsevolod s theory of montage saying in cannibal holocaust we see actors kill and rip apart a giant sea turtle and other animals brain has been conditioned to accept that which it s now seeing as real this mixture of real and staged violence combined with handheld camerawork and rough unedited quality of second half of movie is certainly enough to convince someone that what they are watching is real deodato says he included execution footage in last road to hell to draw further similarities to cannibal holocaust and mondo filmmaking of gualtiero jacopetti certain scenes in cannibal holocaust have also been noted as being similar to scenes in antonio climati s mondo film savana specifically scene in which monroe bathes naked in river and scene of forced abortion rite cinema verite style used heavily in cannibal holocaust was also used before in climati s first mondo film dalla savana in a scene where a tourist is attacked and killed by a pride of lions another scene in which a native man is captured tortured and murdered by mercenaries in south america uses a similar filming style and both scenes may have been influential on deodato s direction filming principal photography began on 4 june 1979 scenes featuring film team were shot first with handheld 16mm cameras in a cinema verite style that mimicked an observational documentary after shooting with film team was completed kerman flew down to film his scenes in rainforest and then to new york to film exterior shots in city interior shots of new york were later filmed in a studio in rome production on film was delayed numerous times while filming in amazon after original actor to play alan yates dropped out filming was halted for two weeks as new casting calls began and crew awaited arrival of yorke from new york city during principal filming with kerman father of actor who played miguel was murdered and production was again halted as actor flew back to bogota to attend his father s funeral tensions on amazonian set were high due in part to location and to nature of production itself yorke describes set as having a level of cruelty unknown to me while kerman described deodato as remorseless and uncaring he and deodato got into long drawn out arguments every day of shooting usually because of remarks made by deodato cast members also experienced unscrupulous payment practices which further heightened tensions yorke s first payment for film came in form of colombian pesos and was less than what had been agreed upon yorke refused to continue shooting until he was paid fairly in united states dollars native extras also went unpaid for their work despite their involvement in numerous dangerous scenes including a scene in which they were forced to stay inside a burning hut for a prolonged period of time robert kerman also noted unfair treatment of natives by deodato stating he was a sadist he was particularly sadistic to people that couldn t answer back people that were colombian and people that were italian but could be sent home gore met december 2005 a forbidden feast of flesh rue morgue magazine 52 30 32 one particular aspect that led to disagreement amongst cast and crew was genuine killing of animals kerman stormed off set while death of coatimundi was filmed and yorke refused to participate in killing of a pig which he was originally scripted to execute leaving duty to luca barbareschi when it was shot squeal of pig subsequently caused yorke to a long monologue and retakes were not an option because they had no access to additional pigs perry pirkanen cried after filming butchering of a turtle and crew members vomited off camera when a squirrel monkey was killed for film actress francesca ciardi also objected to film s sexual content and did not want to bare her breasts during sex scene between her and carl yorke when she refused to comply with deodato s direction he dragged her off set and screamed at her in italian she had earlier suggested that she and yorke actually have sex in jungle before filming in order to relieve tension of upcoming scene when yorke declined she grew upset with him alienating him for rest of shoot soundtrack film s soundtrack was composed entirely by italian composer riz ortolani whom deodato specifically requested because of ortolani s work in mondo cane deodato was particularly fond of film s main theme ti nel cuore which was given lyrics and became a worldwide pop hit under title more music of cannibal holocaust is a variety of styles from a gentle melody in main theme to a sad and flowing score in crucified woman and faster and more upbeat tracks in cameraman s recreation relaxing in savannah and drinking coco to sinister sounding massacre of troupe instrumentation is equally mixed ranging from full orchestras to electronics and synthesizers track listing reaction cannibal holocaust premiered on 7 february 1980 in italian city of milan although courts later confiscated film based on a citizen s complaint initial audience reaction was positive after seeing film director sergio leone wrote a letter to deodato which stated translated dear ruggero what a movie second part is a masterpiece of cinematographic realism but everything seems so real that i think you will get in trouble with all world in ten days before it was seized film had grossed approximately 2 million in japan it grossed 21 million becoming second highest grossing film of that time after e t extraterrestrial deodato has claimed film has grossed as much as 200 million worldwide in wake of its various re releases critical response critics remain split on their stances of cannibal holocaust supporters of film cite it as a serious and well made social commentary on modern world sean axmaker praised structure and setup of film saying it s a weird movie with an awkward narrative which deodato makes all more effective with his grimy sheen of documentary realism while riz ortolani s unsettlingly lovely elegiac score provides a weird undercurrent jason buchanan of allmovie said while it s hard to defend director for some of truly repugnant images with which he has chosen to convey his message there is indeed an underlying point to film if one is able to look beyond sometimes unwatchable images that assault viewer detractors however criticize over top gore and genuine animal slayings and also point to an alleged hypocrisy that film presents nick schager criticized brutality of film saying as clearly elucidated by its shocking gruesomeness as well as its unabashedly racist portrait of indigenous folks it purports to sympathize with real indigenous peoples in brazil whose names were used in film yanomamo and shamatari are not fierce enemies as portrayed in film nor is either tribe truly cannibalistic although yanomamo do partake in a form of post mortem ritual cannibalism actual savages involved with cannibal holocaust are ones behind camera robert firsching of allmovie made similar criticisms of film s content saying while film is undoubtedly gruesome enough to satisfy fans its mixture of nauseating mondo animal slaughter repulsive sexual violence and pie faced attempts at socially conscious moralizing make it rather distasteful morally as well slant magazine s eric henderson said it is artful enough to demand serious critical consideration yet foul enough to christen you a pervert for even bothering in recent years cannibal holocaust has received accolades in various publications as well as a cult following review aggregation website rotten tomatoes gives a score of 65 based on 17 reviews with a weighted average of 5 1 10 british film magazine total film ranked cannibal holocaust as tenth greatest horror film of all time and film was included in a similar list of top 25 horror films compiled by wired film also came in eighth on ign s list of ten greatest grindhouse films holocaust is seen by some critics as social commentary on various aspects of modern civilization by comparing western society to that of cannibals david carter says cannibal holocaust is not merely focused on societal taboo of flesh eating greater theme of film is difference between civilized and uncivilized though graphic violence can be hard for most to stomach most disturbing aspect of film is what deodato is saying about modern society film asks questions what is it to be civilized and is it a good thing mark goodall author of sweet savage world through film lens also contends film s message is rape of natural world by unnatural exploitation of primitive cultures for western entertainment deodato s intentions regarding italian media coverage of red brigades have also fallen under critical examination and has been expanded to include all sensationalism carter explores this claiming that lack of journalistic integrity is shown through interaction between professor monroe and news agency that had backed documentary crew they continually push monroe to finish editing footage because blood and guts equal ratings lloyd kaufman claims that this form of exploitative journalism can still be seen in media today and in programming such as reality television goodall and film historians david slater and david kerekes have also suggested that deodato was attempting to comment on documentary works of antonio climati with his film despite these interpretations deodato has said in interviews that he had no intentions in cannibal holocaust but to make a film about cannibals actor luca barbareschi asserts this as well and believes that deodato only uses his films to put on a show robert kerman contradicts these assertions however stating that deodato did tell him of political concerns involving media in making of this film these interpretations have also been criticized as hypocritical and poor justification for film s content as cannibal holocaust itself is highly sensationalized firsching claims that fact that film s sole spokesperson for anti exploitation perspective is played by porn star robert kerman should give an indication of where its sympathies lie while schager says deodato is pathetically justifying unrepentant carnage by posthumously damning his eaten filmmaker protagonists with a who are real monsters cannibals or us anti imperialism morale controversy since its original release cannibal holocaust has been target of censorship by moral and animal activists other than graphic gore film contains several scenes of sexual violence and genuine cruelty to animals issues which find cannibal holocaust in midst of controversy to this day due to this notoriety cannibal holocaust has been marketed as having been banned in over 50 countries in 2006 entertainment weekly magazine named cannibal holocaust as 6th most controversial film of all time snuff film allegations ten days after its premiere in milan cannibal holocaust was confiscated under orders of a local magistrate sumner don horror movie freak p 189 krause publications 2010 and ruggero deodato was arrested and charged with obscenity as all copies were to be turned over to authorities film was released in other countries like united kingdom via subterfuge in january 1981 during film s theatrical run in france magazine photo suggested that certain deaths depicted in film were real which would have made cannibal holocaust a snuff film king geoff spectacle of real from hollywood to reality tv and beyond intellect ltd 2005 following publication of photo article charges against deodato were amended to include murder courts believed that actors who portrayed missing film crew and native actress featured in impalement scene were killed for camera right thumb film s impalement scene was one of several scenes examined by courts to determine whether violence depicted was staged or genuine compounding matters was fact that supposedly deceased actors had signed contracts with production which ensured that they would not appear in any type of media motion pictures or commercials for one year following film s release this was done in order to promote idea that cannibal holocaust was truly recovered footage of missing documentarians during subsequent court proceedings questions arose as to why actors were in no other media if they were alive as deodato claimed to prove his innocence deodato had luca barbareschi get in contact with other three actors and four of them were interviewed for an italian television show deodato also explained in court how special effect in impalement scene was achieved a bicycle seat was attached to end of an iron pole upon which actress sat she then held a short length of balsa wood in her mouth and looked skyward thus giving appearance of impalement deodato also provided court with pictures of girl interacting with crew after scene had been filmed after they were presented with this evidence courts dropped all murder charges against deodato censorship although snuff film allegations were disproven italian courts decided to ban cannibal holocaust due to genuine animal slayings citing animal cruelty laws deodato franco palaggi franco di nunzio gianfranco clerici producer alda pia and united artists europa representative sandro perotti each received a four month suspended sentence after they were all convicted of obscenity and violence deodato fought in courts for three additional years to get his film in 1984 courts ruled in favor of deodato and cannibal holocaust was granted a rating certificate of for a cut print it would later be re released uncut perhaps as a result of this united artists no longer holds film s rights in italy cannibal holocaust also faced censorship issues in other countries around world in 1981 video releases were not required to pass before british board of film censors bbfc which had power to ban films in united kingdom cannibal holocaust was released straight to video there thus avoiding possible banning of film in 1983 director of public prosecutions compiled a list of 72 video releases that were not brought before bbfc for certification and declared them prosecutable for obscenity this list of video nasties included cannibal holocaust which was successfully prosecuted and banned film was not approved for release in uk until 2001 albeit with nearly six minutes of mandated cuts in 2011 bbfc waived all but one of these previous edits and passed cannibal holocaust with fifteen seconds of cuts it was determined that only scene that breached bbfc s guidelines was killing of a coatimundi and bbfc acknowledged that previous cuts were reactionary to film s reputation film was also banned in australia united states norway finland iceland new zealand singapore and several other countries in or before 1984 movie was later released in us by exploitation distributor trans american films in 1985 it should be noted however that movie was oddly enough released in us without a rating in 2005 office of film and literature classification in australia lifted ban passing cannibal holocaust with an r18 rating for uncut print including consumer advice high level sexual violence high level violence animal cruelty in 2006 film was rejected for classification and banned in its entirety by oflc in new zealand cuts to retain an r18 classification were offered by office but they were eventually refused animal cruelty many of censorship issues with cannibal holocaust concern on screen killings of animals deodato himself has condemned his past actions saying i was stupid to introduce animals although six animal deaths appear onscreen seven animals were killed for production as scene depicting monkey s death was shot twice resulting in death of two monkeys both of animals were eaten by indigenous cast members who consider monkey brains a delicacy animals that were killed onscreen were a coati mistaken for a muskrat in film killed with a knife a large turtle decapitated and its limbs shell and entrails removed a tarantula killed with a machete a boa constrictor also killed with a machete a squirrel monkey decapitated with a machete a pig shot in head with a 22 caliber rifle at point blank range film historian andrew devos has argued that animal deaths have been harshly condemned because of film s classification as exploitation whereas animal mutilations in films perceived by critics to be classics or art films are often ignored devos cites several examples of this double standard including rules of game el topo wake in fright and apocalypse now bbfc made a similar conclusion regarding censorship of scenes in which deaths were quick and painless noting removing these sequences would be inconsistent with bbfc s decisions to permit quick clean kills in several other films such as apocalypse now holocaust was innovative in its plot structure specifically with concept of found footage being brought back to civilization and later viewed to determine fate of crew that shot it this was later popularized as a distinct style in hollywood cinema by last broadcast and blair witch project both of which use similar storytelling devices each film uses idea of a lost film team making a documentary in wilderness and their footage returned advertisements for blair witch project also promoted idea that footage is genuine deodato has acknowledged similarities between his film and blair witch project and though he holds no malice against producers he is frustrated at publicity that blair witch project received for being an original production producers of last broadcast have denied that cannibal holocaust was a major influence nonetheless film was cited by director paco plaza as a source of inspiration for found footage films rec and rec 2 cannibal holocaust has been regarded as apex of cannibal genre and it bears similarities to subsequent cannibal films made during same time period cannibal ferox also stars kerman and pirkanen and star giovanni lombardo radice says it was made based on success of cannibal holocaust cannibal ferox has also been noted as containing similar themes to cannibal holocaust such as comparison of western violence to perceived uncivilized cultures and anti imperialism in a mixed review film journalist jay slater claims certainly a tough customer cannibal ferox still fails where deodato succeeds lenzi attempts to tackle cultural defilement and racial issues but cannibal ferox is nothing more than a shoddy exercise in sadism and animal cruelty reviewer andrew parkinson also notes at end there is a basic attempt to validate cannibal ferox posing that old chestnut of whether civilised man is actually more savage than uncivilised tribespeople right thumb 250px ruggero deodato with eli roth on set of hostel part ii 2007 unofficial sequels to cannibal holocaust were produced in years following its release titles of these films were changed following their original theatrical releases in order to associate film with cannibal holocaust in different markets in 1985 mario directed bianche in which was also released as cannibal holocaust 2 catherine miles story in addition to new title slater notes similarities between score in catherine miles story and riz ortolani s score in cannibal holocaust previously known for his work in mondo films antonio climati directed natura contro in 1988 which was released as cannibal holocaust ii in united kingdom in 2005 deodato announced that he planned to make a companion piece to cannibal holocaust entitled cannibals deodato was originally hesitant about directing his new film as he thought that he would make it too violent for american audiences however while he was in prague filming his cameo appearance in hostel part ii for eli roth deodato viewed hostel and decided that he would direct after all citing it as a similarly violent film that was given a mainstream release in america although screenplay written by christine was completed a financial conflict between deodato and film s producer led to project s cancellation in 2013 roth directed green inferno which takes its title from fictional documentary produced in cannibal holocaust roth s film was intended as an homage to cannibal holocaust and other cannibal films from same era film s influence has extended to other media as well in 2001 death metal band released a song entitled cannibal holocaust from eponymous record alternate versions due to its graphic content there are several different versions of cannibal holocaust in circulation which are edited to varying degrees in uk film was originally released on vhs by go video in 1982 with approximately six minutes of cuts these cuts were self imposed by distributor possibly due to technical limitations of tape in 2001 film was passed for release on dvd by bbfc with 5 minutes and 44 seconds of cuts to remove scenes of animal cruelty and sexual violence all but 15 seconds of these cuts were waived for a re release in 2011 latter release also includes a new edit sponsored by deodato which reduces violence toward animals american dvds and blu ray released by grindhouse releasing contains an animal cruelty free version of film that cuts out six animal deaths other versions also contain alternative footage shot specifically for middle eastern markets that does not depict nudity there are multiple versions of last road to hell segment of film which causes variances even among uncensored releases an extended version of last road to hell includes approximately ten seconds of footage not seen in an alternative shorter version this additional footage includes a wide angle shot of firing squad executions a close up of a dead victim and extended footage of bodies being carried into back of a truck longer version also includes different titles that correctly name
