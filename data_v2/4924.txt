was conceived by osamu sato a japanese multimedia artist sato started his art career in photography and writing music in 1980s before turning to digital graphic design and computer art in 1990s he began experimenting with cd rom technology creating animated 3d videos with a dimension of interactivity although these projects resembled video games sato s intent was not to create games but to use game platforms as a means of creating contemporary works of art sato s first such project was funded by sony music entertainment japan and released in 1994 titled eastern mind lost souls of tong nou it was released in japan and united states because eastern mind was released in united states and received some awards sato was able to source funding for his next project which would become lsd sato still rejected idea of video games and wanted to use playstation game console as a medium for creating art and music he chose playstation as a platform because he felt sony was already embracing elaborate concepts while he felt sega and nintendo had greater reputations as toy companies sato got idea for lsd after playing racing games he found racing games difficult and boring since he was not a skilled player and so he imagined possibilities of smashing car into a wall and transporting player to another dimension he thought it would be more enjoyable for players like him that were unskilled at other games from there he got idea of creating an imaginary world with same irrationality and easily forgettable nature as dreams he did not give game any objectives because according to him they are not essential in video games because even natural human existence cannot be reduced to simple objectives for inspiration sato pulled ideas from a dream diary written by hiroko nishikawa a game designer at asmik ace entertainment who had been writing in diary for about a decade sato also placed many gimmicks in game such as sudden game overs odd videos and strange texts as sato is also a musician he composed game s soundtrack using samples to create around 500 musical patterns he felt this approach more closely resembled chaos of a dream state in contrast to full drawn out melodies he was particularly influenced from music coming out of england s warp record label initially he was going to include more pentatonic scales and melodies to give game an asian flair but he came to realize this was not necessary after seeing international success of japanese producers like ken ishii who was later featured on a remix soundtrack featuring some of game s music title lsd is a reference to drug of same name lysergic acid diethylamide in a bid to attract hippie and psychedelic subcultures acronym was not given any single interpretation in game instead there were many interpretations in game such as in life sensuous dream and in limbo silent dream sato felt this represented chaos and confusion of dreams release game was released in japan on october 22 1998 sato had hoped for an american release as with eastern mind but he had no say in further localization lsd sold few copies and now is rare to find on secondary markets selling for high prices when it becomes listed for sale it was re released on japanese playstation store on august 11 2010 lsd was released as a standalone game and in a limited edition set which came with a bonus cd titled lucy in sky with and a book called lovely sweet dream cd contains about an hour of acid techno music and book is composed of excerpts from nishikawa s dream diary book has english translations of many dreams and illustrations provided by a wide variety of artists sato was adamant about releasing a special soundtrack so a double disc soundtrack compilation titled lsd and remixes was issued alongside game and features remixes by ken ishii jimi tenor u ziq and morgan geist among others legacy lsd dream emulator quickly fell into obscurity after release due to its limited availability and eccentric nature of its content this led to it gaining an avid cult following in following years its growing interest among western audiences years after its release is a mystery to sato motherboard wrote that its popularity is due to internet primarily from appearances on humor blogs like cracked com and youtube let s play video curators who feed off game s quirky qualities hardcore gaming 101 concluded that
