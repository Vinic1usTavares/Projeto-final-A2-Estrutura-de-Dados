harrya chromapes commonly known as yellowfoot bolete or chrome footed bolete is species of bolete fungus in family boletaceae bolete is found in eastern north america costa rica and eastern asia where it grows on ground in a mycorrhizal association with deciduous and coniferous trees fruit bodies have smooth rose pink caps that are initially convex before flattening out pores on cap undersurface are white aging to a pale pink as spores mature thick stipe has fine pink or reddish dots scabers and is white to pinkish but with a bright yellow base mushrooms are edible but are popular with insects and so they are often infested with maggots in its taxonomic history harrya chromapes has been shuffled to several different genera including boletus leccinum and tylopilus and is known in field guides as a member of one of these genera in 2012 it was transferred to newly created genus harrya when it was established that morphological and molecular evidence demonstrated its distinctness from genera in which it had formerly been placed taxonomy species was first described scientifically by american mycologist charles christopher frost as boletus chromapes cataloging bolete fungi of new england frost published 22 new bolete species in that 1874 publication rolf singer placed species in leccinum in 1947 due to scabrous dots on stipe even though spore print color was not typical of that genus in 1968 alexander h smith and harry delbert thiers thought that tylopilus was a more appropriate fit as they believed pinkish brown spore print characteristic of that genus to be of greater taxonomic significance other genera to which it has been shuffled in its taxonomic history include ceriomyces by william alphonso murrill in 1909 and krombholzia by rolf singer in 1942 ceriomyces and krombholzia have since been subsumed into boletus and leccinum respectively additional synonyms include tylopilus described by wolfe in 1993 and a later combination based on this name leccinum molecular analysis of large subunit ribosomal dna and translation elongation factor 1a showed that species belonged to a unique lineage in family boletaceae and genus harrya was circumscribed to contain both it as type species and newly described h atriceps javan species referred to tylopilus are sister to harrya lineage specific epithet chromapes is latin for yellow foot it is commonly known as yellowfoot bolete or chrome footed bolete description fruit bodies have caps that are initially convex before flattening out in maturity reaching diameters between cap surface is dry to slightly sticky it is initially pink to rose colored fading to tan or pinkish tan in maturity cap margin may curl upward in maturity flesh is white and does not stain blue when it is bruised or injured an important diagnostic feature of many bolete species it does not have any distinct odor or taste pore surface is initially white before becoming pinkish to flesh colored in age individual pores are circular to angular numbering two or three per millimeter while tubes are long tubes near top of stipe are depressed and almost free from attachment stipe measures long by thick and is equal in width throughout its length or with a slight taper in either direction stipe surface has a scurfy texture from scabers that are colored white pink or reddish underlying surface color is white or pinkish except for yellow base mushrooms are edible and good but popular with insects and so are often infested with maggots thumb left spores are smooth and translucent measuring up to 17 um long spore print has been reported as ranging in color from pinkish to pinkish brown to rosy brown to vinaceous fawn variation in spore print color results in part from differences in moisture content when recorded spores are roughly oblong to oval smooth hyaline translucent to pale brown and measure 11 17 by 4 5 5 um they are covered in a gelatinous sheath basidia spore bearing cells are club shaped two and four spored thin walled and measure 25 35 by 10 14 um pleurocystidia found on tube walls are roughly cylindrical to fuse shaped with rounded tips and measure 37 50 by 5 8 um cheilocystidia on tube edges are fuse shaped with a central swelling thin walled and measure 23 40 by 6 8 um caulocystidia at top of stipe have various shapes and dimensions of 25 45 by 10 15 um at stipe base caulocystidia are 30 40 by 7 23 um and are mostly club shaped to roughly spherical to tear shaped cap cuticle comprises a single layer of tangled hyphae that are 4 6 um thick several chemical tests can be used to confirm identify of mushroom a drop of ferrous sulfate feso4 on flesh turns it greenish while potassium hydroxide koh turns it brown cap cuticle turns yellow with nitric acid hno3 and yellow with ammonium hydroxide nh4oh similar species fruit bodies of harrya chromapes are readily identified in field by their rosy color bright yellow stipe base and reddish scabers on stipe tylopilus is a similar species found in australia tylopilus has a more orangish cap and lacks distinctive chrome yellow stipe base harrya atriceps is a closely related rare species from costa rica in contrast to its more common relative it lacks reddish color in its stipe scabers and has a black cap although it has a similar yellow stipe base habitat and distribution harrya chromapes is an ectomycorrhizal species and its fruit bodies grow singly to scattered on soil they are usually found in forests containing conifers betulaceae and oak in north america north american distribution includes eastern canada south to georgia and alabama including mexico it extends west to michigan and mississippi fruit season extends from late spring to late summer in costa rica where species associates with oak it has been recorded from cordillera talamanca poas and irazu volcano it is also in guatemala in asia it is known from india west bengal taiwan japan and in china where it associates with trees from beech and pine families fruit bodies can be parasitized by molds sepedonium ampullosporum s and s in sepedonium infections a white to powdery yellow mold covers surface of fruit body mushrooms are a food source and rearing habitat for several insect species including fungus gnats and m and flies such as pegomya winthemi and species of genera and cottontail rabbit species sylvilagus brasiliensis has been recorded feeding on mushrooms in costa rica see also list of north american boletes references external links category boletaceae category edible fungi category fungi described in 1874 category
