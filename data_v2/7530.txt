succeeded his father as king of dublin in 934 and succeeded in establishing dominance over vikings of limerick when he captured their king amlaib cenncairech in 937 that same year he allied with constantine ii of scotland in an attempt to reclaim kingdom of northumbria which his father had ruled briefly in 927 forces of olaf and constantine were defeated by english led by aethelstan at battle of brunanburh in 937 olaf returned to ireland in 938 but after aethelstan s death following year olaf left for york where he was quickly able to establish himself as king with his brother blacaire mac gofraid being left to rule in dublin olaf and aethelstan s successor edmund met in 939 at leicester where they came to an agreement regarding division of england between them this agreement proved short lived however and within a few years vikings had occupied five boroughs of derby leicester lincoln nottingham and stamford olaf died in 941 and was succeeded in northumbria by his cousin olaf cuaran at time of his death irish annals title him king of danes and king of fair foreigners and dark foreigners biography olaf first conclusively appears in contemporary records in 933 when annals describe him plundering armagh on 10 november hudson 2004 he is then recorded as allying with mac aeda of ulaid and raiding as far as sliabh where they were met by an army led by muirchertach mac neill of ailech and lost 240 men in ensuing battle along with much of their plunder an earlier reference to a son of gofraid who plundered monastery at kildare in 928 might refer to olaf but no name is given downham 2007 pp 243 244 olaf s father gofraid ua imair king of dublin died in 934 and olaf succeeded him as king cannon 2009 p 479 following year olaf carried out a raid at crannog in county meath and then looted burial chamber at knowth following week olaf is described as lord of foreigners by annals of four masters in 937 annals of four masters s a 937 at which time he went to lough ree and captured amlaib cenncairech king of limerick and his troops after breaking their boats this conflict can be ascribed to rivalry between competing viking settlements of dublin and limerick with this event marking victory for dublin this period is considered to be high point of viking influence in ireland downham 2007 pp 41 42 having secured his position in ireland olaf turned his attention to england and northumbria which had once been ruled by olaf s father and had been conquered in 927 by aethelstan of england olaf allied with constantine ii of scotland whose kingdom had been invaded by aethelstan in 934 and in 937 same year as victory over limerick olaf and vikings of dublin left for england downham 2007 p 104 106 allied forces of olaf and constantine met forces of aethelstan at battle of brunanburh at a site which is subject of much debate although current scholarly consensus identifies site as bromborough in cheshire roffe 2012 p 120 olaf and constantine commanded viking troops while aethelstan alongside his brother edmund led english troops into battle contemporary accounts indicate both sides suffered many casualties but result was a decisive english victory olaf and constantine survived battle and returned to ireland and scotland respectively however one of constantine s sons died battle is well attested with references in irish chronicles and a poetic telling of battle in anglo saxon chronicle annals of four masters s a 1861 pp 86 88 numerous references to it in various chronicles throughout british isles testify to its perceived importance at time annals record olaf s return to ireland in 938 as well as a raid he carried out that year on kilcullen in modern day county kildare where he is said to have taken a thousand prisoners aethelstan died in october 939 and very soon afterwards olaf left for york where he was able to quickly establish himself as king of northumbria olaf was joined in england by his cousin olaf cuaran and olaf s brother blacaire was left to rule in dublin while he was away forte oram and pedersen 2005 p 2007 pp 107 110 symeon of durham s historia regum records that olaf and new english king edmund met at leicester in 939 and came to an agreement on dividing england between two of them harper bill 1998 pp 23 24 n 155 this peace was short lived and within a few years of agreement vikings had seized five boroughs of derby leicester lincoln nottingham and stamford in 941 chronicle of melrose records that olaf raided an ancient anglian church at tyninghame in what is now scottish borders and at time was a part of northumbria stevenson 1853 p 2001 p 357 this attack may have been more than just a raid and may have been intended to secure a route through scotland upon which communication between york and dublin was reliant forte oram and pedersen 2005 p 111 olaf died in 941 and he was succeeded in northumbria by olaf cuaran in recording his death annals title him king of danes chronicon scotorum and king of fair foreigners and dark foreigners annals of clonmacnoise chronicon scotorum s a 1896 p 152 burial in 2005 a skeleton was excavated in an archaeological dig at auldhame east lothian grave goods including a belt similar to others known to have been worn in viking age ireland indicate that skeleton belonged to a high status individual presence of such goods and age of skeleton has led to speculation among historians and archaeologists that remains could be those of olaf olaf is known to have conducted raids on auldhame and tyninghame shortly before his death in 941 auldhame and tyninghame were two of several local churches dedicated to saint baldred according to alex woolf although skeleton cannot be definitively identified with olaf date and nature of burial make it very likely deceased individual died as a consequence of olaf s attacks in area in 941 woolf has also suggested that there is a strong likelihood that king s followers hoped that by burying him in saint s cemetery he might have benefitted from some sort of post mortem penance family olaf s father is identifiable as gofraid who was king of dublin between 920 and 934 and also briefly ruled northumbria in 927 downham 2007 p 2004 gofraid was a grandson of imar but no patronymic is given in original sources this may be because he was a child of a son of imar who never ruled dublin or he was a child of a daughter of imar which in either case would mean his legitimacy to rule in eyes of his contemporaries was dependent on identity of his grandfather not his parents downham 2007 p 33 34 imar possibly identical to ivar boneless was founder of ui imair and was one of earliest kings of dublin in mid ninth century bartlett and jeffrey 1997 p 44 three other individuals are identifiable as sons of gofraid albann blacaire and ragnall albann was killed in battle against muirchertach mac neill in 926 downham 2007 p 238 blacaire ruled dublin from 939 onwards and ragnall mac gofraid ruled northumbria in 943 and 944 probably along with his cousin olaf cuaran until they were driven out by edmund i of england downham 2007 pp 111 112 john of worcester writing in twelfth century claimed that olaf had married a daughter of constantine ii of scotland prior to 937 but this evidence is considered unreliable downham 2007 p 150 thirteenth century chronicler roger of wendover wrote that olaf married daughter of a northumbrian earl called orm as a consequence of agreement at leicester between olaf and king edmund harper bill 1998 pp 25 26 n 166 an individual named camman mac amlaib is identifiable as a son of olaf annals of ulster record he was defeated at a place called dub in 960 camman may have been one of meic amlaib sons of olaf who annals of four masters mention in 962 annals of ulster s a 2007 p 2007 p of four masters s a 962 according to this account sons of olaf and lawmen came to ireland and plundered and howth afterward lawmen went to munster to avenge their brother they continued plunder there and were defeated by irish in ui where 365 of them died in same year an unnamed son of olaf led a raid from ireland s eye on anglesey and britain camman may be identical to sitriuc cam an individual who in 962 made a naval attack on ui but was forced to flee back to ships after a force of dubliners and leinstermen overtook him and slaughtered some of his men downham 2007 p 269 an individual named gofraid mac amlaib recorded by annals as dying in 963 may have been a son of olaf or he may have been a son of olaf cuaran downham 2007 p 253 annals of clonmacnoise list
