all time these plans did not come to fruition nor did a december 2009 claim by onerepublic frontman ryan tedder that he had been recruited by glees music supervisor adam anders to write an original song for series murphy later stated that he planned to showcase original music during second season aiming to find a way for this to occur organically as it wouldn t work before if they just broke out

upon its initial airing james poniewozik of time called it a solid episode and wrote that it did well by a couple of ongoing relationship stories amy reiter of los angeles times opined that it delivered several long anticipated moments and several more we only wish we d thought to anticipate mark perigard of boston herald deemed it a great episode filled with many great moments robert canning of ign rated it 8 10 signifying a great episode sandra gonzalez of entertainment weekly praised development of original song and wrote one great thing about episode was that after last week s plot bomb filled episode show didn t completely abandon what we d learned that week emily vanderwerff of a v club graded it b she noted that she enjoyed scenes but criticized show for its inconsistency brett berk of vanity fair praised episode for not only retreating into series s standard flailing everybody in pool narrative template or filling this metaphorical slough with more leaden tropes than richard serra circa 1968 but by having results be precisely we all knew would occur akash nikolas at zap2it praised new song and its performance as a metaphor for show new directions flashed glee s trademark l sign which show has renamed as something cool and instead of cups full of slush that s usually thrown at glee club cups were filled with red confetti and thrown at audience this neat moment captured show s conceit taking something ugly and oppressive and turning it into something beautiful and celebratory guest performances made by kathy griffin and loretta devine were met with mixed reception from several critics amy reiter was more critical on griffin s performance as tammy jean albertson and noted while kathy griffin was sight gag funny as local tea party candidate tammy jean albertson her lines fell a bit flat she went on to praise devine s performance as sister mary constance saying that her lines totally hit bull s eye robert canning praised both performances saying that it was best part of episode he continued i love how guest judge segments of these contest episodes are beginning to become mini series unto themselves i hope that tradition continues james poniewozik had mixed feelings regarding griffin s performance he went on to write glee can be sharp and topical enough that i thought it could actually do something clever with much publicized cameo instead performance hinged on expected gags and griffin delivered it all with a stiffness that felt more like a recitation than a performance emily vanderwerff reacted negatively to both performances in her review of episode she opined that judges scene was a pale retread of original only this time it had kathy griffin and loretta devine as well as a bunch of tired tea party gags that were tired when this episode was written kurt blaine storyline was met with general acclaim from critics in her review for episode katie morgan of billboard reacted positively to interaction between kurt and blaine she wrote it sure took them long enough but we re so glad to finally see kurt happy in his review mark perigard opined it was utterly sweetly romantic and criss sold hell out of moment it s long overdue and it will silence growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with pace of this story and why kurt always seemed to be stuck in pure misery robert canning was more critical on storyline he highly criticized darren criss performance as blaine in a detailed review regarding storyline canning wrote kurt finally got first kiss he deserved too bad it came from wooden glass eyed blaine chris colfer has been in running for performance awards for good reason darren criss will not be colfer and his character deserve better than cardboard unemotional declaration of love that criss delivered yay for kurt and his first boyfriend but that was a bland work up to their kiss sandra gonzalez called whole development simply perfect kevin fallon of atlantic thought kiss was sweet and stated that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever james poniewozik reacted positively to storyline in his review poniewozik wrote as for at long last kiss it s to glee s credit that it made me think finally blaine and kurt are locking lips already before it made me think look an honest to god gay kiss between two men on my primetime tv show aly semigran of mtv praised interaction between kurt and blaine saying that kiss scene was a sweet real and shockingly un hyped moment semigran went on to praise acting in scene saying that both actors handled it with dignity and honesty brett berk deemed interaction to be appropriately fervid music and performances songs may not have been familiar but new directions gave it all they had in their quest to win regionals trophy with verve and creativity in original song in doing so they hit refresh on their songbook and won not by mimicking others hits but performing music they made on their own and they were pretty darn good raymund flandez of wall street journal on new direction s performance of loser like me musical performances and selection in episode were met with mixed response from critics original track loser like me received general acclaim from critics berk praised performance and gave it four stars he opined all four stars are for lyrics in which lovable dorks sing about being lovable dorks we fell in love with in her review for episode erica futterman of rolling stone praised song and called it a true anthem that ends triumphantly raymond flandez of wall street journal gave a positive review of song song grew out of a collaborative brainstorming session that went beyond rhyming dictionaries or first attempts at ditties such as trouty mouth big ass heart and hell to no jarrett wieselman of new york post commended show for use of original songs and wrote glee entered uncharted territory last night no not kurt s first kiss i m talking about new directions dabbling in and debuting their very first original songs it was as risky for show as it was for group since opting to perform wholly new creations would either give them a leg up on competition or put them six feet under bobby hankinson of houston chronicle praised song and deemed it fun and summery thumb left 145px several critics praised vocal performance of lea michele pictured as rachel in episode as well as development of character sandra gonzalez of entertainment weekly was generally positive on most of songs featured in episode she gave performance of loser like me a b and explained that this one took a little time to grow on me i liked it better on show than when i heard it by itself which is weird because it s exactly same thing goes to show how much of a difference a good performance makes gonzalez gave highest grade to cover versions of misery and raise your glass both performed by dalton academy warblers in her review for misery she praised performance and gave it an a she opined i m a sucker for a warbler ized pop song especially when it makes blaine dance and make his weird animated faces they re simply adorable and these warblers are simply amazing gonzalez gave performance of raise your glass an a lowest grade given by gonzalez was a d for santana s performance of trouty mouth she explained if we re taking this song as a joke it gets a b because santana sounded great but i think about how bad i felt for sam watching his utter mortification candles was generally well received by gonzalez she gave performance a b and went on to write it s really hard for this pair to live up to awesomeness of baby it s cold outside i m sure they could one day but this one fell a bit short for me musically in context of show however it was a great moment amy reiter of los angeles times reacted positively to all of songs in her review for original song reiter opined that original songs weren t half bad from santana s ode to poor horrified sam trouty mouth to puck s tribute to lauren big ass heart to mercedes self celebrating hell to no original songs on this episode were funny and revealing and rousing regionals winning anthem loser like me landed like an exuberant slushy in face katie morgan of billboard praised performance of candles and called it beautifully intimate and commended warblers solid performance todd of a v club responded negatively to trouty mouth but was generally pleased with other songs vanderwerff went on to praise voice of lea michele first song rachel sang at regionals was a nicely done little ballad sort of song you could both see someone like rachel writing and later belting james poniewozik also praised voice of michele as well as her character development he opined that said i like arc of rachel as songwriter which has played to some of lea michele s greatest strengths both as a comic and dramatic actress robert canning of ign found original songs to be hilarious he opined getting to run through a series of comical and catchy false starts was entertaining santana s trouty mouth was sultry and hilarious puckerman s rocking ode to lauren big ass heart was also a ridiculous treat and then both were outdone by mercedes stomping amy winehouse aping hell to no chart history seven of eleven songs featured on episode charted on several popular musical charts in united states loser like
