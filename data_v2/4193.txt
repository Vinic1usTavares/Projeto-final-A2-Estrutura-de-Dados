harold adams innis november 5 1894 november 8 1952 was a canadian professor of political economy at university of toronto and author of seminal works on media communication theory and canadian economic history despite his dense and difficult prose innis was one of canada s most original thinkers he helped develop staples thesis which holds that canada s culture political history and economy have been decisively influenced by exploitation and export of a series of staples such as fur fishing lumber wheat mined metals and coal staple thesis dominated economic history in canada 1930s 1960s

inspiration for future members of school marshall mcluhan and edmund snow carpenter innis laid basis for scholarship that looked at social sciences from a distinctly canadian point of view as head of university of toronto s political economy department he worked to build up a cadre of canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on british or american trained

subservient colony to its much more powerful southern neighbor we are indeed fighting for our lives he warned pointing especially to pernicious influence of american advertising we can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against american imperialism in all its attractive guises his views influenced some younger scholars including donald creighton innis also tried to defend

named him herald hoping he would become a minister in strict evangelical baptist faith that she and her husband william shared at time baptist church was an important part of life in rural areas it

innis became an agnostic in later life but never lost his interest in religion babe robert canadian communication thought ten foundational writers university of toronto press p 51 according to his friend and biographer donald creighton innis s character was moulded by church strict sense of values and feeling of devotion to a cause which became so characteristic of him in later life were derived in part at least from instruction imparted so zealously and unquestioningly inside severely unadorned walls of baptist church at otterville creighton p 19 innis attended one room schoolhouse in otterville and community s high school he travelled by train to woodstock ontario to complete his secondary education at a baptist run college he intended to become a public school teacher and passed entrance examinations for teacher training but decided to take a year off to earn money he would need to support himself at an ontario teachers college at age 18 therefore he returned to one room schoolhouse at otterville to teach for one term until local school board could recruit a fully qualified teacher experience made him realize that life of a teacher in a small rural school was not for him creighton pp 18 19 university studies thumb right original home of mcmaster university at 273 bloor street west toronto in october 1913 innis started classes at mcmaster university then in toronto mcmaster was a natural choice for him because it was a baptist university and many students who attended woodstock college went there mcmaster s liberal arts professors encouraged critical thinking and debate watson pp 64 68 innis was especially influenced by james ten broeke university s one man philosophy department ten broeke posed an essay question that innis pondered for rest of his life why do we attend to things to which we attend watson p 326 innis refers to this question in preface to bias of communication his book of essays on consciousness and communication before his final undergraduate year at mcmaster innis spent a summer teaching at northern star school in frontier farming community of near vermilion alberta experience gave him a sense of vastness of canada he also learned about western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs creighton pp 26 27 in his final undergraduate year innis focused on history and economics he kept in mind

don t think i would go trench warfare with its mud and lice and rats had a devastating effect on him quoted from a later innis letter by creighton p 107 innis s role as an artillery signaller gave him

hospital treatment in england watson p 70 innis s war was over his biographer john watson notes physical wound took seven years to heal but psychological damage lasted a lifetime innis suffered recurring bouts of depression and nervous exhaustion because of his military service watson also notes that great war influenced innis s intellectual outlook it strengthened his canadian nationalism sharpened his opinion of what he thought were destructive effects of technology including communications media that were used so effectively to sell war and led him for first time to doubt his baptist faith watson pp 68 117 graduate studies mcmaster and chicago harold innis completed a master of arts at mcmaster graduating in april 1918 his thesis called returned soldier was a detailed description

in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist economics faculty at chicago questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories then in vogue arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies watson p 111 innis was influenced by university s two eminent communications scholars george herbert mead and robert e park although he did not attend any of these famous professors classes innis did absorb their idea that communication involved much more than transmission of information james w carey writes that mead and park characterized communication as entire process whereby a culture is brought into existence maintained in time and sedimented into institutions carey j w 1992 space time and communications a tribute to harold innis in communication as culture essays on media and society new york routledge p 144 while at chicago innis was exposed to ideas of thorstein veblen iconoclastic thinker who drew on his deep knowledge of philosophy and economics to write scathing critiques of contemporary thought and culture veblen had left chicago years before but his ideas were still strongly felt there years later in an essay on veblen innis praised him for waging war against standardized static economics in this 1929 essay innis concluded veblen has waged a constructive warfare of emancipation against tendency toward standardized static economics which becomes so dangerous on a continent with ever increasing numbers of students clamouring for textbooks on final economic theory this essay was republished in

pacific railway at craigellachie bc november 7 1885 harold innis wrote his phd thesis on history of canadian pacific railway cpr completion of canada s first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a defining moment in canadian history innis s thesis eventually published as a book in 1923 can be seen as an early attempt to document railway s significance from an economic historian s point of view it uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments innis maintains that difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of american annexation of canadian west heyer pp 6 7 innis argues that history of canadian pacific railroad is primarily history of spread of western civilization over northern half of north american continent innis harold 1971 a history of canadian pacific railway revised ed toronto university of toronto press p 287 as robert babe notes railway brought industrialization transporting coal and building supplies to manufacturing sites it was also a kind of communications medium that contributed to spread of european civilization babe writes that for innis cpr s equipment comprised a massive energy consuming fast moving powerful capital intensive sign dropped into very midst of indigenous peoples whose entire way of life was disrupted and eventually shattered as a result babe p 62 communications scholar arthur kroker argues that innis s study of canadian pacific railway was only first in which he attempted to demonstrate that technology is not something external to canadian being but on contrary is necessary condition and lasting consequence of canadian existence kroker arthur 1984 technology and canadian mind innis mcluhan grant montreal new world perspectives p 94 it also reflected innis s lifelong interest in exercise of economic and political power his cpr history ends for example with a recounting of western grievances against economic policies such as high freight rates and steep import tariffs designed to protect fledgling canadian manufacturers westerners complained that this national policy funnelled money from prairie farmers into pockets of eastern business establishment western canada innis wrote has paid for development of canadian nationality and it would appear that it must continue to pay acquisitiveness of eastern canada shows little sign of abatement innis pp 290 94 staples thesis harold innis is considered leading founder of a canadian school of economic thought known as staples theory it holds that canada s culture political history and economy have been decisively shaped by exploitation and export of a series of staples such as fur fish wood wheat mined metals and fossil fuels innis theorized that this reliance on exporting natural resources made canada dependent on more industrially advanced countries and resulted in periodic disruptions to economic life as international demand for staples rose and fell as staple itself became increasingly scarce and as technological change resulted in shifts from one staple to others innis pointed out for example that as furs became scarce and trade in that staple declined it became necessary to develop and export other staples such as wheat potash and especially lumber export of these new staples was made possible through improved transportation networks that included first canals and later railways dirt research in 1920 innis joined department of political economy at university of toronto he was assigned to teach courses in commerce economic history and economic theory he decided to focus his scholarly research on canadian economic history a hugely neglected subject and he settled on fur trade as his first area of study furs had brought french and english traders to canada motivating them to travel west along continent s interlocking lake and river systems to pacific coast innis realized that he would not only need to search out archival documents to understand history of fur trade but would also have to travel country himself gathering masses of firsthand information and accumulating what he called dirt experience creighton pp 49 60 reference to dirt experience appears in watson p 41 thus innis travelled extensively beginning in summer of 1924 when he and a friend paddled an canvas covered canoe hundreds of miles down peace river to lake athabasca then down slave river to great slave lake they completed their journey down mackenzie canada s longest river to arctic ocean on a small hudson s bay company tug creighton pp 61 64 during his travels innis supplemented his fur research by gathering information on other staple products such as lumber pulp and paper minerals grain and fish he travelled so extensively that by early 1940s he had visited every part of canada except for western arctic and east side of hudson bay berger carl 1976 writing of canadian history aspects of english canadian historical writing 1900 1970 toronto oxford university press pp 89 90 everywhere innis went his methods were same he interviewed people connected with production of staple products and listened to their stories watson p 124 fur trade in canada thumb north american beaver castor canadensis innis argued that it is impossible to understand canadian history without some knowledge of beaver s life and habits harold innis s interest in relationship between empires and colonies was developed in his classic study fur trade in canada an introduction to canadian economic history 1930 book chronicles trade in beaver fur from early 16th century to 1920s instead of focusing on heroic european adventurers who explored canadian wilderness as conventional histories had done innis documents how interplay of geography technology and economic forces shaped both fur trade and canada s political and economic destiny berger carl 1976 writing of canadian history toronto oxford university press pp 94 95 he argues that fur trade largely determined canada s boundaries coming to conclusion that country emerged not in spite of geography but because of it innis harold 1956 fur trade in canada an introduction to canadian economic history revised edition toronto university of toronto press pp 383 402 in line with this observation innis notably proposes that european settlement of saint lawrence river valley followed economic and social patterns of indigenous peoples making for a canadian historical and cultural continuity that pre dates and post dates european settlement unlike many historians who see canadian history as beginning with arrival of europeans innis emphasizes cultural and economic contributions of first nations peoples dickason olive mcnab david 2009 canada s first nations a history of founding peoples from earliest times fourth edition don mills ontario oxford university press p ix we have not yet realized he writes that indian and his culture was fundamental to growth of canadian institutions innis fur trade p 392 this innisian perspective on development of canadian political economic and social institutions was an early form of neo which became an accepted part of canadian political science tradition well before american and european counterparts fur trade in canada concludes by arguing that canadian economic history can best be understood by examining how one staple product gave way to another furs to timber for example and later importance of wheat and minerals berger pp 95 96 reliance on staples made canada economically dependent on more industrially advanced countries and cyclonic shifts from one staple to another caused frequent disruptions in country s economic life neill robin 1972 a new theory of value canadian economics of h a innis toronto university of toronto press pp 45 46 fur trade in canada also describes cultural interactions among three groups of people europeans in fashionable metropolitan centres who regarded beaver hats as luxury items european colonial settlers who saw beaver fur as a staple that could be exported to pay for essential manufactured goods from home country and first nations peoples who traded furs for industrial goods such as metal pots knives guns and liquor watson pp 152 53 innis describes central role first nations peoples played in development of fur trade without their skilled hunting techniques knowledge of territory and advanced tools such as snowshoes toboggans and birch bark canoes fur trade would not have existed innis fur trade p 10 15 however dependence on european technologies disrupted first nations societies new technology with its radical innovations innis writes brought about such a rapid shift in prevailing indian culture as to lead to wholesale destruction of peoples concerned by warfare and disease innis fur trade p 388 historian carl berger argues that by placing first nations culture at centre of his analysis of fur trade innis was first to explain adequately disintegration of native society under thrust of european capitalism berger p 100 cod fishery after publication of his book on fur trade innis turned to a study of an earlier staple cod fished for centuries off eastern coasts of north america especially grand banks of newfoundland result was cod fisheries history of an international economy published in 1940 10 years after fur trade study innis tells detailed history of competing empires in exploitation of a teeming natural resource a history that ranges over 500 years while his study of fur trade focused on continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes cod fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire showing far reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as newfoundland nova scotia and new england communications theories harold innis s study of effects of interconnected lakes and rivers on canadian development and european empire sparked his interest in complex economic and cultural relationships between transportation systems and

of history toronto university of toronto press pp 32 33 during 1940s innis also began studying pulp and paper an industry of central importance to canadian economy this research provided an additional crossover point from his work on staple products to his communications studies watson p 248 biographer paul heyer writes that innis followed pulp and paper through its subsequent stages newspapers and journalism books and advertising in other words from looking at a natural resource based industry he turned his attention to a cultural industry in which information and ultimately knowledge was a commodity that circulated had value and empowered those who controlled it heyer p 30 thumb right a greek copy of plato s symposium from a papyrus roll innis argued that plato s dialogues combined vitality of spoken word with power of writing a perfect balance between time and space one of innis s primary contributions to communications studies was to apply dimensions of time and space to various media he divided media into time binding and space binding types time binding media are durable they include clay or stone tablets space binding media are more ephemeral they include modern media such as radio television and mass circulation newspapers innis empire p 27 innis examined rise and fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing effects of communications media he looked at media that led to growth of an empire those that sustained it during its periods of success and then communications changes that hastened an empire s collapse he tried to show that media biases toward time or space affected complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire these interrelationships included partnership between knowledge and ideas necessary to create and maintain an empire and power or force required to expand and defend it for innis interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire watson p 313 innis argued that a balance between spoken word and writing contributed to flourishing of ancient greece in time of plato innis empire pp 78 79 this balance between time biased medium of speech and space biased medium of writing was eventually upset innis argued as oral tradition gave way to dominance of writing torch of empire then passed from greece to rome innis empire p 104 see also heyer pp 49 50 harold innis s analysis of effects of communications on rise and fall of empires led him to warn grimly that western civilization was now facing its own profound crisis development of powerful communications media such as mass circulation newspapers had shifted balance decisively in favour of space and power over time continuity and knowledge balance required for cultural survival had been upset by what innis saw as mechanized communications media used to transmit information quickly over long distances these media had contributed to an obsession with present mindedness wiping out concerns about past or future innis harold 1951 bias of communication toronto university of toronto press p 87 innis wrote overwhelming pressure of mechanization evident in newspaper and magazine has led to creation of vast monopolies of communication their entrenched positions involve a continuous systematic ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity western civilization could only be saved innis argued by recovering balance between space and time for him that meant reinvigorating oral tradition within universities while freeing institutions of higher learning from political and commercial pressures in his essay a plea for time he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce critical thinking necessary to restore balance between power and knowledge then universities could muster courage to attack monopolies that always imperil civilization innis bias pp 61 91 comment about universities mustering their courage appears in upside of ivory towers by rick globe and mail september 7 2007 although innis remains appreciated and respected for grand and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories he was not without critics particularly fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in empire and communications has been criticized as ambiguous aggressively non linear and lacking connections between levels of analysis stamps j 1991 negative dialogues a study of harold innis and marshall mcluhan in light of negative dialects of theodor adorno and walter benjamin ottawa canada national library p 6 biographers have suggested that this style may have been a result of innis illness late in his career heyer paul 1988 communications and history theories of media knowledge and civilization westport greenwood press p 114 academic and public career influence in 1930s aside from his work on cod fisheries innis wrote extensively in 1930s about other staple products such as minerals and wheat as well as canada s immense economic problems in great depression during summers of 1932 and 1933 he travelled to west to see effects of depression for himself creighton p 84 next year in an essay entitled canadian economy and depression innis outlined plight of a country susceptible to slightest ground swell of international disturbance yet beset by regional differences that made it difficult to devise effective solutions he described a prairie economy dependent on export of wheat yet afflicted by severe drought on one hand and increased political power of canada s growing cities sheltered from direct reliance on staples trade on other result was political conflict and a breakdown in federal provincial relations we lack vital information on which to base prospective policies to meet this situation innis warned because of weak position of social sciences in canada innis harold 1956 essays in canadian economic history edited by mary q innis toronto university of toronto press pp 123 40 left thumb radio a new medium drew a scathing rebuke from harold innis for promoting small talk and bores innis believed that both radio and mass circulation newspapers encouraged stereotypical thinking innis s reputation as a public intellectual was growing steadily and in 1934 premier angus l macdonald invited him to serve on a royal commission to examine nova scotia s economic problems next year he helped establish canadian journal of economics and political science in 1936 he was appointed a full university of toronto professor and a year later became head of university s department of political economy creighton pp 85 95 innis was appointed president of canadian political science association in 1938 his inaugural address entitled penetrative powers of price system must have baffled his listeners as he ranged over centuries of economic history jumping abruptly from one topic to next linking monetary developments to patterns of trade and settlement heyer p 20 address was an ambitious attempt to show disruptive effects of new technologies culminating in modern shift from an industrial system based on coal and iron to newest sources of industrial power electricity oil and steel innis also tried to show commercial effects of mass circulation newspapers made possible by expanded newsprint production and of new medium of radio which threatens to circumvent walls imposed by tariffs and to reach across boundaries frequently denied to other media of communication both media innis argued stimulated demand for consumer goods and both promoted nationalism innis essays pp 252 72 innis was also a central participant in an international project that produced 25 scholarly volumes between 1936 and 1945 it was a series called relations of canada and united states overseen by james t shotwell director of carnegie endowment for international peace innis edited and wrote prefaces for volumes contributed by canadian scholars his own study of cod fisheries also appeared as part of series his work with shotwell enabled innis to gain access to carnegie money to further canadian academic research as john watson points out project offered one of few sources of research funds in rather lean times watson p 201 politics and great depression thumb right r b bennett was conservative prime minister of canada from 1930 35 during depths of great depression although innis advocated staying out of politics he did correspond with bennett urging him to strengthen law against business monopolies era of dirty thirties with its mass unemployment poverty and despair gave rise to new canadian political movements in alberta for example radio evangelist william bible bill aberhart led his populist social credit party to victory in 1935 three years earlier in calgary alberta social reformers had founded a new political party co operative commonwealth federation or ccf it advocated democratic socialism and a mixed economy with public ownership of key industries frank underhill one of innis s colleagues at university of toronto was a founding member of ccf innis and underhill had both been members of an earlier group at university that declared itself dissatisfied with policies of two major political parties in canada and that aimed at forming a definite body of progressive opinion in 1931 innis presented a paper to group on economic conditions in canada but he later recoiled from participating in party politics denouncing partisans like underhill as hot gospellers havelock eric 1982 harold innis a memoir toronto harold innis foundation pp 14 15 reference to hot gospellers can be found in creighton biography p 93 innis maintained that scholars had no place in active politics and that instead they should devote themselves first to research on public problems and then to production of knowledge based on critical thought he saw university with its emphasis on dialogue open mindedness and skepticism as an institution that could foster such thinking and research university could provide an environment he wrote as free as possible from biases of various institutions that form state so that its intellectuals could continue to seek out and explore other perspectives quoted in public role of intellectual by liora salter and cheryl dahl in harold innis in new century 1999 montreal mcgill queen s university press p 119 although sympathetic to plight of western farmers and urban unemployed workers innis did not embrace socialism eric havelock a left leaning colleague explained many years later that innis distrusted political solutions imported from elsewhere especially those based on marxist analysis with its emphasis on class conflict he worried too that as canada s ties with britain weakened country would fall under spell of american ideas instead of developing its own based on canada s unique circumstances havelock added he has been called radical conservative of his day not a bad designation of a complex mind clear sighted cautious perhaps at bottom pessimistic in areas where thinkers we would label progressive felt less difficulty in taking a stand never content to select only one or two elements in a complicated equation in order to build a quick order policy or program far ranging enough in intellect to take in whole sum of factors and comprehend their often contradictory effects havelock pp 22 23 late career and death in 1940s harold innis reached height of his influence in both academic circles and canadian society in 1941 he helped establish american based economic history association and its journal of economic history he later became association s second president innis played a central role in founding two important sources for funding of academic research canadian social science research council 1940 and humanities research council of canada 1944 watson p 223 in 1944 university of new brunswick awarded innis an honorary degree as did his alma mater mcmaster university universite laval university of manitoba and university of glasgow would also confer honorary degrees in 1947 48 watson pp 223 24 in 1945 innis spent nearly a month in soviet union where he had been invited to attend 220th anniversary celebrations marking founding of country s academy of sciences watson pp 223 224 later in his essay reflections on russia he mused about differences between soviet producer economy and west s consumer ethos a n economy which emphasizes consumer s goods is characterized by communication industries largely dependent on advertising and by constant efforts to reach largest number of readers or listeners an economy emphasizing producer s goods is characterized by communications industries largely dependent on government support as a result of this contrast a common public opinion in russia and west is hard to achieve quoted in heyer p 33 innis s trip to moscow and leningrad came shortly before u s soviet rivalry led to hostility of cold war innis lamented this rise in international tensions creighton p 122 he saw soviet empire as a stabilizing counterbalance to american empire s emphasis on commercialism individual and constant change for innis russia was a society within western tradition not an alien civilization he abhorred nuclear arms race seeing it as triumph of force over knowledge a modern form of medieval inquisition middle ages burned its heretics he wrote and modern age threatens them with atom bombs innis bias p 139 in 1946 innis was elected president of royal society of canada country s senior body of scientists and scholars that same year he served on manitoba royal commission on adult education and published political economy in modern state a collection of his speeches and essays that reflected both his staples research and his new work in communications in 1947 innis was appointed university of toronto s dean of graduate studies in 1948 he delivered lectures at university of london and nottingham university he also gave prestigious beit lectures at oxford later published in his book empire and communications in 1949 innis was appointed as a commissioner on federal government s royal commission on transportation a position that involved extensive travel at a time when his health was starting to fail watson pp 224 25 see also creighton pp 136 40 last decade of his career during which he worked on his communications studies was an unhappy time for innis he was academically isolated because his colleagues in economics could not fathom how this new work related to his pioneering research in staples theory biographer john watson writes that almost complete lack of positive response to communications works contributed to his sense of overwork and depression watson pp 250 55 innis died of prostate cancer in 1952 a few days after his 58th birthday in commemoration innis college at university of toronto and innis library at mcmaster university were named in his honour following his premature death innis significance increasingly deepened as scholars in several academic disciplines continued to build upon his writings marshall poe s general media theory that proposes two sub theories were inspired by innis douglas c north expanded on of innis vent for surplus theory of economic development by applying it to regional development in united states and underdeveloped countries in addition james w carey adopted innis as a reference point in his conception of two models of communication innis and mcluhan marshall mcluhan was a colleague of innis s at university of toronto as a young english professor mcluhan was flattered when he learned that innis had put his book mechanical bride on reading list of fourth year economics course preface by h marshall mcluhan in havelock p 10 also see watson p 405 mcluhan built on innis s idea that in studying effects of communications media technological form mattered more than content biographer paul heyer writes that innis s concept of bias of a particular medium of communication can be seen as a less flamboyant precursor to mcluhan s legendary phrase medium is message heyer p 61 innis for example tried to show how printed media such as books or newspapers were biased toward control over space and secular power while engraved media such as stone or clay tablets were biased in favour of continuity in time and metaphysical or religious knowledge innis empire p 7 mcluhan focused on what may be called a medium s sensory bias arguing for example that books and newspapers appealed to rationality of eye while radio played to irrationality of ear mcluhan marshall 2003 understanding media extensions of man corte madera california gingko press differences in innisian and approaches were summarized by late james w carey both mcluhan and innis assume centrality of communication technology where they differ is in principal kinds of effects they see deriving from this technology whereas innis sees communication technology principally affecting social organization and culture mcluhan sees its principal effect on sensory organization and thought mcluhan has much to say about perception and thought but little to say about institutions innis says much about institutions and little about perception and thought carey james w harold adams innis and marshall mcluhan in mcluhan pro and con 1969 baltimore pelican books p 281 graeme patterson strongly disagrees with this view arguing that innis paid an extraordinary amount of attention to perception and thought while mcluhan examined institutions both innis and mcluhan patterson argues were preoccupied with language one of humanity s basic institutions see patterson pp 36 37 biographer john watson notes that innis s work was profoundly political while mcluhan s was not he writes that mechanization of knowledge not relative sensual bias of media is key to innis s work this also underlies politicization of innis s position vis a vis that of mcluhan watson adds that innis believed very different media could produce similar effects for innis yellow press of united states and nazi loudspeaker had same form of negative effect they reduced men from thinking beings to mere automatons in a chain of command watson argues that while mcluhan separated media according to their sensory bias innis examined a different set of interrelationships dialectic of power and knowledge in specific historical circumstances for watson innis s work is therefore more flexible and less deterministic than mcluhan s watson pp 410 11 as scholars and teachers innis and mcluhan shared a similar dilemma since both argued that book culture tended to produce fixed points of view and homogeneity of thought yet both produced many books in his introduction to 1964 reprint of bias of communication mcluhan marvelled at innis s technique of juxtaposing his insights in a mosaic structure of seemingly unrelated and sentences and aphorisms mcluhan argued that although this made reading innis s dense prose difficult a pattern of insights that are not packaged for consumer palate innis s method approximated natural form of conversation or dialogue rather than of written discourse best of all it yielded insight and pattern recognition rather than classified knowledge so overvalued by print trained scholars how exciting it was to encounter a writer whose every phrase invited prolonged meditation and exploration mcluhan added mcluhan marshall 2005 marshall mcluhan unbound corte madera ca gingko press v 8 pp 5 8 mcluhan s own books with their reliance on aphorisms puns quips probes and oddly juxtaposed observations also employ this mosaic technique innis s theories of political economy media and society remain highly relevant he had a profound influence on critical media theory and communications and in conjunction with mcluhan offered groundbreaking canadian perspectives on function of communication technologies as key agents in social and historical change together their works advanced a theory of history in which communication is central to social change and transformation carey mcluhan pro and con p 271 selected works innis harold 1923 a
