episode 8 5 10 he commented that in resetting events of sectionals it felt a bit rushed but concluded glee continues to work because it has its cake and eats it too it s an over top overly cheerful musical but also a biting comedy that always winks at audience and acknowledges how cheesy musical theater can be even while also proving how fun it is daily news david hinckley shared goldman s concerns about resetting characters and while he believed that doing so was right long term move he commented that immediate effect is to make episode feel a little jerky hinckley felt that episode s

have sold series early on dawn felt that there were too many musical performances commenting they might be fun performances but they re not all necessary and yes it is possible to have too much music
