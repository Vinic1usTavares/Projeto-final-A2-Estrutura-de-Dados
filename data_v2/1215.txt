wordlessly along with music in reference to her laid back delivery peter shapiro wrote facetiously in wire that sadier display ed all emotional histrionics of nico while some critics have commented

sweet and slightly alien after hansen s death in 2002 critic jim harrington commented that her absence is noticeable on live performances of stereolab s older tracks and that their newer songs could have benefited from hansen s backing vocals in interviews gane and sadier have discussed their musical philosophy gane said that to be unique was more important than to be good on subject of being too obscure he said in a 1996 interview that maybe area where we re on dodgy ground is this idea that you need great knowledge of esoteric music to understand what we re doing sadier responded to gane saying that she think s we have achieved a music that will make sense to a lot of people whether they know about steve reich or not according to sadier band avoided going overground and exemplified pj harvey pulp and cranberries all of whom were initially obscure but quickly rose to fame this kind of notoriety is not a particularly good thing and you don t enjoy it anymore duo were up front about their desire to grow their sound for gane otherwise it just sounds like what other people are doing and for sadier you trust that there is more and that it can be done more interesting influences their records have been heavily influenced by motorik technique of 1970s krautrock groups such as neu and faust tim gane has supported comparison neu did minimalism and drones but in a very pop way dave heaton of popmatters said that their music also had echoes of bubblegum of exotica of beach boys and bossa nova with their earlier work bearing strong velvet underground overtones funk jazz and brazilian music were additional inspirations for band stephan of french newspaper le monde said that emperor tomato ketchup 1996 had musical influences such as burt bacharach and francoise hardy sounds influenced by minimalist composers philip glass and steve reich can be found on 1999 album cobra and phases group play voltage in milky night stereolab s style also incorporates easy listening music of 1950s and 60s barney hoskyns wrote in a review for dots and loops 1997 that group moved away from one chord velvets drone mesh of its early days toward easy listening and europop joshua klein in washington post said that years before everyone else caught on stereolab were referencing 1970s german bands can and neu mexican lounge music master esquivel and decidedly burt bacharach regarding their later work such as instant 0 in universe 2003 and margerine eclipse 2004 critics have compared releases to band s earlier guitar driven style live performances stereolab toured regularly to support their album releases in a 1996 washington post gig review mark jenkins wrote that stereolab started out favouring an easy listening syncopation but eventually reverted to a messier more urgent sound characteristic of their earlier performances in another review jenkins said that band s live songs frequently veer ed into more cacophonous guitar dominated territory in contrast to their albums such as cobra and phases group play voltage in milky night in minneapolis star tribune jon bream compared band s live sound to feedback driven rock bands like velvet underground sonic youth and my bloody valentine stereolab s stage presence would be negatively received by critics commenting that sadier s vocal delivery was too subdued and that band tended to play instead of perform its music regarding being onstage gane has said that i don t like to be center of attention i just get into music and am not really aware of people there that s my way of getting through it lyrics and titles stereolab s music is politically and philosophically charged dave heaton of popmatters said that group uses lyrics to convey ideas while using them for pleasurable way words sound lyrics of 2006 compilation fab four suture contains themes of war governments that suppress freedom and powerlessness that everyday people feel in face of it all in contrast to humans working together treating each other like people and pushing for governments that would do same laetitia sadier who writes group s lyrics was influenced by both situationist philosophy society of spectacle by marxist theorist guy debord and her anger towards iraq war surrealist as well as situationist cultural and political movements were also influences as stated by sadier and gane in a 1999 salon interview critics have seen marxist allusions in band s lyrics and have gone so far as to call band members themselves marxist music journalist simon reynolds commented that sadier s lyrics tend to lean towards marxist social commentary rather than affairs of heart 1994 single ping pong has been put forward as evidence in regard to these alleged views in song sadier sings about capitalism s cruel cycles of slump and recovery with lyrics that constitute a explanation of one of central tenets of marxian economic analysis said critics reynolds and stewart mason respectively band members have resisted attempts to link group and its music to marxism in a 1999 interview gane stated that none of us are marxists i ve never even read marx gane said that although sadier s lyrics touch on political topics they do not cross line into sloganeering sadier also said that she had read very little marx in contrast cornelius castoriadis a radical political philosopher but strong critic of marxism has been cited as a marking influence in sadier s thinking name of her side project monade and its debut album title ou barbarie are also references to work of castoriadis stereolab s album and song titles occasionally reference avant garde groups and artists gane said that title of their 1999 album cobra and phases group play voltage in milky night contains names of two surrealist organisations cobra and phases group title of song brakhage from dots and loops 1997 is a nod to experimental filmmaker stan brakhage other examples are 1992 compilation switched on named after wendy carlos 1968 album switched on

decade s most innovative british bands by mark jenkins simon reynolds commented in rolling stone that group s earlier records form an endlessly seductive body of work that sounds always same always different in a review for 1992 single john cage bubblegum jason ankeny said that no other artist of its generation fused high minded daring of avant garde and lowbrow infectiousness of pop with as much invention skill and appeal in wire peter shapiro compared band to britpop bands oasis and blur and defended their music against charge that it is nothing but sum total of its arcane reference points they were one of first groups to be termed post rock in a 1996 article journalist angela lewis applied new term to stereolab and three other bands who have connections to group stylistically music journalist j d considine credits band for anticipating and driving late 1990s revival of vintage analogue instruments among indie rock bands stephen christian a creative director of warp records said that group exists in gap between experimentation of underground and appeal of wider world of pop music group have also received negative press barney hoskyns questioned longevity of their music in a 1996 mojo review saying that their records sound more like arid experiments than music born of emotional need in guardian dave simpson stated with their borrowings from early obscure kraftwerk and hip obtuse sources stereolab sound like a band of rock critics rather than musicians laetitia sadier s vocals were cited by author stuart shea as often being indecipherable a variety of artists

sizeable fanbase commercial success eluded group early in their career their 1993 ep jenny ondioline entered uk singles chart but financial issues prevented band from printing enough records to satisfy demand when elektra records was closed down by warner bros records in 2004 stereolab was dropped along with many other artists reportedly because of poor sales tim gane said in retrospect that that group signed to elektra because we thought we would be on there for an album or two and then we d get ejected we were surprised when we got to our first album since then stereolab s self owned label duophonic has inked a worldwide distribution deal with independent label too pure through duophonic band both licenses their music and releases it directly depending on geographic market gane
