required assistance he argued that more troops did not necessarily mean more violence saying that experience shows that after an initial spike as insurgents are cleared out violence reduces to much lower levels and that providing a sense of security depends on much more than physical troop presence but it has to start with that we need sufficient troops to protect people and convince them that afghan government control supported by isaf for moment is sufficient to prevent return of insurgents he went on to say that backbone of nato alliance gives coalition a steadfastness which coalitions of willing cannot match it also gives unparalleled authority and legitimacy based on consensus of its members dutton concluded that given strength of this unparalleled military coalition and political
