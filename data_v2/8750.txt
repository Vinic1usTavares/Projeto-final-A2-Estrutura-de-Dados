routing a surface light rail line between downtown and university district to serve seattle center and south lake union at time a low rise industrial area neighborhood had previously been proposed for redevelopment into a technology hub as part of seattle commons plan which was supported by microsoft co founder paul allen and civic leaders after seattle commons plan was rejected by voters in a set of referendums in 1995 and 1996 allen s venture capital holding company vulcan inc acquired waterfront properties in south lake union area with plans to create a new commercial neighborhood allen and

filed a formal protest to local improvement district during month long protest period several property owners also discussed a potential lawsuit to halt construction while others were skeptical of

but 2 8 million of construction costs construction on south lake union streetcar began with a groundbreaking ceremony on july 7 2006 during which mayor nickels u s senator patty murray state

utility work after line opening local improvement district contributed 25 7 million to its cost including 8 6 million from vulcan while federal grants paid for 14 6 million state grants contributed 3 million and proceeds from land sales and property exchanges with vulcan yielded 5 3 million operating funds for streetcar cost 2 million and had to be covered by further loans in 2007 and 2009 due to low advertising revenue and higher costs streetcar was criticized for its slow speeds due to lack of dedicated lanes and widespread transit signal priority as well as disruptions because of cars that were improperly parked adjacent to track a transit priority intersection at mercer street was removed in 2009 during street s reconstruction which added several minutes to scheduled travel times streetcar tracks were also identified as a hazard for cyclists riding on westlake avenue or intersecting streets causing crashes and injuries within first year of operation a group of six cyclists sued city government in 2011 over streetcar hazard but case was dismissed by king county superior court due to a lack of evidence of fault high rise development in south lake union opened alongside streetcar including offices to accommodate then upcoming relocation of amazon new condominiums businesses and retailers public opinion of streetcar grew unfavorable in its first years of operation in part because of its low ridership all but one of candidates in 2009 city council and mayoral elections stated that that streetcar was a bad idea when asked during a public debate by 2010 streetcar ridership had reached 500 000 annual boardings and was continuing to increase streetcar ridership rose in later years due to an increase in new businesses around south lake union necessitating new

arrived as part of first hill fleet in early 2015 and entered service later that year increased traffic on westlake avenue and a decline in streetcar reliability by 2015 prompted seattle department of transportation to propose installation of transit only lanes along street which would be paired with increased bus service new lanes were added to improve reliability and headways for streetcar and required temporary suspension of mid day service for several weeks in early 2016 new lanes took effect on march 21 2016 a service change went into effect five days later to increase streetcar frequency to 10 minutes add bus service on route 40 and reroute rapidride c line to terminate in south lake union similar lane restrictions on two blocks of terry avenue during rush hours went into effect in november 2018 and are planned to be extended south by another block in 2020 expansion plans city officials saw south lake union line as first in a network of streetcar routes extending north to university district west to seattle center and southeast to first hill and international district preliminary plans for a network of five line streetcar network were approved for further development by city council in december 2008 without allocated funding to cover 600 million cost network plan included branches of south lake union line that traveled northwest to ballard via fremont and northeast to university district via eastlake lines would feed into a trunk along south lake union streetcar that would connect to a line serving downtown seattle and seattle center on either 1st avenue or 4th and 5th avenues eastlake project including a compatible replacement for fairview avenue north bridge was prioritized for next streetcar study but it was delayed by city council in favor of using its funds for bus service only addition to network so far first hill line began construction in 2012 and opened in january 2016 with funding from sound transit as part of mitigation for loss of a planned light rail station serving first hill first hill line generally runs south from capitol hill station to yesler terrace on broadway and west on south jackson street to international district and pioneer square two streetcar lines do not intersect and leave a gap across downtown seattle that was planned to be filled by a later extension planning of a third streetcar project to connect south lake union and first hill lines began in 2012 as part of a revival in streetcar studies under mayor mike mcginn project named center city connector was approved in july 2014 by city council and was planned to begin service on 1st avenue by 2020 its 110 million cost would be primarily covered by a grant from federal transit administration fta under approved plan streetcar route would use a set of transit only lanes in center of 1st avenue stopping at pike place market seattle art museum and near colman dock it would carry both south lake union and first hill lines which would overlap for a frequency of five minutes and would have an estimated daily ridership of 20 000 older fleet of inekon streetcars would be incompatible with first hill line requiring a replacement seattle department of transportation planned to sell retired cars to portland for use on its streetcar system by late 2017 questions arose regarding streetcar s ridership projections and increased cost of 177 million as it neared start of construction king county metro was contracted to operate route but found baseline operating budget to be too small to handle expected staffing that it needed mayor jenny durkan ordered an independent review of center city connector project s cost estimations and halted all ongoing construction on line in march 2018 independent review was delivered several months late and found issues with vehicle procurement including exceeding project s limits for vehicle weight and size review estimated that project would cost 252 million to construct streetcar
