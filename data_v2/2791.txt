amenemhat iii his reign started with a two year coregency with amenemhat iii and was seemingly peaceful he undertook expeditions in sinai for turquoise in upper egypt for amethyst and to land of punt

temple of renenutet in medinet madi amenemhat iv s tomb has not been identified although southern mazghuna pyramid is a possibility he was succeeded by sobekneferu possibly his sister or step sister whose short reign marked end of 12th dynasty and beginning of middle kingdom s decline into second intermediate period family amenemhat iv was son of a woman named hetepi hetepi s only known attestation is an inscription on wall of temple of renenutet at medinet madi where she is given title of king s mother but not those of king s wife king s daughter or king s sister consequently her relation to amenemhat iii is unknown and she may have been non royal relation of amenemhat iv to amenemhat iii is similarly uncertain former could have been son or grandson of latter similarly while manetho states that he married his half sister sobekneferu this claim is not yet supported by archaeological evidence in particular sobekneferu is not known to have borne title of king s wife instead egyptologist kim ryholt proposes that amenemhat iv was adopted by amenemhat iii and thus became sobekneferu s step brother thereby explaining tradition amenemhat may have died without a male heir which could explain why he was succeeded by sobekneferu however some egyptologists such as aidan dodson and kim ryholt have proposed that first two rulers of 13th dynasty sobekhotep i and amenemhat
