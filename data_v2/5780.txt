golem arcana is a tabletop miniature wargaming game developed and published by harebrained schemes for ios and android devices game combines physical miniatures on a game board with a mobile app that much of gameplay takes place in physical pieces and app communicate through use of a bluetooth stylus several elements of game including special abilities and optional missions exist only within app golem arcana was funded through a kickstarter campaign that launched in september 2013 and went on to raise over 500 000 game was released just under a year later on 13 august 2014 both studio co founder jordan weisman and executive producer ray winninger had extensive experience developing both video games and tabletop games and one of their primary motivations in creating golem arcana was to merge two gaming types they also sought to create a more social experience than could be found in traditional multiplayer video games game received mixed reviews upon release critics were split in their take on hybrid of physical pieces and digital app with some seeing it as a boon and others as a detriment game received praise for its visuals lore and ruleset but also received criticism for its price gameplay golem arcana is a two to eight player miniature wargaming game that interfaces with a digital app through use of a bluetooth stylus players compete against one another in one of several scenario types including eliminating opponent s golems or capturing and holding a specific area of map ultimate goal of game is to collect a set number of victory points which are gathered by defeating opposing golems completing scenario objectives and as rewards for completing optional missions encountered through app each player controls a number of physical miniatures called golems which are placed on a game board built with interchangeable map tiles each map tile is divided into nine squares arranged 3 by 3 and has terrain features pre printed on it golems come in small large and very large sizes up to four small two large or one large and two small golems can share a square on a map tile very large colossus golems take up an entire square by themselves each golem comes with a card that lists actions it can take another type of card known as relics allow players to active special abilities including healing and resurrection golems cards and game board are covered in small magnetic dots a bluetooth stylus that comes with starter kit reads dots to transmit information from board to a mobile app gameplay information such as position of all of golems terrain and map effects and game s rules are stored in app which uses that information to determine and present players with available moves attack accuracy and damage and other statistics players then use stylus to choose where to move and what actions to take players still have to move physical pieces on board but their moves are also reflected in app game also has several components that exist only within app base game includes around 70 knights which in game s lore are sorcerers that control golems players pair each golem with one knight or three knights for colossus golems and different knights provide golems with different bonuses players can also use spells in game s lore by evoking ancestral gods called ancient ones ancient ones are cast using mana which can be acquired in several ways including when a golem that player controls is defeated or though missions that appear in app players encounter missions which provide optional objectives in exchange for victory points while moving around map in some cases not completing missions offers alternative rewards harebrained schemes collects aggregate data on decisions that players make in game and uses it to alter game s lore development thumb executive producer ray winninger in 2008 golem arcana was announced in july 2013 in a blog post on developer harebrained schemes website blog post indicated that studio would return to kickstarter to fund game and that most of studio s staff would continue to work on their other project shadowrun returns while a few would be split off to work on golem arcana kickstarter campaign was launched on 10 september 2013 and ran until 15 october 2013 with a funding goal of 500 000 backers could get base game by pledging at 55 kickstarter reward tier game was released on 13 august 2014 with digital component available for both ios and android in addition to base game a number of expansion sets have been released expansions sets contain three miniatures as well as cards and abilities harebrained schemes has also released colossus expansions which contain one large miniature instead of three normal sized ones final expansion champions of western wind was released on january 27 2016 a post on game s official blog indicated that despite strong critical reception sales were not sufficient to justify millions of dollars spent on development and production according to a statement sent to icv2 studio had ensured that game s companion app supported as many devices and operating systems as possible at time but could not promise compatibility or support in future both studio co founder jordan weisman and executive producer ray winninger had experience developing both tabletop games and video games one of studio s motivations for developing game was to combine two mediums with winninger explaining one of spaces we re interested in exploring at harebrained and golem is first effort is how can we take those tabletop games that we know and love so much and leverage technology to enhance that experience in some way weisman and winninger also stressed social nature of game winninger comparing golem arcana to another game with both physical and digital components stressed that golem arcana was less focused on components and more focused on social experience weisman pointed to his disappointment that kids idea of playing together after school these days usually means just meeting online from their own houses in stressing that participants playing against each other in golem arcana would do so face to face reception golem arcana received mixed reviews upon release reviewers were divided on game s defining feature hybrid of physical miniature and digital app but praised game s visuals lore and rules writing for rock paper shotgun robert florence praised app for calculating variables like movement range and tracking statistics like health and ability but spoke of a disconnect caused by constantly shifting focus between screen and board while ultimately questioning need for physical components at all florence also saw game as having potential in future chris hutton of tom s guide took a much more negative view hutton found it cumbersome that starter kit came with only one stylus and that only one device running app could be synced to a given game at a time necessitating that screen and stylus be passed back and forth between players he also found stylus itself to be unresponsive slowing game down to point that he lost interest jay henningsen on other hand had nothing but praise for app and stylus after fifteen minutes he found using stylus to be almost natural and found that app handling all of rules and stat keeping made for one of easiest experiences i ve ever had getting into a new game he went on to say that players will look to see technology spread to other miniature wargaming products one element that did receive near universal criticism was game s price of 80 for base game pc world called price game s biggest flaw yahoo tech called it hefty and a steep investment and venturebeat called it quite price tag but qualified their statement by pointing to large number of items that come with starter kit game did receive praise for its visuals storytelling and rules academy of adventure gaming arts design awarded golem arcana best miniature figure rules prize in 2015 origins awards in an otherwise negative review chris hutton of tom s guide praised storyline and visuals saying of latter that colorful interesting terrain created a unique universe game informer praised game s setting and its gorgeous visual aesthetic
