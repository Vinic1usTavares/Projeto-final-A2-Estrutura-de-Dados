half life 2 lost coast stylized as life2 lost coast is an additional level for 2004 first person shooter video game half life 2 developed by valve corporation it was released on october 27 2005 through steam content delivery service as a free download to owners of microsoft windows version of half life 2 lost coast serves as a technology demonstration specifically showcasing high dynamic range rendering implemented in source engine level was designed with a variety of appropriate environments to emphasize these effects lost coast was first video game developed by valve to allow developers to explain various elements of design as player progresses through level lost coast follows half life protagonist gordon freeman as he travels up a coastal cliff to destroy a combine headcrab artillery launcher in a monastery which is firing on a nearby town saint olga lost coast level was initially created for half life 2 but was ultimately removed from game as a result it has several minor story details that were not included in half life 2 level received a generally positive reception and there was consensus among reviewers that new features included in lost coast should be integrated into future games released by valve gameplay lost coast uses same first person shooter gameplay mechanics as half life 2 game is viewed from perspective of player character and plot information is imparted through scripted sequences rather than cutscenes a heads up display at bottom of screen shows player s health energy gauge and ammunition status while available weapons are shown at top health and armor energy can be replenished by picking up medical supplies and energy cells respectively or by using wall mounted charging devices player character is equipped with a small armory of weapons from half life 2 at beginning of level including a pistol shotgun crossbow and gravity gun gravity gun allows player to manipulate physical objects in world it can be used to pick up nearby objects and throw them at enemies or create cover from enemy fire gravity gun can also be used to perform several non combat functions such as grabbing out of reach supply crates story thumb 300px chancel of byzantine christian church in lost coast which valve artist viktor antonov called a great showcase for hdr half life 2 lost coast opens with protagonist gordon freeman finding himself near a group of decaying piers underneath a monastery set up on rocks and overlooking small town of st olga a fisherman recognizes gordon and directs him to monastery which enemy combine are using as a platform to launch artillery shells filled with headcrabs into town fisherman opens a gate allowing player to proceed and awaits gordon s return as gordon proceeds up cliffside to byzantine christian monastery he encounters heavy resistance from combine soldiers who rappel down cliff to try to stop him gordon fights his way up enters church s nave and disables artillery launcher this alerts nearby soldiers who assault sanctuary in force while a combine attack helicopter arrives to support soldiers after defeating soldiers in courtyard gordon moves to scaffolding over side of cliff and destroys helicopter with rpgs helicopter crashes into scaffolding freeing up a path to a crude elevator which lowers gordon back down to pier fisherman congratulates freeman on his success invites him to a feast in st olga and screen fades out as level ends fisherman exclaims that gordon is getting all fuzzy round edges development level design lost coast was conceived as a part of highway 17 chapter in half life 2 highway 17 s development name was coast hence name lost coast but was later discarded during development as a result lost coast features minor storyline details that were removed from half life 2 such as headcrab artillery launchers each area of level was designed with a specific purpose an eastern orthodox architectural style was deliberately chosen for monastery as buildings of this type are very colorful and have a large variety of materials and are often lit naturally with extremes of darkness and brightness providing an ideal showcase for hdr lighting effects valve also thought that use of a monastery would help provide a starker contrast between old human architecture and futuristic combine technology found within it cliffside that leads to monastery had a gameplay oriented purpose and was meant to emulate a similar cliffside combat scene in half life cliffside also forces player to be observant of threats from above and below breaking from normal horizontal combat monastery s courtyard was designed as an area where player recovers from cliffside combat while also presenting a contained combat arena later in level in which player must hold their ground while they are attacked from multiple directions high dynamic range rendering thumb 250px right a comparison of standard fixed aperture rendering left with hdr rendering right in source engine goal of lost coast was to demonstrate new high dynamic range rendering implemented into source game engine valve first attempted to implement high dynamic range rendering in source in late 2003 first method stored textures in color space allowing for multisample anti aliasing and pixel shaders to be used but this prevented alpha mapping and fog effects from working correctly as well as making textures appear sharp and jagged second method involved saving two versions of a texture one with regular data and other with overbrightening data however this technique did not allow for multisample anti aliasing and consumed twice as much video card memory making it infeasible third method shown at e3 convention in 2005 used floating point data to define rgb color space allowing for reasonably efficient storage of high dynamic range data however this method also did not allow for multisample anti aliasing and was only compatible with nvidia video cards leaving ati cards unable to run high dynamic range fourth and final method compromised between second and third methods using overbrightening textures sparingly and allowing ati cards to render hdr in a different way to nvidia ones while nearly producing same result final version of valve s high dynamic range technology adds a significant number of lighting effects to engine aimed at making game appear more realistic bloom shading was introduced blurring bright edges in game world and emulating a camera s overexposure to light this is combined with exposure control to tailor effect to represent human eye for example as player exits a dark area into a light area new area is initially glaringly bright but quickly darkens representing adjustment of player character s eyes to light new cube mapping techniques allow reflection cast by an object to correspond with brightness of light source and enable light bouncing and global illumination to be taken into account in rendering refraction effects were added to make light account for physical attributes of an object and to emulate way light is reflected by water lost coast level is specifically designed to showcase these effects it uses sea and beach as opportunities to demonstrate water based effects monastery to demonstrate bloom from its whitewash walls and sanctuary to provide means to show refraction through stained glass windows and cube maps on golden urns and candlesticks as a technology showcase valve considered lost coast to have very demanding system requirements game runs on computers with specifications lower than what is recommended albeit without some key features such as high dynamic range if a non high dynamic range capable card is used developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this for example valve president gabe newell would describe effects that are seen differently commentary system in addition to a showcase for visual improvements lost coast acted as a testbed for valve s commentary system when feature is enabled additional items appear in game that can be interacted with to play audio commentary each audio piece ranges from ten seconds to a minute of commentary players hear developers talk about what player is seeing what is happening why they made certain decisions and what kinds of challenges they faced commentary tracks are represented by floating speech bubbles called commentary nodes valve intended for players to first play level with commentary disabled and after completing level play it again with commentary enabled learning about each new stage as they progress company has since made commentary system standard in all its later video games release and reception lost coast was released on october 27 2005 as a free download from valve s steam content delivery service to anyone who purchased half life 2 people who received half life 2 as a gift from valve s online store were not eligible to download level valve announced on may 30 2007 that lost coast along with half life 2 deathmatch would be made available for free to owners of ati radeon cards it was later released without charge to nvidia graphics card owners along with half life 2 deathmatch peggle extreme and first eleven levels of portal lost coast was generally well received by video game critics 1up com enjoyed amount of detail including graphics puzzles and intelligent enemies saying valve just packed more atmosphere into a tiny snippet than most shooters muster period review also praised level s commentary system calling it an informative addition and enjoyed interesting and insightful comments made by some of its creators level satisfied ugo because it would be harder not to enjoy this level in all its beautifully rendered glory even after you ve broken all windows and spattered walls with combine blood and gamespot commented that textures in lost coast are noticeably more detailed and numerous than in retail game review concluded hoping that features introduced in lost coast would be included in valve s future releases negative reaction to game focused on its length and gameplay 1up com and ugo both considered it short shawn elliott of 1up com described it as a lickety split run through postcard pretty tide pools up cliffs and into a church turned combine outpost ugo s nigel grammer stated that lost coasts gameplay seemed to be secondary to level s graphics lost coasts gameplay disappointed brad shoemaker of gamespot who compared it to that of half life 2 and considered them to be very similar saying that it isn t going to set world on fire notes references
