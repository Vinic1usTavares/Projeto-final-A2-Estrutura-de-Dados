supporting individual host cities requests irb did not focus its own efforts on returning sport to olympics until early 1990s when efforts began to reunite two movements with a series of informal meetings between then irb secretary keith rowlands and british olympic association secretary dick palmer in 1994 when vernon pugh qc of wales was elected chairman of irb march towards olympic recognition began in earnest pugh convinced irb council that olympic membership initially as a non participation sport would be beneficial to rugby and offer irb member unions membership of their national olympic committees many european federations such as france italy and romania had been members of their national olympic committees for decades demand to get rugby back in olympics mounted as more rugby nations from africa asia oceania and americas joined irb because it was a sport seen as providing a realistic medal opportunity for a number of smaller nations a significant step in process of acceptance back into olympic movement was achieved at a ceremony held in cardiff in november 1994 when irb was officially confirmed as a recognised international federation of ioc at that ceremony international olympic committee president juan antonio samaranch pointed out that rugby s history and values were very much in tune with olympic philosophy and traditions this historic meeting in
