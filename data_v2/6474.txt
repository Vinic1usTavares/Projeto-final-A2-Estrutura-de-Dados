late 1860s and mid 1910s akron plan thumb upright alt man with white beard bald on top lewis miller akron plan was developed in response to changing sunday school practices in first part of 19th century general tendency was for all pupils to learn same lesson together in one large room beginning in about 1860 however churches began implementing a new approach all pupils learned same lesson but they were separated into grades allowing each instructor to teach lesson in a manner suitable for age and level of development of their pupils this practice was taken up by increasing numbers of churches in 1872 a national convention adopted uniform lesson plan implementing practice nationwide grades were not kept separate for entire duration of session class began with devotional exercises led by superintendent and involving entire body of pupils after this grades were taught separately at end of session superintendent led and whole body participated in a five minute review of lesson followed by closing exercises this created a challenge for ecclesiastical architects sunday school building had to be designed in such a way that pupils could quickly and efficiently be separated into various grades and brought together for all school activities one of those who addressed design problem was lewis miller a wealthy inventor and industrialist miller supervised a sunday school in canton ohio and later one in akron when first methodist episcopal church in akron decided to construct a new building miller worked with several architects to plan sunday school wing he devised a plan in which wedge shaped classrooms were separated by partitions radiating from direction of a central superintendent s platform doors on platform facing side of each classroom could be closed during grade separated lessons or opened to allow all pupils to see and hear superintendent during school wide exercises new church following these plans was constructed in 1866 67 thumb alt plan of interior with large open central area remaining portion divided into 10 rooms by radial partitions original akron plan so called akron plan was adopted by protestant churches throughout united states and world many of these churches modified design with addition of a movable partition between sanctuary and sunday school spaces allowing sunday school classes and main body of congregants to be separated or united akron plan s popularity declined after 1908 when an international sunday school convention approved development of completely graded lesson plans pupils were to be kept in separate classes for entire session school wide exercises led by superintendent were eliminated this did away with chief advantage of akron plan whose awkwardly shaped imperfectly soundproofed and often poorly lighted rooms were not well suited for any other use to create more useful spaces many akron plan interiors were remodelled by beginning of 21st century few intact akron plan interiors remained madison church madison presbyterian church is located on southeast corner of fourth and nebraska streets architecturally its design has been described as a modest romanesque revival style as a representative of this style and because its interior serves as a well preserved example of akron plan design church was listed in national register of historic places in 2008 exterior church is chiefly built out of red
