simon moore of flickering myth compared show s left field laughs favorably to humor in simpsons and futurama david wiegand of san francisco chronicle found writing not funny writing that he could not see jon heder s expressionless face as he talked in animation staten island advance said change to animation freed napoleon from real world limitations but thought it lessen ed overall appeal of character and setting lori of chicago sun times did not like movie and liked animated series even less she thought emotions and physical humor were lost in change to animation brian lowry of variety gave show a neutral review to say show represents an improvement over allen gregory is not much of an endorsement but there is something amusing about heder s monotonic voice and napoleon s utter lack of self awareness along with fast paced gags like a miniature golf course where hitting ball into hitler s mouth wins a free round robert bianco of usa today called first episode a vulgarized premiere that detracted from film s qualities but called second one a sweeter funnier improvement mary mcnamara of los angeles times wrote of pacing that satirical silence or non sequitur scenes slowly compiled to establish tone in film but were sacrificed for faster pace of a network tv show simon moore of flickering myth disagreed faster pace was to show s detriment calling film s snail like pace
