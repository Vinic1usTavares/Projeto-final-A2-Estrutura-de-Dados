new york state route 414 ny 414 is a north south state highway in southern tier and finger lakes regions of new york in united states it extends for from an intersection with ny 352 in steuben county city of corning to a junction with ny 104 in wayne county town of huron ny 414 spans five counties and roughly parallels ny 14 between watkins glen and huron it intersects every major east west arterial in western new york including southern tier expressway interstate 86 i 86 and ny 17 u s route 20 us 20 and ny 5 and new york state thruway i 90 route passes through mostly rural areas as it travels between several villages and cities along its routing in 1930 renumbering of state highways in new york portion of modern ny 414 south of seneca falls was designated as part of new york state route 44 a route extending from caton to wolcott while most of what is now ny 414 north of seneca falls became part of ny 89 ny 44 was renumbered to ny 414 to eliminate numerical duplication with us 44 ny 414 was shifted onto its current alignment between seneca falls and huron on april 30 1959 placing it on what had been ny 89 north of hamlet of magee and new york state route 89a between magee and overlapped routes of us 20 and ny 5 route description steuben and chemung counties ny 414 begins at an intersection with ny 352 denison parkway in steuben county city of corning it initially heads north on cedar street following it past two largely commercial blocks that make up part of market street historic district past district route changes names to centerway and crosses over chemung river which flows east west through center of corning across river route traverses more commercial neighborhoods to reach pulteney street designated as ny 415 west of this point along this stretch ny 414 passes former corning armory and corning museum of glass latter located on southwest corner of junction with ny 415 right thumb ny 414 at its southern terminus in city of corning route continues on meeting southern tier expressway ste at exit 46 composition of exit s ramps is unorthodox in that westbound on ramp for i 86 and ny 17 is about north of remainder of interchange this layout is caused by several factors including a nearby wye connecting two norfolk southern railway lines east west southern tier line and north south corning secondary another is alignment of ste itself which runs in close proximity to ny 414 for a short distance as it bypasses northern corning while avoiding hilly terrain north of city north of ste amount of development along highway significantly decreases as it follows corning secondary northeastward into mountains that surround city of corning over next ny 414 and rail line head due northeast through a valley surrounding post creek traversing rural isolated areas as both cross into chemung county past county line valley turns to north reflecting a similar curve in creek s routing ny 414 and corning secondary turn to match and route passes over rail line via a bridge just east of county line as highway heads north it runs parallel to county line for and passes through hamlet of chambers only developed location along an otherwise nondescript and undeveloped stretch that leads to schuyler county and town of dix schuyler county thumb left ny 414 northbound past cr 16 south of watkins glen in dix ny 414 makes a large reverse s curve turning to east and northeast as it follows corning secondary through another creek valley this one surrounding creek creek eventually heads east toward montour falls however ny 414 and rail line continue northeast to outskirts of watkins glen a village located inside of a wide valley holding seneca lake at western edge of gully corning secondary breaks from ny 414 to follow ridge north through watkins glen state park route meanwhile descends side of valley to enter watkins glen where it merges with ny 14 at foot of hill as one road ny 14 and ny 414 travel down franklin street main thoroughfare of watkins glen routes pass by several blocks of homes as they follow western base of ravine and meet east end of ny 329 which ascends side of valley to serve watkins glen state park ny 414 continues to follow ny 14 to watkins glen s central business district where ny 414 splits from overlap to travel east at an intersection that also acts as eastern terminus of ny 409 from this point north ny 14 and ny 414 follow opposite sides of seneca lake with ny 414 running along east lake shore thumb ny 414 southbound in hector just past ny 79 junction this section of route overlooks seneca lake at right as it heads downhill route initially heads east from watkins glen to skirt southern edge of lake but turns north upon exiting village and passing southeastern tip of waterbody just outside watkins glen ny 414 comes to a fork left fork carries ny 414 to foot of valley bringing it very close to seneca lake right fork holds ny 79 which travels up side of valley toward village of burdett ny 414 continues to parallel seneca lake but gradually ascends side of lake valley as it heads north through town of hector and enters seneca county seneca county soon after entering seneca county ny 414 turns to northeast traveling away from seneca lake it continues on a northeast alignment across more level terrain to village of lodi where it intersects and forms an overlap with ny 96a two routes head due north from lodi crossing relatively flat farmland to reach neighboring village of ovid at northern edge of community ny 96a splits from concurrency at a junction that also features ny 96 while ny 96a travels to west ny 96 which enters ovid from east forms a concurrency with ny 414 and follows latter north out of village overlap continues for across more farmland to a junction east of seneca army depot ny 96 heads northwest to straddle eastern border of depot while ny 414 progresses northward through sparsely populated towns of romulus and varick left thumb us 20 ny 5 and ny 414 in seneca falls at varick fayette town line north of ny 96 ny 414 intersects eastern terminus of ny 336 route continues into fayette serving town center and several large farms on its way into town of seneca falls just past town line highway connects to finger lakes regional airport and passes by a large field that hosts annual empire farm days exhibition every august north of here is hamlet of seneca falls where farmlands are replaced by densely populated residential blocks highway follows ovid street across cayuga seneca canal to village center where it intersects us 20 and ny 5 at fall street ny 414 turns west here following both routes through northwestern portion of seneca falls here route passes national women s hall of fame and women s rights national historical park west of village us 20 ny 5 and ny 414 become a major commercial strip as it heads through an area situated between hamlet of seneca falls and village of waterloo roughly midway between two communities ny 414 splits from us 20 and ny 5 becoming a commercial strip itself as it heads north through northern portion of town of seneca falls as mound road near northern end of strip route crosses main line of finger lakes railway at a grade crossing past crossing businesses give way to mostly undeveloped areas that persist into neighboring town of tyre where it intersects ny 318 in small hamlet of magee as ridge road just north of this intersection ny 414 intersects new york state thruway i 90 at exit 41 north of thruway ny 414 maintains a constant north northwest alignment across rolling farmland into wayne county wayne county thumb upright both ends of ny 414 s very short overlap with ny 31 in clyde across county line ny 414 veers slightly to west and east as it heads north across rural terrain to village of clyde located on erie canal and csx transportation owned rochester subdivision route traverses lightly populated southern half of village prior to crossing canal and railroad to enter village s center as it proceeds through clyde s business district ny 414 intersects ny 31 overlapping route for just as ny 31 moves from park to genesee streets ny 414 meanwhile continues north through community on glasgow street passing several blocks of homes and clyde savannah central school district s combined middle and high schools before exiting clyde for more rural regions of wayne county north of clyde ny 414 intersects a number of roads of local importance as it heads north northwest across gentle terrain in mostly open towns of galen and rose as main street aside from rose and north rose two communities of note along ny 414 between clyde and route s end ny 414 traverses little more than nondescript cultivated fields in latter hamlet ny 414 crosses ontario midland railroad at a grade crossing in center of community route ends about north of north rose at an intersection with ny 104 in town of huron located at southern tip of sodus bay while ny 414 ends here right of way of highway continues north along eastern edge of bay to lake ontario shoreline as county maintained lake bluff road history origins in 1908 new york state legislature created route 36 an unsigned legislative route extending from owego to seneca falls via ovid from ovid north to seneca falls route 36 followed what is now ny 414 via ny 96 and county route 148 or cr 148 in romulus portion of modern ny 414 between watkins glen and ovid became route 45 on june 16 1911 however route was realigned one year later to use what is now ny 96a from lodi to interlaken instead when first set of posted routes in new york were assigned in 1924 owego interlaken and ovid romulus segments of legislative route 36 became part of ny 15 which continued northwest from romulus to rochester from interlaken to ovid ny 15 initially followed post 1912 alignment of legislative route 45 to lodi and pre 1912 routing of route 45 to ovid thumb left upright reassurance markers and an old n y state highway marker along ny 96a and ny 414 in lodi portion of legislative route 45 south of lodi remained unnumbered until when it was designated as ny 78 by 1929 route was extended northward over a new highway that followed eastern edge of seneca lake between ovid and geneva also altered by this time was ny 15 which was realigned to follow what had been legislative route 36 from interlaken to ovid former routing of ny 15 between lodi and ovid became part of extended ny 78 remainder of what is now ny 414 south of watkins glen and north of romulus remained unnumbered until 1930 renumbering of state highways in new york even though parts of highway were state maintained as early as 1926 among these state maintained but unnumbered segments was romulus seneca falls section of old route 36 another significant section of continuous state maintenance existed from clyde to huron designation in 1930 renumbering ny 78 was split into two new routes north of ovid it served as basis for ny 15a which continued southeast to interlaken over original alignment of ny 15 remainder of ny 78 became part of ny 44 a lengthy north south route extending from ny 13 in caton to ridge road then ny 3 and later us 104 in wolcott from caton to watkins glen ny 44 was assigned to what is now ny 225 and ny 414 north of romulus route utilized alignment of legislative route 36 from romulus to seneca falls and modern ny 89 from a junction east of seneca falls to wolcott in vicinity of seneca falls ny 44 overlapped with us 20 and ny 5 us 44 was assigned in april 1935 as a result ny 44 was renumbered to ny 414 to eliminate numerical duplication with new u s highway also assigned as part of 1930 renumbering was ny 89 which utilized modern ny 414 north of hamlet of magee and portion of lake bluff road between current ny 104 super two and ridge road between magee and its current alignment east of village of seneca falls ny 89 used what is now ny 318 automobile legal association ala automobile green

ny 89 in magee and a junction with us 20 and ny 5 midway between waterloo and seneca falls was designated ny 89a this route became part of a larger realignment of ny 414 on april 30 1959 in rerouting ny 414 was altered to overlap us 20 and ny 5 west out of seneca falls before following what had been ny 89a and ny 89 north to us 104 ridge road near huron hamlet of resort ny 89 meanwhile was realigned to follow former alignment of ny 414 to wolcott thumb ny 414 north at ny 318 in tyre during mid 1950s this was northern terminus of ny 89a ny 414 has been truncated twice over years first of these occurred on january 1 1949 when it was cut back on its southern end to corning ny 414 was truncated to its current northern terminus in mid 1960s following construction of super two highway for us 104 between sodus and ny 414 us 104 continued to use former alignment of ny 414 along lake bluff road to connect to ridge road until remainder of super two east to red creek was completed in early 1970s this portion of lake bluff road is now maintained by wayne county as cr 254 in seneca county ny 414 was realigned slightly in early 1950s to bypass hamlet of romulus to east moving it off cr 148 and ny 96 and onto a new road leading directly to ovid corning area in city of corning ny 44 and later ny 414 originally entered from north on baker street and met ny 17 at pulteney street two routes then overlapped along pulteney street to centerway where they crossed chemung river via centerway and pine street at market street ny 17 and ny 44 turned east and remained concurrent to street where ny 44 headed south to caton while ny 17 continued east on market to hamlet of gibson when overlap through corning was eliminated in 1949 ny 414 was truncated to western end of overlap at intersection of baker and pulteney streets ny 414 was re extended across chemung river in mid 1960s after ny 17 was moved onto denison parkway a new divided highway through corning that bypassed pulteney street ny 414 followed its original routing across river to market street then continued south on pine street for an additional block to intersect ny 17 portion of ny 414 south of pulteney street was realigned slightly following completion of briscoe bridge across chemung river instead of entering downtown corning on pine street ny 414 used cedar street instead national bridge inventory a database compiled by united states department of transportation federal highway administration available at www nationalbridges com accessed april 4 2009 when corning bypass part of southern tier expressway was built in mid 1990s baker street was split into two segments ny 414 was subsequently rerouted onto its current alignment through city major intersections see also list of county routes in seneca county new
