vojtech jarnik 1897 1970 was a czech mathematician who worked for many years as a professor and administrator at charles university and helped found czechoslovak academy of sciences he is namesake of jarnik s algorithm for minimum spanning trees jarnik worked in number theory mathematical analysis and graph algorithms he has been called probably first czechoslovak mathematician whose scientific works received wide and lasting international response as well as developing jarnik s algorithm he found tight bounds on number of lattice points on convex curves studied relationship between hausdorff dimension of sets of real numbers and how well they can be approximated by rational numbers and investigated properties of nowhere differentiable functions education and career jarnik was born december 22 1897 he was son of a professor of romance language philology at charles university p 168 and his older brother jarnik also became a professor of linguistics despite this background jarnik learned no latin at his gymnasium c k ceske gymnasium prague so when he entered charles university in 1915 he had to do so as an extraordinary student until he could pass a latin examination three semesters later he studied mathematics and physics at charles university from 1915 to 1919 with karel petr as a mentor after completing his studies he became an assistant to jan vojtech at brno university of technology where he also met mathias lerch in 1921 he completed a doctoral degree at charles university with a dissertation on bessel functions supervised by petr then returned to charles university as petr s assistant while keeping his position at charles university he studied with edmund landau at university of gottingen from 1923 to 1925 and again from 1927 to 1929 and however o connor and robertson give his return dates as 1924 and 1928 on his first return to charles university he defended his habilitation and on his return from second visit he was given a chair in mathematics as an extraordinary professor he was promoted to full professor in 1935 and later served as dean of sciences 1947 1948 and vice rector 1950 1953 he retired in 1968 jarnik supervised dissertations of 16 doctoral students notable among these are miroslav a chess master who became rector of charles university jaroslav kurzweil known for kurzweil integral and slovak mathematician tibor salat he died september 22 1970 contributions although jarnik s 1921 dissertation like some of his later publications was in mathematical analysis his main area of work was in number theory he studied gauss circle problem and proved a number of results on diophantine approximation lattice point problems and geometry of numbers he also made pioneering but long neglected contributions to combinatorial optimization number theory thumb upright a convex curve through 13 integer lattice points gauss circle problem asks for number of points of integer lattice enclosed by a given circle one of jarnik s theorems 1926 related to this problem is that any convex curve with length passes through at most points of integer lattice in this formula is an instance of big o notation neither exponent of nor leading constant of this bound can be improved as there exist convex curves with this many grid points another theorem of jarnik in this area shows that for any closed convex curve in plane with a well defined length absolute difference between area it encloses and number of integer points it encloses is at most its length jarnik also published several results in diophantine approximation study of approximation of real numbers by rational numbers he proved 1928 1929 that badly approximable real numbers ones with bounded terms in their continued fractions have hausdorff dimension one this is same dimension as set of all real numbers intuitively suggesting that set of badly approximable numbers is large he also considered numbers for which there exist infinitely many good rational approximations with for a given exponent and proved 1929 that these have smaller hausdorff dimension second of these results was later rediscovered by besicovitch besicovitch used different methods than jarnik to prove it and result has come to be known as jarnik besicovitch theorem see theorem 1 33 jarnik besicovitch theorem p 23 and discussion following theorem mathematical analysis jarnik s work in real analysis was sparked by finding in unpublished works of bernard bolzano a definition of a continuous function that was nowhere differentiable bolzano s 1830 discovery predated 1872 publication of weierstrass function previously considered to be first example of such a function based on his study of bolzano s function jarnik was led to a more general theorem if a real valued function of a closed interval does not have bounded variation in any subinterval then there is a dense subset of its domain on which at least one of its dini derivatives is infinite this applies in particular to nowhere differentiable functions as they must have unbounded variation in all intervals later after learning of a result by stefan banach and stefan mazurkiewicz that generic functions that is members of a residual set of functions are nowhere differentiable jarnik proved that at almost all points all four dini derivatives of such a function are infinite much of his later work in this area concerned extensions of these results to approximate derivatives combinatorial optimization thumb upright animation of jarnik s algorithm for minimum spanning trees in computer science and combinatorial optimization jarnik is known for an algorithm for constructing minimum spanning trees that he published in 1930 in response to publication of boruvka s algorithm by another czech mathematician otakar boruvka see in particular page 127 soon after boruvka s published his solution another czech mathematician vojtech jarnik reacted by publishing his own solution and page 133 jarnik s article on this topic is an extract from a letter to o boruvka jarnik s algorithm builds a tree from a single starting vertex of a given weighted graph by repeatedly adding cheapest connection to any other vertex until all vertices have been connected same algorithm was later rediscovered in late 1950s by robert c prim and edsger w dijkstra it is also known as prim s algorithm or prim dijkstra algorithm he also published a second related paper with 1934 on euclidean steiner tree problem in this problem one must again form a tree connecting a given set of points with edge costs given by euclidean distance however additional points that are not part of input may be added to make overall tree shorter this paper is first serious treatment of general steiner tree problem although it appears earlier in a letter by gauss and it already contains virtually all general properties of steiner trees later attributed to other researchers recognition and legacy jarnik was a member of czech academy of sciences and arts from 1934 as an extraordinary member and from 1946 as a regular member in 1952 he became one of founding members of czechoslovak academy of sciences he was also awarded czechoslovak state prize in 1952 thumb upright 1 3 jarnikova street jarnikova bus stop and a commemorative sign honoring jarnik vojtech jarnik international mathematical competition held each year since 1991 in ostrava is named in his honor as is jarnikova street in district of prague a series of postage stamps published by czechoslovakia in 1987 to honor 125th anniversary of union of czechoslovak mathematicians and physicists included one stamp featuring jarnik together with joseph and a conference was held in prague in march 1998 to honor centennial of his birth selected publications jarnik published 90 papers in mathematics including a function with unbounded variation in all intervals has a dense set of points where a dini derivative is infinite tight bounds on number of integer points on a convex curve as a function of its length badly approximable numbers have hausdorff dimension one well approximable numbers have hausdorff dimension less than one original

ten textbooks in czech on integral calculus differential equations and mathematical analysis these books became classics for several generations of students references further reading external links
