four improvised tracks inspired by john coltrane s giant steps paseo iluminado paseo en media luz paseo azul and paseo morado iluminado improv 1 according to roberto r calder of popmatters has stock phrasing but a pause in concentration before sublime quality of a one minute lullaby worth waiting for media luz improv 2 hints at jazz with concert room sonorities and a striking ending azul improv 3 proceeds with more consistent direction than its two predecessors and becomes a hymn and morado improv 4 develops into long linear passages for each hand faro is a track with a simple ostinato bass a transition section and a loud climax opening track rezo is an interlude inspired by work of french composer claude debussy and american performer duke ellington and is based on afro cuban melodies sung during santeria rites silencio is a tribute to cuban boleros prologue to a fantasy features a congenial intellectual playfulness alternating between something like spanish piano music of a

and a more complex higher level of communication than original version here s that rainy day is a jazz ballad recorded earlier for album inner voyage with an arrangement described as breathtaking by ken dryden of allmusic first version of quasar can be found on paseo 2004 and version included on solo is described as seven minutes of drama by calder of popmatters with a sprawling improv heavy

handed assault he also demonstrates a profound awareness of space and dynamics and finally called album stunning joey guerra of amazon said that solo finds rubalcaba soaring on strength of his own talent creating a unique experience website allmusic stated that album is a spellbinding collection of improvisations with remarkable stylistic display harvey siders of jazztimes commented that album did not need elaborate arrangements being a spontaneous inner dialogue from a brilliant inquisitive mind and that on solo elegance trumps excitement popmatters robert r calder stated that record was a very remarkable solo piano recital david miller of all about jazz gave album a mixed review being critical of entertainment value stating that performer is more introspective than ever frequently using silence as his means of expression only problem is it doesn t necessarily work miller also suggested that rubalcaba should develop his ideas in more conventional settings he still has time to become a great solo artist and this writer has every confidence that he will in a separate review jim also of all about jazz praised solo commenting that rubalcaba finds space in his exploratory interpretation for dreamy soliloquies but excitement is all there and it s powerful pianist makes us wait for this moment and it s always worth anticipation ultimately he lights an inspiring fire mark
