based webzine com au reviewer andrew weaver comments on song s musical layering coupling song with wishing on same moon and comments that layering in two songs gives music genuine depth of sound and taking veteran group to new places citysearch sydney also made reference to likeness to wishing on same moon but notes that what sets two songs apart is a serviceable fade out cacophony of keys and guitar music journalist chris leonard of uk magazine rock louder praises live performance of song while powderfinger performed in glasgow on 11 december 2007 j watson of fasterlouder com au comments that song when performed live at sydney opera house forecourt for charity on 31 october 2007 was another highlight of evening fellow reviewer from fasterlouder comments on song s sparse pink floyd esque sound which echoes through who really cares as clever a rock ballad as band have ever written andrew of mess noise echoed comments of similarities to pink floyd and also neil young stating where psych gospel organ and wailing guitar billow around fanning s vocals like a lost track from dark side of moon though most of critical response has been positive song has also received criticism from uk reviewer matthias scherer of noize makes enemies scherer notes that song s title who really cares is a question that should have been asked before recording not during though this comment refers both to song itself and whole album of dream days at hotel existence charts song s critical response has been mostly positive though so too were two prior singles from dream days at hotel existence which both performed poorly in charts like these two who really cares was released to radioplay and music video stations but with little inclusion in circulation leading speculators to believe single will follow i don t remember and nobody sees with poor charting performance this speculation proved to be accurate leading to who really cares to be first single by powderfinger since their 2004 release bless my soul to fail to achieve a position on aria charts although b side one more kiss as you fly away was number 81 on aria charts track listing who really cares featuring sound of insanity
