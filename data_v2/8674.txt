sarcoscypha coccinea commonly known as scarlet elf cup scarlet elf cap or scarlet cup is a species of fungus in family sarcoscyphaceae of order pezizales fungus widely distributed in northern hemisphere has been found in africa asia europe north and south america and australia type species of genus sarcoscypha s coccinea has been known by many names since its first appearance in scientific literature in 1772 phylogenetic analysis shows species to be most closely related to other sarcoscypha species that contain numerous small oil droplets in their spores such as north atlantic island species s macaronesica due to similar physical appearances and sometimes overlapping distributions s coccinea has often been confused with s occidentalis s austriaca and s dudleyi saprobic fungus grows on decaying sticks and branches in damp spots on forest floors generally buried under leaf litter or in soil cup shaped fruit bodies are usually produced during cooler months of winter and early spring brilliant red interior of cups from which both common and scientific names are derived contrasts with lighter colored exterior edibility of fruit bodies is not clearly established but its small size tough texture and insubstantial fruitings would dissuade most people from collecting for table fungus has been used medicinally by oneida native americans and also as a colorful component of table decorations in england molliardiomyces eucoccinea is name given to imperfect form of fungus that lacks a sexually reproductive stage in its life cycle taxonomy naming and phylogeny species was originally named helvella coccinea by italian naturalist giovanni antonio scopoli in 1772 other early names include peziza coccinea nikolaus joseph von jacquin 1774 and peziza dichroa theodor holmskjold 1799 although some authors in older literature have applied generic name plectania to taxon following karl fuckel s 1870 name change e g seaver 1928 1948 nannfeldt 1949 le gal 1953 that name is now used for a fungus with brownish black fruit bodies sarcoscypha coccinea was given its current name by jean baptiste emil lambotte in 1889 thumb left drawings by jean louis emile boudier obligate synonyms different names for same species based on one type include lachnea coccinea gillet 1880 macroscyphus coccineus gray 1821 and peziza dichroa holmskjold 1799 taxonomic synonyms different names for same species based on different types include peziza aurantia schumacher 1803 peziza aurantiaca persoon 1822 peziza coccinea jacquin 1774 helvella coccinea schaeffer 1774 lachnea coccinea phillips 1887 geopyxis coccinea massee 1895 sarcoscypha coccinea saccardo ex durand 1900 plectania coccinea fuckel ex seaver and peziza batsch 1783 sarcoscypha coccinea is type species of genus sarcoscypha having been first explicitly designated as such in 1931 by frederick clements and cornelius lott shear korf and harrington 1990 citing a 1990 publication revealed that genus name sarcoscypha had been used previously by carl f p von martius as name of a tribe in genus peziza according to rules of botanical nomenclature this meant that generic name peziza had priority over sarcoscypha to address taxonomical dilemma genus name sarcoscypha was conserved against peziza with s coccinea as type species to avoid creation of a new generic name for scarlet cups and also to avoid disadvantageous loss of a generic name widely used in popular and scientific literature specific epithet coccinea is derived from latin word meaning deep red species is commonly known as scarlet elf cup scarlet elf cap or scarlet cup fungus s coccinea var jurana was described by jean boudier 1903 as a variety of species having a brighter and more orange colored fruit body and with flattened or blunt ended ascospores today it is known as distinct species s jurana s coccinea var albida named by george edward massee in 1903 as geopyxis coccinea var albida has a cream colored rather than red interior surface but is otherwise identical to typical variety within large area that includes temperate to alpine boreal zone of northern hemisphere europe and north america only s coccinea had been recognized until 1980s however it had been known since early 1900s that there existed several macroscopically indistinguishable taxa with various microscopic differences distribution and number of oil droplets in fresh spores germination behavior and spore shape detailed analysis and comparison of fresh specimens revealed that what had been collectively called s coccinea actually consisted of four distinct species s austriaca s coccinea s dudleyi and s jurana phylogenetic relationships in genus sarcoscypha were analyzed by francis harrington in late 1990s her cladistic analysis combined comparisons of sequences of internal transcribed spacer in non functional rna with fifteen traditional morphological characteristics such as spore features fruit body shape and degree of curliness of hairs that form tomentum based on her analysis s coccinea is part of a clade that includes species s austriaca s macaronesica s and s all of these sarcoscypha species have numerous small oil droplets in their spores its closest relative s macaronesica is found on canary islands and madeira harrington hypothesized that most recent common ancestor of two species originated in europe and was later dispersed to macaronesian islands description initially spherical fruit bodies are later shallowly saucer or cup shaped with rolled in rims and measure in diameter inner surface of cup is deep red fading to orange when dry and smooth while outer surface is whitish and covered with a dense matted layer of tiny hairs a tomentum stipe when present is stout and up to long if deeply buried by thick and whitish with a tomentum color variants of fungus exist that have reduced or absent pigmentation these forms may be orange yellow or even white as in variety albida in netherlands white fruit bodies have been found growing in polders thumb right stalks and outer surface are lighter in color than interior sarcoscypha coccinea is one of several fungi whose fruit bodies have been noted to make a puffing sound an audible manifestation of spore discharge where thousands of asci simultaneously explode to release a cloud of spores buller 1958 pp 329 31 retrieved 2010 08 22 spores are 26 40 by 10 12 um elliptical smooth hyaline translucent and have small lipid droplets concentrated at either end droplets are refractive to light and visible with light microscopy in older dried specimens such as herbarium material droplets may coalesce and hinder identification of species depending on their geographical origin spores may have a delicate mucilaginous sheath or envelope european specimens are devoid of an envelope while specimens from north america invariably have one asci are long and cylindrical and taper into a short stem like base they measure 300 375 by 14 16 um although in most pezizales all of ascospores are formed simultaneously through delimitation by an inner and outer membrane in s coccinea ascospores located in basal parts of ascus develop faster paraphyses sterile filamentous hyphae present in hymenium are about 3 um wide and only slightly thickened at apex and contain red pigment granules anamorph form anamorphic or imperfect fungi are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle and typically reproduce by process of mitosis in structures called conidia in some cases sexual stage or teleomorph stage is later identified and a teleomorph anamorph relationship is established between species international code of nomenclature for algae fungi and plants permits recognition of two or more names for one and same organism one based on teleomorph other s restricted to anamorph name of anamorphic state of s coccinea is molliardiomyces eucoccinea first described by marin molliard in 1904 molliard found growth of conidia to resemble those of genera coryne and rather than and he considered that this suggested an affinity between sarcoscypha and family helvellaceae in 1972 john w paden again described anamorph but like molliard failed to give a complete description of species in 1984 paden created a new genus he named molliardiomyces to contain anamorphic forms of several sarcoscypha species and set molliardiomyces eucoccinea as type species this form produces colorless conidiophores specialized stalks that bear conidia that are usually irregularly branched measuring 30 110 by 3 2 4 7 um conidia are ellipsoidal to egg shaped smooth translucent hyaline and 4 8 16 0 by 2 3 5 8 um they tend to accumulate in mucilaginous masses similar species similar species include s dudleyi and s austriaca and in literature confusion amongst three is common examination of microscopic features is often required to definitively differentiate between species sarcoscypha occidentalis has smaller cups 0 5 2 0 cm wide a more pronounced stalk that is 1 3 cm long and a smooth exterior surface unlike s coccinea it is only found in new world and in east and midwest north america but not in far west it also occurs in central america and caribbean in north america s austriaca and s dudleyi are found in eastern regions of continent s dudleyi has elliptical spores with rounded ends that are 25 33 by 12 14 um and completely sheathed when fresh s austriaca has elliptical spores that are 29 36 by 12 15 um that are not completely sheathed when fresh but have small polar caps on either end macaronesian species s macaronesica frequently misidentified as s coccinea has smaller spores typically measuring 20 5 28 by 7 3 11 um and smaller fruit bodies up to wide ecology habitat and distribution a saprobic species sarcoscypha coccinea grows on decaying woody material from various plants rose family beech hazel willow elm and in mediterranean oak fruit bodies of s coccinea are often found growing singly or clustered in groups on buried or partly buried sticks in deciduous forests a hungarian study noted that fungus was found mainly on twigs of european hornbeam carpinus betulus that were typically less than long fruit bodies growing on sticks above ground tend to be smaller than those on buried wood mushrooms that are sheltered from wind also grow larger than their more exposed counterparts fruit bodies are persistent and may last for several weeks if weather is cool time required for development of fruit bodies has been estimated to be about 24 weeks although it was noted that maximum life span may well be more than 24 weeks because decline of colonies seemed to be associated more with sunny windy weather rather than with old age one field guide calls fungus a welcome sight after a long desperate winter and harbinger of a new year of mushrooming common over much of northern hemisphere s coccinea occurs in midwest in valleys between pacific coast sierra nevada and cascade range its north american distribution extends north to various locations in canada and south to mexican state jalisco fungus has also been collected from chile in south america it is also found in old world europe africa asia australia and india specimens collected from macaronesian islands that once thought to be s coccinea were later determined to be distinct species s macaronesica a 1995 study of occurrence of british sarcoscypha including s coccinea and s austriaca concluded that s coccinea was becoming very rare in great britain all species of sarcoscypha including s coccinea are red listed in europe in turkey it is considered critically endangered chemistry thumb right near north wales red color of fruit bodies is caused by five types of carotenoid pigments including and b carotene carotenoids are lipid soluble and are stored within granules in paraphyses british canadian mycologist arthur henry reginald buller suggested that pigments in fruit bodies exposed to sun absorb some of sun s rays raising temperature of hymenium hastening development of ascus and subsequent spore discharge buller 1958 p 301 retrieved 2010 08 22 lectins are sugar binding proteins that are used in blood typing biochemical studies and medical research a lectin has been purified and characterized from s coccinea fruit bodies that can bind selectively to several specific carbohydrate molecules including lactose uses sarcoscypha coccinea was used as a medicinal fungus by oneida indians and possibly by other tribes of iroquois six nations fungus after being dried and ground up into a powder was applied as a styptic particularly to navels of newborn children that were not healing properly after umbilical cord had been severed pulverized fruit bodies were also kept under bandages made of soft tanned deerskin in scarborough england fruit bodies used to be arranged with moss and leaves and sold as a table decoration species is said to be edible inedible or not recommended depending on author although its insubstantial fruit body and low numbers do not make it particularly suitable for table one source claims children in jura are said to eat it raw on bread and butter and one french author suggests adding cups with a little kirsch to a fresh fruit salad fruit bodies have been noted to be a source of food for rodents in winter and slugs in summer references cited books external links
