schinas died by falling out of a police station window either by murder or by suicide details of schinas s life before assassination are unclear he was a native greek but his birthplace is disputed likely either in area of volos or serres he may have been a medical student teacher unlicensed doctor chemistry shop assistant waiter beggar or none of these several years before assassination schinas may have left greece for new york city returning in february 1913 some contemporary sources reported that he advocated anarchism or socialism and ran an anarchist school that was shut down by greek

confirmed about schinas s life before he assassinated king george i he was born in 1870s possibly in volos serres or kanalia he had two sisters one older and one younger and may have had a brother named hercules who ran a chemist shop in volos where schinas may have worked as an assistant schinas told an interviewer that he suffered from an unspecified neurological condition beginning at age 14 schinas may have studied or taught medicine in athens possibly at national and university of athens after leaving athens schinas and his sisters taught in greek village kleisoura before a dispute with

lawyer were sentenced to three months in prison for reasons unknown schinas was not punished according to botassi during this period schinas also stood unsuccessfully as a candidate for office of deputy from volos in greek legislative body botassi s account was disputed by batznoulis in a letter to atlantis a greek paper in new york which was republished by new york times shortly after assassination batznoulis claimed that schinas was born in kanalia not volos according to batznoulis s letter it was not alexandros schinas who ran for office in volos but another person named george schinas batznoulis disputed that alexandros schinas was involved in centre for workingmen school in volos writing schinas had nothing to do with any school and had no idea of entering politics he was known as a man who loved isolation and his backgammon he wore a beard and was an anarchist alt volos c 1900 left thumb volos c 1900 schinas reportedly spent some time living in united states schinas stated in an interview that in 1910 he was deported from thessaloniki then under ottoman rule by young turks because i was a good greek patriot botassi suggested another explanation for schinas s departure to us that he was evading police following closure of centre for workingmen school in volos batznoulis on other hand wrote that schinas left because of a family quarrel with his brother hercules whatever reason a number of contemporary sources suggest that schinas lived in new york city and worked at fifth avenue hotel and plaza hotel before returning to greece in february 1913 no known immigration or other records document schinas s deportation from thessaloniki or arrival in new york in 1910 however immigration records document arrival of a 36 year old man named athanasios schinas approximately same age as alexandros schinas would have been at time a former resident of greece arriving at ellis island aboard ship la gascogne from le havre france on october 30 1905 it is unclear whether athanasios schinas was same person as alexandros or whether alexandros travelled under an assumed name to avoid detection by greek authorities an article in new york times puts schinas in greece in 1911 stating that he applied that year for assistance at king s palace but was refused and driven off by palace guards although it is uncertain when why or even whether he moved to new york city schinas was back in greece by february 1913 according to post assassination newspaper articles about three weeks before assassination he traveled from athens to volos then to thessaloniki

never been revealed nor has schinas s testimony in depositions to authorities a fire broke out on steamship carrying them to piraeus it is reported that in a private conversation with king s widow queen olga he stated that he had acted alone but most historians take view that he acted on behalf of foreign interests in balkans that benefited from king s murder schinas shot george once in back at point blank range with a seven cylinder revolver states two shots were fired bullet entered below shoulder blade pierced heart and lungs and exited abdomen george collapsed and was taken by carriage

died by falling out of a window from office of examining magistrate of gendarmerie in thessaloniki he was approximately 43 years old gendarmerie reported that schinas who was not handcuffed at time ran and jumped out of window when guards were distracted some suggest schinas may have committed suicide to avoid further gendarmerie examinations or a slow death from tuberculosis others speculate that he was thrown from window by gendarmerie greek newspaper has reported that schinas gave depositions before his death but they were lost in a fire aboard a ship while being transported after his death his ear and hand were amputated and used for identification then stored and exhibited at criminology museum of athens motives thumb a 1920 postcard depicting assassination schinas is understood to have been in his later life a homeless alcoholic with anarchist beliefs accordingly his motivation for assassination is commonly ascribed to his anarchist politics as propaganda of deed or to mental illness without political motivation ultimately historical record is inconclusive political schinas has been described as an anarchist and a socialist march 19 1913 initial report of george s assassination in new york times described schinas as a socialist who declared that he is against governments however it also described him as a feeble intellect and of low mental type who states that he was driven to desperation by sickness and want concluding crime therefore was without motive thumb right march 19 1913 new york times headline describing schinas as a socialist following day new york times published an article from its baltimore and new york bureaus quoting three witnesses first was a waiter who said he worked with schinas at fifth avenue hotel in new york and who described schinas as a socialist a communist a radical and an atheist second was greek consul general for new york demetrios botassi who told newspaper that schinas was a man of education an anarchist and an atheist according to greeks who knew him well same day new york times published a statement from greek minister in london that schinas was a victim of alcoholism and that assassination cannot be ascribed to any political motive thumb right march 20 1913 new york times headline describing schinas as an anarchist a third article published in march 20 1913 new york times stated that schinas is not a madman but apparently is weak minded and that he led a wretched existence subsisting almost entirely on milk according to article schinas visited shortly before assassination and declared that in a short time he would succeed in establishing equality that there would no longer be either rich or poor and that work which was now accomplished in one hour would be spread out over two article stated that schinas told interrogators he assassinated king because i had to die somehow as i suffer from neurasthenia and therefore wished to redeem my life on march 21 1913 new york times published batznoulis s letter to atlantis generally disputing botassi s earlier account but nevertheless describing schinas as an anarchist along with a statement from solon vlasto editor of atlantis endorsing batznoulis s account and suggesting that many conflicting stories concerning schinas s identity may be due to fact that schinas is a common surname in greece and there were likely multiple people named aleko schinas schinas was interviewed in march 1913 and asked question are you an anarchist to which he replied one recent scholar has doubted that schinas was an anarchist or that his actions were an example of propaganda by deed writing in 2018 michael kemp noted that both socialism and anarchism were used interchangeably at time and that reports of schinas as having run for political office or invested in a stock market do not support theories that schinas was either a socialist or an anarchist others have suggested schinas was a foreign agent bulgaria or ottoman empire bulgaria germany or ottoman empire austria hungary bulgaria or germany austria hungary macedonia bulgaria germany or ottoman empire bulgaria bulgaria or ottoman empire ottoman empire acting on behalf of austria hungary bulgaria germany ottoman empire or macedonian nationalists no evidence supporting these theories has emerged norwich bulletin reported that there were fears of bulgarian involvement but a message received at midnight dispelled such apprehensions by identifying assassin as a greek degenerate personal thumb schinas 1913 some have asserted that motive for assassination was revenge for king s refusal of request for assistance in 1911 or simply that schinas had lost an inherited fortune in greek stock market was in poor health and despondent prior to attack schinas has been described as an alcoholic weak minded a madman irresponsible and of unstable mind greek government released statements claiming that schinas was an alcoholic vagrant rural new yorker stated it is believed that assassin is mentally unbalanced and that crime was not result of any political conspiracy other reports referred to him as a man of education or an educated anarchist in a 1913 interview after his arrest schinas himself blamed deliriums brought on by tuberculosis saying more than a year after schinas s death new york times printed a retrospective article regarding recent political assassinations article did not list schinas among anarchists who believe in militant tactics instead describing george i s murderer as a greek named aleko schinas who probably was half demented a more recent scholar has written that rather than being part of a wider conspiracy whether political or enacted by a state alexandros schinas may have simply been a sick man both mentally and physically seeking an escape from harsh realities of early twentieth century another describes gendarmerie s torture of schinas as producing a confused confession that mixed anarchist sentiments with a claim that he had killed king because he refused to give him money some sources have described him simply as a greek named aleko schinas notes references as published in new york times a b c d e f g h ol
