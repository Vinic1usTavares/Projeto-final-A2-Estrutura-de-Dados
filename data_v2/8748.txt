indian heaven is a volcanic field in skamania county in state of washington in united states midway between mount st helens and mount adams field dates from pleistocene to early holocene epoch it trends north to south and is dominated by six small shield volcanoes these shields are topped by small spatter and cinder cones and field includes a number of subglacial volcanoes and tuyas northernmost peak in field is sawtooth mountain and southernmost is red mountain its highest point is lemei rock at an elevation of indian heaven features both polygenetic and monogenetic volcanic activity many of its volcanoes have only erupted once before coming extinct while others have erupted several times approximately 50 eruptive centers lie within indian heaven field which also has approximately 40 lava flows field s eruptive output totals with sporadic activity taking place for past 700 000 years last volcanic activity in field produced a large cinder cone big lava bed as well as a voluminous lava and scoria flows about 9 000 years ago future activity is possible though volcano hazards program directed by united states geological survey considers indian heaven s volcanic threat level to be low volcanic field is surrounded by indian heaven wilderness a protected wilderness area within gifford pinchot national forest supporting diverse flora and fauna local area has been inhabited by native american populations for about 10 000 years and name indian heaven derives from indigenous name for vicinity a popular recreation destination wilderness offers a number of trails as well as more than 150 lakes for fishing swimming and boating geography 200px thumb right indian heaven volcanic field and mount adams shown in a relief map located in skamania county in state of washington indian heaven volcanic field is part of high cascades an eastern segment of cascade range which trends north south formed towards end of pleistocene epoch these mountains are underlain by more ancient volcanoes that subsided due to parallel north south faulting in surrounding region indian heaven field lies east of vancouver washington and to north of columbia river indian heaven volcanic field lies between mount st helens and mount adams about southeast of latter simcoe mountains volcanic field is located to east to southwest lies a diffuse volcanic belt of at least 22 volcanic centers in length that runs in a southeast trending direction and includes marble mountain bare mountain west crater and trout creek hill field has a diameter of with a total area of tallest point within field is lemei rock shield volcano which reaches an elevation of wilderness indian heaven wilderness which encompasses an area of lies within a forested high plateau region it includes subalpine meadows volcanic field and a number of other volcanic features more than 150 lakes and forests created in 1984 by washington wilderness bill it sits between mount adams and columbia river gorge a canyon of columbia river part of gifford pinchot national forest wilderness area includes of pacific crest trail which traverses it from north to south as well as seven other tributary trails that form a network of trails area is relatively inaccessible as roads are covered by snow until june annually though snow melts by mid july in most years permitting visitors in fall season ecology plateau that contains indian heaven wilderness features forests which are predominantly made up of pacific silver fir noble fir and subalpine fir trees though there are also western red cedars mountain hemlock grand firs and engelmann spruce other flora found in vicinity include an understory of huckleberry plants and beargrass in addition to colorful wildflowers vine maples flowering plants such as blueberry heather vanilla leaf and false hellebore and aromatic many of area s lakes get stocked with trout species like cutthroat rainbow and brook trout amphibians such as frogs can be found in wilderness while terrestrial animals in area include deer elk and american black bears because of abundance of mosquitoes within vicinity indian heaven is sometimes informally referred to as insect heaven human history thumb indian racetrack within heaven wilderness indian heaven and surrounding wilderness area have played an important role in local native american life for about 10 000 years and vicinity was originally called tyee by native peoples which loosely translates to indian heaven sawtooth berry fields known globally for their huckleberries burned during late 1890s and again in 1902 later fires helped maintain fields by drying their berries from 1902 to mid 1920s local tribes including yakama klickitat wasco and umatilla as well as native american groups from montana and wyoming gathered in indian heaven area during summers for annual huckleberry feasts during these gatherings they celebrated traded and performed rituals they also raced horses played various games constructed baskets dried meat tanned hides and fished in local lakes in 1932 yakama nation and united states forest service agreed to set aside a portion of berry fields for exclusive indian use harvest remains an important local tradition today marks from race track a meadow used by native americans for horse racing can be seen about off segment of pacific crest trail that crosses through indian heaven wilderness trees within area have scars from where their bark was peeled for wood to make baskets area is also rich with large game animals and supports a number of roots and tuber plant species geology thumb 350px satellite map showing volcanoes of indian heaven volcanic field area near indian heaven vicinity is composed of western cascade rocks from eocene to miocene including andesite tuffs mud flows pyroclastic flow deposits and other volcaniclastic materials as well as high cascade rocks that date from between pliocene and holocene epochs strata of rock underlying area has been deformed to create faults fractures separations in geologic formation volcanic igneous intrusions and a gradual dipping syncline that trends north to south indian heaven field resides within syncline s trough and it consists of high cascade rocks which are far less altered than surrounding rock strata similar to other cascade volcanoes indian heaven volcanoes were fed by magma chambers produced by subduction of juan de fuca tectonic plate under western edge of north american tectonic plate indian heaven consists of several overlapping shield volcanoes that run along a line from sawtooth mountain at north to red mountain to south as well as cinder cones lava flows and spatter cones low steep sided hills or mounds that consist of welded lava fragments with a total magma output of field has about 50 mafic eruptive edifices rich in magnesium and iron whose activity lasted from pleistocene to early holocene roughly half of these vents mark a mountainous highland in length which runs parallel to north south trend of cascade arc in southern washington state most of volcanoes that comprise indian heaven field are monogenetic only erupting once before becoming extinct rest are polygenetic shield volcanoes about 80 percent of lava erupted by indian heaven volcanoes consists of basalt it represents most voluminous quaternary basalt produced by a volcanic field in cascade arc north of newberry volcano in oregon with an eruptive output volume between basalt composition varies from low potassium high alumina olivine tholeiite to calc alkaline shoshonite and alkaline intraplate compositions though olivine bearing basalt with different amounts of porphyritic plagioclase dominates volcanoes within field have produced smaller amounts of basaltic andesite and andesite with silicon dioxide compositions up to 59 percent though dacite is not very common among indian heaven eruptive products unlike mount st helens indian heaven field has generated large volumes of basalt but has not caused extensive crustal melting most of lava flows produced by field have been pahoehoe featuring smaller percentages of block flows and a a flows they vary in thickness from reaching volumes up to there are about 40 distinct lava flow groups in field totaling in area indian heaven has been significantly altered through glacial erosion including at least four major periods of glaciation during hayden creek glaciation from 190 000 to 130 000 years ago lewis river glacier advanced from mount adams to fill lewis river canyon partly overlapping indian heaven volcanic field an ice cap originating at northern end of field also spread during this glacial era lone butte tuya volcano erupted through this glacier which had a thickness of eruptive history and potential hazards thumb cinder cone that produced big lava bed rises above a forest which covers part of extensive lava flow it produced one of indian heaven s vents produced a large effusive eruption about 9 000 years ago forming big lava bed which consisted of basaltic lava with an area of and a volume of big lava bed mostly consists of unvegetated basalt it moved to south down little white salmon river drainage which it filled for of its length ultimately flow extended from its initial source vent an unnamed cinder cone it came within of columbia river another more ancient lava flow that was especially fluid encompassed trout lake area and extended several miles south also nearing columbia river highly voluminous it also features lava tubes these lava tubes can be found at many of lava flows that comprise indian heaven volcanic field which range from basaltic to andesitic in composition and extend as far as from their source vents eruptive units from field show normal residual magnetism suggesting that they were all formed less than 780 000 years ago with exception of lava within gifford peak s eroded core volcanic field also features a number of pleistocene subglacial volcanoes many of which formed flat topped peaks generated by subglacial eruptions these mountains such as crazy hills formed pillow like shapes when their lava interacted with ice or meltwater field also has tuyas such as lone which formed as flat and steep volcanic cones created by lava that erupted through glaciers or ice sheets lone butte in particular erupted through a glacier in indian heaven field building its upper cone above water and generating pyroclastic materials lava flows and tephra to reach a height of above its base however lone butte has since undergone significant glacial erosion losing about half of its original structure activity at volcanic field has occurred sporadically for past 700 000 years therefore it remains likely that volcanoes from field will erupt in future generating voluminous lava flows nonetheless volcano hazards program directed by united states geological survey lists indian heaven s volcanic threat level as low very low to assess threats from possible lava flows at indian heaven or at nearby mount adams geologists from united states geological survey headed by w e scott determined its mean burial rate in 1995 calculated as lava volume erupted per unit time divided by area of lava field they found that indian heaven s average burial rate was low but noted that indian heaven has had a large lava flow in past 10 000 years estimating probability of lava flows from indian heaven covering a certain point in zone surrounding field geologists arrived at a range between one in 100 000 to one in a million major vents global volcanism program of smithsonian institution lists a number of major vents at indian heaven including big lava bed pyroclastic cone produced by most recent eruption in field bird mountain east crater gifford peak lemei rock red mountain and sawtooth mountain shield volcanoes and lone butte tuya volcano big lava bed pyroclastic cinder cone has a smooth slope and produced big lava bed flow which represents newest eruptive activity within entire indian heaven field red mountain which has an elevation of marks southernmost point of shield volcanoes in volcanic field while sawtooth mountain is northernmost volcano name elevation location meters feet coordinates big lava bed bird mountain east crater lemei rock lone butte red mountain sawtooth mountain recreation thumb a small lake within indian heaven wilderness within indian heaven wilderness visitors can fish in lakes and ponds hike backpack ride horses and view wildlife a popular trail is indian heaven loop which runs for from cultus creek campground following indian heaven trail to deep trail and then lemei lake trail it passes through meadows and lakes to join pacific crest trail before it returns to cultus creek campground where it starts after climb from final paved road to enter wilderness area which lasts about hiking in indian heaven is relatively undemanding however trails can vary in difficulty for horseback riders and hikers lake trail in length gains in elevation and provides scenic views of mount adams and mount rainier blue lake trail in indian heaven wilderness area runs for together with lemei lake trail it forms a loop that last a moderate hike it offers views of lakes ponds meadows and forests as well as access to popular fishing lakes like dee lake heather lake thomas lake and eunice lake these lakes are also popular swimming spots particularly among hikers with children before it merges with pacific crest trail route arrives at blue lake which has a depth of and marks deepest lake within entire wilderness blue lake was carved by glacial motion one of most popular camping spots is goose lake campground which is frequented by fishermen boaters and swimmers operated by united states forest service campground remains open from july through october a designated camp site near thomas and blue lakes within wilderness was created by wilderness managers for gifford pinchot national forest with hope that it would mitigate resource damage in high use area and focus visitor use impact to smaller more compact areas see also cascade volcanoes list of volcanoes in
