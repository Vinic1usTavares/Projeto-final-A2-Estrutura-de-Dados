operation perch was a british offensive of second world war which took place from 7 to 14 june 1944 during early stages of battle of normandy operation was intended to encircle and seize german occupied city of caen which was a d day objective for british 3rd infantry division in early phases of operation overlord operation perch was to begin immediately after british beach landings with an advance to south east of caen by xxx corps three days after invasion city was still in german hands and operation was amended operation was expanded to include i corps for a pincer attack on caen on next day xxx corps in west pushed south to tilly sur seulles which was occupied by and village was captured and re captured several times i corps began eastern thrust two days later from orne bridgehead which had been secured in operation tonga on d day i corps was also delayed by constant counter attacks of 21st panzer division with mounting casualties and no sign of a german collapse offensive east of caen was suspended on 13 june further west in us first army area american attacks forced a gap in german defences part of british 7th armoured division was diverted from tilly sur seulles to advance through gap in a flanking manoeuvre and force panzer lehr division to fall back to avoid encirclement on 14 june after two days of battle including battle of villers bocage 7th armoured division was ordered to withdraw towards caumont plans were made to resume offensive once 7th armoured division had been reinforced but plans came to nothing when a storm in english channel seriously delayed landing of supplies and reinforcements battle is controversial because many historians and writers have concluded that it was failures by british divisional and corps commanders that squandered an opportunity to capture caen rather than germans achieving a defensive success to resist offensive germans had committed their most powerful armoured reserves which deprived them of fighting power for a counter offensive and forfeited initiative to allies background operation overlord thumb infantry of 50th northumbrian infantry division run ashore near la riviere on 6 june norman town of caen was a d day objective for 3rd infantry division which landed on sword beach on 6 june 1944 capture of caen was most ambitious objective of i corps lieutenant general john crocker overlord plan called for second army lieutenant general miles dempsey to secure city and then form a front line from caumont l evente to south east of caen acquiring airfields and protecting left flank of us first army while it moved on cherbourg possession of caen and its surroundings would give second army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture falaise which could be used as pivot for a swing left of allied front to advance on argentan and then towards touques river terrain between caen and vimont was especially promising being open dry and conducive to swift offensive operations allies greatly outnumbered germans in tanks and mobile units and a battle of manoeuvre would be to their advantage operation perch thumb tanks from 4th county of london yeomanry 7th armoured division move inland from gold beach 7 june 1944 operation perch was intended to create threat of a british break out to south east of caen by xxx corps 50th northumbrian infantry division

northumbrian division and advance from tilly sur seulles to mont pincon xxx corps landed on gold beach at 07 30 on 6 june cleared seven exits off beach and advanced inland german resistance at le hamel delayed division and prevented achievement of all of d day objectives before dark patrols had reached bayeux and made contact with 3rd canadian infantry division which had landed on juno beach

its last reserve unit mobile brigade 30 towards gold beach to repeat counter attack which also failed and brigade was destroyed north of bayeux survivors of two counter attacks were driven into a pocket north of city by anglo american advance although americans did not discover that this had happened from sword beach 3rd infantry division of i corps had advanced towards caen but diverted units

arrived during night of 9 june at tilly sur seulles having lost up to 200 vehicles to aerial attacks during its drive from chartres having been diverted from facing british i corps north of caen due

from 11 june and replace them with infantry divisions to concentrate tanks in carentan area and avert danger to cherbourg adolf hitler over ruled rommel and next day ordered him not to retreat and instead to roll up allied beachhead from east to west starting with orne bridgehead i corps while xxx corps attacked tilly sur seulles an attack by i corps was postponed until 12 june because of weather delays which slowed landing of 51st highland infantry division and 4th armoured brigade on 10 june german tanks and infantry made several attacks on 6th airborne division in orne bridgehead which forestalled british attack germans were repulsed with help of naval gunfire and then counter attacked a captured german officer remarked that his battalion had been virtually wiped out during twelve hours of fighting in evening a german attack on was repulsed with many german casualties vanguard of 51st highland division arrived during evening and attacked breville at dawn which was also a costly failure other elements of division quickly secured during afternoon of 11 june queen s own rifles of canada and 1st hussars attacked le mesnil patry to assist advance of 69th brigade of 50th northumbrian division but attack was another costly failure on 12 june german attacks were launched from breville area against orne bridgehead fighting lasted all day and casualties were severe on both sides but during evening germans pulled back to close gap in british perimeter decision was made to secure breville and 12th battalion parachute regiment captured village by midnight but had 141

called off on 13 june caumont gap thumb allied and axis dispositions on 12 june 1944 although attempt to envelop caen had been repulsed on right flank of xxx corps junction of british second and first us armies possibility for a flanking manoeuvre had developed since d day british and americans had destroyed five german battle groups in this area including reserves of lxxxiv corps leaving only remnants of 352nd infantry division in agy sector 352nd division had been in action since its defence of omaha on 6 june and had received few replacements 1st us infantry division and 2nd us infantry division had forced collapse of left flank of 352nd division on night of 9 10 june 352nd division received permission to retire to saint lo which created a gap in german lines near caumont l evente only reconnaissance battalion of 17th ss panzergrenadier division which had been detached when division was moved west ready for a counter offensive at carentan remained in area germans planned to use 2nd panzer division to plug gap but on 10 june bulk of 2nd panzer division was strung out between amiens and alencon and was not expected to arrive in strength for another three days general hans freiherr von of xlvii panzer corps rushed divisional reconnaissance battalion to caumont with orders to hold high ground i ss panzer corps commander sepp dietrich ordered his only reserve schwere ss

described in text on 12 june dempsey met with lieutenant general gerard bucknall xxx corps and major general george erskine 7th armoured division and ordered erskine to disengage division from fighting around tilly sur seulles 7th armoured division was to exploit gap to seize villers bocage and advance behind left flank of panzer lehr division to a ridge about east of town it was believed that appearance of british tanks behind panzer lehr division on high ground astride german supply lines would compel panzer lehr division to withdraw or be trapped to support flanking move of 7th armoured division 50th northumbrian infantry division was to continue its attack against panzer lehr division around tilly sur seulles v us corps would push forward at same time 1st us infantry

northumbrian infantry division thumb two of five panther tanks knocked out by sergeant wilfred spit harris commanding a sherman firefly and trooper ian mackillop tank gunner are visible at west end of lingevres where second attack was launched on morning of 14 june montgomery abandoned pincer attack on caen because he lacked sufficient strength to act offensively on both flanks xxx corps was ordered to continue in a concentrated single blow while in i corps area attack by 51st highland infantry division was piped down 50th northumbrian infantry division continued attack southwards to pin down german forces on 14 june supported by divisional artillery and royal air force division attacked with two brigades towards la la belle epine lingevres and verrieres if attack succeeded it was to be exploited to capture hottot les bagues to prepare route of attack a reconnaissance in force was conducted evening before but panzergrenadiers of panzer lehr division inflicted many casualties on british troops german casualties are unknown although one tank was destroyed main attack began at 10 15 next morning when 151st durham infantry brigade and tanks of 4th 7th royal dragoon guards advanced towards lingevres and verrieres german defenders held their fire until british were less than from their position fighting culminated with an assault by 6th durham light infantry dli with much artillery support that captured german positions two companies advanced to verrieres which was found to be unoccupied but further advances were checked by german infantry and tanks 9th dli was also held up by german machine gun fire and needed their reserve companies to break through german positions at about 13 30 battalion captured lingevres and moved anti tank guns into village although most of these were put out of action by first german counter attack two panthers were spotted approaching lingevres by sergeant wilfred harris commander of a sherman firefly who engaged at destroying

launched by battalion during campaign nine german tanks were knocked out during day but 50th northumbrian infantry division had been unable to break through panzer lehr defences and dli suffered battle of island thumb 22nd armoured brigade group had completed their withdrawal by 14 june and formed a brigade box for all round defence with an area of fewer than near hill 174 fighting became known as battle of island or island position as named in 22nd armoured brigade group after action report other names given to action are battle of brigade box and battle of amaye sur seulles panzer lehr division had defended against 50th northumbrian infantry division attack and to counter attack 7th armoured division penetration with support of 1st company 2nd panzer division reconnaissance battalion and other small infantry units also faced brigade box but tanks of 2nd panzer division had still not arrived british 131st infantry brigade one infantry battalion and an armoured regiment had moved up to livry during morning 131st infantry brigade kept road from brigade box to livry area open and typhoon fighter bombers attacked german positions near box german infantry spotted advancing towards brigade box were bombarded by heavy artillery and repulsed around 09 00 more infantry attacked box and came too close for artillery fire hand to hand fighting began and a british platoon was overrun a british counter attack by infantry and tanks repulsed german infantry and restored position germans resorted to harassing fire sniping mortar bombardments and heavy artillery fire after a long artillery bombardment simultaneous attacks from north and south by tanks and infantry were made at 19 00 which broke into box and closed on brigade headquarters before being driven back around 22 30 7th armoured division commander was confident that box was secure but failure of 50th northumbrian infantry division to break through panzer lehr division and reach 7th armoured division led to orders for brigade group to retire to straighten front line retirement codenamed operation began just after midnight decoy raids by bomber command on sur odon and evrecy caused 29 casualties destroyed a tiger tank and damaged three more artillery harassing fire was maintained north and south of withdrawal route but germans did little to intervene germans losses included and including several tigers british casualties were light and only three tanks were lost reynolds called german casualty figures exaggerated and in his report hinde wrote it is questionable whether expenditure of artillery and small arms ammunition was justified by scale of enemy s efforts aftermath analysis failure of operation led dempsey to write that there was no chance now of a snap operation with airborne troops either to seize caen or to deepen bridgehead on xxx corps front it is clear now that caen can be taken only by set piece assault and we do not have men or ammunition for that at this time after war he wrote that attack by 7th armoured division should have succeeded and that his doubts about suitability of bucknall and erskine increased dempsey called handling of battle a disgrace and said that decision to withdraw from villers bocage was made by corps commander and erskine carlo d este called dempsey s comments excessively harsh but historians generally support them suggesting that a great opportunity swiftly to capture caen had been squandered by bucknall john buckley wrote that bucknall was not ready to support attack once problems developed and that erskine was not capable of mastering situation british official historian lionel ellis wrote that result was disappointing but that fighting power of panzer lehr division and with unexpected arrival of 2nd panzer division 7th armoured division could hardly have achieved full success in 2001 michael reynolds wrote that 2nd panzer division tanks were nowhere near villers bocage hubert meyer wrote that operation perch failed because 50th northumbrian division and its armoured brigade could not overcome panzer lehr division 51st highland infantry division attack in east end of bridgehead failed and because of rapid counter attack by advanced elements of 2nd panzer division allocation of insufficient infantry to attack has been criticised because there were two infantry battalions and most of 1st battalion rifle brigade available to 7th armoured division on 13 june and three fresh infantry brigades in bridgehead reynolds wrote that bucknall was at fault for failing to concentrate his forces d este concurred but bucknall defended his decision claiming 49 division had no recent battle experience and it was important to launch them nicely into their first fighting in a properly coordinated battle and not bundle them helter skelter into hot armoured scrapping like that around v b and amaye buckley wrote that operation was a failure of command terry copp wrote that dempsey continued to underestimate german strength and commitment to defending ground they held mungo melvin wrote that dempsey and second army handled subordinate formations poorly by not giving subordinates definite tasks clear intentions and allowing discretion in implementation of orders chester wilmot called operation perch a strategic success by premature commitment of his armour rommel had delayed british advance but in process he had played into montgomery s hands for once panzer divisions were locked into battle with second army they could not be used for their proper offensive task stephen badsey wrote that montgomery s message to bradley caen is key to cherbourg was true risk of a break out past caen immobilised german armoured divisions at east end of front unable mount a counter offensive against first us army hitler s interference saved rommel s military reputation because unsuitability of cotentin for armoured operations difficulties involved in movement and supply in area and strength of anglo canadian force would have led to a more rapid and complete defeat of german army in normandy by his order of 12 june hitler made rest of campaign a battle of attrition casualties thumb during operation perch suffered 27 casualties had nine tanks destroyed and a further 21 damaged leaving battalion with only 15 operation tanks by 16 june for most of formations involved in fighting specific casualty data are unavailable by end of june panzer lehr division had suffered 2 972 casualties and reported loss of 51 tanks and assault guns 82 half tracks and 294 other vehicles

operational tanks by end of june 7th armoured division had suffered 1 149 casualties and lost at least 38 tanks during operation perch by end of month 50th northumbrian infantry division had suffered
