chest and his need to feed on spirits of others to survive was described by obsidian as less all encompassing than first game and more personal in nature saunders commented it s an epic story but it s a very personal one you awaken in a pool of your own blood your immediate goal is survival shard of sword of gith has been ripped from your chest and in its place is a dark hunger a craving that threatens to consume you early part of game involves determining source and implications of this craving saunders also stated that story written by creative lead george was very dark and that ending would bring some closure to story of shard bearer critical reception reviews of mask of betrayer were generally favorable obsidian entertainment s handling of epic levels in expansion was particularly praised although some reviewers said that at higher levels expansion became unbalanced a number of reviewers mentioned that expansion allows for more customization of both characters and levels with

starting neverwinter nights 2 over from beginning after installing mask of betrayer is also interesting because expansion integrate s with previous game i e you can select one of new races and classes and go back and play nwn2 with them reviewers said that expansion s single player game was more difficult than that of neverwinter nights 2 1up com stated that obsidian upped ante with tougher enemies and a more challenging experience altogether expansion also has more puzzles which make player think rather than somehow being resolvable through combat with one reviewer noting that expansion has genuinely tough logic puzzles some frustratingly short on clues and a series of side quests that completely vary some might not even open up depending on your party makeup multiple reviewers mentioned that expansion is more serious than neverwinter nights 2 game s story and writing were praised by many reviewers with some noting its avoidance of common fantasy cliches some reviewers also compared quality and tone of writing to neil gaiman s sandman series and to planescape torment expansion s sound was described by gamezone as being exactly what it needs to be in that it supports story and gameplay its voice work was described as decent although some dialogue is purely text graphics were also improved from neverwinter nights 2 with better textures and spell effects in addition to a new option so that player can change game s level of violence reviewers also mentioned that graphics especially that of spells such as lightning could make combat difficult gamespy said all those high level spells also throw out a ton of spectacular graphics effects that do wonders to obscure what s going on during a battle as beautiful as they are we d trade all eye candy in world for ability to accurately select a target mask of betrayer was nominated for best rpg of year by g4 tv and it was named runner up for rpg of year by criticism of expansion was aimed at its poor camera angles and other technical issues although game and updates since neverwinter nights 2s release fixed many bugs of original ign criticized spirit meter mechanic a statement echoed by gamespy who said on a purely mechanical level spirit meter ends up being more annoyance than fun from a role playing story standpoint it s actually reverse of what mechanic was supposed to accomplish john walker for gamesradar criticized companions available nwn2 was immediately joyful with hilarious characters and dialogue juxtaposing dark story is far more serious and while companions fulfill role of representing personality extremes none of them are particularly entertaining company there s no one to compare with khelgar s dwarfish temper nor s impish naughtiness most are positively dull and this isn t helped by opening dungeon being tedious beyond see also list of pc games 2007 in video gaming references external links neverwinter nights 2 mask of betrayer official page category 2007 video games category
