nebular hypothesis is leading hypothesis amongst scientists which states that planets were formed out of a cloud of material associated with a youthful sun which was slowly rotating later in 1900 thomas chamberlin and forest ray moulton considered that a wandering star approach sun as a result a cigar shaped extension of material was separated from solar surface as passing star moved away material separated from solar surface continued to revolve around sun and it slowly condensed into planets they considered that sun was surrounded by a solar nebula containing mostly hydrogen and helium along with what may be termed as dust friction and collision of particle led to formation of a disk shaped cloud and planets were formed through process of accretion it is most widely accepted model in field of cosmogony to explain formation and evolution of solar system as well as other planetary systems it suggests that solar system is formed from nebulous material theory was developed by immanuel kant and published in his allgemeine naturgeschichte und theorie des himmels universal natural history and theory of heavens published in 1755 and then modified in 1796 by pierre laplace originally applied to solar system process of planetary system formation is now thought to be at work throughout universe widely accepted modern variant of nebular hypothesis is solar nebular disk model sndm or solar nebular model it offered explanations for a variety of properties of solar system including nearly circular and coplanar orbits of planets and their motion in same direction as sun s rotation some elements of original nebular hypothesis are echoed in modern theories of planetary formation but most elements have been superseded according to nebular hypothesis stars form in massive and dense clouds of molecular hydrogen giant molecular clouds gmc these clouds are gravitationally unstable and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps which then rotate collapse and form stars star formation is a complex process which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk around young star this may give birth to planets in certain circumstances which are not well known thus formation of planetary systems is thought to be a natural result of star formation a sun like star usually takes approximately 1 million years to form with protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over next 10 100 million years protoplanetary disk is an accretion disk that feeds central star initially very hot disk later cools in what is known as t tauri star stage here formation of small dust grains made of rocks and ice is possible grains eventually may coagulate into kilometer sized planetesimals if disk is massive enough runaway accretions begin resulting in rapid 100 000 to 300 000 years formation of moon to mars sized planetary embryos near star planetary embryos go through a stage of violent mergers producing a few terrestrial planets last stage takes approximately 100 million to a billion years formation of giant planets is a more complicated process it is thought to occur beyond frost line where planetary embryos mainly are made of various types of ice as a result they are several times more massive than in inner part of protoplanetary disk what follows after embryo formation is not completely clear some embryos appear to continue to grow and eventually reach 5 10 earth masses threshold value which is necessary to begin accretion of hydrogen helium gas from disk accumulation of gas by core is initially a slow process which continues for several million years but after forming protoplanet reaches about 30 earth masses it accelerates and proceeds in a runaway manner jupiter and saturn like planets are thought to accumulate bulk of their mass during only 10 000 years accretion stops when gas is exhausted formed planets can migrate over long distances during or after their formation ice giants such as uranus and neptune are thought to be failed cores which formed too late when disk had almost disappeared history there is evidence that emanuel swedenborg first proposed parts of nebular hypothesis in 1734 baker gregory l emanuel an 18th century physics teacher october 1983 pp 441 446 immanuel kant familiar with swedenborg s work developed theory further in 1755 publishing his own universal natural history and theory of heavens wherein he argued that gaseous clouds nebulae slowly rotate gradually collapse and flatten due to gravity eventually forming stars and planets for details of kant s position see stephen palmquist kant s cosmogony re evaluated studies in history and philosophy of science 18 3 september 1987 pp 255 269 pierre simon laplace independently developed and proposed a similar model in 1796 in his exposition du systeme du monde he envisioned that sun originally had an extended hot atmosphere throughout volume of solar system his theory featured a contracting and cooling protosolar cloud protosolar nebula as this cooled and contracted it flattened and spun more rapidly throwing off or shedding a series of gaseous rings of material and according to him planets condensed from this material his model was similar to kant s except more detailed and on a smaller scale while laplacian nebular model dominated in 19th century it encountered a number of difficulties main problem involved angular momentum distribution between sun and planets planets have 99 of angular momentum and this fact could not be explained by nebular model as a result astronomers largely abandoned this theory of planet formation at beginning of 20th century a major critique came during 19th century from james clerk maxwell 1831 1879 who maintained that different rotation between inner and outer parts of a ring could not allow condensation of material george h a cole 2013 planetary science science of planets around stars second edition michael m woolfson p 190 astronomer sir david brewster also rejected laplace writing in 1876 that those who believe in nebular theory consider it as certain that our earth derived its solid matter and its atmosphere from a ring thrown from solar atmosphere which afterwards contracted into a solid sphere from which moon was thrown off by same process he argued that under such view moon must necessarily have carried off water and air from watery and aerial parts of earth and must have an atmosphere david 1876 more worlds than one creed of philosopher and hope of christian chatto and windus piccadilly p 153 brewster claimed that sir isaac newton s religious beliefs had previously considered nebular ideas as tending to atheism and quoted him as saying that growth of new systems out of old ones without mediation of a divine power seemed to him apparently absurd as quoted by david brewster more worlds than one creed of philosopher and hope of christian fixed stars and binary systems p 233 perceived deficiencies of laplacian model stimulated scientists to find a replacement for it during 20th century many theories addressed issue including planetesimal theory of thomas chamberlin and forest moulton 1901 tidal model of james jeans 1917 accretion model of otto schmidt 1944 protoplanet theory of william mccrea 1960 and finally capture theory of michael woolfson in 1978 andrew prentice resurrected initial laplacian ideas about planet formation and developed modern laplacian theory none of these attempts proved completely successful and many of proposed theories were descriptive birth of modern widely accepted theory of planetary formation solar nebular disk model sndm can be traced to soviet astronomer victor safronov his 1969 book evolution of protoplanetary cloud and formation of earth and planets which was translated to english in 1972 had a long lasting effect on way scientists think about formation of planets in this book almost all major problems of planetary formation process were formulated and some of them solved safronov s ideas were further developed in works of george wetherill who discovered runaway accretion while originally applied only to solar system sndm was subsequently thought by theorists to be at work throughout universe as of astronomers have discovered extrasolar planets in our galaxy solar nebular model achievements and problems achievements thumb dusty discs surrounding nearby young stars in greater detail star formation process naturally results in appearance of accretion disks around young stellar objects at age of about 1 million years 100 of stars may have such disks this conclusion is supported by discovery of gaseous and dusty disks around protostars and t tauri stars as well as by theoretical considerations observations of these disks show that dust grains inside them grow in size on short thousand year time scales producing 1 centimeter sized particles accretion process by which 1 km planetesimals grow into 1 000 km sized bodies is well understood now this process develops inside any disk where number density of planetesimals is sufficiently high and proceeds in a runaway manner growth later slows and continues as oligarchic accretion end result is formation of planetary embryos of varying sizes which depend on distance from star various simulations have demonstrated that merger of embryos in inner part of protoplanetary disk leads to formation of a few earth sized bodies thus origin of terrestrial planets is now considered to be an almost solved problem current issues physics of accretion disks encounters some problems most important one is how material which is accreted by protostar loses its angular momentum one possible explanation suggested by hannes alfven was that angular momentum was shed by solar wind during its t tauri star phase momentum is transported to outer parts of disk by viscous stresses viscosity is generated by macroscopic turbulence but precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood another possible process for shedding angular momentum is magnetic braking where spin of star is transferred into surrounding disk via that star s magnetic field main processes responsible for disappearance of gas in disks are viscous diffusion and photo evaporation thumb multiple star system as 205 formation of planetesimals is biggest unsolved problem in nebular disk model how 1 cm sized particles coalesce into 1 km planetesimals is a mystery this mechanism appears to be key to question as to why some stars have planets while others have nothing around them not even dust belts formation timescale of giant planets is also an important problem old theories were unable to explain how their cores could form fast enough to accumulate significant amounts of gas from quickly disappearing protoplanetary disk mean lifetime of disks which is less than ten million 107 years appeared to be shorter than time necessary for core formation much progress has been done to solve this problem and current models of giant planet formation are now capable of forming jupiter or more massive planets in about 4 million years or less well within average lifetime of gaseous disks another potential problem of giant planet formation is their orbital migration some calculations show that interaction with disk can cause rapid inward migration which if not stopped results in planet reaching central regions still as a sub jovian object 2007 page 10 more recent calculations indicate that disk evolution during migration can mitigate this problem formation of stars and protoplanetary disks protostars right thumb 300px visible light left and infrared right views of trifid nebula a giant star forming cloud of gas and dust located 5 400 light years away in constellation sagittarius stars are thought to form inside giant clouds of cold molecular hydrogen giant molecular clouds roughly 300 000 times mass of sun and 20 parsecs in diameter over millions of years giant molecular clouds are prone to collapse and fragmentation these fragments then form small dense cores which in turn collapse into stars cores range in mass from a fraction to several times that of sun and are called protostellar protosolar nebulae they possess diameters of 0 01 0 1 pc 2 000 20 000 au and a particle number density of roughly 10 000 to 100 000 cm 3 compare it with particle number density of air at sea level initial collapse of a solar mass protostellar nebula takes around 100 000 years every nebula begins with a certain amount of angular momentum gas in central part of nebula with relatively low angular momentum undergoes fast compression and forms a hot hydrostatic not contracting core containing a small fraction of mass of original nebula this core forms seed of what will become a star as collapse continues conservation of angular momentum means that rotation of infalling envelope accelerates which largely prevents gas from directly accreting onto central core gas is instead forced to spread outwards near its equatorial plane forming a disk which in turn onto core core gradually grows in mass until it becomes a young hot protostar at this stage protostar and its disk are heavily obscured by infalling envelope and are not directly observable in fact remaining envelope s opacity is so high that even millimeter wave radiation has trouble escaping from inside it such objects are observed as very bright condensations which emit mainly millimeter wave and submillimeter wave radiation they are classified as spectral class 0 protostars collapse is often accompanied by bipolar outflows jets that emanate along rotational axis of inferred disk jets are frequently observed in star forming regions see herbig haro hh objects luminosity of class 0 protostars is high a solar mass protostar may radiate at up to 100 solar luminosities source of this energy is gravitational collapse as their cores are not yet hot enough to begin nuclear fusion left thumb 250px infrared image of molecular outflow from an otherwise hidden newborn star hh 46 47 as infall of its material onto disk continues envelope eventually becomes thin and transparent and young stellar object yso becomes observable initially in far infrared light and later in visible around this time protostar begins to fuse deuterium if protostar is sufficiently massive above 80 jupiter masses hydrogen fusion follows otherwise if its mass is too low object becomes a brown dwarf this birth of a new star occurs approximately 100 000 years after collapse begins objects at this stage are known as class i protostars which are also called young t tauri stars evolved protostars or young stellar objects by this time forming star has already accreted much of its mass total mass of disk and remaining envelope does not exceed 10 20 of mass of central yso at next stage envelope completely disappears having been gathered up by disk and protostar becomes a classical t tauri star this happens after about 1 million years mass of disk around a classical t tauri star is about 1 3 of stellar mass and it is accreted at a rate of 10 7 to per year a pair of bipolar jets is usually present as well accretion explains all peculiar properties of classical t tauri stars strong flux in emission lines up to 100 of intrinsic luminosity of star magnetic activity photometric variability and jets emission lines actually form as accreted gas hits surface of star which happens around its magnetic poles jets are byproducts of accretion they carry away excessive angular momentum classical t tauri stage lasts about 10 million years disk eventually disappears due to accretion onto central star planet formation ejection by jets and photoevaporation by uv radiation from central star and nearby stars as a result young star becomes a weakly lined t tauri star which slowly over hundreds of millions of years evolves into an ordinary sun like star protoplanetary disks thumb right 250px debris disks detected in hst archival images of young stars hd and hd using improved imaging processes 24 april 2014 under certain circumstances disk which can now be called protoplanetary may give birth to a planetary system protoplanetary disks have been observed around a very high fraction of stars in young star clusters they exist from beginning of a star s formation but at earliest stages are unobservable due to opacity of surrounding envelope disk of a class 0 protostar is thought to be massive and hot it is an accretion disk which feeds central protostar temperature can easily exceed 400 k inside 5 au and 1 000 k inside 1 au heating of disk is primarily caused by viscous dissipation of turbulence in it and by infall of gas from nebula high temperature in inner disk causes most of volatile material water organics and some rocks to evaporate leaving only most refractory elements like iron ice can survive only in outer part of disk thumb left 250px a protoplanetary disk forming in orion nebula main problem in physics of accretion disks is generation of turbulence and mechanism responsible for high effective viscosity turbulent viscosity is thought to be responsible for transport of mass to central protostar and momentum to periphery of disk this is vital for accretion because gas can be accreted by central protostar only if it loses most of its angular momentum which must be carried away by small part of gas drifting outwards result of this process is growth of both protostar and of disk radius which can reach 1 000 au if initial angular momentum of nebula is large enough large disks are routinely observed in many star forming regions such as orion nebula thumb 300px artist s impression of disc and gas streams around young star hd lifespan of accretion disks is about 10 million years by time star reaches classical t tauri stage disk becomes thinner and cools less volatile materials start to condense close to its center forming 0 1 1 mm dust grains that contain crystalline silicates transport of material from outer disk can mix these newly formed dust grains with primordial ones which contain organic matter and other volatiles this mixing can explain some peculiarities in composition of solar system bodies such as presence of interstellar grains in primitive meteorites and refractory inclusions in comets thumb 350px left various planet formation processes including exocomets and other planetesimals around beta pictoris a very young type a v star nasa artist s conception dust particles tend to stick to each other in dense disk environment leading to formation of larger particles up to several centimeters in size signatures of dust processing and coagulation are observed in infrared spectra of young disks further aggregation can lead to formation of planetesimals measuring 1 km across or larger which are building blocks of planets planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger one hypothesis is formation by gravitational instability particles several centimeters in size or larger slowly settle near middle plane of disk forming a very thin less than 100 km and dense layer this layer is gravitationally unstable and may fragment into numerous clumps which in turn collapse into planetesimals however differing velocities of gas disk and solids near mid plane can generate turbulence which prevents layer from becoming thin enough to fragment due to gravitational instability this may limit formation of planetesimals via gravitational instabilities to specific locations in disk where concentration of solids is enhanced another possible mechanism for formation of planetesimals is streaming instability in which drag felt by particles orbiting through gas creates a feedback effect causing growth of local concentrations these local concentration push back on gas creating a region where headwind felt by particles is smaller concentration is thus able to orbit faster and undergoes less radial drift isolated particles join these concentrations as they are overtaken or as they drift inward causing it to grow in mass eventually these concentrations form massive filaments which fragment and undergo gravitational collapse forming planetesimals size of larger asteroids planetary formation can also be triggered by gravitational instability within disk itself which leads to its fragmentation into clumps some of them if they are dense enough will collapse which can lead to rapid formation of gas giant planets and even brown dwarfs on timescale of 1 000 years if these clumps migrate inward as collapse proceeds tidal forces from star can result in a significant mass loss leaving behind a smaller body however it is only possible in massive disks more massive than in comparison typical disk masses are because massive disks are rare this mechanism of planet formation is thought to be infrequent on other hand this mechanism may play a major role in formation of brown dwarfs thumb right 300px asteroid collision building planets artist concept ultimate dissipation of protoplanetary disks is triggered by a number of different mechanisms inner part of disk is either accreted by star or ejected by bipolar jets whereas outer part can evaporate under star s powerful uv radiation during t tauri stage or by nearby stars gas in central part can either be accreted or ejected by growing planets while small dust particles are ejected by radiation pressure of central star what is finally left is either a planetary system a remnant disk of dust without planets or nothing if planetesimals failed to form because planetesimals are so numerous and spread throughout protoplanetary disk some survive formation of a planetary system asteroids are understood to be left over planetesimals gradually grinding each other down into smaller and smaller bits while comets are typically planetesimals from farther reaches of a planetary system meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a planetary surface and provide a great deal of information about formation of solar system primitive type meteorites are chunks of shattered low mass planetesimals where no thermal differentiation took place while processed type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals interstellar objects could have been captured and become part of young solar system formation of planets rocky planets according to solar nebular disk model rocky planets form in inner part of protoplanetary disk within frost line where temperature is high enough to prevent condensation of water ice and other substances into grains this results in coagulation of purely rocky grains and later in formation of rocky planetesimals such conditions are thought to exist in inner 3 4 au part of disk of a sun like star after small planetesimals about 1 km in diameter have formed by one way or another runaway accretion begins it is called runaway because mass growth rate is proportional to where r and m are radius and mass of growing body respectively specific divided by mass growth accelerates as mass increases this leads to preferential growth of larger bodies at expense of smaller ones runaway accretion lasts between 10 000 and 100 000 years and ends when largest bodies exceed approximately 1 000 km in diameter slowing of accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies on remaining planetesimals in addition influence of larger bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies next stage is called oligarchic accretion it is characterized by dominance of several hundred of largest bodies oligarchs which continue to slowly accrete planetesimals no body other than oligarchs can grow at this stage rate of accretion is proportional to r2 which is derived from geometrical cross section of an oligarch specific accretion rate is proportional to and it declines with mass of body this allows smaller oligarchs to catch up to larger ones oligarchs are kept at distance of about is hill radius where a is semimajor axis e is orbital eccentricity and ms is mass of central star from each other by influence of remaining planetesimals their orbital eccentricities and inclinations remain small oligarchs continue to accrete until planetesimals are exhausted in disk around them sometimes nearby oligarchs merge final mass of an oligarch depends on distance from star and surface density of planetesimals and is called isolation mass for rocky planets it is up to or one mars mass final result of oligarchic stage is formation of about 100 moon to mars sized planetary embryos uniformly spaced at about they are thought to reside inside gaps in disk and to be separated by rings of remaining planetesimals this stage is thought to last a few hundred thousand years last stage of rocky planet formation is merger stage it begins when only a small number of planetesimals remains and embryos become massive enough to perturb each other which causes their orbits to become chaotic during this stage embryos expel remaining planetesimals and collide with each other result of this process which lasts for 10 to 100 million years is formation of a limited number of earth sized bodies simulations show that number of surviving planets is on average from 2 to 5 in solar system they may be represented by earth and venus formation of both planets required merging of approximately 10 20 embryos while an equal number of them were thrown out of solar system some of embryos which originated in asteroid belt are thought to have brought water to earth mars and mercury may be regarded as remaining embryos that survived that rivalry rocky planets which have managed to coalesce settle eventually into more or less stable orbits explaining why planetary systems are generally packed to limit or in other words why they always appear to be at brink of instability giant planets right thumb 250px dust disk around fomalhaut brightest star in piscis austrinus constellation asymmetry of disk may be caused by a giant planet or planets orbiting star formation of giant planets is an outstanding problem in planetary sciences in framework of solar nebular model two theories for their formation exist first one is disk instability model where giant planets form in massive protoplanetary disks as a result of its gravitational fragmentation see above second possibility is core accretion model which is also known as nucleated instability model latter scenario is thought to be most promising one because it can explain formation of giant planets in relatively low mass disks less than in this model giant planet formation is divided into two stages a accretion of a core of approximately and b accretion of gas from protoplanetary disk either method may also lead to creation of brown dwarfs searches as of 2011 have found that core accretion is likely dominant formation mechanism giant planet core formation is thought to proceed roughly along lines of terrestrial planet formation it starts with planetesimals that undergo runaway growth followed by slower oligarchic stage hypotheses do not predict a merger stage due to low probability of collisions between planetary embryos in outer part of planetary systems an additional difference is composition of planetesimals which in case of giant planets form beyond so called frost line and consist mainly of ice ice to rock ratio is about 4 to 1 this enhances mass of planetesimals fourfold however minimum mass nebula capable of terrestrial planet formation can only form cores at distance of jupiter 5 au within 10 million years latter number represents average lifetime of gaseous disks around sun like stars proposed solutions include enhanced mass of disk a tenfold increase would suffice protoplanet migration which allows embryo to accrete more planetesimals and finally accretion enhancement due to gas drag in gaseous envelopes of embryos some combination of above mentioned ideas may explain formation of cores of gas giant planets such as jupiter and perhaps even saturn formation of planets like uranus and neptune is more problematic since no theory has been capable of providing for in situ formation of their cores at distance of 20 30 au from central star one hypothesis is that they initially accreted in jupiter saturn region then were scattered and migrated to their present location another possible solution is growth of cores of giant planets via pebble accretion in pebble accretion objects between a cm and a meter in diameter falling toward a massive body are slowed enough by gas drag for them to spiral toward it and be accreted growth via pebble accretion may be as much as 1000 times faster than by accretion of planetesimals once cores are of sufficient mass they begin to gather gas from surrounding disk initially it is a slow process increasing core masses up to in a few million years after that accretion rates increase dramatically and remaining 90 of mass is accumulated in approximately 10 000 years accretion of gas stops when supply from disk is exhausted this happens gradually due to formation of a density gap in protoplanetary disk and to disk dispersal in this model ice giants uranus and neptune are failed cores that began gas accretion too late when almost all gas had already disappeared post runaway gas accretion stage is characterized by migration of newly formed giant planets and continued slow gas accretion migration is caused by interaction of planet sitting in gap with remaining disk it stops when protoplanetary disk disappears or when end of disk is attained latter case corresponds to so called hot jupiters which are likely to have stopped their migration when they reached inner hole in protoplanetary disk left thumb 250px in this artist s conception a planet spins through a clearing gap in a nearby star s dusty planet forming disc giant planets can significantly influence terrestrial planet formation presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations see kozai mechanism of planetesimals and embryos in terrestrial planet region inside 4 au in solar system if giant planets form too early they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion if they form near end of oligarchic stage as is thought to have happened in solar system they will influence merges of planetary embryos making them more violent as a result number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive in addition size of system will shrink because terrestrial planets will form closer to central star influence of giant planets in solar system particularly that of jupiter is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from terrestrial planets region of a planetary system adjacent to giant planets will be influenced in a different way in such a region eccentricities of embryos may become so large that embryos pass close to a giant planet which may cause them to be ejected from system as a variant they may collide with central star or a giant planet if all embryos are removed then no planets will form in this region an additional consequence is that a huge number of small planetesimals will remain because giant planets are incapable of clearing them all out without help of embryos total mass of remaining planetesimals will be small because cumulative action of embryos before their ejection and giant planets is still strong enough to remove 99 of small bodies such a region will eventually evolve into an asteroid belt which is a full analog of asteroid belt in solar system located from 2 to 4 au from sun exoplanets thousands of exoplanets have been identified in last twenty years orbits of many of these planets and systems of planets differ significantly from planets in solar system exoplanets discovered include hot jupiters warm jupiters super earths and systems of tightly packed inner planets hot jupiters and warm jupiters are thought to have migrated to their current orbits during or following their formation a number of possible mechanisms for this migration have been proposed type i or type ii migration could smoothly decrease semimajor axis of planet s orbit resulting in a warm or hot jupiter gravitational scattering by other planets onto eccentric orbits with a perihelion near star followed by circularization of its orbit due to tidal interactions with star can leave a planet on a close orbit if a massive companion planet or star on an inclined orbit was present an exchange of inclination for eccentricity via kozai mechanism raising eccentricities and lowering perihelion followed by circularization can also result in a close orbit many of jupiter sized planets have eccentric orbits which may indicate that gravitational encounters occurred between planets although migration while in resonance can also excite eccentricities in situ growth of hot jupiters from closely orbiting super earths has also been proposed cores in this hypothesis could have formed locally or at a greater distance and migrated close to star super earths and other closely orbiting planets are thought to have either formed in situ or to have migrated inward from their initial locations in situ formation of closely orbiting super earths would require a massive disk migration of planetary embryos followed by collisions and mergers or radial drift of small solids from farther out in disk migration of super earths or embryos that collided to form them is likely to have been type i due to their smaller mass resonant orbits of some of exoplanet systems indicates that some migration occurred in these systems while spacing of orbits in many of other systems not in resonance indicates that an instability likely occurred in those systems after dissipation of gas disk absence of super earths and closely orbiting planets in solar system may be due to previous formation of jupiter blocking their inward migration amount of gas a super earth that formed in situ acquires may depend on when planetary embryos merged due to giant impacts relative to dissipation of gas disk if mergers happen after gas disk dissipates terrestrial planets can form if in a transition disk a super earth with a gas envelope containing a few percent of its mass may form if mergers happen too early runaway gas accretion may occur leading to formation of a gas giant mergers begin when dynamical friction due to gas disk becomes insufficient to prevent collisions a process that will begin earlier in a higher metallicity disk alternatively gas accretion may be limited due to envelopes not being in hydrostatic equilibrium instead gas may flow through envelope slowing its growth and delaying onset of runaway gas accretion until mass of core reaches 15 earth masses meaning of accretion use of term accretion disk for protoplanetary disk leads to confusion over planetary accretion process protoplanetary disk is sometimes referred to as an accretion disk because while young t tauri like protostar is still contracting gaseous material may still be falling onto it accreting on its surface from disk s inner edge in an accretion disk there is a net flux of mass from larger radii toward smaller radii however that meaning should not be confused with process of accretion forming planets in this context accretion refers to process of cooled solidified grains of dust and ice orbiting protostar in protoplanetary disk colliding and sticking together and gradually growing up to and including high energy collisions between sizable planetesimals in addition giant planets probably had accretion disks of their own in first meaning of word clouds of captured hydrogen and helium gas contracted spun up flattened and deposited gas onto surface of each giant protoplanet while solid bodies within that disk accreted into giant planet s regular moons see also asteroid belt bok globule comet formation and evolution of solar system herbig haro object history
