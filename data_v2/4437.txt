shuffle while creating soundtrack hirota wanted to use his background in sound design to make a successor to gothic style he created for sound effects itakura gave hirota s team a basic outline of game s setting and premise hirota s intent was to make soundtrack beautiful yet destructive not wanting players to think it was like a movie score soundtrack included over fifty songs which was a large project for hirota at this time he included elements of punk new wave industrial rock techno electronic rock and orchestra his aim was to create personal future ethnic music upon first hearing result producer jun mihara was shocked as to him music sounded like a random jumble of genres somehow being fitted together despite shock he was impressed with young team s efforts which motivated him to make game itself match these images game s vocal elements had multiple contributors main theme icaro and several additional vocals were provided by kyoko while ending theme shadow hearts was sung by hiroko kasahara icaro was put together quickly for an internal demo hirota wanted theme to be short yet striking its use in game s opening sequence where main protagonist saves main heroine was intended to show game s focus on these two characters later versions of icaro were used to connect back to that scene and its meaning lyrics of shadow hearts were written by james h woan with lyrics

adventure and creativity will enjoy this soundtrack significantly reviewers of game also praised music gerald villoria writing for gamespot praised soundtrack audio s strongest point despite some repetition david smith of ign praised variety and quality of soundtrack though he felt mitsuda s tracks were weaker than his other works patrick gann of rpgfan described soundtrack as nothing short of brilliant describing it as potentially best rpg soundtrack of 2001 shadow hearts ii original soundtrack composition for shadow hearts covenant known in japan as shadow hearts ii was led by hirota mitsuda returned from original shadow hearts along with series newcomers kenji ito and tomoko kobayashi kobayashi a staff member at sacnoth was responsible for writing some short story related pieces soundtrack includes over sixty songs mitsuda contributed between five and six solo pieces along with working on a few collaborative tracks music for game as included on soundtrack album was composed between june 2002 and end of 2003 according to sound director hirotomi imoto he asked composers to take original sound for shadow hearts deconstruct it and rebuild it composers used different tones for their tracks hirota created dark tracks mitsuda focused on melodies with a beautiful face and ito s themes were mental due to game s shift in tone compared to original hirota wanted a soundtrack that was more dynamic and emotional without surrendering signature shadow hearts sound mitsuda had difficulty during early production as he wanted to adapt his music to better fit shadow hearts universe but at hirota s insistence he maintained his own style which was fitted into game s overall score covenant was ito s very first project for ps2 his first time working with hirota and mitsuda and first time he ever collaborated on a major track this being final boss theme 3 karma 3 karma was co composed by hirota mitsuda and ito piece came together after three composers had a private meeting and after speed and tempo were set each was allowed to go in their own direction because of battle s style a limited number of instruments were used for theme during recording process there was a combination of scripted music and improvisations from performers previous game s main theme icaro was included as a part of soundtrack with hirota rearranging it while preserving its core musical notes ending theme getsurenka was written by hirota with lyrics by kumiko hasegawa and performed by mio isayama getsurenka was described by machida as true feelings of main heroine karin its tone according to producer asako oikawa was decided upon once he and machida had finalized game s ending lyrics were intended to be words heroine karin koenig wanted to say to yuri but was unable to before that point upon receiving request hasegawa was inspired by their combined effect with a near full moon outside her home to turn off all lights and write lyrics by moonlight song was written as a love poem isayama was so impressed by emotion within lyrics that she sang from her heart a 2cd soundtrack album shadow hearts ii original soundtrack was published by team entertainment on march 24 2004 video game music online was very positive citing battle themes as one of album s strengths and giving praise to environmental and dungeon themes he enjoyed mitsuda s contributions despite their low number but felt ito s use of electronica made his tracks contrast against rest of album jesse jones of rpgfan was generally positive with tracks such as astaroth and ending theme receiving particular praise but he felt that several tracks felt lacking compared to first game some tracks including town of twilight suffered in jones s eyes due to their overuse in covenant jeremy parish of 1up com praised soundtrack positively mentioning mitsuda s contributions gamepro positively noted that music gets dramatic during every battle and bethany massimilla of gamespot found it enjoyable and praised battle and main themes igns jeremy dunham felt that soundtrack was not as good as first game but still called it a strength of game mark marrow of palgn said score does a nice job of fitting in with context of each area and rpgfans mike bracken echoed dunham s opinion on score s weakness compared to shadow hearts despite saying that anyone interested in game music should get soundtrack album shadow hearts from new world original soundtrack composition for from new world was once more led by hirota who was joined by fukuda and newcomers tomoko imoto and hirotomi imoto latter also acting as sound director due to game s setting of americas soundtrack made heavy use of ethnic instruments and vocals with overall theme being thirst this was meant to evoke both desert environment and people s thirst for connections for lyrics team used both latin and italian production of soundtrack as with rest of game was on a tight schedule and caused trouble for some members before starting on score hirota researched cultures of native american tribes seeing a shared belief in coexistence with world that informed his concept for game s music after his research he came up with concept of ancient instruments fusing with modern electronic elements which would become main theme of score hirota handled majority of tracks with his first completed piece being theme dream catcher which played during a key story sequence fukada who previously played a minor role for last two shadow hearts titles was invited by hirota to contribute solo tracks to score fukada acted as both composer and arranger for game tomoko imoto was a sacnoth employee whom hirota had met when they were part of band for a live concert a number of ethnic instruments were used throughout score including a didgeridoo and a cajon their use tied into game s setting of new world as with covenant series main theme icaro was used in an arranged form this time it appeared in opening theme great ghost dance choral work for game was led by akiko shikata during her work on chorus segments including spirit sequences she had to redo several of her tracks so they would come off as primal with one piece needing to be redone when imoto rung her up and complained that it sounded like a men s festival she adjusted it so it sounded more ceremonial for one early segment set inside a theater shikata used aria d oreste d from opera idomeneo by wolfgang amadeus mozart she picked area due to its dark tone consequently working it into environment chorus work included use of throat singing for some tracks including dream catcher and great ghost dance game s ending theme spread my wings was composed by hirota and written and sung by takehara tomoaki of indie funk band taste of chocolate a 2cd soundtrack album shadow hearts from new world original soundtrack was released by team entertainment on august 24 2005 video game music online was generally positive about album enjoying several tracks including fusion themes of heroine shania and different environment themes due to fitting their locations fairly well ending theme spread my wings was criticised as inferior to previous theme songs summarising album reviewer said overall it s a good album not great since many of themes have potential to become very repetitive after repeated listenings wilson felt that soundtrack was much stronger than that of covenant though still inferior to first game and despite an uneven start album was generally strong massimilla said that score remains oddly compelling in shadow hearts style dunham was highly positive about game s soundtrack giving it high praise in contrast to his opinions on voice acting tristan kalogeropoulos of palgn praised music saying it matched game s tone and tied action together gann said that despite some redundant town themes soundtrack was one of game s strongest elements despite disliking spread my wings other albums koudelka original soundtrack music for koudelka was composed by kikuta who had previously composed scores of secret of mana seiken densetsu 3 and soukaigi for square he wrote music alongside his roles as game s director producer and writer kikuta found composing score easiest part of development due to mainly working on his own his concept for musical elements of koudelka were created alongside setting and narrative score was arranged by kikuta and nick ingman to compose most of game s tracks kikuta used atari notator sound software while he found lack of compression an issue better sequencing compared to software he used for earlier games was very useful when creating score for cgi cutscenes due to there being a smaller amount of music than average rpg score was completed within six months rather than having looping tracks like his earlier work with square soundtrack of koudelka used ambient sounds and short tracks related to cutscenes outside of battle themes game featured influences from church music opening vocal theme requiem was performed by catherine bott while ending theme ubi caritas et amor taken from a larger composition by maurice durufle was performed by london oratory school excerpts from score were used in a cd drama adaptation of game released in november 1999 by scitron digital contents soundtrack album for game koudelka original soundtrack was published on december 1 1999 by pony canyon and scitron digital contents featuring over an hour of music across 34 tracks album included all tracks from game and live versions of three of battle themes arranged by naoya akimoto harry simons of video game music online gave a mixed opinion of album praising several tracks but finding rest either lacking or poorly written rpgfans patrick gann was highly positive about game s music aside from live tracks which he referred to as a bomb reviewers of games were divided about soundtrack gamespots ike sato called soundtrack simply amazing and jake alley of rpgamer enjoyed most aspects of music while finding battle themes clashed with game s tone david zdyrko of ign was unimpressed by environmental music and called battle themes very worst that have ever been used in a console role playing game ken chu writing for rpgfan found soundtrack disappointing compared to kikuta s previous work dutch magazine power unlimited was particularly scathing calling music a disaster near death experience shadow hearts arrange tracks planning for arrange album near death experience began as hirota was producing soundtrack of from new world album s title derived from his opinion that senses were interconnected main wish of hirota was to rid himself of practical side of music development which had previously restrained his creative abilities for shadow hearts series and involved working with multiple composers who stuck to their own styles due to time constraints for remixes hirota decided to experiment with his own style while retaining core of each track album featured tracks from all three shadow hearts games covering compositions by hirota mitsuda ito and imoto each also provided arrangements hirota handled five out of eleven tracks while others worked on two each album was published by team entertainment on august 24 2005 these four also arranged tracks two music critics who reviewed title had split opinions on album despite generally liking tracks included video game music onlines eduardo friedman called album fantastic particularly noting for titular battle theme from first game and hirota s of 3 karma mike wilson of rpgfan ranked album as a 6 5 out of 10 while he enjoyed some arrangements he felt there was a general lack of effort put into arrangements a track criticised by both was mitsuda s arrangement of covenant boss theme astaroth which they felt was
