1949 florida hurricane caused significant damage in southern portions of state late in month of august second recorded tropical cyclone of annual hurricane season system originated from a tropical wave near northern leeward islands on august 23 already a tropical storm upon initial observations cyclone curved west northwestward and intensified becoming a hurricane on august 25 rapid intensification ensued as storm approached central bahamas early on august 26 with storm reaching category 4 hurricane strength later that day and peaking with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph 215 km h shortly after striking andros late on august 26 storm made landfall near lake worth florida at same intensity cyclone initially weakened quickly after moving inland falling to category 1 status early next day shortly thereafter system curved northward over nature coast and entered georgia on august 28 where it weakened to a tropical storm storm then accelerated northeastward and became extratropical over new england by august 29 remnants traversed atlantic canada and much of atlantic ocean before dissipating near ireland on september 1 hurricane produced strong winds in bahamas including a wind gust of 120 mph 195 km h on bimini a wide expanse of east coast of florida stretching from miami beach to st augustine observed hurricane force winds while much of state recorded winds of at least closer to location of landfall city of lake worth observed a sustained winds speed of palm beach county was one of worst impacted areas with 65 homes destroyed and 13 283 others damaged to some degree just to north martin county also received extensive impact with severe damage inflicted to about 40 of homes and commercial buildings in stuart overall hurricane damaged about 18 000 homes while roughly 1 000 other structures suffered severe damage or destruction in florida about 45 million in damage occurred in state which included 20 million in damage to crops 18 million to property 4 million electrical and communications and 500 000 to road infrastructure damage throughout united states totaled about 52 35 million and three deaths occurred two in florida and one in georgia meteorological history on august 23 a moderate tropical storm developed 200 mi 323 km east of sint maarten operationally system was treated as an easterly wave until it moved through bahamas it is believed that system originated near cape verde islands barnes p 183 on august 24 tropical storm passed north of leeward islands and san juan puerto rico and then strengthened to a minimal hurricane with 75 mph 120 km h winds on august 25 subsequently it strengthened rapidly and cyclone was noted as well developed when it passed near nassau with 115 mph 185 km h winds on morning of august 26 at time it was equivalent of a category 3 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale storm strengthened further over gulf stream and it moved ashore over city of west palm beach as a strong category 4 hurricane around 7 20 p m edt city s airport reported calm conditions from 7 20 7 40 p m and minimum central pressure of 954 mbar 28 18 inhg was measured at site peak gusts were recorded at 125 mph 205 km h before anemometer blew away a maximum sustained wind of 153 mph 246 km h was reported from jupiter inlet light station prior to loss of anemometer although conditions were slightly more severe after reading reliable estimates are unavailable atlantic hurricane database lists cyclone as a strong category 4 hurricane at landfall wind reading is basis for category 4 designation in atlantic hurricane database although a reduction from anemometer s elevated location lends credence to concept of a weaker system norcross bryan 2007 hurricane almanac st martin s griffin originally system was designated as a category 3 hurricane in state of florida based on minimum central pressure reading of 954 mbar 28 18 inhg this pressure corresponds to original classification of a category 3 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale however modern analysis applies saffir simpson rankings based on maximum sustained wind speeds 1949 florida hurricane will be eventually reanalyzed by atlantic hurricane reanalysis project which may find a weaker hurricane in florida central pressure of 954 mbar 28 18 inhg is unusually high for a strong category 4 hurricane reanalysis project has discovered that hurricanes erroneously featured stronger winds than typical pressure wind relationship in 1940s 1960s unlike subsequent hurricanes in 1970s 1980s evidence suggests wind speeds may have been overestimated for hurricanes in 1940s 1960s inland hurricane moved over northern portion of lake okeechobee following a similar path as 1928 okeechobee hurricane on august 27 hurricane recurved over florida peninsula and then weakened to a category 1 hurricane northeast of tampa system diminished to a tropical storm near cedar key and it entered southern georgia during morning of august 28 system passed over carolinas as a weak tropical storm and it was operationally noted as a weak disturbance at time cyclone passed through mid atlantic states and new england on august 29 it became extratropical over new hampshire on august 31 extratropical low was last detected over western north atlantic ocean preparations and impact on august 25 northern bahamas were advised to initiate hurricane precautions and a hurricane warning was issued for islands south floridians were encouraged to closely monitor progress of storm on august 26 hurricane warnings were released from miami to
