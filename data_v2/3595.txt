impressed with gun runner s performance you know going back and thinking about race it s very rare as a jockey that you can feel a horse never getting tired in a 1 1 8 mile grade 1 he remarked gun runner made his next start in whitney stakes on august 5 at saratoga going off as heavy 3 5 favorite after a good start he settled into second place behind cautious giant who had been entered as a rabbit for his stablemate war story entering far turn geroux decided pace was too slow and let gun runner assume control of race in stretch he continued to draw away to a length victory despite a strong late run from keen ice win attracted further attention on social media because gun runner ran final half mile with a horseshoe caught in his tail a shoe from cautious giant flew loose just as gun runner was starting his move we watched tape repeatedly repeatedly said asmussen and if you never seen anything before just wait around can you believe that i mean if we tried to throw one and stick in one s tail as he was standing still we d go 0 for 1 000 let alone at a run let alone gun runner let alone in whitney and it stayed with how fast he was going during race it was held out from him when he slowed down to walk then it came into him we were obviously unaware of it until he came back to winner s circle but not a nick on him i mean there s still nails in it shoe was originally thrown out by asmussen s assistant trainer scott blasi but after realizing rarity of situation blasi paid 100 to a fan to get it back it was eventually given to asmussen s children race improved gun
