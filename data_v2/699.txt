praised game s visuals with nathan meunier of gamesradar stating that game really stands out as one of more visually impressive and creatively designed downloadable offerings in recent years peter eykemans of ign wrote that art highlights journey and that overall aesthetics are beautiful edge magazine in a highly critical review called game successful only as an interactive showcase of jurevicius art simon parkin of eurogamer in a review that was much kinder to game overall also called art and animation strongest aspects of game several reviewers compared game s visuals to style developed by tim burton gameplay itself was viewed in a significantly harsher light several critics took issue with controls which were viewed as imprecise both in platforming and in combat phases of game reviewers took issue with various parts of combat system several reviewers found combat against large groups of enemies to be frustrating jason venter of gamespot singled out a specific combat stage taking place on an airship as particularly demonstrative of game s shortcomings in combat calling scenario cheap venter did however have praise for game s boss battles which he described as a nice change of pace because victory relies more on pattern memorization and intuition than manic combat edge magazine echoed praise for boss battles and both reviews lamented that such segments were not more common reviews were mixed on co op mode while reviewers praised bunnyguru s martial arts inspired moveset they did not like bunnyguru s inability to grapple which limits second player s utility in some situations edge magazine also complained that even when there were two players playing camera would always center on scarygirl even if that meant that bunnyguru wound up off screen reviews were also mixed for exploration and collection aspects of game parkin of eurogamer described these aspects by stating that branching paths through levels add illusion of depth but for players who wish to collect 100 per cent of gems in a stage trekking backwards and forwards through a level is an inelegant slog peter eykemans of ign found that game s branching paths created difficulty for players seeking to gain a rating of perfection but goes on to recommend game to people that enjoy searching for collectables film adaptation a film based on scarygirl titled arkie is currently in production at passion pictures and nitrogen studios arkie is set to be released into theaters in 2019 and will star shailene woodley jai courtney and king bach arkie is directed by luke jurevicius
