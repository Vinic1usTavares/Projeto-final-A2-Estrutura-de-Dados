italian composer who gained fame for his 39 operas although he also wrote many songs some chamber music and piano pieces and some sacred music he set new standards for both comic and serious opera before retiring from large scale composition while still in his thirties at height of his popularity born in pesaro to parents who were both musicians his father a trumpeter his mother a singer rossini began to compose by age of 12 and was educated at music school in bologna his first opera was performed in venice in 1810 when he was 18 years old in 1815 he was engaged to write operas and manage theatres in naples in period 1810 1823 he wrote 34 operas for italian stage that were performed in venice milan ferrara naples and elsewhere this productivity necessitated an almost formulaic approach for some components such as overtures and a certain amount of self borrowing during this period he produced his most popular works including comic operas l italiana in algeri il barbiere di siviglia known in english as barber of seville and la cenerentola which brought to a peak opera buffa tradition he inherited from masters such as domenico cimarosa he also composed opera seria works such as otello tancredi and semiramide all of these attracted admiration for their innovation in melody harmonic and instrumental colour and dramatic form in 1824 he was contracted by opera in paris for which he produced an opera to celebrate coronation of charles x il viaggio a reims later cannibalised for his first opera in french le comte ory revisions of two of his italian operas le siege de corinthe and moise and in 1829 his last opera guillaume tell rossini s withdrawal from opera for last 40 years of his life has never been fully explained factors may have been ill health wealth his success had brought him and rise of spectacular grand opera under composers such as giacomo meyerbeer from early 1830s to 1855 when he left paris and was based in bologna rossini wrote relatively little on his return to paris in 1855 he became renowned for his musical salons on saturdays regularly attended by musicians and artistic and fashionable circles of paris for which he wrote entertaining pieces peches de vieillesse guests included franz liszt anton rubinstein giuseppe verdi meyerbeer and joseph joachim rossini s last major composition was his petite messe solennelle 1863 he died in paris in 1868 life and career early life rossini was born in 1792 in pesaro a town on adriatic coast of italy that was then part of papal states he was only child of giuseppe rossini a trumpeter and horn player and his wife anna nee a seamstress by trade daughter of a baker giuseppe rossini was charming but impetuous and feckless burden of supporting family and raising child fell mainly on anna with some help from her mother and mother in law stendhal who published a colourful biography of rossini in 1824 wrote giuseppe was imprisoned at least twice first in 1790 for insubordination to local authorities in a dispute about his employment as town trumpeter and in 1799 and 1800 for republican activism and support of troops of napoleon against pope s austrian backers in 1798 when rossini was aged six his mother began a career as a professional singer in comic opera and for a little over a decade was a considerable success in cities including trieste and bologna before her untrained voice began to fail in 1802 family moved to lugo near ravenna where rossini received a good basic education in italian latin and arithmetic as well as music he studied horn with his father and other music with a priest giuseppe whose extensive library contained works by haydn and mozart both little known in italy at time but inspirational to young rossini he was a quick learner and by age of twelve he had composed a set of six sonatas for four stringed instruments which were performed under aegis of a rich patron in 1804 two years later he was admitted to recently opened liceo musicale bologna initially studying singing cello and piano and joining composition class soon afterwards he wrote some substantial works while a student including a mass and a cantata and after two years he was invited to continue his studies he declined offer strict academic regime of liceo had given him a solid compositional technique but as his biographer richard osborne puts it his instinct to continue his education in real world finally asserted itself while still at liceo rossini had performed in public as a singer and worked in theatres as a repetiteur and keyboard soloist in 1810 at request of popular tenor domenico mombelli he wrote his first operatic score a two act operatic dramma serio demetrio e to a libretto by mombelli s wife it was publicly staged in 1812 after composer s first successes rossini and his parents concluded that his future lay in composing operas main operatic centre in north eastern italy was venice under tutelage of composer giovanni morandi a family friend rossini moved there in late 1810 when he was eighteen first operas 1810 1815 rossini s first opera to be staged was la di a one act comedy given at small teatro san moise in november 1810 piece was a great success and rossini received what then seemed to him a considerable sum forty an amount i had never seen brought together he later described san moise as an ideal theatre for a young composer learning his craft everything tended to facilitate debut of a novice composer it had no chorus and a small company of principals its main repertoire consisted of one act comic operas farse staged with modest scenery and minimal rehearsal rossini followed success of his first piece with three more farse for house l felice 1812 la scala di seta 1812 and il signor bruschino 1813 rossini maintained his links with bologna where in 1811 he had a success directing haydn s seasons and a failure with his first full length opera l stravagante he also worked for opera houses in ferrara and rome in mid 1812 he received a commission from la scala milan where his two act comedy la pietra del paragone ran for fifty three performances a considerable run for time which brought him not only financial benefits but exemption from military service and title of maestro di a composer whose name on advertising posters guaranteed a full house following year his first opera seria tancredi did well at la fenice in venice and even better at ferrara with a rewritten tragic ending success of tancredi made rossini s name known internationally productions of opera followed in london 1820 and new york 1825 within weeks of tancredi rossini had another box office success with his comedy l italiana in algeri composed in great haste and premiered in may 1813 1814 was a less remarkable year for rising composer neither il turco in italia or sigismondo pleasing milanese or venetian public respectively 1815 marked an important stage in rossini s career in may he moved to naples to take up post of director of music for royal theatres these included teatro di san carlo city s leading opera house its manager domenico barbaia was to be an important influence on composer s career there naples and il barbiere 1815 1820 thumb left upright 1 3 storm scene from il barbiere in an 1830 lithograph by alexandre fragonard musical establishment of naples was not immediately welcoming to rossini who was seen as an intruder into its cherished operatic traditions city had once been operatic capital of europe memory of cimarosa was revered and paisiello was still living but there were no local composers of any stature to follow them and rossini quickly won public and critics round rossini s first work for san carlo elisabetta regina d inghilterra was a dramma per musica in two acts in which he reused substantial sections of his earlier works unfamiliar to local public rossini scholars philip gossett and patricia brauner write it is as if rossini wished to present himself to neapolitan public by offering a selection of best music from operas unlikely to be revived in naples new opera was received with tremendous enthusiasm as was neapolitan premiere of l italiana in algeri and rossini s position in naples was assured for first time rossini was able to write regularly for a resident company of first rate singers and a fine orchestra with adequate rehearsals and schedules that made it unnecessary to compose in a rush to meet deadlines between 1815 and 1822 he composed eighteen more operas nine for naples and nine for opera houses in other cities in 1816 for teatro argentina in rome he composed opera that was to become his best known il barbiere di siviglia barber of seville there was already a popular opera of that title by paisiello and rossini s version was originally given same title as its hero despite an unsuccessful opening night with mishaps on stage and many pro paisiello and anti rossini audience members opera quickly became a success and by time of its first revival in bologna a few months later it was billed by its present italian title and rapidly eclipsed paisiello s setting thumb alt of young woman in long

serious pieces his otello 1816 provoked lord byron to write they have been crucifying othello into an opera music good but lugubrious but as for words nonetheless piece proved generally popular and held stage in frequent revivals until it was overshadowed by verdi s version seven decades later among his other works for house were mose in egitto based on biblical story of moses and exodus from egypt 1818 and la donna del lago from sir walter scott s poem lady of lake 1819 for la scala he wrote opera semiseria la gazza ladra 1817 and for rome his version of cinderella story la cenerentola 1817 in 1817 came first performance of one of his operas l italiana at theatre italien in paris its success led to others of his operas being staged there and eventually to his contract in paris from 1824 to 1830 rossini kept his personal life as private as possible but he was known for his susceptibility to singers in companies he worked with among his lovers in his early years were ester mombelli domenico s daughter and maria of bologna company by far most important of these relationships both personal and professional was with isabella colbran prima donna of teatro san carlo and former mistress of barbaia rossini had heard her sing in bologna in 1807 and when he moved to naples he wrote a succession of important roles for her in opere serie vienna and london 1820 1824 by early 1820s rossini was beginning to tire of naples failure of his operatic tragedy ermione previous year convinced him that he and neapolitan audiences had had enough of each other an insurrection in naples against monarchy though quickly crushed unsettled rossini when barbaia signed a contract to take company to vienna rossini was glad to join them but did not reveal to barbaia that he had no intention of returning to naples afterwards he travelled with colbran in march 1822 breaking their journey at bologna where they were married in presence of his parents in a small church in castenaso a few miles from city bride was thirty seven groom thirty in vienna rossini received a hero s welcome his biographers describe it as unprecedentedly feverish enthusiasm rossini fever and near hysteria authoritarian chancellor of austrian empire metternich liked rossini s music and thought it free of all potential revolutionary or republican associations he was therefore happy to permit san carlo company to perform composer s operas in a three month season they played six of them to audiences so enthusiastic that beethoven s assistant anton schindler described it as an idolatrous orgy thumb left alt drawing of plump man in court dress greeting a slimmer balding one also in formal court dress george iv left greeting rossini at brighton pavilion in vienna rossini heard beethoven s eroica

recalled that although conversation was hampered by beethoven s deafness and rossini s ignorance of german beethoven made it plain that he thought rossini s talents were not for serious opera and that above all he should do more barbiere barbers after vienna season rossini returned to castenaso to work with his librettist gaetano rossi on semiramide commissioned by la fenice it was premiered in february 1823 his last work for italian theatre colbran starred but it was clear to everyone that her voice was in serious decline and semiramide ended her career in italy work survived that one major disadvantage and entered international operatic repertory remaining popular throughout 19th century in richard osborne s words it brought rossini s italian career to a spectacular close in november 1823 rossini and colbran set off for london where a lucrative contract had been offered they stopped for four weeks en route in paris although he was not as feverishly acclaimed by parisians as he had been in vienna he nevertheless had an exceptionally welcoming reception from musical establishment and public when he attended a performance of il barbiere at theatre italien he was applauded dragged onto stage and serenaded by musicians a banquet was given for him and his wife attended by leading french composers and artists and he found cultural climate of paris congenial once in england rossini was received and made much of by king george iv although composer was by now unimpressed by royalty and aristocracy rossini and colbran had signed contracts for an opera season at king s theatre in haymarket her vocal shortcomings were a serious liability and she reluctantly retired from performing public opinion was not improved by rossini s failure to provide a new opera as promised impresario vincenzo benelli defaulted on his contract with composer but this was not known to london press and public who blamed rossini in a 2003 biography of composer gaia servadio comments that rossini and england were not made for each other he was prostrated by channel crossing and was unlikely to be enthused by english weather or english cooking although his stay in london was financially rewarding british press reported disapprovingly that he had earned over ps30 000 he was happy to sign a contract at french embassy in london to return to paris where he had felt much more at home paris and final operas 1824 1829 rossini s new and highly remunerative contract with french government was negotiated under louis xviii who died in september 1824 soon after rossini s arrival in paris it had been agreed that composer would produce one grand opera for academie royale de musique and either an opera buffa or an opera semiseria for theatre italien he was also to help run latter theatre and revise one of his earlier works for revival there death of king and accession of charles x changed rossini s plans and his first new work for paris was il viaggio a reims an operatic entertainment

retirement put a strain on rossinis marriage leaving her unoccupied while he continued to be centre of musical attention and constantly in demand she consoled herself with what servadio describes as a new pleasure in shopping for rossini paris offered continual gourmet delights as his increasingly rotund shape began to reflect first of four operas rossini wrote to french librettos were le siege de corinthe 1826 and moise et pharaon 1827 both were substantial reworkings of pieces written for naples maometto ii and mose in egitto rossini took great care before beginning work on first learning to speak french and familiarising himself with traditional french operatic ways of declaiming language as well as dropping some of original music that was in an ornate style unfashionable in paris rossini accommodated local preferences by adding dances hymn like numbers and a greater role for chorus rossini s mother anna died in 1827 he had been devoted to her and he felt her loss deeply she and colbran had never got on well and servadio suggests that after anna died rossini came to resent surviving woman in his life in 1828 rossini wrote le comte ory his only french language comic opera his determination to reuse music from il viaggio a reims caused problems for his librettists who had to adapt their original plot and write french words to fit existing italian numbers but opera was a success and was seen in london within six months of paris premiere and in new york in 1831 following year rossini wrote his long awaited french grand opera guillaume tell based on friedrich schiller s 1804 play which drew on william tell legend early retirement 1830 1855 guillaume tell was well received orchestra and singers gathered outside rossini s house after premiere and performed rousing finale to second act in his honour newspaper le globe commented that a new era of music had begun gaetano donizetti remarked that first and last acts of opera were written by rossini but middle act

rossinis had left paris and were staying in castenaso within a year events in paris had rossini hurrying back charles x was overthrown in a revolution in july 1830 and new administration headed by louis philippe i announced radical cutbacks in government spending among cuts was rossini s lifetime annuity won after hard negotiation with previous regime attempting to restore annuity was one of rossini s reasons for returning other was to be with his new mistress olympe pelissier he left colbran in castenaso she never returned to paris and they never lived together again reasons for rossini s withdrawal from opera have been continually discussed during and since his lifetime some have supposed that aged thirty seven and in variable health having negotiated a sizeable annuity from french government and having written thirty nine operas he simply planned to retire and kept to that plan in a 1934 study of composer critic francis toye coined phrase great renunciation and called rossini s retirement a phenomenon unique in history of music and difficult to parallel in whole history of art poet heine compared rossini s retirement with shakespeare s withdrawal from writing two geniuses recognising when they had accomplished and not seeking to follow it others then and later suggested that rossini had retired because of pique at successes of giacomo meyerbeer and fromental halevy in genre of grand opera modern rossini scholarship has generally discounted such theories maintaining that rossini had no intention of renouncing operatic composition and that circumstances rather than personal choice made guillaume tell his last opera gossett and richard osborne suggest that illness may have been a major factor in rossini s retirement from about this time rossini had intermittent bad health both physical and mental he had contracted gonorrhoea in earlier years which later led to painful side effects from to arthritis he suffered from bouts of debilitating depression which commentators have linked to several possible causes cyclothymia or bipolar disorder or reaction to his mother s death for next twenty five years following guillaume tell rossini composed little although gossett comments that his comparatively few compositions from 1830s and 1840s show no falling off in musical inspiration they include soirees musicales 1830 1835 a set of twelve songs for solo or duet voices and piano and his stabat mater begun in 1831 and completed in 1841 after winning his fight with government over his annuity in 1835 rossini left paris and settled in bologna his return to paris in 1843 for medical treatment by jean sparked hopes that he might produce a new grand opera it was rumoured that eugene scribe was preparing a libretto for him about joan of arc opera was moved to present a french version of otello in 1844 which also included material from some of composer s earlier operas it is unclear to what extent if at all rossini was involved with this production which was in event poorly received more controversial was pasticcio opera of robert bruce 1846 in which rossini by then returned to bologna closely cooperated by selecting music from his past operas which had not yet been performed in paris notably la donna del lago opera sought to present robert as a new rossini opera but although othello could at least claim to be genuine canonic rossini historian mark everist notes that detractors argued that robert was simply fake goods and from a bygone era at that he cites theophile gautier regretting that lack of unity could have been masked by a superior performance unfortunately tradition of rossini s music was lost at opera a long time ago period after 1835 saw rossini s formal separation from his wife who remained at castenaso 1837 and death of his father at age of eighty 1839 in 1845 colbran became seriously ill and in september rossini travelled to visit her a month later she died following year rossini and pelissier were married in bologna events of year of revolution in 1848 led rossini to move away from bologna area where he felt threatened by insurrection and to make florence his base which it remained until 1855 by early 1850s rossini s mental and physical health had deteriorated to point where his wife and friends feared for his sanity or his life by middle of decade it was clear that he needed to return to paris for most advanced medical care then available in april 1855 rossinis set off for their final journey from italy to france rossini returned to paris aged sixty three and made it his home for rest of his life sins of old age 1855 1868 gossett observes that although an account of rossini s life between 1830 and 1855 makes depressing reading it is no exaggeration to say that in paris rossini returned to life he recovered his health and joie de vivre once settled in paris he maintained two homes a flat in rue de la chaussee d antin a smart central area and a neo classical villa built for him in passy a commune now absorbed into city but then semi rural he and his wife established a salon that became internationally famous first of their saturday evening gatherings samedi soirs was held in december 1858 and last two months before he died in 1868 thumb upright alt photo of fat old man looking genial and happy rossini in began composing again his music from his final decade was not generally intended for public performance and he did not usually put dates of composition on manuscripts consequently musicologists have found it difficult to give definite dates for his late works but first or among first was song cycle musique dedicated to his wife and presented to her in april 1857 for their weekly salons he produced more than 150 pieces including songs solo piano pieces and chamber works for many different combinations of instruments he referred to them as his peches de vieillesse sins of old age salons were held both at beau passy villa and in winter at paris flat such gatherings were a regular feature of parisian life writer james penrose has observed that well connected could easily attend different salons almost every night of week but rossinis samedi soirs quickly became most sought after an invitation was city s highest social prize music carefully chosen by rossini was not only his own but included works by haydn and mozart and modern pieces by some of his guests among composers who attended salons and sometimes performed were auber gounod liszt rubinstein meyerbeer and verdi rossini liked to call himself a fourth class pianist but many famous pianists who attended samedi soirs were dazzled by his playing violinists such as pablo sarasate and joseph joachim and leading singers of day were regular guests in 1860 wagner visited rossini via an introduction from rossini s friend edmond who some forty five years later wrote his account of genial conversation between two composers one of rossini s few late works intended to be given in public was his petite messe solennelle first performed in 1864 in same year rossini was made a grand officer of legion of honour by napoleon iii after a short illness and an unsuccessful operation to treat colorectal cancer rossini died at passy on 13 november 1868 at age of seventy six he left olympe a life interest in his estate which after her death ten years later passed to commune of pesaro for establishment of a liceo musicale and funded a home for retired opera singers in paris after a funeral service attended by more than four thousand people at church of sainte trinite paris rossini s body was interred at pere lachaise cemetery in 1887 his remains were moved to church of santa croce florence music code rossini writer julian budden noting formulas adopted early on by rossini in his career and consistently followed by him thereafter as regards overtures arias structures and ensembles has called them code rossini in a reference to code napoleon legal system established by french emperor rossini s overall style may indeed have been influenced more directly by french historian john rosselli suggests that french rule in italy at start of 19th century meant that music had taken on new military qualities of attack noise and speed to be heard in rossini rossini s approach to opera was inevitably tempered by changing tastes and audience demands formal classicist libretti of which had underpinned late 18th century opera seria were replaced by subjects more to taste of age of romanticism with stories demanding stronger characterisation and quicker action a jobbing composer needed to meet these demands or fail rossini s strategies met this reality a formulaic approach was logistically indispensable for rossini s career at least at start in seven years 1812 1819 he wrote 27 operas often at extremely short notice for la cenerentola 1817 for example he had just over three weeks to write music before premiere such pressures led to a further significant element of rossini s compositional procedures not included in budden s code namely recycling composer often transferred a successful overture to subsequent operas thus overture to la pietra del paragone was later used for opera seria tancredi 1813 and in other direction overture to aureliano in palmira 1813 ended as and is today known as overture to comedy il barbiere di siviglia barber of seville he also liberally re employed arias and other sequences in later works spike hughes notes that of twenty six numbers of eduardo e cristina produced in venice in 1817 nineteen were lifted from previous works audience were remarkably good humoured and asked slyly why libretto had been changed since last performance rossini expressed his disgust when publisher giovanni ricordi issued a complete edition of his works in 1850s same pieces will be found several times for i thought i had right to remove from my fiascos those pieces which seemed best to rescue them from shipwreck a fiasco seemed to be good and dead and now look they ve resuscitated them all overtures philip gossett notes that rossini was from outset a consummate composer of overtures his basic formula for these remained constant throughout his career gossett characterises them as sonata movements without development sections usually preceded by a slow introduction with clear melodies exuberant rhythms and simple harmonic structure and a crescendo climax richard taruskin also notes that second theme is always announced in a woodwind solo whose catchiness etch es a distinct profile in aural memory and that richness and inventiveness of his handling of orchestra even in these early works marks start of t he great nineteenth century flowering of orchestration arias thumb upright 1 8 alt page of musical score extract from di tanti palpiti tancredi rossini s handling of arias and duets in cavatina style marked a development from eighteenth century commonplace of recitative and aria in words of rosselli in rossini s hands aria became an engine for releasing emotion rossini s typical aria structure involved a lyrical introduction cantabile and a more intensive brilliant conclusion cabaletta this model could be adapted in various ways so as to forward plot as opposed to typical eighteenth century handling which resulted in action coming to a halt as requisite repeats of da capo aria were undertaken for example they could be punctuated by comments from other characters a convention known as or chorus could intervene between cantabile and cabaletta so as to fire up soloist if such developments were not necessarily rossini s own invention he nevertheless made them his own by his expert handling of them a landmark in this context is cavatina di tanti palpiti from tancredi which both taruskin and gossett amongst others single out as transformative most famous aria rossini ever wrote with a melody that seems to capture melodic beauty and innocence characteristic of italian opera both writers point out typical rossinian touch of avoiding an expected cadence in aria by a sudden shift from home key of f to that of a flat see example taruskin notes implicit pun as words talk of returning but music moves in a new direction influence was lasting gossett notes how rossinian cabaletta style continued to inform italian opera as late as giuseppe verdi s aida 1871 structure thumb upright alt text only poster for operatic performance listing cast poster for a performance of tancredi in ferrara structural integration of forms of vocal music with dramatic development of opera meant a sea change from primacy of aria in rossini s works solo arias progressively take up a smaller proportion of operas in favour of duets also typically in cantabile caballetta format and ensembles during late 18th century creators of opera buffa had increasingly developed dramatic integration of finales of each act finales began to spread backwards taking an ever larger proportion of act taking structure of a musically continuous chain accompanied throughout by orchestra of a series of sections each with its own characteristics of speed and style mounting to a clamorous and vigorous final scene in his comic operas rossini brought this technique to its peak and extended its range far beyond his predecessors of finale to first act of l italiana in algeri taruskin writes that r through almost a hundred pages of vocal score in record time it is most concentrated single dose of rossini that there is of greater consequence for history of opera was rossini s ability to progress this technique in genre of opera seria gossett in a very detailed analysis of first act finale of tancredi identifies several elements in rossini s practice these include contrast of kinetic action sequences often characterised by orchestral motifs with static expressions of emotion final static section in form of a caballetta with all characters joining in final cadences gossett claims that it is from time of tancredi that caballetta becomes obligatory closing section of each musical unit in operas of rossini and his contemporaries early works with extremely few exceptions all rossini s compositions before peches de vieillesse of his retirement involve human voice his very first surviving work apart from a single song is however a set of string sonatas for two violins cello and double bass written at age of 12 when he had barely begun instruction in composition tuneful and engaging they indicate how remote talented child was from influence of advances in musical form evolved by mozart haydn and beethoven accent is on cantabile melody colour variation and virtuosity rather than transformational development these qualities are also evident in rossini s early operas especially his farse one act farces rather than his more formal opere serie gossett notes that these early works were written at a time when t he deposited mantles of cimarosa and paisiello were unfilled these were rossini s first and increasingly appreciated steps in trying them on teatro san moise in venice where his farse were first performed and la scala theatre of milan which premiered his two act opera la pietra del paragone 1812 were seeking works in that tradition gossett notes that in these operas rossini s musical personality began to take shape many elements emerge that remain throughout his career including a love of sheer sound of sharp and effective rhythms unusual effect employed in overture of il signor bruschino 1813 deploying violin bows tapping rhythms on music stands is an example of such witty originality italy 1813 1823 thumb upright alt painting of prosperous looking man in fur collared black coat left domenico in naples in 1820s great success in venice

composer of his generation from end of 1813 to mid 1814 he was in milan creating two new operas for la scala aureliano in palmira and il turco in italia in aureliano was sung by castrato giambattista velluti this was last opera role rossini wrote for a castrato singer as norm became to use contralto voices another sign of change in operatic taste rumour had it that rossini was displeased by velluti s ornamentation of his music but in fact throughout his italian period up to semiramide 1823 rossini s written vocal lines become increasingly florid and this is more appropriately credited to composer s own changing style rossini s work in naples contributed to this stylistic development city which was cradle of operas of cimarosa and paisiello had been slow to acknowledge composer from pesaro but domenico barbaia invited him in 1815 on a seven year contract to manage his theatres and compose operas for first time rossini was able to work over a long period with a company of musicians and singers including amongst latter isabella colbran andrea giovanni david and others who as gossett notes all specialized in florid singing and whose vocal talents left an indelible and not wholly positive mark on rossini s style rossini s first operas for naples elisabetta regina d inghilterra and la gazzetta were both largely recycled from earlier works but otello 1816 is marked not only by its virtuoso vocal lines but by its masterfully integrated last act with its drama underlined by melody orchestration and tonal colour here in gossett s opinion rossini came of age as a dramatic artist he further comments thumb alt caricature of man in turkish dress carrying and banging a large drum upright 1 3 il signor ou la nouvelle melodie 1821 by now rossini s career was arousing interest across europe others came to italy to study revival of italian opera and used its lessons to advance themselves amongst these was berlin born giacomo meyerbeer who arrived in italy in 1816 a year after rossini s establishment at naples and lived and worked there until following him to paris in 1825 he used one of rossini s librettists gaetano rossi for five of his seven italian operas which were produced at turin venice and milan in a letter to his brother of september 1818 he includes a detailed critique of otello from point of view of a non italian informed observer he is scathing about self borrowings in first two acts but concedes that third act so firmly established rossini s reputation in venice that even a thousand follies could not rob him of it but this act is divinely beautiful and what is so strange is that its beauties are blatantly un rossinian outstanding even passionate recitatives mysterious accompaniments lots of local colour rossini s contract did not prevent him from undertaking other commissions and before otello il barbiere di siviglia a grand culmination of opera buffa tradition had been premiered in rome february 1816 richard osborne catalogues its excellencies beyond physical impact of figaro s largo al factotum there is rossini s ear for vocal and instrumental timbres of a peculiar and brilliance his quick witted word setting and his mastery of large musical forms with their often brilliant and explosive internal variations add to that what verdi called opera s abundance of true musical ideas and reasons for work s longer term emergence as rossini s most popular opera buffa are not hard to find apart from la cenerentola rome 1817 and pen and ink sketch adina 1818 not performed until 1826 rossini s other works during his contract with naples were all in opera seria tradition amongst most notable of these all containing virtuoso singing roles were mose in egitto 1818 la donna del lago 1819 maometto ii 1820 all staged in naples and semiramide his last opera written for italy staged at la fenice in venice in 1823 both mose and maometto ii were later to undergo significant reconstruction in paris see below france 1824 1829 thumb left alt page of musical score extract from rossini s moise published in le globe 31 march 1827 in an article by ludovic already in 1818 meyerbeer had heard rumours that rossini was seeking a lucrative appointment at paris opera should his proposals be accepted he will go to french capital and we will perhaps experience curious things some six years were to pass before this prophecy came true in 1824 rossini under a contract with french government became director of theatre italien in paris where he introduced meyerbeer s opera il crociato in egitto and for which he wrote il viaggio a reims to celebrate coronation of charles x 1825 this was his last opera to an italian libretto and was later cannibalised to create his first french opera le comte ory 1828 a new contract in 1826 meant he could concentrate on productions at opera and to this end he substantially revised ii as le siege de corinthe 1826 and mose as moise et pharaon 1827 meeting french taste works are extended each by one act vocal lines in revisions are less florid and dramatic structure is enhanced with proportion of arias reduced one of most striking additions was chorus at end of act iii of moise with a crescendo repetition of a diatonic ascending bass line rising first by a minor third then by a major third at each appearance and a descending chromatic top line which roused excitement of audiences rossini s government contract required him to create at least one new grand opera and rossini settled on story of william tell working closely with librettist etienne de story in particular enabled him to indulge an underlying interest in related genres of folk music pastoral and picturesque this becomes clear from overture which is explicitly programmatic in describing weather scenery and action and presents a version of des swiss cowherd s call which undergoes a number of transformations during opera and gives it in richard osborne s opinion something of character of a leitmotif in opinion of music historian benjamin walton rossini saturate s work with local colour to such a degree that there is room for little else thus role of soloists is significantly reduced compared to other rossini operas hero not even having an aria of his own whilst chorus of swiss people is consistently in musical and dramatic foregrounds thumb upright 1 4 costume designs for guillaume tell with laure cinti as mathilde adolphe nourrit as arnold and nicolas levasseur as walter tell premiered in august 1829 rossini also provided for opera a shorter three act version which incorporated pas redouble quick march final section of overture in its finale it was first performed in 1831 and became basis of opera s future productions tell was very successful from start and was frequently revived in 1868 composer was present at its 500th performance at opera globe had reported enthusiastically at its opening that a new epoch has opened not only for french opera but for dramatic music elsewhere this was an era it transpired in which rossini was not to participate withdrawal 1830 1868 rossini s contract required him to provide five new works for opera over 10 years after premiere of tell he was already considering some opera subjects including goethe s faust but only significant works he completed before abandoning paris in 1836 were stabat mater written for a private commission in 1831 later completed and published in 1841 and collection of salon vocal music soirees musicales published in 1835 living in bologna he occupied himself teaching singing at liceo musicale and also created a pasticcio of tell rodolfo di for benefit of singer nikolay ivanov for which giuseppe verdi provided some new arias continuing demand in paris resulted in productions of a new french version of otello in 1844 with which rossini was not involved and a new opera robert bruce for which rossini cooperated with louis niedermeyer and others to recast music for la donna del lago and others of his works which were little known in paris to fit a new libretto success of both of these was qualified to say least not until rossini returned to paris in 1855 were there signs of a revival of his musical spirits a stream of pieces for voices choir piano and chamber ensembles written for his soirees peches de vieillesse sins of old age were issued in thirteen volumes from 1857 to 1868 of these volumes 4 to 8 comprise 56 semi comical piano pieces dedicated to pianists of fourth class to which i have honour of belonging these include a mock funeral march marche et reminiscences pour mon dernier voyage march and reminiscences for my last journey gossett writes of peches their historical position remains to be assessed but it seems likely that their effect direct or indirect on composers like camille saint saens and erik satie was significant most substantial work of rossini s last decade petite messe solennelle 1863 was written for small forces originally voices two pianos and harmonium and therefore unsuited to concert hall performance and as it included women s voices it was unacceptable for church performances at time for these reasons richard osborne suggests piece has been somewhat overlooked among rossini s compositions it is neither especially petite little nor entirely solennelle solemn but is notable for its grace counterpoint and melody at end of manuscript composer wrote dear god here it is finished this poor little mass is it sacred music i have written or damned music i was born for opera buffa as you know well a little technique a little heart that s all be blessed then and grant me paradise influence and legacy thumb upright alt highly ornate white marble funerary monument rossini s final resting place in basilica of santa croce florence sculpture by giuseppe 1900 popularity of rossini s melodies led many contemporary virtuosi to create piano transcriptions or fantasies based on them examples include sigismond thalberg s fantasy on themes from moise sets of variations on non piu mesta from la cenerentola by henri herz frederic chopin franz anton diabelli and friedrich and liszt s transcriptions of william tell overture 1838 and soirees musicales continuing popularity of his comic operas and decline in staging his opere serie overthrow of singing and staging styles of his period and emerging concept of composer as creative artist rather than craftsman diminished and distorted rossini s place in music history even though forms of italian opera continued up to period of to be indebted to his innovations rossini s status amongst his contemporary italian composers is indicated by per rossini a project initiated by verdi within a few days of rossini s death which he and a dozen other composers created in collaboration if rossini s principal legacy to italian opera was in vocal forms and dramatic structure for serious opera his legacy to french opera was to provide a bridge from opera buffa to development of opera comique and thence via jacques offenbach s operas bouffes to genre of operetta operas showing a debt to rossini s style include francois adrien boieldieu s la dame blanche 1825 and daniel auber s fra diavolo 1830 as well as works by ferdinand herold adolphe adam and fromental halevy critical of rossini s style was hector berlioz who wrote of his melodic cynicism his contempt for dramatic and good sense his endless repetition of a single form of cadence his eternal puerile crescendo and his brutal bass drum it was perhaps inevitable that formidable reputation which rossini had built in his lifetime would fade thereafter in 1886 less than twenty years after composer s death bernard shaw wrote once universal rossini whose semiramide appeared to our greener grandfathers a wonder came at last to be no longer looked upon as a serious musician in an 1877 review of il barbiere he noted that adelina patti sang as an encore in lesson scene home sweet home but that opera proved so intolerably wearisome that some of her audience had already displayed their appreciation of sentiment of ballad in most practical way in early 20th century rossini received tributes from both ottorino respighi who had orchestrated excerpts from peches de both in his ballet la boutique fantasque 1918 and in his 1925 suite and from benjamin britten who adapted music by rossini for two suites soirees musicales op 9 in 1936 and matinees musicales op 24 in 1941 richard osborne singles out three volume biography of rossini by giuseppe 1927 1929 as an important turning point towards positive appreciation which may also have been assisted by trend of neoclassicism in music a firm re evaluation of rossini s significance began only later in 20th century in light of study and creation of critical editions of his works a prime mover in these developments was fondazione g rossini which was created by city of pesaro in 1940 using funds which had been left to city by composer since 1980 fondazione has supported annual rossini opera festival in pesaro in 21st century rossini repertoire of opera houses around world remains dominated by il barbiere la cenerentola
