hurricane janet was most powerful tropical cyclone of 1955 atlantic hurricane season and one of strongest atlantic hurricanes on record janet was also first named storm to have 1 000 deaths and first category 5 named storm to be retired eleventh tropical storm ninth hurricane and fourth major hurricane of year janet formed from a tropical wave east of lesser antilles on september 21 moving westward across caribbean sea janet fluctuated in intensity but generally strengthened before reaching its peak intensity as a category 5 hurricane with winds of intense hurricane later made landfall at that intensity near chetumal mexico on september 28 after weakening over yucatan peninsula it moved into bay of campeche where it slightly strengthened before making its final landfall near veracruz on september 29 janet quickly weakened over mexico s mountainous terrain before dissipating on september 30 in its developmental stages janet caused 7 8 million in damage to lesser antilles and 189 deaths in grenadines and barbados while janet was in central caribbean sea a reconnaissance aircraft flew into storm and was lost with all eleven crew members believed to be perished this remains only such loss which has occurred in association with an atlantic hurricane a category 5 upon landfall on yucatan peninsula janet caused severe devastation in areas of quintana roo and british honduras only five buildings in chetumal mexico remained intact after storm and an estimated 500 deaths occurred in mexican state of quintana roo at janet s second landfall near veracruz significant river flooding ensued worsening effects caused by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in month floods left thousands of people stranded and killed at least 326 people in tampico area leading to largest mexican relief operation ever executed by united states janet s landfall as a category 5 hurricane on yucatan peninsula was first recorded instance that a storm of such intensity in atlantic made landfall on a continental mainland prior to janet landfalls of category 5 intensity were only known to have taken place on islands janet s minimum barometric pressure recorded in chetumal was at time second lowest recorded pressure on land associated with a tropical cyclone in atlantic behind 1935 labor day hurricane at least 1 023 deaths were attributed to hurricane janet as well as 65 8 million in damages meteorological history a weak tropical disturbance was first reported by air france and iberia airlines east of lesser antilles early on september 21 although it was speculated that disturbance originated from a tropical wave near cape verde weather bureau considered system too weak to be detected due to a lack of reports from islands see pp 321 323 at 1800 utc on september 21 while it was located east southeast of martinique disturbance became sufficiently organized for weather bureau to classify it as tropical storm janet tenth named storm of season upon classification janet quickly intensified as it moved to west on september 22 janet attained hurricane strength and proceeded to intensify rapidly as it moved westward across windward islands by 1200 utc that day janet already attained category 3 hurricane strength with maximum sustained winds of before stalling in intensification shortly after 1700 utc on september 22 eye of janet passed south of barbados as a category 1 hurricane a reconnaissance flight into hurricane discovered that hurricane janet s eye measured only in diameter with gale force winds extending away from center of circulation flight also reported a minimum barometric pressure of after passing between islands of grenada and carriacou in morning hours of september 23 janet entered an area of unfavorable conditions in eastern caribbean sea as a result hurricane became disorganized with winds weakening to by 1200 utc on september 23 a u s navy reconnaissance plane entered hurricane early on september 24 reporting a lack of organization and noting an indiscernible center of circulation with weak rainbands however hurricane began to reintensify in favorable conditions regaining major hurricane strength by 1200 utc on september 24 and subsequently category 4 hurricane intensity by next day thumb graph of barometer readings in chetumal alt chart showing a line which remains steady and suddenly drops near center of graph representing a drop in barometric pressure before rising again and steadying out while trekking across central caribbean sea janet was only slightly larger than while it was moving over windward islands with gale force winds extending out from center by september 25 remaining a category 4 hurricane as it moved erratically westward across caribbean a reconnaissance flight mission during night of september 25 26 indicated strong rainbands with frequent lightning strikes and a well defined eye evidence that storm was once again rapidly intensifying as it neared yucatan peninsula on september 26 janet began accelerating in forward speed after reconnaissance flight snowcloud five was lost while making a penetration into hurricane s eye another flight early on september 27 reported a minimum pressure of with winds in excess of by a large and incalculable amount hurricane was estimated to have intensified to category 5 hurricane intensity highest rating on modern day saffir simpson hurricane scale at 1200 utc on september 27 while in western caribbean sea janet continued to intensify afterwards eventually reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of with gale force winds having expanded to at least away from center of hurricane janet maintained peak intensity as it passed over swan islands before making landfall in extreme southern quintana roo mexico just east of chetumal mexico in that city a barometer indicated a minimum barometric pressure of in eye of janet at time this was second lowest pressure ever recorded on land in a landfalling atlantic hurricane behind 1935 labor day hurricane though janet was later surpassed by hurricanes dean and gilbert which also made landfall on yucatan peninsula as category 5 hurricanes once over land janet considerably weakened to a category 2 hurricane with winds of after crossing yucatan peninsula with a forward speed of hurricane emerged into bay of campeche by 1600 utc on september 28 weakened hurricane marginally intensified as it crossed bay of campeche to a secondary peak intensity of with a minimum central pressure of janet eventually made its final landfall north of city of veracruz by 2200 utc on september 29 as a category 2 hurricane after moving inland hurricane became quickly disorganized due to highly mountainous terrain of mexico and as a result weather bureau issued its last advisory on janet weakening system degenerated to tropical storm strength by september 30 and later dissipated over central mexico by 0600 utc that day janet s remnant circulation contributed to development of a disturbed area of weather off western coast of mexico that would subsequently develop into a tropical storm on october 1 preparations caribbean islands upon janet s formation east of windward islands weather bureau office in san juan puerto rico advised small craft to remain in port and vessels in path of developing storm to exercise caution after a reconnaissance flight reported much stronger winds than initially suggested hurricane warnings were issued at 1600 utc on september 22 for entirety of lesser antilles from saint lucia to grenada including barbados storm warnings were issued for all islands in windward islands from saint lucia south to tobago excluding st vincent and grenadines all warnings in windward antilles remained in effect until 1000 utc on september 22 shortly after warnings were lowered in windward islands storm warnings were issued for abc islands and peninsula of venezuela at 0200 utc on september 23 after janet passed north of islands all storm warnings were lifted on morning of september 25 weather bureau later warned interests in jamaica but did not issue any hurricane related warnings for island yucatan peninsula and mexico weather bureau first began cautioning areas of central america at 1600 utc on september 26 advising people in areas of northeast nicaragua and honduras to take precautionary measures along with all vessels and small craft in gulf of honduras south to cabo gracias a dios after janet began accelerating towards west northwest advisories warned areas in british honduras and quintana roo of hurricane related impacts though no official warnings were issued for areas of central america advisories published by weather bureau cautioned interests in hurricane s path up until landfall evacuations took place in several coastal towns in quintana roo upon notification of oncoming storm people were evacuated to inland hillside shelters after hurricane moved through yucatan peninsula and entered bay of campeche weather bureau alerted areas in storm s path on western side of mexico s gulf coast at time janet was expected to make landfall between veracruz and tuxpan areas were warned of storm s potential flooding and

comprehensive record of such statistics began in 1942 lesser antilles as a small but rapidly intensifying hurricane janet passed just south of barbados on september 22 becoming first hurricane to strike island in 57 years since 1898 windward islands hurricane maximum sustained winds on south side of island were estimated to be between strong winds knocked out communication lines preventing officials from accurately enumerating casualties on island though communications were still maintained by commercial cable companies and amateur radio electric power was later restored allowing newspapers to publish information on storm sugar cane island country s main source of revenue was severely damaged with losses estimated to be in excess of 1 million poorly constructed dwellings were blown apart by strong winds an estimated 8 100 homes were damaged by hurricane destroyed buildings and trees blocked highways and airport was forced to close heavy rains peaked at and a storm surge of swept away low lying houses along coast an estimated 2 000 people were left homeless due to hurricane property damage on barbados was estimated to be 5 million and at least 57 people were killed on september 23 janet passed directly between grenada and carriacou in grenadines killing 122 people in island chain an airport on grenada was covered in debris strewn by strong winds eight people were killed in a small town adjacent to airport strong winds were also reported to have destroyed docks and warehouses and unroofed a hotel in st george s grenada houses were also unroofed and balconies of government offices in st george s were torn off all bridges in island s interior regions collapsed and spice crops sustained heavy damage an estimated 75 of nutmeg plantations were destroyed along with nearly all of island s banana and cocoa crops three ships were also grounded in local harbor in waterfront region of st george s debris was scattered and an pier collapsed st vincent was mostly destroyed and st lucia suffered significant coastal damage over 2 8 million in damages were estimated throughout grenadines farther south in port of spain a church being used as a storm shelter collapsed killing ten people hurricane janet skirted abc islands with strong winds as it passed to north from september 24 25 in aruba gusts peaked at uprooting trees however damage outside of trees was primarily insignificant in bonaire piers were destroyed and island s coastal boulevard was damaged beach facilities at curacao s and bays suffered considerable damage quays along harbor entrance were also damaged snowcloud five on september 26 hurricane hunter p2v 3w neptune aircraft snowcloud five led by u s navy lieutenant commander grover b windham was sent from guantanamo bay to investigate janet which was at time a category 4 hurricane south of jamaica upon penetration of hurricane s eyewall at an altitude of a final transmission was received from reconnaissance flight before it presumably crashed in caribbean sea all 11 people on board including nine crew members and two journalists were killed following loss of plane an extensive search and rescue operation took place over a large area of caribbean sea with 3 000 personnel involved with search returning no results exact cause of crash remains unknown though it is speculated that plane s altimeter gave an incorrect reading due to low surrounding barometric pressure although four hurricane reconnaissance flights have been lost since operations began in 1943 snowcloud five remains only known loss of a reconnaissance aircraft as a result of a hurricane in atlantic basin with other three occurring as a result of pacific typhoons yucatan peninsula thumb right damage in corozal town alt aerial black

knocked down and damaged numerous trees across british honduras particularly in freshwater creek forest preserve there an estimated 30 of all trees had been damaged especially mahogany and trees hurricane janet also caused extensive damage to crops with an estimated 2 631 million in damages fruit trees maize and sugar cane crops suffered most damage sugar cane was expected to have a 20 decrease in yield due to damage sustained after storm pineapple crops and livestock experienced less significant losses to a lesser extent hurricane also affected belize district and several of british honduras offshore cayes similar to corozal and orange walk districts corn trees and coconut experienced most severe damage of any crop in corozal town british honduras south of where janet made landfall 500 people were made homeless and six people were killed about 90 of all buildings in town were destroyed and communications were knocked out by strong winds based on an average home cost of 2 000 it was estimated that property damage to homes in corozal town totaled 800 000 much of santa elena british honduras was also flattened by strong winds farther south in belize city winds peaked at though no damage was reported in british honduras hurricane s effects were less deadly than in quintana roo but in northern portions of colony storm killed 16 people and caused 5 million in damages mainland mexico thumb helicopter observing flood damage in tampico alt sepia toned helicopter view of a city with roads flooded by water and buildings damaged another helicopter can be seen near middle of image while in bay of campeche shrimp boat celestino arias was sunken by strong waves generated by janet after it suffered engine failures stranded ship was heavily damaged by hurricane

above average farther north along texas coast tides were above average blocking beach roads near corpus christi janet made its final landfall in mexican state of veracruz between cities of nautla and veracruz as a category 2 hurricane at 2200 utc on september 29 in nautla communications were cut by strong winds from hurricane strong winds also caused a relief plane to crash causing five deaths heavy rains in tampico tamaulipas area added to floods caused by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in year resulting flood was reported by weather bureau office in new orleans to be one of worst natural disasters in mexican history in tampico of rain was reported floods contributed to a localized typhoid fever and dysentery outbreak causing over 1 000 people to evacuate out of city to prevent further spreading of diseases an additional 36 000 people were being cared for in concentration centers although located south of where janet made landfall areas of veracruz were inundated by strong storm surge including city s main streets and port operations along a railroad stretching from laredo texas to mexico city were stopped after having just reopened due to hurricane hilda farther inland as janet dissipated over mountainous central mexico storm dropped torrential rainfall over and panuco river basins water levels in panuco river remained above flood stage for four weeks in tampico river flooded neighborhoods forcing cables to be stretched along roads to prevent people from being swept away small boats were also sent to monitor streets according to some sources 800 people died from floods with thousands more being stranded in city was inundated by an overflowing moctezuma river rains caused a landslide in colonia san rafael killing 12 people heavy rains also impacted guadalajara which had previously not been affected by any tropical cyclones earlier in year in jalisco lerma and duero rivers overflowed forcing 800 people in town to evacuate farther north in sonora cotton crops damaged by janet were estimated to amount to 12 million in damages combined property damage in mexico from hurricanes gladys hilda and janet was estimated to total 200 million nearly half

government made requests for food and construction materials extensive damaged caused by janet on island to low income households led passage of 1955 housing act which created national housing authority nha in 1956 nha was responsible for acquisition of lands on which houses could be built with stronger and more permanent materials which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane related damage newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after hurricane struck in grenada island s governor issued an emergency order against hoarding of food in aftermath of janet due to food and water shortage that resulted from janet a united states destroyer and a british frigate were sent to bring relief supplies to grenada and ships departing from jamaica and trinidad were redirected to island to help send supplies british government later announced that it would send ps50 000 us 155 000 in relief to grenadines crown agents and red cross delivered relief supplies to barbados and grenadines which included aluminum roofing sheets and portable electric generators british honduras and mexico relief and reconstruction measures were enacted in british honduras beginning on september 30 a large scale reconstruction program was initiated by government to help rebuild 48 villages government also declared a state of emergency for corozal orange walk and belize administrative districts including a ban on liquor sales temporary communication lines were rebuilt which initially only allowed official communications with affected areas due to severity of damage in corozal an airstrip was built to help deliver relief to city more efficiently food depots in corozal louisville and orange walk town were tasked with distributing food potential for widespread disease following devastation wrought by janet forced a widespread vaccination initiative against typhoid fever in affected areas jamaican government sent ps20 000 us 55 000 to colony in relief funds while british government sent ps40 000 us 110 000 to affected areas in british honduras and other affected islands in caribbean united states sent cargo ship uss antares which supplied colony with various relief materials in corozal town a 3 5 million grant was given to land surveyor h c fairweather to plan and reconstruct township a u s navy relief plane was sent to chetumal mexico to deliver food and other relief supplies after janet struck region in areas previously affected by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in year federal relief agencies were ordered to extend relief operations to yucatan peninsula however after crossing bay of campeche and making landfall near veracruz relief measures were once again implemented in western gulf coast of mexico mexican air force commercial and private planes and helicopters were sent to bring relief supplies and airlift refugees united states initiated largest relief campaign ever staged in mexico at time various government and relief agencies including american red cross and salvation army participated in relief efforts u s air force and united states army began a joint relief operation to send relief supplies to tampico area beginning with deployment of a curtiss c 46 commando from harlingen air force base on october 1 ten other military transport aircraft from u s air force were sent from texas to provide food and clothing pan american world airways sent a boeing 314 from miami florida to evacuate victims helicopters were sent from uss saipan to transfer food and medical supplies from light aircraft carrier other ships also aided in delivering supplies including uss siboney which also deployed helicopters to assist in relief efforts by october 6 1 500 people were estimated to have been rescued from tampico area and at least of food and clothing materials were estimated to have been delivered by us air force to city there typhoid serum shots were administered as a precautionary measure
