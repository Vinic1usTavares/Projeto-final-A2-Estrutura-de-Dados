radioplane rp 77 was a small target drone missile constructed largely of plastic materials produced by radioplane division of northrop corporation although rp 77d was successfully tested by united states army decision was made not to procure aircraft design and development development of rp 77 began in 1955 parsch 2004 similar in outline to radioplane s earlier oq 19 four prototypes of rp 77 were constructed two each of rp 77 powered by a four cylinder mcculloch piston engine and of rp 77a powered by a six cylinder lycoming engine results of flight testing were insufficient to interest u s army however in 1957 a proposal for an improved rp 77d powered by a boeing 502 turboprop resulted in a contract for construction of 20 aircraft design of rp 77d made extensive use of glass polyester plastic materials merrill 1956 p 108 duffin 1958 p 160 drone was launched using a rocket assisted take off system consisting of four loki rockets and was fitted with a radio control apparatus that with assistance of radar tracking allowed drone to be operated at a considerable distance from its launching point in addition to equipment typically carried by target drones rp 77d could be equipped with reconnaissance or meteorological sensors or with air sampling equipment rp 77d utilised tracking system developed by radioplane using audio frequency tones for control interavia p 359 tip tanks allowed for carriage of additional fuel to extend aircraft s range and recovery at end of flight was by parachute journal of royal aeronautical society volume lxiii january december 1959 p 165 an improved version of rp 77d was projected with provision for launching rp 76 target missiles operational history following its maiden flight in march 1958 evaluation of rp 77d by u s army took place throughout remainder of that year nearly 40 test flights being conducted although test results were generally satisfactory it was determined that performance of aircraft was an insufficient improvement over existing types in service to have aircraft ordered into production and project was cancelled along with improved rp 86 a dedicated reconnaissance variant following termination of army s evaluation radioplane as a private venture conducted an improvement program for rp 77d fitting aircraft with a larger wing along with other modifications that improved performance of drone however these improvements were insufficient to produce a renewed interest from army variants thumb right rp 77d being evaluated by u s army rp 77 prototype model powered by mcculloch piston engine two built rp 77a prototype model powered by lycoming imo 360 piston engine two 2009 rp proposed version of rp 77 with turbo supercharged mcculloch engine none built rp proposed version of rp 77a with turbo supercharged lycoming so engine none built jane s 1958 rp 77d production prototype with boeing 502 turboprop twenty built for evaluation rp 86 proposed reconnaissance version of rp 77d none built specifications rp 77d see also references notes bibliography international aeronautic federation 1961 interavia jane s information group jane fred t et al 1958 jane s all world s aircraft london s low marston company merrill arthur m 1956 plastics technology volume 2 royal aeronautical society 1959 aeronautical journal volume 63 rp 77 category 1950s united states special purpose aircraft category single engined tractor aircraft category high wing aircraft category target drones of united states category single engined turboprop aircraft category cancelled military aircraft projects of united states category aircraft first flown in 1958
