adjectives should be avoided as well as expressions like dim lands of peace which pound thought dulled image by mixing abstract with concrete he wrote that natural object was always adequate symbol poets should go in fear of abstractions and should not re tell in mediocre verse what has already been told in good prose a typical example is pound s in a station of metro 1913 inspired by an experience on paris underground about which he wrote i got out of a train at i think la concorde and in jostle i saw a beautiful face and then turning suddenly another and another and then a beautiful

to pound style critics generally agree that pound was a strong yet subtle lyricist particularly in his early work such as river merchant s wife o connor 1963 7 19 according to witmeyer a modern style is evident as early as ripostes and nadel sees evidence of modernism even before he began cantos writing that pound wanted his poetry to represent an objective presentation of material which he believed could stand on its own without use of symbolism or romanticism nadel 1999 1 6 witmeyer 1999 47 drawing on literature from a variety of disciplines pound intentionally layered often confusing juxtapositions yet led reader to an intended conclusion believing thoughtful man would apply a sense of organization and uncover underlying symbolism and structure coats 2009 87 89 ignoring victorian and edwardian grammar and structure he created a unique form of speech employing odd and strange words jargon avoiding verbs and using rhetorical devices such as parataxis stark 2001 10 12 pound s relationship to music is essential to his poetry although he was tone deaf and his speaking voice is described as raucous nasal scratchy michael writes that pound is on a short list of poets possessed of a sense of sound an ear for words imbuing his poetry with his study of troubadour poetry words written to be sung motz et son led him to think modern poetry should be written similarly ingham 1999 236 237 he wrote that rhythm is hardest quality of a man s style to counterfeit pound 1968 103 ingham compares form of cantos to a fugue without adhering strictly to traditions of form nevertheless multiple themes are explored simultaneously he goes on to write that pound s use of counterpoint is integral to structure and cohesion of cantos which show multi voiced counterpoint and with juxtaposition of images non linear themes pieces are presented in fragments which taken together can be seen to unfold in time as music does ingham 1999 244 245 imagism and vorticism thumb upright alt cover dorothy shakespear designed vorticism inspired cover art for pound s 1915 ripostes opinion varies about nature of pound s writing style nadel writes that imagism was to change pound s poetry like wyndham lewis pound reacted against decorative flourishes found in edwardian writing saying poetry required a precise and economic use of language and that poet should always use exact word stripping writing down to barest essence oliver 2011 87 according to nadel imagism evolved as a reaction against abstraction replacing victorian generalities with clarity in japanese haiku and ancient greek lyrics daniel albright writes that pound tried to condense and eliminate all but hardest kernel from a poem such as in two line poem in a station of metro however pound learned that imagism did not lend itself well to writing of an epic so he turned to more dynamic structure of vorticism for cantos albright 1999 60 translations pound s translations represent a substantial part of his work he began his career with translations of occitan ballads and ended with translations of egyptian poetry yao says body of translations by modernist poets in general much of which pound started consists of some of most significant modernist achievements in english yao 2010 34 35 pound was first english language poet since john dryden some three centuries earlier to give primacy to translations in english literature fullness of achievement for modernists is that they renewed interest in multiculturalism multilingualism and perhaps of greater importance they treated translations not in a strict sense of word but instead saw a translation as creation of an original work yao 2010 33 36 michael alexander writes that as a translator pound was a pioneer with a great gift of language and an incisive intelligence he helped popularize major poets such as guido cavalcanti and du fu and brought provencal and chinese poetry to english speaking audiences he revived interest in confucian classics and introduced west to classical japanese poetry and drama he translated and championed greek latin and anglo saxon classics and helped keep them alive at a time when poets no longer considered translations central to their craft alexander 1997 23 30 in pound s fenollosa translations unlike previous american translators of chinese poetry which tended to work with strict metrical and stanzaic patterns pound created free verse translations whether poems are valuable as translations continues to be a source of controversy hugh kenner contends that cathay should be read primarily as a work about world war i not as an attempt at accurately translating ancient eastern poems real achievement of book kenner argues is in how it combines meditations on violence and friendship with an effort to rethink nature of an english poem these ostensible translations of ancient eastern texts kenner argues are actually experiments in english poetics and compelling elegies for a warring west kenner 1971 199 pound scholar ming xie explains that pound s use of language in his translation of seafarer is deliberate in that he avoids merely trying to assimilate original into contemporary language xie 1999 204 212 cantos cantos is difficult to decipher in epic poem pound disregards literary genres mixing satire hymns elegies essays and memoirs nadel 1999 1 6 pound scholar rebecca beasley believes it amounts to a rejection of 19th century nationalistic approach in favor of early 20th century comparative literature pound reaches across cultures and time periods assembling and juxtaposing themes and history from homer to ovid and dante from thomas jefferson and john adams and many others work presents a multitude of protagonists as travellers between nations nature of cantos she says is to compare and measure among historical periods and cultures and against a standard of modernism beasley 2010 662 pound layered ideas cultures and historical periods writing in as many as 15 different languages using modern vernacular classical languages and chinese ideograms xie 1999 217 ira nadel says cantos is an epic that is a poem including history and that historical figures lend referentiality to text it functions as a contemporary memoir in which personal history and lyrical retrospection mingle most clearly represented in pisan cantos michael ingham sees in cantos an american tradition of experimental literature writing about it these works include everything but kitchen sink and then add kitchen sink ingham 1999 240 in 1960s william o connor described cantos as filled with cryptic and gnomic utterances dirty jokes obscenities of various sorts o connor 1963 7 allen tate believes poem is not about anything and is without beginning middle or end he argues that pound was incapable of sustained thought and at mercy of random flights of angelic insight an self indulgence of prejudice which is not checked by a total view to which it could be subordinated tate 1965 87 this perceived lack of logical consistency or form is a common criticism of cantos nadel 1999 8 pound himself felt this absence of form was his great failure and regretted that he could not make it cohere nicholls 1999 144 literary criticism and economic theory pound s literary criticism and essays are according to massimo bacigalupo a form of intellectual journal in early works such as spirit of romance and i gather limbs of osiris pound paid attention to medieval troubadour poets daniel and francois villon former piece was to remain one of pound s principal sourcebooks for his poetry in latter he introduces concept of luminous details bacigalupo 1999 188 191 leitmotifs in pound s literary criticism are recurrent patterns found in historical events which he believed through use of judicious juxtapositions illuminate truth and in them he reveals forgotten writers and cultures bacigalupo 1999 203 pound wrote intensively about economic theory with abc of economics and jefferson and or mussolini published in mid 1930s right after he was introduced to mussolini these were followed by guide to kulchur covering 2500 years of history which tim redman describes as most complete synthesis of pound s political and economic thought redman 1999 258 pound thought writing cantos meant writing an epic about history and economics and he wove his economic theories throughout neither can be understood without other redman 1999 255 260 in these pamphlets and in abc of reading he sought to emphasize value of art and to political written forcefully according to nadel and in a determined voice nadel 1999 10 in form his criticism and essays are direct repetitive and reductionist his rhetoric minimalist filled with strident impatience according to pound scholar jason coats and frequently failing to make a coherent claim he rejected traditional rhetoric and created his own although not very successfully in coats s view bacigalupo 1999 203 coats 2009 80 83 reception critical reception in 1922 literary critic edmund wilson reviewed pound s latest published volume of poetry poems 1918 21 and took opportunity to provide an overview of his estimation of pound as poet in his essay on pound titled ezra pound s patchwork wilson wrote ezra pound is really at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial it is true that he was driven to europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could scarcely have satisfied in america but he took to europe simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native idaho his sophistication is still juvenile his ironies are still clumsy and obvious he ridicules americans in europe not very much simpler than himself wilson edmund 2007 ezra pound s patchwork literary essays and reviews of 1920s 30s library of america 44 45 essay was first published on 19 april 1922 according to wilson lines in pound s poems stood isolated with fragmentary wording contributing to poems that do not hang together citing pound s first seven cantos wilson dubbed writing unsatisfactory he found cantos disjointed and its contents reflecting a too obvious reliance on literary works of other authors and an awkward use of latin and chinese translations as a device inserted among reminiscences of pound s own life rise of new criticism during 1950s in which author is separated from text secured pound s poetic reputation beasley 2010 651 nadel writes that publication of t s eliot s literary essays in 1954 initiated recuperation of ezra pound eliot s essays coincided with work of hugh kenner who visited pound extensively at st elizabeths nadel 1999 12 kenner wrote that there was no great contemporary writer less read than pound adding that there is also no one to appeal more through sheer beauty of language kenner 1983 16 along with donald davie kenner brought a new appreciation to pound s work in 1960s and 1970s alexander 1997 15 18 donald gallup s pound bibliography was published in 1963 and kenner s pound era in 1971 in 1970s a literary journal dedicated to pound studies was established and ronald bush published first dedicated critical study of cantos to be followed by a number of research editions of cantos following mullins biography described by nadel as partisan and melodramatic was noel stock s factual 1970 life of ezra pound although material included was subject to dorothy s approval 1980s saw three significant biographies john tytell s neutral account in 1987 followed by wilhelm s multi volume biography humphrey carpenter s sprawling narrative a complete life built on what stock began unlike stock carpenter had benefit of working without intervention from pound s relatives in 2007 david moody published first of his multi volume biography combining narrative with literary criticism first work to link two nadel 2010b 162 165 in 1980s mary de rachewiltz released first dual language edition of cantos including canto lxxii and canto lxxiii these cantos had originally been published in fascist magazines and are characterized by 21st century literary scholars as no more than war time propaganda feldman 2012 94 in 1991 a complete facsimile edition of pound s prose and poetry was published now considered a fundamental research tool according to nadel nadel 1999 13 scholarship in 1990s turned toward in depth investigations of his antisemitism and rome years tim redman writes about pound s fascism and his relationship with mussolini and leon surrette about pound s economic theories especially during italian period investigating how pound poet became pound fascist coats 2009 81 in 1999 surrette wrote about state of pound criticism that effort to uncover coherence in a crazy quilt of verse styles critical principles economic theories and distasteful political affiliations has made it difficult to perceive genesis and development of any of these components he emphasized that pound s economic and political opinions have not been properly dated nor has suddenness of his radicalization been appreciated surrette 1999 13 nadel s 2010 pound in context is a contextual literary approach to pound scholarship pound s life social political historical and literary developments of his period is fully investigated which according to nadel is grid for reading pound s poetry nadel 2010a 1 6 in 2012 matthew feldman wrote that more than 1 500 documents in pound files held by fbi have been ignored by scholars and almost certainly contain evidence that pound was politically was more involved with italian fascism and was more involved with mussolini s regime than has been posited feldman 2012 90 91 legacy pound helped advance careers of some of best known modernist writers of early 20th century in addition to eliot joyce lewis frost williams hemingway and conrad aiken he befriended and helped marianne moore louis zukofsky jacob epstein basil bunting e e cummings margaret anderson george oppen and charles olson bornstein 1999 22 23 hugh witemeyer argues that imagist movement was most important in 20th century english language poetry because it affected all leading poets of pound s generation and two generations after him witemeyer 1999 48 in 1917 carl sandburg wrote in poetry all talk on modern poetry by people who know ends with dragging in ezra pound somewhere he may be named only to be cursed as wanton and poseur trifler and vagrant or he may be classed as filling a niche today like that of keats in a preceding epoch point is he will be mentioned eliot 1917 3 outrage after pound s wartime collaboration with mussolini s regime was so deep that imagined method of his execution dominated discussion arthur miller considered him worse than hitler in his wildest moments of human vilification hitler never approached our ezra he knew all america s weaknesses and he played them as expertly as goebbels ever did response went so far as to denounce all modernists as fascists and it was only in 1980s that critics began a re evaluation macha rosenthal wrote that it was as if all beautiful vitality and all brilliant rottenness of our heritage in its luxuriant variety were both at once made manifest in ezra pound for arthur miller s quote see torrey 1984 200 for rosenthal see her a primer of ezra pound macmillan 1960 2 pound s antisemitism has soured evaluation of his poetry pound scholar wendy stallard flory writes that separating poetry from antisemitism is perceived as apologetic she believes positioning of pound as national monster and designated fascist intellectual made him a stand in for silent majority in germany occupied france and belgium as well as britain and united states who she argues made holocaust possible by aiding or standing by flory 1999 285 286 294 300 later in his life pound analyzed what he judged to be his own failings as a writer attributable to his adherence to ideological fallacies allen ginsberg states that in a private conversation in 1967 pound told young poet my poems don t make sense he went on to say that he was not a lunatic but a moron and to characterize his writing as stupid and ignorant a mess ginsberg reassured pound that he had shown us way but pound refused to be mollified any good i ve done has been spoiled by bad intentions preoccupation with irrelevant and stupid things he replied then very slowly with emphasis surely conscious of ginsberg s being jewish but worst mistake i made was that stupid suburban prejudice of anti semitism carpenter 1988 898 899 works 1908 a lume spento privately printed by a antonini
