ombla is a short river in croatia northeast of dubrovnik its course is approximately long and it empties into rijeka dubrovacka embayment of adriatic sea near komolac in dubrovnik neretva county rijeka dubrovacka is actually a ria a flooded river valley formed through changes in sea surface elevation on a geologic time scale river rises as a karst spring fed by groundwater replenished by trebisnjica which is an stream flowing in popovo polje in immediate hinterland of ombla elevation difference between river s source and its mouth is just over average discharge of river is per second drainage basin of ombla encompasses and besides short surface course includes only groundwater flow ombla is used as a source of drinking water for dubrovnik s water supply network and construction of a hydroelectric power plant has been planned for past two decades plans entail construction of a subsurface reservoir and a 68 megawatt power plant plan sparked controversy amid doubts raised with respect to environmental protection and biodiversity management technical and financial feasibility and procedural problems related to project a particular concern expressed was that underground reservoir might trigger earthquakes source and course course of ombla river is located in dubrovnik neretva county northeast of city of dubrovnik in southernmost part of mainland of croatia area surrounding river bears eponymous name of rijeka dubrovacka lit dubrovnik s river and encompasses several villages clustered near ombla that are home to 12 000 people name is also applied to an estuary of ombla a ria enclosed by steep slopes of high hills forming a long wide and deep embayment of adriatic sea ombla rises at foot of golubov kamen massif a landform that straddles border between croatia and bosnia herzegovina river rises in a cave whose roof has an clearance above surface of water primary source is located at an elevation of below sea level and secondary sources are found at above sea level a s l spring is largest karst spring in croatia and one of largest ones in dinarides surface of water in cave is a s l watercourse flows for approximately before reaching a weir across which ombla discharges into adriatic sea leading to claims that ombla is shortest river in world drainage basin drainage basin of ombla is estimated to cover an area of at least and up to between adriatic sea coast in area of dubrovnik and popovo polje other than short surface course of river drainage basin includes groundwater only exact boundaries of drainage basin vary depending on prevailing hydrological conditions determining groundwater seepage and flow area comprises 176 settlements and 50 000 inhabitants area exhibits karst morphology with bedrock largely consisting of limestones and comparatively small areas of dolomites and quaternary sediments eocene forms southwest boundary of catchment area towards which catchment basin drains and where ombla rises rocks were formed as a thick series of carbonate sediments were deposited between norian and late cretaceous as adriatic carbonate platform up to deep in eocene and early oligocene adriatic plate moved north and north east contributing to alpine orogeny via tectonic uplift of dinarides basin s karst topography developed from carbonate platform s exposure to weathering largely began after dinarides final uplift in oligocene and miocene when carbonates were exposed to atmospheric effects this extended to level of below present sea level exposed during last glacial maximum some karst formations were created during earlier sea level drops most notably messinian salinity crisis geological structure of area indicates recent tectonic activity in catchment with a fault running between hum and ombla a recent strong earthquake in wider region was 1979 montenegro earthquake measuring 7 0 on richter scale only strong historical earthquake in immediate area was 1667 dubrovnik earthquake which was followed by a tsunami hydrological regime of basin and popovo polje is determined by flow of trebisnjica a losing stream disappearing underground in polje groundwater is distributed to a number of springs some of them are headwaters of watercourses discharging into neretva river to northwest of polje or appearing as submarine springs or as headwaters of ombla river flow rate of ombla river measured at komolac water intake plant ranges from per second averaging per second average has dropped by about per second since completion of trebisnjica hydroelectric power plant and concreting of trebisnjica s river bed on other hand minimum discharge was not affected by river engineering works catchment basin area straddles boundary of two climate zones mediterranean climate zone in areas at elevations up to a s l and continental climate zone in other parts of basin average annual precipitation varies depending on climate zones in dubrovnik at coast and in hum in popovo polje economy thumb rijeka dubrovacka a ria formed by ombla ombla is used as a source of drinking water for city of dubrovnik water intake plant at komolac has a water supply capacity of per second ombla has been used as a part of dubrovnik s water supply network since 1897 when first contract to supply of water per day was made with an owner of watermills operating on river river water becomes opaque containing increased proportion of suspended particulate matter three to five times a year for periods of four to five days after increased rainfall situation is proposed to be addressed through moving of intake plant to a higher elevation during construction of a proposed ombla hydroelectric power plant hpp new water intake is planned to be constructed at a s l these changes are expected to improve quality of drinking water and to increase water supply capacity to per second average volume of water diverted to water supply network varies considerably by month peaking during summer tourist seasons in august 2008 daily volume of water taken from ombla for water supply network averaged at in 2008 annual daily volume of water diverted averaged proposed power plant ombla hpp is proposed to be built as an underground power plant utilizing headwaters of ombla river through a planned underground reservoir which would hold water behind a grout curtain and a concrete block extending from below sea level to a s l project entails flooding of a cavern system at spring to a level below entrance to long vilina cave proposed power plant is planned to have productive capacity of 68 megawatts project is to be financed in part through a european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd loan in amount of 123 2 million euros approved on 22 november 2011 total project cost is estimated at 152 4 million euros pursuant to european union habitats directive an additional assessment and a biodiversity management plan are required before ebrd actually provides approved funds documents should define any mitigating or compensating activities that might be needed thumb ombla rises at foot of golubov kamen massif additional springs formed uphill after heavy rains development project became controversial as environmental protection non governmental organizations ngos drew public attention to a possible threat that may arise to seven species of bats subsequently ngos alleged that project is illegal environmentally unsafe financially not feasible and technically questionable project legality was disputed because it is based on a 1999 environmental impact assessment eia while croatian legislation requires that must not be more than two years old flooding of vilina cave is cited as an environmental concern while financial issues are based on previous cost overruns by hrvatska state owned company planning development in other projects one objection to technical aspects of project is possibility that groundwater may trigger earthquakes opponents of project have urged prime minister of croatia to cancel development of plant after elections of 2011 mirela holy who had declared her opposition to project prior to elections was appointed minister of environment and nature protection in 2012 ministry commissioned four reviews of eia reviews one of them supporting eia and three disproving conclusions of original eia were submitted to government of croatia one day after holy resigned her post reportedly over an unrelated matter on 7 june 2012 objections were raised by authors of eia that reviews were not published and names of authors have been kept secret prime minister zoran milanovic said he wanted to collect opinions from foremost croatian european and worldwide experts before deciding on matter which has been under consideration since early 1990s in may 2013 european bank for reconstruction and development cancelled its proposed loan to project pointing at environmental concerns victory for civil society as ebrd cancels loan for controversial croatian dam blog may 28 2013 etymology in classical antiquity ombla was a part of river arion rising and sinking in present day region of herzegovina before resurfacing at coast this is earliest known name of river reported in periplus of pseudo scylax most likely etymology of river s name is that it is derived from latin being named after vineyards or since river was once in zachlumia alternatively it is proposed that name of river descended from slavic word or meaning a pit containing water possibly a water well since 16th century river was called ombla or or a variety of similar names which all translate as river rika and rijeka in 19th century use of name orion was also reported apparently based on arion of classical period word ombla means sweet water from albanian language
