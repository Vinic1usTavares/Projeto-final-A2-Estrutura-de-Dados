called fratellis artless but amiable predictable and intermittently rewarding elizabeth goodman of rolling stone called single flathead preternaturally catchy and stated that it makes you elated in moment helen phares of allmusic called it high energy and fun in moment stylus magazine s ryan foley shared similar views describing it as beyond infectious and claiming that they fill their three minute pop punk ditties with melodic snarl flouncing sass and enough lusty sing along parts to keep punters busy ign s chad grischow gave album an outstanding rating in his review of album saying it was not most refined album you will buy this year but surely one you will not regret sal cinquemani of slant magazine was less favourable calling it tediously misogynistic and instantly memorable but
