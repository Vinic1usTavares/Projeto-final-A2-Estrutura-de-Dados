their scores it focuses on style and emotion from player character s terminal speed rather than on jumps and tricks it also has a hard rock guitar soundtrack development solipskier was designed for adobe flash platform michael boxleiter and greg wohlwend had worked on flash games earlier as intuition games idea for game came from a brainstorming session about parallax scrolling and was revised in fits of creativity they paired parallax scrolling with speed and eventually boxleiter blurted out with wide eyes that player could paint terrain to determine speed of character they chose a snow or snowmobile theme and began to prototype that same night boxleiter used skills he had acquired from previous games from dinowaurs and bitmap drawing from eon to make a mockup within hours a red ball that moved along with a slope made with mouse and floated down slowly when suspended in air he added three gates to create a slalom skiing course and a sense of distance and speed which was not apparent otherwise boxleiter then set up indicators to show incoming gates though he thought it was odd to have indicators move to right as gate moved to towards player to left there was no parallax scrolling implemented in this phase meanwhile wohlwend mocked up a 2d course in grayscale with humps of mountains he originally designed visuals such that there would be nothing on screen where player had not painted which was later cut after seeing boxleiter s draft he used crisp colors to make distinct gate markers and made foreground highly contrast with background their early drafts had a nighttime theme and included an aurora that was later cut due to difficulty of implementation in flash wohlwend left character design for last as his weak point boxleiter was particularly inspired by idea of a skier replacing snowmobile and set up parallax scrolling and motion blur which made skier appear to go faster he also added tunnel idea as a series of gates they animated skier who they gave an ego tastic large head on a stick figure body and decided to not use tutorials opting for a game that began with player s first click wohlwend s rainbow trail effect was added as a scarf or cape which later became a rainbow burst behind player and scoring mechanics were refined to reward players who took risks by letting skier fly through air without touching screen this was partly inspired by tony hawk s pro skater series title refers to a combination of solipsism and skiing game was their first to receive public appreciation boxleiter first understood its potential when publishers fought for bid to game at time it was solely designed for flash and not ios though they were interested in making bigger games outside flash market they announced game in mid august 2010 where they revealed that game would release on flash through kongregate and ios simultaneously which happened on august 29 2010 joe bergeron a programmer who had previously worked on dinowaurs with mikengreg helped with ios version of game solipskier made around 70 000 in its first two months as compared to 15 000 from flash release which let them work in other non flash mediums in future they released an android version three months later reception game received generally favorable reviews according to video game review score aggregator metacritic it was a runner up in 2011 game developers conference independent games festival s best mobile game category ign levi buchanan praised art direction especially rainbow scarf against gray monotone background chris hall of 148apps called it most original since hall praised touch of having headphones fall off with contrast between hard rock guitar and rushing natural wind but criticized complex scoring system edge chris donlan on other hand appreciated trade offs between different opportunities to score higher hall of 148apps added that solipskier did not look as great on a retina display tim rattray of slide to play called graphics pure eye candy he felt that game was unique but a one trick pony combination of fast canabalt and platform drawing line racer likewise indiegames com felt solipskier novelty was ephemeral pocket gamer mark brown called its difficulty steeper than alps pocket gamer listed game as one of toughest and best indie games in 2011 one of best endless runners in 2012 and a hidden gem in 2013 notes and references notes
