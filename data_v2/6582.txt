foramen spinosum is one of two foramina located in base of human skull on sphenoid bone it is situated just anterior to spine of sphenoid bone and just lateral to foramen ovale middle meningeal artery middle meningeal vein and meningeal branch of mandibular nerve pass through foramen foramen spinosum is often used as a landmark in neurosurgery due to its close relations with other cranial foramina it was first described by jakob benignus winslow in 18th century structure foramen spinosum is a foramen through sphenoid bone situated in middle cranial fossa it is one of two foramina in greater wing of sphenoid bone foramen ovale is one of these two cranial foramina situated directly anterior and medial to foramen spinosum spine of sphenoid falls medial and posterior to foramen lateral to foramen is mandibular fossa and posterior is eustachian tube variation foramen spinosum varies in size and location foramen is rarely absent usually unilaterally in which case middle meningeal artery enters cranial cavity through foramen ovale it may be incomplete which may occur in almost half of population conversely in a minority of cases less than 1 it may also be duplicated particularly when middle meningeal artery is also duplicated foramen may pass through sphenoid bone at apex of spinous process or along its medial surface development in newborn foramen spinosum is about 2 25 mm long and in adults about 2 56 mm width of foramen extends from 1 05 mm to about 2 1 mm in adults average diameter of foramen spinosum is 2 63 mm in adults earliest perfect ring shaped formation of foramen spinosum was observed in eighth month after birth and latest seven years after birth in a developmental study of foramen rotundum foramen ovale and foramen spinosum majority of foramina in skull studies were round in shape ligament derived from first pharyngeal arch and usually attached to spine of sphenoid bone may be found attached to rim of foramen animals in other great apes foramen spinosum is found not in sphenoid bone but in parts of temporal bone such as squamous part found at suture or absent function foramen spinosum permits passage of middle meningeal artery middle meningeal vein and meningeal branch of mandibular nerve clinical significance due to its distinctive position foramen is used as an anatomical landmark during neurosurgery as a landmark foramen spinosum reveals positions of other cranial foramina mandibular nerve and trigeminal ganglion foramen ovale and foramen rotundum it may also be relevant in achieving during trauma surgery history foramen spinosum was first described by danish anatomist jakob benignus winslow in 18th century it is so named because of its relationship to spinous process of greater wing of sphenoid bone however due to incorrectly declining noun literal meaning is hole full of thorns correct but unused name would in fact be additional images see also foramina of skull references external links osteology of skull internal surface of skull schematic view of key landmarks of infratemporal fossa anatomy of skull 27 foramen spinosum category foramina of skull
