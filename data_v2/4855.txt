diplodocus or is a genus of diplodocid sauropod dinosaurs whose fossils were first discovered in 1877 by s w williston generic name coined by othniel charles marsh in 1878 is a neo latin term derived from greek diplos diplos double and dokos dokos beam in reference to double beamed chevron bones located in underside of tail which were then considered unique it is now common scientific opinion that seismosaurus hallorum is a species of diplodocus this genus of dinosaurs lived in what is now mid western north america at end of jurassic period diplodocus is one of more common dinosaur fossils found in middle to upper morrison formation between about 154 and 152 million years ago during late kimmeridgian age morrison formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs such as apatosaurus barosaurus brachiosaurus brontosaurus and camarasaurus its great size may have been a deterrent to predators allosaurus and ceratosaurus their remains have been found in same strata which suggests that they coexisted with diplodocus diplodocus is among most easily identifiable dinosaurs with its typical sauropod shape long neck and tail and four sturdy legs for many

of about 80 caudal vertebrae which are almost double number some of earlier sauropods had in their tails such as shunosaurus with 43 and far more than contemporaneous macronarians had such as camarasaurus with 53 some speculation exists as to whether it may have had a defensive or noisemaking by cracking it like a coachwhip function tail may have served as a counterbalance for neck middle part of tail had double beams oddly shaped chevron bones on underside which gave diplodocus its name they may have provided support for vertebrae or perhaps prevented blood vessels from being crushed if animal s heavy tail pressed against ground these double beams are also seen in some related dinosaurs chevron bones of this particular form were initially believed to be unique to diplodocus since then they have been discovered in other members of diplodocid family as well as in non diplodocid sauropods such as mamenchisaurus thumb restoration of d carnegii with horizontal neck flexible whip tail keratinous spines and nostrils low on snout like other sauropods manus front feet of diplodocus were highly modified with finger and hand bones arranged into a vertical column horseshoe shaped in cross section diplodocus lacked claws on all but one digit of front limb and this claw was unusually large relative to other sauropods flattened from side to side and detached from bones of hand function of this unusually specialized claw is unknown no skull has ever been found that can be confidently said to belong to diplodocus though skulls of other diplodocids closely related to diplodocus such as galeamopus are well known skulls of diplodocids were very small compared with size of these animals diplodocus had small peg like teeth that pointed forward and were only present in anterior sections of jaws its braincase was small neck was composed of at least 15 vertebrae and may have been held parallel to ground and unable to be elevated much past horizontal discovery of

of diplodocus were described between 1878 and 1924 first skeleton was found at canon city colorado by benjamin mudge and samuel wendell williston in 1877 and was named diplodocus longus long double beam by paleontologist othniel charles marsh in 1878 although not type species d carnegii is most completely known and most famous species due to large number of casts of its skeleton in museums around world diplodocus remains have since been found in morrison formation of western u s states of colorado utah montana and wyoming fossils of this animal are common except for skull which has never been found with otherwise complete skeletons d known from a partial skeleton and skull discovered by william h utterback in 1902 near sheridan wyoming was described in 1924 holland wj skull of diplodocus memoirs of carnegie museum ix 379 403 1924 in 2015 it was renamed as separate genus galeamopus and several other diplodocus specimens were referred to that genus leaving no definite diplodocus skulls known two morrison formation sauropod genera diplodocus and barosaurus had very similar limb bones in past many isolated limb bones were automatically attributed to diplodocus but

meeting november 7 10 2004 retrieved on may 24 2007 this was followed by a much more detailed publication in 2006 which not only renamed species diplodocus hallorum but also speculated that it could prove to be same as d longus position that d hallorum should be regarded as a specimen of d longus was also taken by authors of a redescription of supersaurus refuting a previous hypothesis that seismosaurus and supersaurus were same a 2015 analysis of diplodocid relationships noted that these opinions are based on more complete referred specimens of d longus authors of this analysis concluded that those specimens were indeed same species as d hallorum but that d longus itself was a nomen dubium nomina dubia doubtful species thumb usnm a skull formerly thought to have belonged to holotype of d longus d longus type species is known from two complete and several fragmentary caudal vertebrae from morrison formation felch quarry of colorado though several more complete specimens have been attributed to d longus detailed analysis has suggested that original fossil lacks necessary features to allow comparison with other specimens for this reason it has been considered a nomen dubium which is not an ideal situation for type species of a well known genus like diplodocus a petition to international commission on zoological nomenclature was being considered which proposed to make d carnegii new type species this proposal was rejected by iczn and d longus has been maintained as type species d of lake is a nomen dubium named by marsh in 1884 based on specimen ypm 1922 found by arthur lakes consisting of snout and upper jaw of a smaller animal from morrison colorado these remains are now believed to have been from an immature animal rather than from a separate species in 2015 it was concluded that specimen actually belonged to camarasaurus classification diplodocus is both type genus of and gives its name to diplodocidae family to which it belongs members of this family while still massive are of a markedly more slender build than other sauropods such as titanosaurs and all are characterised by long necks and tails and a horizontal posture with fore limbs shorter than hind limbs diplodocids flourished in late jurassic of north america and possibly africa a subfamily diplodocinae was erected to include diplodocus and its closest relatives including barosaurus more distantly related is contemporaneous apatosaurus which is still considered a diplodocid although not a diplodocine as it is a member of sister subfamily apatosaurinae portuguese and african tornieria have also been identified as close relatives of diplodocus by some authors diplodocoidea comprise diplodocids as well as dicraeosaurids suuwassea amphicoelias and possibly and or

intervals marsh and then jb diplodocus marsh its osteology taxonomy and probable habits with a restoration of skeleton memoirs of carnegie museum vol 1 1901 pp 1 63 assumed that animal was aquatic because of position of its nasal openings at apex of cranium similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods such as brachiosaurus and apatosaurus a 1951 study by kenneth a indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils when rest of body was submerged as water pressure on chest wall would be too great since 1970s general consensus has sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals browsing on trees ferns and bushes j r 1999 diplodocus carnegii carnegie magazine scientists have debated as to how sauropods were able to breathe with their large body sizes and long necks which would have increased amount of dead space they likely had an avian respiratory system which is more efficient than a mammalian and reptilian system reconstructions of neck and thorax of diplodocus show great pneumaticity which could have played a role in respiration as it does in birds posture thumb right an outmoded depiction by oliver p hay 1910 with sprawled o p 1910 proceedings of washington academy of sciences vol 12 pp 1 25 depiction of diplodocus posture has changed considerably over years for instance a classic 1910 reconstruction by oliver p hay depicts two diplodocus with splayed lizard like limbs on banks of a river hay argued that diplodocus had a sprawling lizard like gait with widely splayed legs hay dr oliver p on habits and pose of sauropod dinosaurs especially of diplodocus american naturalist vol xlii oct 1908 and was supported by gustav tornier this hypothesis was contested by william jacob holland who demonstrated that a sprawling diplodocus would have needed a trench through which to pull its belly finds of sauropod footprints in 1930s eventually put hay s theory to rest thumb left upright neck pose for d carnegii based on taylor et al 2009 later diplodocids were often portrayed with their necks held high up in air allowing them to graze from tall trees studies looking at morphology of sauropod necks have concluded that neutral posture of diplodocus neck was close to horizontal rather than vertical and scientists such as kent stevens have used this to argue that sauropods including diplodocus did not raise their heads much above shoulder level a nuchal ligament may have held neck in this position a 2009 study found that all tetrapods appear to hold base of their necks at maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal alert posture and argued that same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown unique characteristics that set soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals study found faults with stevens assumptions regarding potential range of motion in sauropod necks and based on comparing skeletons to living animals study also argued that soft tissues could have increased flexibility more than bones alone suggest for these reasons they argued that diplodocus would have held its neck at a more elevated angle than previous studies have concluded as with related genus barosaurus very long neck of diplodocus is source of much controversy among scientists a 1992 columbia university study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that longest necks would have required a 1 6 ton heart a tenth of animal s body weight study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary hearts in their necks whose only purpose was to pump blood up to next heart some argue that near horizontal posture of head and neck would have eliminated problem of supplying blood to brain as it would not be elevated diet and feeding thumb cast of a diplodocid skull that may belong to a species of diplodocus cm diplodocines have highly unusual teeth compared to other sauropods crowns are long and slender and elliptical in cross section while apex forms a blunt triangular point most prominent wear facet is on apex though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods diplodocine wear patterns are on labial cheek side of both upper and lower teeth this implies that feeding mechanism of diplodocus and other diplodocids was radically different from that of other sauropods unilateral branch stripping is most likely feeding behavior of diplodocus norman d b 1985 illustrated encyclopedia of dinosaurs london salamander books ltd as it explains unusual wear patterns of teeth coming from tooth food contact in unilateral branch stripping one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from stem while other would act as a guide and stabilizer with elongated preorbital in front of eyes region of skull longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action also palinal backwards motion of lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behavior 1 an increased gape and 2 allowed fine adjustments of relative positions of tooth rows creating a smooth stripping action young et al 2012 used biomechanical modelling to examine performance of diplodocine skull it was concluded that proposal that its dentition was used for bark stripping was not supported by data which showed that under that scenario skull and teeth would undergo extreme stresses hypotheses of branch stripping and or precision biting were both shown to be plausible feeding behaviors diplodocine teeth were also continually replaced throughout their lives usually in less than 35 days as was discovered by michael d et al within each tooth socket as many as five replacement teeth were developing to replace next one studies of teeth also reveal that it preferred different vegetation from other sauropods of morrison such as camarasaurus this may have better allowed various species of sauropods to exist without competition thumb left diplodocus green and various sauropods in a tripodal posture white dots showing approximate center of mass as estimated in studies flexibility of diplodocus neck is debated but it should have been able to browse from low levels to about 4 m 13 ft when on all fours however studies have shown that center of mass of diplodocus was very close to hip socket this means that diplodocus could rear up into a bipedal posture with relatively little effort it also had advantage of using its large tail as a prop which would allow for a very stable tripodal posture in a tripodal posture diplodocus could potentially increase its feeding height up to about neck s range of movement would have also allowed head to graze below level of body leading some scientists to speculate on whether diplodocus grazed on submerged water plants from riverbanks this concept of feeding posture is supported by relative lengths of front and hind limbs furthermore its peg like teeth may have been used for eating soft water plants matthew cobley et al 2013 dispute this finding that large muscles and cartilage would have limited neck movements they state that feeding ranges for sauropods like diplodocus were smaller than previously believed and animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation as such they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs conclusions of cobley et al were disputed in 2013 and 2014 by mike taylor who analysed amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine flexibility of neck of diplodocus and apatosaurus taylor found that neck of diplodocus was very flexible and that cobley et al were incorrect in that flexibility as implied by bones is less than in reality in 2010 whitlock et al described a juvenile skull at time referred to diplodocus cm that differed greatly from adult skulls of same genus its snout was not blunt and teeth were not confined to front of snout these differences suggest that adults and juveniles were feeding differently such an ecological difference between adults and juveniles had not been previously observed in sauropodomorphs reproduction and growth thumb restoration of a narrow snouted juvenile based on specimen cmc feeding alongside broad snouted adults while long neck has traditionally been interpreted as a feeding adaptation it was also suggested that oversized neck of diplodocus and its relatives may have been primarily a sexual display with any other feeding benefits coming second a 2011 study refuted this idea in detail while no evidence indicates diplodocus nesting habits other sauropods such as titanosaurian have been associated with nesting sites walking on eggs astonishing discovery of thousands of dinosaur eggs in badlands of patagonia by luis and lowell dingus june 19 2001 scribner titanosaurian nesting sites indicate that they may have laid their eggs communally over a large area in many shallow pits each covered with vegetation diplodocus may have done same documentary walking with dinosaurs portrayed a mother diplodocus using an ovipositor to lay eggs but it was pure speculation on part of documentary author for diplodocus and other sauropods size of clutches and individual eggs were surprisingly small for such large animals this appears to have been an adaptation to predation pressures as large eggs would require greater incubation time and thus would be at greater risk based on a number of bone histology studies diplodocus along with other sauropods grew at a very fast rate reaching sexual maturity at just over a decade and continued to grow throughout their lives paleoecology thumb left restoration of two d hallorum morrison formation is a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which according to radiometric dating ranges between 156 3 million years old ma at its base and 146 8 million years old at top which places it in late oxfordian kimmeridgian and early tithonian stages of late jurassic period this formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons morrison basin where dinosaurs lived stretched from new mexico to alberta and saskatchewan and was formed when precursors to front range of rocky mountains started pushing up to west deposits from their east facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands
