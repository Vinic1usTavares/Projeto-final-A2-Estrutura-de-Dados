secular justice was administered for twelve hides name may have been first used by john collinson in his history and antiquities of county of somerset in 1791 however when investigated by richard warner in 1826 he could not identify where name had originated it was also thought to be site of trials by judge jeffreys for bloody assizes after monmouth rebellion current building was constructed in 15th century on site of a wooden building dating from 12th century in 16th century a new facade was added to original building it is possible that stonework and window of front wall were removed from abbot s lodgings behind great kitchen of abbey as similar features can be identified in a 1712 engraving and it is known that building was ruined and without its front wall by 1723 door is original and above it are a tudor rose and arms of richard beere who was abbot of glastonbury from 1493 to 1524 it is possible that building was used as a hospice in time of richard beere as abbot as a document of 1716 describes beere s hospital although it is uncertain whether this is same building clearer documentary evidence shows that it was used as a commercial school for young gentlemen in
