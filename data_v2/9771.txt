pink necked green pigeon treron vernans is a species of bird of pigeon and dove family columbidae it is a common species of southeast asia found from myanmar and vietnam south through to major islands of indonesia and philippines it is a medium sized pigeon with predominantly green plumage only male has pink neck that gives species its name species lives in a wide range of forested and human modified habitats and is particularly found in open habitats its diet is dominated by fruit in particular figs pairs lay two eggs in a flimsy twig nest in a tree shrub or hedge and work together to incubate eggs and raise chicks species is thought to be an important disperser of fruit seeds species has adapted well to human changes to environment and can be found in crowded cities as long as fruiting trees are present it is not considered to be at risk of extinction taxonomy carl linnaeus described pink necked green pigeon as columba vernans in 1771 its specific name vernans is derived from latin word for brilliant or flourishing it was later moved to green pigeon genus treron within that genus species is most closely related to similar looking orange breasted green pigeon of india and southeast asia species has had up to nine subspecies described along with nominate race but among important ornithological checklists international ornithological congress ioc birds of world recommended english names howard and moore complete checklist of birds of world and clements checklist of birds of world do not accept any described subspecies as valid and all treat species as monotypic only handbook of birds of worlds alive lists any subspecies with proviso that difference between them is in many cases clinal and further research is necessary to determine if any of them are valid pink necked green pigeon has been designated as official common name for species by ioc it is also known as pink necked pigeon description pink necked green pigeon is a medium sized pigeon measuring in length and weighing around species has sexually dimorphic plumage male has a grey head pinkish neck and upper breast and rest of breast is orange back is olive green and wings are green with black and yellow edging on which create a yellow bar across wing in flight belly is yellowish with grey flanks and tail is grey with a black band at end and a chestnut female is smaller overall has a yellowish belly throat and face and greenish crown and back of neck although is otherwise similar to male legs are pink or reddish and bill is white pale blue green or grey juvenile birds look similar to females but are greyer above pigeons in genus treron are unusual in family for not having cooing calls instead making whistling and quacking noises but some cooing notes have been recorded for pink necked green pigeon as male makes a tri whistling call ending in a coo it is also reported to make a rasping krrak krrak call but species is generally held to not be particularly vocal usually only calling in communal roosts and when it finds food distribution and habitat range of pink necked green pigeon extends from southern myanmar thailand cambodia and vietnam south through malay peninsula and across greater and their surrounding islands bali lombok and as far east as moluccas as well as philippines it occupies a variety of habitats including primary forest forest edge secondary forest and coastal mangroves it favours more open environments and where it is found in association with denser forest it is typically on edges it is also readily found in human dominated environments such as gardens plantations and farmland it is more common in lowlands and close to coast but can be found up to in philippines in borneo and in sulawesi species is recorded as non migratory by handbook of birds of world but other sources have described it as making local movements a related species thick billed green pigeon covers vast distances in search of fruit and it is likely that pink necked green pigeon has a similar behaviour after main island of krakatoa was obliterated in a volcanic eruption in 1883 leaving a handful of smaller islands pink necked pigeon was observed on first bird survey of these remnants survey was conducted in 1908 and at time pigeon was only obligate frugivore meaning it ate mostly fruit as opposed to as part of a wider diet or opportunistically that had established itself on islands within archipelago it was able to colonise anak krakatau a volcano that emerged from sea from caldera in 1927 within 36 years of new island suffering a large eruption in 1952 delay between island settling down and colonisation was likely due to time taken for figs to become established on island and begin fruiting it later became extinct on that island due to a small population and predation species has recently expanded its range having colonised flores at some time since 2000 behaviour thumb recently fledged chicks pink necked green pigeon is primarily a frugivore taking a range of fruits particularly figs ficus fruit of other trees are taken as well including and shoots buds and seeds are also taken but much less commonly so often by quite a substantial margin in one study of frugivores of sulawesi 55 observations were made of this species feeding and every one was of it eating fruit mostly figs species feeds in mid canopy of forest and rarely feeds in understory or on ground it is described as being agile when clinging on fine branches to reach fruits at end like other members of genus treron gizzard is muscular and contains grit which is used to grind and digest seeds inside fruit studies of closely related species have found that not every individual has grit and it is likely same is true of this species it is social feeding in small groups or where an abundant source of food is found quite large flocks of up to 70 birds species also roosts communally and can form roosting flocks of hundreds of birds there is no defined breeding season and it has been recorded breeding all year across its range except in february task of building nest is divided by sex with male being responsible for collecting nesting material and female building it nest itself is a simple and flimsy platform of twigs and finer material two eggs are laid which are white and measure nest is placed in a tree shrub or hedge and can be quite close to ground ranging from breeding biology of this species is virtually unknown with only a single breeding report from singapore in that report pair shared incubation duties with male incubating during day and female at night with incubation time being 17 days on hatching chicks are brooded continuously for first few days of life as with incubation male broods during day and female at night chicks are near naked and have brown skin with a few white pin feathers on hatching chicks leave nest 10 days after hatching but remain in nesting area for a few days after hatching and continue to be fed by their parents ecology thumb male on rakata in krakatoa like many fruit eating pigeons pink necked green pigeon is thought to be an important disperser of fruit seeds in forests and woodlands grinding gizzard was thought to mean species was entirely a seed predator instead of a seed disperser but studies of closely related species have shown that not every bird crop contains grinding stones and some seeds could pass through and same is likely to be true of this species species is thought to be one of those responsible for helping return of many of ficus species to islands of krakatoa after obliteration of original island in a volcanic eruption it may not have been responsible for first shrubby fig species which may have been carried by generalists such as bulbuls but once some fruiting figs had established on island it could have been responsible for both bringing new species of ficus to islands and then moving seeds between islands its flight time to islands of krakatoa has been estimated at 48 minutes far shorter than estimated seed retention time in its gut of 60 to 480 minutes pink necked pigeon has been reported being preyed upon by white bellied sea eagles and peregrine falcons have been implicated in localised extinction of species on anak krakatau status an adaptable species t vernans has fared well with human made changes to its range it has readily moved into cities and is common in singapore s protected areas and even its gardens and has become more common over time in spite of suffering some hunting pressure in thailand malaysia and sumatra and being targeted by cage bird trade it remains common there and across most of its range because it is not considered to be in any danger of extinction it has been evaluated as least concern by iucn red list of threatened species references external links pink necked green pigeon category birds of southeast asia pink necked green pigeon category taxonomy articles created by
