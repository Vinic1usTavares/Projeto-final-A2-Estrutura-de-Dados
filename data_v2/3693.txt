other name fifteen year old paul mccartney joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and lennon met that july in february 1958 mccartney invited his friend george harrison to watch band fifteen year old auditioned for lennon impressing him with his playing but lennon initially thought harrison was too young for band after a month of harrison s persistence during a second meeting arranged by mccartney he performed lead guitar part of instrumental song raunchy on upper deck of a liverpool bus and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist by january 1959 lennon s quarry bank friends had left group and he began his studies at liverpool college of art three guitarists billing themselves at least three times as johnny and moondogs were playing rock and roll whenever they

his german fiancee astrid kirchherr who took first semi professional photos of beatles during next two years beatles were resident for periods in hamburg where they used preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all night performances in 1961 during their second hamburg engagement kirchherr cut sutcliffe s hair in existentialist style later adopted by other beatles when sutcliffe decided to leave band early that year and resume his art studies in germany mccartney took up bass producer bert kaempfert contracted what was now a four piece group until june 1962 and he

cavern club they encountered brian epstein a local record store owner and music columnist he later recalled i immediately liked what i heard they were fresh and they were honest and they had what i thought was a sort of presence a star quality epstein courted band over next couple of months and they appointed him as their manager in january 1962 throughout early and mid 1962 epstein sought to free beatles from their contractual obligations to bert kaempfert productions he eventually negotiated a one month early release from their contract in exchange for one last recording session in hamburg tragedy greeted them on their return to germany in april when a distraught kirchherr met them at airport with news of sutcliffe s death previous day from what was later determined as a brain

a session drummer in his place already contemplating best s dismissal beatles replaced him in mid august with ringo starr who left rory storm and hurricanes to join them a 4 september session at emi

restricted vocal range to validate his standing in group lennon and mccartney had established a songwriting partnership and as band s success grew their dominant collaboration limited harrison s

really want to get in these bigger places you re going to have to change stop eating on stage stop swearing stop smoking lennon said we used to dress how we liked on and off stage he d tell us that

beatles first visit to united states took place when nation was still mourning assassination of president john f kennedy previous november commentators often suggest that for many particularly young beatles performances reignited sense of excitement and possibility that momentarily faded in wake of assassination and helped make way for revolutionary social changes to come in decade their hairstyle unusually long for era and mocked by many adults became an emblem of rebellion to burgeoning youth culture group s popularity generated unprecedented interest in british music and a number of other uk acts subsequently made their own american debuts successfully touring over next three years in what was termed british invasion beatles success in us opened door for a successive string of british beat groups and pop acts such as dave clark five animals petula clark kinks and rolling stones to achieve success in america during week of 4 april 1964 beatles held twelve positions on billboard hot 100 singles chart including top five a hard day s night capitol records lack of interest throughout 1963 did not go unnoticed and a competitor united artists records encouraged their

york in august journalist al aronowitz arranged for beatles to meet bob dylan visiting band in their new york hotel suite dylan introduced them to cannabis gould points out musical and cultural significance of this meeting before which musicians respective fanbases were perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds dylan s audience of college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings a dawning political and social idealism and a mildly bohemian style contrasted with their fans veritable kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in commercialised popular culture of television radio pop records fan magazines and teen fashion to many of dylan s followers in folk music scene beatles were seen as idolaters not idealists within six months of meeting according to gould lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated dylan s nasal drone brittle strum and introspective vocal persona and six months after that dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation and dressed in height of mod fashion as a result gould continues traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts nearly evaporated as beatles fans began to mature in their outlook and dylan s audience embraced new youth driven pop culture during 1964 us tour group were confronted with reality of racial segregation in country at time

stipulating that shows be integrated beatles for sale help and rubber soul according to gould beatles for sale beatles fourth studio lp evidenced a growing conflict between commercial pressures of their global success and their creative ambitions they had intended album recorded between august and october 1964 to continue format established by a hard day s night which unlike their first two lps contained only original songs they had nearly exhausted their backlog of songs on previous album however and given challenges constant international touring posed to their songwriting efforts lennon admitted material s becoming a hell of a problem as a result six covers from their extensive repertoire were chosen to complete album released in early december its eight original compositions stood out demonstrating growing maturity of lennon mccartney songwriting partnership in early 1965 following a dinner with lennon harrison and their wives harrison s dentist john riley secretly added lsd to their coffee lennon described experience it was just terrifying but it was fantastic i was pretty stunned for a month or two he and harrison subsequently became regular users of drug joined by starr on at least one occasion harrison s use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and hinduism he commented for me it was like a flash first time i had acid it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me and i realized a lot of things i didn t learn them because i already knew them but that happened to be key that opened door to reveal them from moment i had that i wanted to have it all time these thoughts about yogis and himalayas and ravi s music mccartney was initially reluctant to try it but eventually did so in late 1966 he became first beatle to discuss lsd

described as mainly a relentless spoof of bond it inspired a mixed response among both reviewers and band mccartney said help was great but it wasn t our film we were sort of guest stars it was fun but basically as an idea for a film it was a bit wrong soundtrack was dominated by lennon who wrote and sang lead on most of its songs including two singles help and ticket to ride accompanying help

saturday morning cartoon series beatles that echoed a hard day s night slapstick antics over its two year original run series was a historical milestone as first weekly television series to feature animated versions of real living people in mid october 1965 beatles entered recording studio for first time when making an album they had an extended period without other major commitments until this time according to george martin we had been making albums rather like a collection of singles now we were really beginning to think about albums as a bit of art on their own released in december rubber soul was hailed by critics as a major step forward in maturity and complexity of band s music their thematic reach was beginning to expand as they embraced deeper aspects of romance and philosophy biographers peter brown and steven gaines attribute new musical direction to beatles now habitual use of marijuana an assertion confirmed by band lennon referred to it as pot album and starr said grass was really influential in a lot of our changes especially with writers and because they were writing different material we were playing differently after help s foray into world of classical music with flutes and strings harrison s introduction of a sitar on norwegian wood this bird has flown marked a further progression outside traditional boundaries of popular music as their lyrics grew more artful fans began to study them for deeper meaning of norwegian wood lennon commented i was trying to be sophisticated in writing about an affair but in such a smokescreen way that you couldn t tell while many of rubber souls prominent songs were product of lennon and mccartney s collaborative songwriting it also featured distinct compositions from each though they continued to share official credit song in my life of which each later claimed lead authorship is considered a highlight of entire lennon mccartney catalogue harrison called rubber soul his favourite album and starr referred to it as departure record mccartney has said we d had our cute period and now it was time to expand however recording engineer norman smith later stated that studio sessions revealed signs of growing conflict within group clash between john and paul was becoming obvious he wrote and as far as paul was concerned george could do no right in 2003 rolling stone ranked rubber soul

when it began issuing beatles recordings for us market exercised complete control over format compiling distinct us albums from band s recordings and issuing songs of their choosing as singles in june 1966 yesterday and today one of capitol s compilation albums caused an uproar with its cover which portrayed grinning beatles dressed in butcher s overalls accompanied by raw meat and mutilated plastic baby dolls it has been incorrectly suggested that this was meant as a satirical response to way capitol had butchered us versions of their albums thousands of copies of lp had a new cover pasted over original an first state copy fetched 10 500 at a december 2005 auction in england meanwhile harrison met sitar maestro ravi shankar who agreed to train him on instrument during a tour of philippines month after yesterday and today furore beatles unintentionally snubbed nation s first lady imelda marcos who had expected them to attend a breakfast reception at presidential palace when presented with invitation epstein politely declined on band members behalf as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations they soon found that marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer resulting riots endangered group and they escaped country with difficulty immediately afterwards band members visited india for first time almost as soon as they returned home beatles faced a fierce backlash from us religious and social conservatives as well as ku klux klan over a comment lennon had made in a march interview with british reporter maureen cleave christianity will go lennon had said it will vanish and shrink i needn t argue about that i m right and i will be proved right jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary it s them twisting it that ruins it for me comment went virtually unnoticed in england but when us teenage fan magazine datebook printed it five months later on eve of group s august us tour it sparked a controversy with christians in american bible belt vatican issued a protest and bans on beatles records were imposed by spanish and dutch stations and south africa s national broadcasting service epstein accused datebook of having taken lennon s words out of context at a press conference lennon pointed out if i d said television was more popular than jesus i might have got away with it lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success but at prompting of reporters he concluded if you want me to apologise if that will make you happy then okay i m sorry as preparations were made for us tour beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard having originally used vox ac30 amplifiers they later acquired more powerful 100 watt amplifiers specially designed by vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964 but these were still inadequate struggling to compete with volume of sound generated by screaming fans band had grown increasingly bored with routine of performing live recognising that their shows were no longer about music they decided to make august tour their last rubber soul had marked a major step forward revolver released in august 1966 a week before beatles final tour marked another pitchforks scott plagenhoef identifies it as sound of a band growing into supreme confidence and redefining what was expected from popular music revolver featured sophisticated songwriting studio experimentation and a greatly expanded repertoire of musical styles ranging from innovative classical string arrangements to psychedelic rock abandoning customary group photograph its cover designed by klaus voormann a friend of band since their hamburg days was a stark arty black and white collage that caricatured beatles in a pen and ink style

recognisable style or genre of song harrison was developing as a songwriter and three of his compositions earned a place on record in 2003 rolling stone ranked revolver as third greatest album of all time during us tour that followed its release however band performed none of its songs as chris ingham writes they were very much studio creations and there was no way a four piece rock n roll group could do them justice particularly through wall of fans screams live beatles and studio beatles had become entirely different beasts band s concert at san francisco s candlestick park on 29 august was

beatles embraced an increasingly experimental approach as they recorded sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band beginning in late november 1966 according to engineer geoff emerick album s recording took over 700 hours he recalled band s insistence that everything on sgt pepper had to be different we had microphones right down in bells of brass instruments and headphones turned into microphones attached to violins we used giant primitive oscillators to vary speed of instruments and vocals and we had tapes chopped to pieces and stuck together upside down and wrong way around parts of a day in

records created using relatively primitive four track recording technology astounded contemporary artists among music critics acclaim for album was virtually universal gould writes sgt pepper was first major pop rock lp to include its complete lyrics which appeared on back cover those lyrics were subject of critical analysis for instance in late 1967 album was subject of a scholarly inquiry by american literary critic and professor of english richard poirier who observed that his students were listening to group s music with a degree of engagement that he as a teacher of literature could only envy poirier identified what he termed its mixed it s unwise ever to assume that they re doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style one kind of feeling about a subject isn t enough any single induced feeling must often exist within context of seemingly contradictory alternatives mccartney said at time we write songs we know what we mean by them but in a week someone else says something about it and you can t deny it you put your own meaning at your own level to our songs album s elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study a collage designed by pop artists peter blake and jann haworth it depicted group as fictional band referred to in album s title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people heavy moustaches worn by group reflected

is very much in vein of sgt pepper and even spacier in parts especially sound collages of i am walrus and he calls its five songs culled from band s 1967 singles huge glorious and innovative in its first three weeks album set a record for highest initial sales of any capitol lp and it is only capitol compilation later to be adopted in band s official canon of studio albums first aired on boxing day magical mystery tour film largely directed by mccartney brought group their first major negative uk press it was dismissed as blatant rubbish by daily express daily mail called it a colossal conceit and guardian labelled film a kind of fantasy morality play about grossness and warmth and stupidity of audience gould describes it as a great deal of raw footage showing a group of people getting on getting off and riding on a bus although viewership figures were respectable its slating in press led us television networks to lose interest in broadcasting film in january 1968 beatles filmed a cameo for animated movie yellow submarine which featured cartoon versions of band members and a soundtrack with eleven of their songs including four unreleased studio recordings that made their debut in film released in june 1968 film was praised by critics for its music humour and innovative visual style it would be seven months however before its soundtrack album appeared thumb beatles known as white album for its minimalist cover conceived by pop artist richard hamilton in direct contrast to sgt pepper while also suggesting a clean slate in interim came beatles a double lp commonly known as white album for its virtually featureless cover creative inspiration for album came from a new direction without epstein s guiding presence group had briefly turned to maharishi mahesh yogi as their guru at his ashram in rishikesh india a guide course scheduled for three months marked one of their most prolific periods yielding numerous songs including a majority of 30 included on album however starr left after only ten days likening it to butlins and mccartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later for lennon and harrison creativity turned to questioning when an electronics technician known as magic alex suggested that maharishi was attempting to manipulate them when he alleged that maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees a persuaded lennon left abruptly just two months into course bringing an unconvinced harrison and remainder of group s entourage with him in anger lennon wrote a scathing song titled maharishi renamed sexy sadie to avoid potential legal issues mccartney said we made a mistake we thought there was more to him than there was during recording sessions for white album which stretched from late may to mid october 1968 relations between beatles grew openly divisive starr quit for two weeks and mccartney took over drum kit for back in u s s r on which harrison and lennon drummed as well and dear prudence lennon had lost interest in collaborating with mccartney whose contribution ob la di ob la da he scorned as granny music shit tensions were further aggravated by lennon s romantic preoccupation with avant garde artist yoko ono whom he insisted on bringing to sessions despite group s well established understanding that girlfriends were not allowed in studio describing double album lennon later said every track is an individual track there isn t any beatle music on it it s john and band paul and band george and band mccartney has recalled that album wasn t a pleasant one to make both he and lennon identified sessions as start of band s break up issued in november white album was band s first apple records album release although emi continued to own their recordings new label was a subsidiary of apple corps which epstein had formed as part of his plan to create a tax effective business structure record attracted more than 2 million advance orders selling nearly 4 million copies in us in little over a month and its tracks dominated playlists of american radio stations despite its popularity it did not receive flattering reviews at time according to gould general critical opinion eventually turned in favour of white album and in 2003 rolling stone ranked it as tenth greatest album of all time pitchfork s mark richardson describes it as large and sprawling overflowing with ideas but also with indulgences and filled with a hugely variable array of material its failings are as essential to its character as its triumphs erlewine comments band s two main songwriting forces were no longer on same page but neither were george and ringo yet lennon turns in two of his best ballads mccartney s songs are stunning harrison had become a songwriter who deserved wider exposure and starr s composition was a delight yellow submarine lp issued in january 1969 contained only four previously unreleased songs that had debuted in film along with title track already issued on revolver all you need is love already issued as a single and on us magical mystery tour lp and seven instrumental pieces composed by martin because of paucity of new beatles music allmusic s unterberger and bruce eder suggest album might be inessential but for harrison s it s all too much jewel of new songs resplendent in swirling mellotron sic larger than life percussion and tidal waves of feedback guitar a virtuoso excursion into otherwise hazy psychedelia abbey road let it be and separation although let it be was beatles final album release it was largely recorded before abbey road project s impetus came from an idea martin attributes to mccartney who suggested they record an album of new material and rehearse it then perform it before a live audience for very first time on record and on film originally intended for a one hour television programme to be called beatles at work in event much of album s content came from studio work beginning in january 1969 many hours of which were captured on film by director michael lindsay hogg martin has said that project was not at all a happy recording experience it was a time when relations between beatles were at their lowest ebb lennon described largely impromptu sessions as hell most miserable on earth and harrison low of all time irritated by both mccartney and lennon harrison walked out for five days upon returning he threatened to leave band unless they abandon ed all talk of live performance and instead focused on finishing a new album initially titled get back using songs recorded for tv special he also demanded they cease work at twickenham film studios where sessions had begun and relocate to newly finished apple studio other band members agreed and idea came about to salvage footage shot for tv production for use in a feature film alt thumb left american soul musician billy preston pictured in 1971 was for a short time considered a fifth beatle during recording of get back in an effort to alleviate tensions within band and improve quality of their live sound harrison invited keyboardist billy preston to participate in last nine days of sessions preston received label billing on get back single only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment on an official beatles release at conclusion of rehearsals band could not agree on a location to film a concert rejecting several ideas including a boat at sea a lunatic asylum tunisian desert and colosseum ultimately what would be their final live performance was filmed on rooftop of apple corps building at 3 savile row london on 30 january 1969

developed between band members regarding appointment of a financial adviser need for which had become evident without epstein to manage business affairs lennon harrison and starr favoured allen klein who had managed rolling stones and sam cooke mccartney wanted lee and john eastman father and brother respectively of linda eastman whom mccartney married on 12 march agreement could not be reached so both klein and eastmans were temporarily appointed klein as beatles business manager and eastmans as their lawyers further conflict ensued however and financial opportunities were lost on 8 may 1969 klein was named sole manager of band eastmans having previously been dismissed as beatles lawyers mccartney refused to sign management contract with klein but he was out voted by other beatles martin stated that he was surprised when mccartney asked him to produce another album as get back sessions had been a miserable experience and he had thought it was end of road for all of us primary recording sessions for abbey road began on 2 july 1969 lennon who rejected martin s proposed format of a continuously moving piece of music wanted his and mccartney s songs to occupy separate sides of album eventual format with individually composed songs on first side and second consisting largely of a medley was mccartney s suggested compromise on 4 july first solo single by a beatle was released lennon s give peace a chance credited to plastic ono band completion and mixing of i want you she s so heavy on 20 august was last occasion on which all four beatles were together in same studio on 8 september 1969 while starr was in hospital other band members met to discuss recording a new album they considered a different approach to songwriting by ending lennon mccartney pretense and having four compositions apiece from lennon mccartney and harrison with two from starr and a lead single around christmas on 20 september lennon announced his departure to rest of group but agreed to withhold a public announcement to avoid undermining sales of forthcoming album released six days after lennon s declaration abbey road sold 4 million copies within three months and topped uk charts for a total of seventeen weeks its second track ballad something was issued as a single only harrison composition ever to appear as a beatles a side abbey road received mixed reviews although medley met with general acclaim unterberger considers it a fitting swan song for group containing some of greatest harmonies to be heard on any rock record musicologist and author ian macdonald calls album erratic and often hollow despite semblance of unity and coherence offered by medley martin has singled it out as his personal favourite of all band s albums lennon said it was competent but had no life in it recording engineer emerick notes that replacement of studio s valve mixing console with a transistorised one yielded a less punchy sound leaving group frustrated at thinner tone and lack of impact and contributing to its kinder gentler feel relative to their previous albums for still unfinished get back album one last song harrison s i me mine was recorded on 3 january 1970 lennon in denmark at time did not participate in march rejecting work johns had done on project now retitled let it be klein gave session tapes to american producer phil spector who had recently produced lennon s solo single instant karma in addition to remixing material spector edited spliced and overdubbed several of recordings that had been intended as live mccartney was unhappy with producer s approach and particularly dissatisfied with lavish orchestration on long and winding road which involved a fourteen voice choir and 36 piece instrumental ensemble mccartney s demands that alterations to song be reverted were ignored and he publicly announced his departure from band on 10 april a week before release of his first self titled solo album on 8 may 1970 spector produced let it be was released its accompanying single long and winding road was beatles last it was released in united states but not in uk let it be documentary film followed later that month and would win 1970 academy award for best original song score sunday telegraph critic penelope gilliatt called it a very bad film and a touching one about breaking apart of this reassuring geometrically perfect once apparently ageless

changed music forever scott schinder and andy schwartz describe beatles musical evolution in beatles as musicians walter everett describes lennon and mccartney s contrasting motivations and approaches to composition mccartney may be said to have constantly developed as a means to entertain a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in demonstration of a universally agreed upon common language that he did much to enrich conversely lennon s mature music is best appreciated as daring product of a largely unconscious searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility ian macdonald describes mccartney as a natural melodist a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony his melody lines are characterised as primarily vertical employing wide consonant intervals which express his extrovert energy and optimism conversely lennon s sedentary ironic personality is reflected in a horizontal approach featuring minimal dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest basically a realist he instinctively kept his melodies close to rhythms and cadences of speech colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own macdonald praises harrison s lead guitar work for role his characterful lines and textural colourings play in supporting lennon and mccartney s parts and describes starr as father of modern pop rock drumming influences band s earliest influences include elvis presley carl perkins little richard and chuck berry during beatles co residency with little richard at star club in hamburg from april to may 1962 he advised them on proper technique for performing his songs of presley lennon said nothing really affected me until i heard elvis if there hadn t been elvis there would not have been beatles other early influences include buddy holly eddie cochran roy orbison and everly brothers beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries including bob dylan who frank zappa lovin spoonful byrds and beach boys whose 1966 album pet sounds amazed and inspired mccartney referring to beach boys creative leader martin later stated no one made a greater impact on beatles than brian wilson ravi shankar with whom harrison studied for six weeks in india in late 1966 had a significant effect on his musical development during band s later years genres originating as a skiffle group beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer merseybeat genre and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music reflecting range of styles they explored lennon said of beatles for sale you could call our new one a beatles country and western lp while gould credits rubber soul as instrument by which legions of folk music enthusiasts were coaxed into camp of pop upright 75 thumb a hofner violin bass guitar and gretsch country gentleman guitar models played by mccartney and harrison respectively vox ac30 amplifier behind them is model beatles used during performances in early 1960s alt two electric guitars a light brown violin shaped bass and a darker brown guitar resting against a vox amplifier although 1965 song yesterday was not first pop record to employ orchestral strings it marked group s first recorded use of classical music elements gould observes more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to din of drums and electric guitars they continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect sgt peppers she s leaving home for instance is cast in of a sentimental victorian ballad gould writes its words and music filled with cliches of musical melodrama band s stylistic range expanded in another direction with their 1966 b side rain described by martin strong as first overtly psychedelic beatles record other psychedelic numbers followed such as tomorrow never knows recorded before rain strawberry fields forever lucy in sky with diamonds and i am walrus influence of indian classical music was evident in harrison s inner light love you to and within you without you gould describes latter two as attempts to replicate raga form in miniature innovation was most striking feature of their creative evolution according to music historian and pianist michael campbell a day in life encapsulates art and achievement of beatles as well as any single track can it highlights key features of their music sound imagination persistence of tuneful melody and close coordination between words and music it represents a new category of song more sophisticated than pop and uniquely innovative there literally had never before been a song classical or vernacular that had blended so many disparate elements so imaginatively philosophy professor bruce ellis benson agrees beatles give us a wonderful example of how such far ranging influences as celtic music rhythm and blues and country and western could be put together in a new way author dominic pedler describes way they crossed musical styles far from moving sequentially from one genre to another as is sometimes conveniently suggested group maintained in parallel their mastery of traditional catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling with a wide range of peripheral influences from country to vaudeville one of these threads was their take on folk music which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with indian music and philosophy as personal relationships between band members grew increasingly strained their individual tastes became more apparent minimalistic cover artwork for white album contrasted with complexity and diversity of its music which encompassed lennon s revolution 9 whose musique concrete approach was influenced by yoko ono starr s country song don t pass me by harrison s rock ballad while my guitar gently weeps and proto metal roar of mccartney s helter skelter contribution of george martin right thumb martin second from right in studio with beatles in mid 1960s george martin s close involvement in his role as producer made him one of leading candidates for informal title of fifth beatle he applied his classical musical training in various ways and functioned as an informal music teacher to progressing songwriters according to gould martin suggested to a sceptical mccartney that arrangement of yesterday should feature a string quartet accompaniment thereby introducing beatles to a hitherto unsuspected world of classical instrumental colour in macdonald s description their creative development was also facilitated by martin s willingness to experiment in response to their suggestions such as adding something baroque to a particular recording in addition to scoring orchestral arrangements for recordings martin often performed on them playing instruments including piano organ and brass collaborating with lennon and mccartney required martin to adapt to their different approaches to songwriting and recording macdonald comments while he worked more naturally with conventionally articulate mccartney challenge of catering to lennon s intuitive approach generally spurred him to his more original arrangements of which being for benefit of mr kite is an outstanding example martin said of two composers distinct songwriting styles and his own stabilising influence harrison echoed martin s description of his stabilising role i think we just grew through those years together him as straight man and us as but he was always there for us to interpret our madness we used to be slightly avant garde on certain days of week and he would be there as anchor person to communicate that through engineers and on to tape in studio making innovative use of technology while expanding possibilities of recorded music beatles urged experimentation by martin and his recording engineers seeking ways to put chance occurrences to creative use accidental guitar feedback a resonating glass bottle a tape loaded wrong way round so that it played backwards any of these might be incorporated into their music their desire to create new sounds on every new recording combined with martin s arranging abilities and studio expertise of emi staff engineers norman smith ken townsend and geoff emerick all contributed significantly to their records from rubber soul and especially revolver onwards along with innovative studio techniques such as sound effects unconventional microphone placements tape loops double tracking and vari speed recording beatles augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional in rock music at time these included string and brass ensembles as well as indian instruments such as sitar in norwegian wood and in strawberry fields forever they also used novel electronic instruments such as mellotron with which mccartney supplied flute voices on strawberry fields forever intro and clavioline an electronic keyboard that created unusual oboe like sound on baby you re a rich man legacy upright 1 2 thumb right beatles monument in almaty kazakhstan former rolling stone associate editor robert greenfield compared beatles to picasso as artists who broke through constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original i n form of popular music no one will ever be more revolutionary more creative and more distinctive british poet philip larkin described their work as an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of negro rock and roll with their own adolescent romanticism and first advance in popular music since war they not only sparked british invasion of united states they became a globally influential phenomenon as well from 1920s united states had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of world via hollywood movies jazz music of broadway and tin pan alley and later rock and roll that first emerged in memphis tennessee beatles are regarded as british cultural icons with young adults from abroad naming band among a group of people that they most associated with uk culture their musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide many artists have acknowledged beatles influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs on radio their arrival marked beginning of a new era in 1968 programme director of new york s wabc radio station forbade his djs from playing any pre beatles music marking defining line of what would be considered oldies on american radio they helped to redefine album as something more than just a few hits padded out with filler and they were primary innovators of modern music video shea stadium show with which they opened their 1965 north american tour attracted an estimated 55 600 people then largest audience in concert history spitz describes event as a major breakthrough a giant step toward reshaping concert business emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles which became a mark of rebellion had a global impact on fashion according to gould beatles changed way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives from what began as beatlemania fad group s popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements of decade as icons of 1960s counterculture gould continues they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas fuelling movements such as women s liberation gay liberation and environmentalism according to peter lavezzoli after more popular than jesus controversy in 1966 beatles felt considerable pressure to say right things and began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness other commentators such as
