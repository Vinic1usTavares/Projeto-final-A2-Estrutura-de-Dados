neighborhoods 2011 band members recorded majority of album on their own in different studios resulting in an extension of bandmates miscommunication and tension trio parted ways with their record label interscope in 2012 later self releasing an extended play dogs eating dogs that holiday season plans for a seventh blink 182 album were delayed numerous times reportedly due to guitarist tom delonge s involvement in his other group angels airwaves as well as other projects in interim band mounted an anniversary tour for its self titled fifth album and headlined reading and leeds festivals by time delonge spoke to rock sound in november 2014 there was still little work completed on album we re just getting to that point of starting there s no timeline at moment by time a record deal was finalized one month later delonge backed out of recording and performing commitments by email which led bassist mark hoppus and drummer travis barker to seek legal separation from him in what hoppus described as a friendly divorce from delonge hoppus soon revealed that it was a very very difficult struggle to corral delonge into working with group while barker asserted that delonge s behavior was motivated by money he also claimed that he quit band more than once prior to group s separation delonge countered these accusations by arguing that he was being forced to drop his other projects calling their actions defensive and divisive as he continued to pursue said projects including a solo album composed of purported blink 182 demos to stars demos odds and ends he related to press that he was totally willing and interested in playing with those guys again meanwhile blink 182 performed two club shows and a slot at tattoo convention music festival in march 2015 with alkaline trio vocalist guitarist matt skiba filling in for delonge barker and hoppus met with skiba over a lunch to discuss filling in for delonge and began rehearsals with group after shows skiba returned to alkaline trio for a string of dates and also released an album from his other band after legal battles with delonge were worked out skiba rejoined blink 182 as an official member and trio began preparations for new music in august 2015 trio initially began writing together for first time at barker s studio opra music in north hollywood in september 2015 group wrote and recorded demos for upwards of 30 40 songs recording and production thumb guitarist and singer matt skiba became a full fledged band member while recording california california was produced by john feldmann and recorded at his studio foxy studios in woodland hills california between january and march 2016 feldmann initially frontman of band goldfinger became better known for his production work with artists such as 5 seconds of summer and all time low barker was first to reach out to feldmann about producing as two were good friends he had known members of blink 182 for over two decades as group had previously performed shows with goldfinger he is first new producer to work with blink 182 since death of band s longtime producer jerry finn who last worked with band in 2003 feldmann worshipped finn and his approach to producing i never thought there d be anybody that could come even close to replacing jerry and john is really closest that we ve come to someone who could fill that capacity said hoppus group initially invited feldmann to hear its demos and he suggested that band regroup at his studio next day to make a fresh start next day group wrote three songs including lead single bored to death as band continued to write and record trio chose to shelve their earlier recordings and proceeded to write 28 songs in a period of 3 4 weeks half of these songs were chosen to be put on finalized album in addition to two joke songs barker fought for all 28 songs to be on album as he felt fans had waited long enough for more new music trio as well as feldmann regularly stayed in studio for up to 18 hours a day band members would arrive at studio with no plan for what to work on for day they would then write several songs in only a few hours aiming to complete them by end of night feldmann asked members to consider what blink 182 as a group are all about to inspire songwriting he would encourage musicians to write with speed which hoppus admitted could be frustrating john was like okay we ve got song structure write lyrics go in there and sing it go in there and sing it sometimes i was like i m not ready to sing and feldmann would reply no go write something great right now barker was more supportive of this method based on his work with transplants which had a similar speedy approach i always feel like your first instinct is your best barker remarked feldmann felt it was a challenge to work with a new version of blink 182 while both keeping its legacy and moving group into a new territory feldmann s agenda was to have an album that was palatable for a generation of add kids band members and feldmann felt a breakthrough in direction with song cynical which they immediately chose as opening song on album according to hoppus band recorded a total of nearly 50 songs by mid february album was 70 80 complete according to barker and work was reportedly completed in early march 2016 by end of march group were still narrowing down songs that would be present on album trio posted their progress via their respective social media accounts during recording in form of snapchat and instagram clips all parties seemed satisfied with record while recording barker told an interviewer that it s honestly best material we ve written or put out in years i haven t been excited about a blink album like this in a long time feldmann commented i m just so excited to have people hear it i d say it s one of best records i ve ever made in my life composition left thumb john feldmann seen here in 2015 was blink 182 s first new producer in over a decade hoppus considered music on album wide ranging commenting we tried to capture energy and not worry so much about all knobs this includes songs he felt sounded like group circa 1999 super fast late nineties punk rock sounding songs as well as more progressive songs that are like nothing we have ever done before overall he considered record really rich with sing along melodies and sing along choruses which was what he preferred most when listening to bands feldmann considered music not a huge departure from band s usual sound as hoped to make a classic blink record to familiarize himself he listened to all of band s catalogue prior to recording lisa worden music director at los angeles radio station kroq compared its sound to second blink 182 album dude ranch and commented it sounds like blink but it s not anything that we ve heard before for fans of band they re going to be super happy with it critics described album categorically as alternative rock pop punk and punk rock hoppus considered his lyrical content relatively similar to group s prior releases topics are universal there is a lot of angst that could be teen angst or it could be angst of everyday life i still have same emotions i had 20 years ago i get frustrated or i get excited i still feel like i m falling in love with my wife hoppus considered common topics he wrote about to be miscommunication loss of identity and questioning of identity which is a process we went through just by being in studio writing a new blink record and having a new iteration of blink though in past he preferred to ruminate on his lyrics for days on end feldmann s speedy process gave hoppus little time to process them despite this he felt he wrote some of best lyrics i ve written in a long time for this record because i didn t have a chance to go and overthink things hoppus s self doubt on his own creative process is referenced in opening lyrics of cynical i start every song with this fear thinking i m never going to write another good song he told upset skiba said that at time of writing album he and hoppus were both reading books such as dead wake blood meridian and revenant and he felt prose impacted their lyrics there were a lot of rushing rivers and whole idea of using metaphors to describe loneliness just like settler native american and southern gothic influence of literature that was kind of our rhyming dictionary songs cynical was proposed by feldmann as a faster song reminiscent of band s past work hoppus wrote song about thinking world is in a cynical place but also as a mission statement as a new version of blink 182 bored to death was first song band recorded with feldmann on group s first day of work with him she s out of her mind post punk band bauhaus in words it was result of multiple rewrites with each draft attempting to perfect chorus preceding it hoppus called it a simple love song los angeles was meant to show a heavier more experimental version of band song is centered on band s adopted hometown its lyrics reference demolition of sixth street bridge in la hoppus described sober as about rebuilding and finding yourself and knowing that you re in a troubled place but striving to get to somewhere better its subject matter is based around two experiences one when skiba was a bicycle messenger in chicago and was struck by a car and another a fictional story of a drunken night with a girlfriend patrick stump of fall out boy collaborated with band his initial idea being what could blink be on modern rock radio in 2016 built this pool is a short joke song with homoerotic lyrics audible is that really it heard at end of song was a genuine reaction from barker no future was nearly cut from record it was inspired by punk rock history as many songs for example sex pistols god save queen contain a no future lyric home is such a lonely place is a ballad with clean arpeggiated finger picking guitars with strings underneath it its lyrics are themed around lost love it emerged from an early morning coffee meeting between hoppus and feldmann who both imagined how lonely their homes would be when their children grow up and move away kings of weekend was also nearly moved off final track listing but kept because of its recognizable guitar riff feldmann described it as party song we ve all had day jobs and we all know what it s like to have that day off to do what we want teenage satellites is based around being a kid and not knowing who you are not having enough courage to say what you mean it was last song recorded for album and it was at first written without a hook or melody in mind left alone made album cut because band liked skiba s vocal performance rabbit hole was one of hoppus favorites and revolves around standing your ground and not falling for people s nonsense san diego is centered on band s original hometown and on a deeper level relationships with group s former bandmate tom delonge according to feldmann it was a song hoppus did not want to write there s clearly a lot of feelings involved with having a best friend who is not in your band anymore feldmann said for him song acts as a bittersweet homage a goodbye to this city while acknowledging interpersonal relationships within band stump also collaborated in writing process for san diego only thing that matters originally began as a infused number until hoppus re wrote it california is about giving credit to how lucky we are to have lived here and grown up in california brohemian rhapsody its title a pun on queen s bohemian rhapsody is another joke song with sole lyric there s something about you i can t quite put my finger in hoppus and feldmann wrote and recorded song in nine minutes artwork and title left thumb original rejected and uncropped version of album artwork album s artwork was created by english street artist d face barker was a fan of his work having bought many of his pieces at his galleries in past according to d face trio wanted artwork to represent california but with a subversive side to show that it s not always great and there s always something under surface in underbelly artist was particularly busy and employed pre existing but unfinished illustration for album cover he also offered two alternate pieces that were rejected but later posted on nme website skiba and barker were pleased but hoppus was not as immediately receptive according to artist while he did not admit to being a fan of group d face was happy with commission commenting to have a band with such a great legacy and talent like blink ask to work with you is a great honour and privilege title california is representative of band s home state and was picked after band members realized that they had written multiple songs relating to its cities and culture title was also inspired by season and feldmann s studio it was a perfect california winter and it was sunny and hot every single day john s studio it s basically indoor outdoor with palm trees everywhere though he refrained from dubbing it a concept album skiba considered songs linked thematically big and bright and huge and dark and twisted everything that california is title of this album was one of most difficult things i ve done in my entire life said hoppus alternate titles for album included no future which was dropped because it seemed too negative and joke titles ob gyn kenobi nude erection and no hard feelings d face also reported that titles los angeles and riot were nearly used release california was announced alongside lead single bored to death on los angeles radio station kroq on april 27 2016 a music video directed by rob soucy was released on june 20 group released an additional three songs built this pool on may 5 rabbit hole on june 8 and no future on june 23 and also performed brohemian rhapsody in live concerts prior to album s release california was released on july 1 date is typically 182nd day of year but due to it being a leap year it was 183rd she s out of her mind was announced as second official single on august 1 2016 and sent to radio october 11 home is such a lonely place was sent to alternative radio as third official single april 18 2017 california is band s first release through bmg rights management and also among bmg s first releases through its distribution deal with alternative distribution alliance album was initially slated to be released independently but they decided to work with bmg when that label acquired vagrant records vagrant had a promotional team that according to blink s manager lawrence varra understood culture surrounding band and genre deal allowed band and its management to be in near complete control of release and promotion of california we didn t have to listen to a major label spend money they wanted to spend and we d just spend it ourselves way we wanted to said varra rather than window album an industry term for its release being exclusively physical for a period of time team chose to release california as wide as possible we wanted music to be accessible to younger kids who listen to it on youtube and spotify and different places he said in addition they employed ticketing tiers for california tour making it possible for hardcore fans to obtain best seats but also allowing it to be affordable for more casual fans however a hit was not guaranteed i was speculative leading up and nervous this record could have gone either way said jon cohen evp of recorded music for bmg in december 2016 band revealed they were in process of recording more material for a deluxe edition re release of album it s a double album at this point and it s more of an extension of what we did in studio earlier some of songs were songs that we did not put on first album but are great songs and some are brand new that we just wrote last week hoppus said to billboard on february 28 2017 hoppus replied to a message on twitter in regards of deluxe edition stating that it is set to release on may 19 2017 on march 16 2017 parking lot was released as first song from deluxe edition critical reception california has received mixed to positive reviews from music critics at metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics album has an average score of 63 out of 100 which indicates generally favorable reviews based on seventeen reviews allmusic s neil z yeung dubbed record their best in 15 years considering it a return to form and an admirable maturation of band s classic pop punk sound it s not a desperate grasp at youth and faded glory but rather a reflective look back and an expert execution of what they do best gav lloyd from rock sound wrote that blink 182 have delivered an album that recalls everything that makes this band great and gives it all a fresh twist end result is california being amongst best albums they ve ever produced nme charlotte gunn felt california has humour pace emotion and huge choruses of a classic blink record evan lucy at alternative press felt it upbeat hooky and above anything else a total blast exclaim s josiah hughes was more critical calling it uneven and disjointed and hard to take in as one larger whole jon dolan of rolling stone considered it band s catchiest music since their heyday summarizing at its best california shows blink trying new ways to freshen up yesterday s racket jon caramanica at new york times found it pleasantly familiar if not especially imaginative album is full of songs that have achieved their purpose by halfway mark andrew unterberger of spin felt delonge s presence was missed describing it as fine fun and overall kinda meh aidan reynolds from drowned in sound noted california sounds like work of a band filled with joy of existence giving in to every pop indulgence or production trick that could stuff in one more hook before end there are pick scrapes and oh backing vocals everywhere and even dumb seconds long throwaway tracks have their own charm a number of reviewers found album overly long while others felt feldmann was too much of an influence mike at houston chronicle said feldmann s style is all over record as most tracks sound too formulaic similar and run together other tracks are way too commercial even for a band size of blink california is ultimately a step back rather than a throwback david anthony from a v club gave album a c commenting california is sound of blink 182 desperately trying to remain relevant by outsourcing its creativity it is another homogenous addition to feldmann s growing resume but this time he unintentionally removed soul of pop punk s clown princes in process nina corcoran from consequence of sound was similarly negative when not cranking compression on vocals feldmann ruins other songs with nonstop gimmicks piano interludes stiffened handclaps sappy title track gwilym mumford of guardian focusing on album s turbulent history regarding departure of delonge deemed album a tired and tiring work accolades at 59th annual grammy awards blink 182 were nominated for award for best rock album california lost to cage elephant s tell me i m pretty commercial performance california
