star trek first contact is a 1996 american science fiction film directed by jonathan frakes in his directorial debut and based on franchise star trek it is eighth film in star trek film series as well as second to star cast of star trek next generation in film crew of uss enterprise e travel back in time from 24th century to mid 21st century in order to stop cybernetic borg from conquering earth by changing their past after release of star trek generations in 1994 paramount pictures tasked writers brannon braga and ronald d moore with developing next film in series braga and moore wanted to feature borg in plot while producer rick berman wanted a story involving time travel writers combined two ideas they initially set film during european renaissance but changed time period that borg corrupted to mid 21st century after fearing renaissance idea would be too kitsch after two better known directors turned down job cast member jonathan frakes was chosen to direct to make sure task fell to someone who understood star trek film s script required creation of new starship designs including a new uss enterprise production designer herman zimmerman and illustrator john eaves collaborated to make a sleeker ship than its predecessor principal photography began with weeks of location shooting in arizona and california before production moved to new sets for ship based scenes borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from inside out new makeup sessions took four times as long as their appearances on television series effects company industrial light magic rushed to complete film s special effects in less than five months traditional optical effects techniques were supplemented with computer generated imagery jerry goldsmith and his son joel goldsmith collaborated to produce film s score star trek first contact was released on november 22 1996 and was highest grossing film on its opening weekend it eventually made 92 million in united states and canada with an additional 54 million in other territories combining a worldwide total of 146 million critical reception was mostly positive critics including roger ebert considered it to be one of best star trek films and it was most positively reviewed film in franchise 93 of reviews were positive until being marginally surpassed 94 by 2009 reboot film borg and special effects were lauded while characterization was less evenly received scholarly analysis of film has focused on captain jean luc picard s parallels to herman melville s ahab and nature of borg first contact was nominated for academy award for best makeup and won three saturn awards plot in 24th century captain jean luc picard awakens from a nightmare in which he relived his assimilation by cybernetic borg six years earlier he is contacted by admiral hayes who informs him of a new borg threat against earth picard s orders are for his ship to patrol neutral zone in case of romulan aggression starfleet is worried that picard is too emotionally involved with borg to join fight learning fleet is losing battle enterprise crew disobeys orders and heads for earth where a single borg cube ship holds its own against a group of starfleet vessels enterprise arrives in time to assist crew of and its captain klingon worf after admiral hayes is killed picard takes control of fleet and directs surviving ships to concentrate their firepower on a seemingly unimportant point on borg ship nemecek 326 cube is destroyed after launching a smaller sphere ship towards planet enterprise pursues sphere into a temporal vortex as sphere disappears enterprise discovers earth has been altered it is now populated entirely by borg realizing borg have used time travel to change past enterprise follows sphere through vortex enterprise arrives hundreds of years in its past on april 4 day before humanity s first encounter with alien life after zefram cochrane s historic warp drive flight crew realizes borg are trying to prevent first contact after destroying borg sphere an away team transports down to cochrane s ship phoenix in montana picard has cochrane s assistant lily sloane sent back to enterprise for medical attention captain returns to ship and leaves commander william t riker on earth to make sure phoenixs flight proceeds as planned nemecek 327 while in future cochrane is seen as a hero real man is reluctant to assume role enterprise crew describe a group of borg invade enterprises lower decks and begin to assimilate its crew and modify ship picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable borg with a corrosive gas but are forced back android data is captured in melee a frightened sloane corners picard with a weapon but he gains her trust two escape borg infested area of ship by creating a diversion in holodeck picard worf and ship s navigator lieutenant hawk travel outside ship in space suits to stop borg from calling reinforcements by using deflector dish as borg continue to assimilate more decks worf suggests destroying ship but picard angrily calls him a coward sloane confronts captain and makes him realize he is acting irrationally picard orders an activation of ship s self destruct then orders crew to head for escape pods while he stays behind to rescue data nemecek 328 as cochrane riker and engineer geordi la forge prepare to activate warp drive on phoenix picard discovers that borg queen has grafted human skin onto data giving him sensation of touch he has long desired so that she can obtain android s encryption codes to enterprise computer although picard offers himself to borg in exchange for data s freedom data refuses to leave he deactivates self destruct and fires torpedoes at phoenix at last moment torpedoes miss and queen realizes data betrayed her android ruptures a coolant tank and corrosive vapor eats away biological components of borg with borg threat neutralized cochrane completes his warp flight next day crew watches from a distance as an alien vulcan ship attracted by phoenix warp test lands on earth cochrane and sloane greet aliens having ensured correction of timeline enterprise crew slip away and return to 24th century cast first contact is first film in star trek film series in which none of star trek original series main characters appear rather main cast of star trek next generation play following characters patrick stewart as jean luc picard captain of uss enterprise e who is haunted by his time as a member of borg stewart was one of few cast members who had an important role in developing script offering suggestions and comments kaplan 22 picard s character was changed from angst ridden character viewers have seen before to an action hero type stewart noted that picard was more physically active in film compared to his usual depiction jonathan frakes as william riker ship s first officer who leads away team on earth frakes said he did not have much difficulty directing and acting at same time having done so on television series brent spiner as data an android and ship s second officer who endeavors to become human rumors before film s release suggested that since data s skin had been largely removed at end of story it would allow another actor to assume role kaplan 31 levar burton as geordi la forge ship s chief engineer who helps repair phoenix la forge was born blind and for television series and previous film had worn a special visor to see burton lobbied for many years to have his character s visor replaced so that people could see his eyes since air filter he wore prevented audience from seeing his eyes and limited his acting ability moore finally agreed giving character ocular implants that were never explained in film beyond showing they were artificial michael dorn as worf commander of uss defiant and picard s former chief of security gates mcfadden as beverly crusher ship s doctor in an interview before film s premiere mcfadden said she considered women finally on par with men in star trek we ve come a long way since majel barrett was stuck in sick bay as nurse chapel in 1960s and made to dye her hair blond marina sirtis as deanna troi counselor aboard enterprise sirtis missed working on television show and was acutely aware that expectations and stakes for first contact were high we were scared that people thought we couldn t cut it without original cast she said alfre woodard as lily sloane cochrane s assistant when frakes first moved to los angeles woodard was one of very first people he met during a conversation at a barbecue woodard said she would become frakes godmother as he did not have one through this relationship frakes was able to cast woodard in film he considered it a coup to land an academy award nominated actress woodard considered lily to be character most like herself out of all roles she has played james cromwell as zefram cochrane pilot and creator of earth s first warp capable vessel character of zefram cochrane had first appeared in original series episode metamorphosis played by glenn corbett cromwell s cochrane is much older and has no resemblance to corbett which did not bother writers kaplan 29 they wanted to portray cochrane as a character going through a major transition he starts out as a cynical selfish drunk who is changed by characters he meets over course of film although character was written with cromwell in mind tom hanks a big fan of star trek was approached for role by paramount first but he had already committed to another project and had to reject part frakes commented that it would have been a mistake to cast hanks as cochrane due to his being so well known cromwell had a long previous association with star trek having played characters in next generation episodes hunted and birthright as well as a role in star trek deep space nine cromwell actually came in and read for part frakes said he nailed it cromwell described his method of portraying cochrane as always playing himself part of actor s interest in film was his involvement in steven m greer s center for study of extraterrestrial intelligence which offers training for first contact scenarios alice krige as borg queen controller of cybernetic collective casting for part took time as actress needed to be sexy dangerous and mysterious frakes cast krige after finding that she had all of mentioned qualities and being impressed by her performance in ghost story director considers her sexiest star trek villain of all time krige suffered a large amount of discomfort filming her role her costume was too tight causing blisters and painful silver contact lenses she wore could only be kept in for four minutes at a time several of next generations recurring characters also appeared in film dwight schultz reprised his role of lieutenant reginald barclay and patti yasutake briefly appeared as nurse alyssa ogawa nemecek 322 whoopi goldberg was not asked to return as guinan a wise bartender whose homeworld was destroyed by borg goldberg only learned about decision through newspapers what can i say i wanted to do it because i didn t think you could do anything about borg without my character she said but apparently you can so they don t need me michael horton appears as a bloodied and stoic starfleet security officer his character would be given name lt daniels in next star trek film neal mcdonough plays lt hawk enterprise helmsman who aids in defense of ship until he is assimilated and killed mcdonough was cavalier about his role as a disposable redshirt saying that since one of characters in deflector dish battle had to die that would be me kaplan 30 third draft of script added cameos by two actors from sister television series star trek voyager which was in its third season when film was released robert picardo appears as enterprises emergency medical hologram picardo played holographic doctor in voyager he won cameo after suggesting to producers that enterprise should have same technology as voyager picardo s line i m a doctor not a door stop is an allusion to star trek original series character dr leonard mccoy picardo s fellow voyager actor ethan phillips who played neelix cameos as a nightclub maitre d in holodeck scene phillips recalled that producers wanted fans to be left guessing whether he was person who played neelix or not as he did not appear in credits it was just kind of a goofy thing to do during production there were incorrect rumors that avery brooks would reprise his role as star trek deep space nine captain benjamin sisko as with many star trek productions new disposable redshirt characters are killed off over course of plot frakes production development in february 1995 two months after release of star trek generations paramount decided to produce another star trek feature for a winter holiday 1996 release paramount wanted writers brannon braga and ronald d moore who had written generations script and a number of next generation episodes to pen screenplay braga moore producer rick berman told braga and moore that he wanted them to think about doing a story involving time travel braga and moore meanwhile wanted to use borg right on spot we said maybe we can do both borg and time travel moore recalled borg had not been seen in full force since fourth season episode of next generation best of both worlds and had never been heavily featured in series due to budget constraints and fear that they would lose their scare factor borg were really liked by fans and we liked them moore said they were fearsome they were unstoppable perfect foils for a feature story in deciding to combine two story ideas writers decided that time travel element could play out as borg attempt to prevent humanity from ever reaching space and becoming a threat our goals at that point were to create a story that was wonderful and a script that was within budget confines of a star trek film said berman kaplan 17 one major question was identifying time period to which borg would travel berman s suggestion was renaissance borg would attempt to prevent dawn of modern european civilization first story draft titled star trek renaissance had crew of enterprise track borg to their hive in a castle dungeon film would have featured sword fights alongside phasers in 15th century europe while data became leonardo da vinci s apprentice moore was afraid that it risked becoming campy and over top while stewart refused to wear tights braga meanwhile wanted to see birth of star trek when vulcans and humans first met that to me is what made time travel story fresh he said with idea of star treks genesis in mind central story became cochrane s warp drive test and humanity s first contact drawing on clues from previous star trek episodes cochrane was placed in mid 21st century montana where humans recover from a devastating world war in first script with this setting borg attack cochrane s lab leaving scientist comatose picard assumes cochrane s place to continue warp test and restore history in this draft picard has a love interest in local photographer ruby while riker leads fight against borg on enterprise nemecek 323 another draft included john de lancie s omnipotent character q looking at early scripts trio knew that serious work was needed it just didn t make sense that picard one guy who has a history with borg never meets them braga recalled riker and picard s roles were swapped and story was shortened and told differently braga and moore focused new arc on cochrane himself making ideal future of star trek come from a flawed man idea of borg fighting among period costumes coalesced into a dixon hill holographic novel sequence on holodeck second draft titled star trek resurrection was judged complete enough that production team used it to plan expenses film was given a budget of 45 million considerably more than generations 35 million price tag this allowed production to plan a larger amount of action and special effects alt bearded man in a black jacket gesturing while talking into a microphone left thumb having directed several episodes of star trek next generation jonathan frakes made his feature film directorial debut with first contact braga and moore intended film to be easily accessible to any moviegoer and work as a stand alone story yet still satisfy devoted star trek fans since much of picard s role made a direct reference to his time as a borg in next generation episodes best of both worlds opening dream sequence was added to explain what happened to him in show pair discarded an opening which would have established what main characters had been doing since last film in favor of quickly setting story kaplan 20 while writers tried to preserve idea of borg as a mindless collective in original draft paramount head jonathan dolgen felt that script was not dramatic enough he suggested adding an individual borg villain with whom characters could interact which led to creation of borg queen cast member frakes was chosen to direct frakes had not been first choice for director ridley scott and john mctiernan reportedly turned down project stewart met a potential candidate and concluded that they didn t know star trek it was decided to stay with someone who understood gestalt of star trek and frakes was given job frakes reported to work every day at 6 30 am a major concern during production was security script to generations had been leaked online and stronger measures were taken to prevent a similar occurrence some script pages were distributed on red paper to foil attempted photocopies or faxes we had real trouble reading them frakes noted frakes had directed multiple episodes of next generation deep space nine and voyager but first contact was his first feature film whereas frakes had seven days of preparation followed by seven days of shooting for a given television episode director was given a ten week preparation period before twelve weeks of filming and had to get used to shooting for a 2 35 1 anamorphic ratio instead of television standard 1 33 1 thompson 60 in preparation he watched jaws close encounters of third kind 2001 a space odyssey and works of james cameron and ridley scott throughout multiple script revisions a number of titles were considered including star trek borg star trek destinies star trek future generations and star trek generations ii planned title of resurrection was scrapped when fox announced title of fourth alien film film was rebranded first contact on may 3 1996 design alt a spaceship glides out of a vibrant multicolored nebula ship is composed of a saucer shaped primary hull connected to a thicker secondary hull paired glowing engines are attached to secondary hull via swept back struts thumb new sovereign class enterprise e was designed to be sleeker than its predecessor ship was last element added to above scene computer generated nebula background was built first with starship composited in later first contact was first star trek film to make significant use of computer generated starship models though physical miniatures were still used for most important vessels with enterprise d destroyed during events of generations task of creating a new starship fell to veteran star trek production designer herman zimmerman script s only guide on appearance of vessel was line new enterprise sleekly comes out of nebula working with illustrator john eaves designers conceived new sovereign class enterprise e as leaner sleeker and mean enough to answer any borg threat you can imagine braga and moore intended it to be more muscular and eaves looked at structure of previous enterprise iterations and designed a more streamlined capable war vessel than enterprise d reducing neck area of ship and lengthening nacelles eaves produced 30 to 40 sketches before he found a final design he liked and began making minor changes working from blueprints created by paramount s rick sternbach model shop at effects house industrial light magic ilm fabricated a miniature over a five month period hull patterns were carved out of wood then cast and assembled over an aluminum armature model s panels were painted in an alternating matte and gloss scheme to add texture magid 68 crew had multiple difficulties in prepping miniature for filming while model shop originally wanted to save time by casting windows using a clear fiberglass material came out tacky ilm instead cut windows using a laser slides of sets were added behind window frames to make interior seem more dimensional when camera tracked past ship in previous films starfleet s range of capital ships had been predominantly represented by constitution class enterprise and just five other ship classes miranda class from star trek ii wrath of khan represented by uss reliant excelsior and oberth class grissom from star trek iii search for spock and galaxy and nebula classes from next generation ilm supervisor john knoll insisted that first contacts space battle prove breadth of starfleet s ship configurations starfleet would probably throw everything it could at borg including ships we ve never seen before he reasoned and since we figured a lot of background action in space battle would need to be done with computer generated ships that needed to be built from scratch anyway i realized there was no reason not to do some new designs alex jaeger was appointed visual effects art director to film and assigned task of creating four new starships paramount wanted ships that would look different from a distance so director devised multiple hull profiles knoll and jaeger had decided that ships had to obey certain star trek ship precedents with a saucer like primary hull and elongated warp nacelles in pairs kaplan 23 akira class featured traditional saucer section and nacelles combined with a catamaran style double hull norway class was based on uss voyager saber class was a smaller ship with nacelles trailing off tips of its saucer section and class featured twin nacelles trailing off saucer and connected by an engineering section in rear each design was modeled as a three dimensional digital wire frame model for use in film magid 70 film also required a number of smaller non starfleet designs warp ship phoenix was conceived as fitting inside an old nuclear missile meaning that ship s nacelles had to fold into a space of less than eaves made sure to emphasize mechanical aspect of ship to suggest it was a highly experimental and untested technology phoenixs cockpit labels came from mcdonnell douglas space shuttle manuals eaves considered vulcan ship a fun vessel to design only two major vulcan ships had been previously seen in star trek including a courier vessel from motion picture since two engine ship format had been seen many times artists decided to step away from traditional ship layout creating a more artistic than functional design ship incorporated elements of a starfish and a crab because of budget constraints full ship was realized as a computer generated design only a boomerang shaped landing foot was fabricated for actors to interact with eaves enterprise interior sets were mostly new designs bridge was designed to be comfortable looking with warm colors among new additions was a larger holographic viewscreen that would operate only when activated leaving a plain wall when disabled new flatscreen computer monitors were used for displays using less space and giving bridge a cleaner look new monitors also allowed for video playback that could simulate interaction with actors nemecek 332 designers created a larger and less spartan ready room retaining elements from television series zimmerman added a set of golden three dimensional enterprise models to a glass case in corner observation lounge was similar to design in enterprise d set itself was re used from television show only such set not to be struck following filming of generations though it was expanded and underwent a color change engineering was simulated with a large three story set corridors a lobby and largest warp core in franchise to date for its borg corrupted state engineering section was outfitted with borg drone alcoves conduits and data s assimilation table where he is interrogated by queen okuda some existing sets were used to save money sickbay was a redress of same location from voyager while uss defiant scenes used deep space nines standing set nemecek 324 some set designs took inspiration from alien film series star wars and 2001 a space odyssey spacewalk scene on enterprise exterior was one of most challenging sets to envision and construct for film production had to design a space suit that looked practical rather than exaggerated fans were built into helmets so that actors would not get overheated and neon lights built into front so that occupant s faces could be seen when actors first put helmets on fully enclosed design made it hard to breathe after a minute of wearing suit stewart became ill and shooting was discontinued nemecek 330 set for ship s outer hull and deflector dish were built on gimbals at paramount s largest sound stage magid 72 surrounded by bluescreen and rigged with wires for zero gravity sequences stage was not large enough to accommodate a full sized replica of enterprise dish so zimmerman had to scale down plans by 15 percent costumes and makeup starfleet uniforms were redesigned for film by longtime star trek costumer bob blackman to give a more militaristic feel with grey padded shoulders and colored undershirts since blackman was also handling costumes for television series non starfleet design clothes were delegated to deborah everton nemecek 325 a newcomer to star trek who was responsible for more than 800 costumes during production kaplan 28 everton was tasked with updating borg s costumes to something new but reminiscent of television series bulky suits were made sleeker and outfitted with fiber optic lights kaplan 24 time travel aspect of story also required period costumes for mid 21st century and 1940s dixon hill nightclub holodeck recreation everton enjoyed designing woodard s costumes because character went through many changes during course of film switching from a utilitarian vest and pants in many shots to a glamorous dress during holodeck scene everton and makeup designers michael westmore scott wheeler and jake garber wanted to upgrade pasty white look borg had retained since next generations second season born out of a need for budget conscious television design i wanted it to look like they were assimilated or borgified from inside out rather than outside in everton said each borg had a slightly different design and westmore designed a new one each day to make it appear that there was an army of borg in reality between eight and twelve actors filled all roles as costumes and makeup were so expensive to produce background borg were simulated by half finished mannequins westmore reasoned that since borg had traveled galaxy they would have assimilated other races besides humans in television series much of borg s faces had been covered by helmets but for first contact makeup artist removed head coverings and designed assimilated versions of familiar star trek aliens such as klingons romulans bajorans and cardassians each drone received an electronic eyepiece blinking lights in each eye were programmed by westmore s son to repeat a production member s name in morse code makeup time for borg expanded from single hour needed for television to five hours in addition to 30 minutes necessary to get into costume and 90 minutes to remove makeup at end of day while westmore estimated that a fully staffed production would have around 50 makeup artists first contact had to make do with fewer than ten people involved in preparation and at most 20 artists a day despite long hours westmore s teams began to be more creative with prosthetics even as they decreased their preparation times they were using two tubes and then they were using three tubes and then they were sticking tubes in ears and up nose westmore explained and we were using a very gooey caramel coloring maybe using a little bit of it but by time we got to end of movie we had stuff dripping down side of borg s faces it looked like they were leaking oil so at very end of film they re more ferocious borg queen was a challenge because she had to be unique among borg but still retain human qualities westmore was conscious of avoiding comparisons to films like alien final appearance involved pale gray skin and an elongated oval head with coils of wire rather than hair krige recalled first day she had her makeup applied i saw everyone cringing i thought great they made this and they ve scared themselves frakes noted that queen ended up being alluring in a disturbing way despite her evil behavior and appearance zimmerman everton and westmore combined their efforts to design and create borgified sections of enterprise to build tension and to make audience feel that they are being fed borg filming principal photography took a more leisurely pace than on next generation because of a less hectic schedule only four pages of script had to be filmed each day as opposed to eight on television series first contact saw introduction of cinematographer matthew f leonetti to star trek franchise frakes hired him out of admiration for some of his previous work on films such as poltergeist and strange days leonetti was unfamiliar with star trek mythos when frakes approached him to prepare for assignment he studied previous four films in franchise each with a different cinematographer voyage home donald peterman final frontier andrew laszlo undiscovered country hiro narita and generations john alonzo cameraman also spent several days at sets of voyager and deep space nine to observe filming leonetti devised multiple lighting methods for enterprise interiors for ship standard operations red alert status and emergency power he reasoned that since ship was being taken over by a foreign entity it required more dramatic lighting and framing while much of footage was shot at 50 70 mm focal lengths using anamorphic lenses 14 mm spherical lenses were used for borg s eye view shots leonetti preferred shooting with long lenses to provide a more claustrophobic feel but made sure length did not flatten image handheld cameras were used for battle sequences so that viewers were brought into action and camera could follow movements of actors thompson 61 borg scenes were received positively by test screening audiences so once rest of film had been completed a borg assimilation scene of enterprise crew was added in using some of money left in budget to add action thumb right a fiberglass capsule was fitted over this decommissioned missile to convert it into cochrane s phoenix alt view looking down a textured metal cylindrical enclosure inside sits a long thin missile that is cylindrical in shape with a conical nose since so many new sets had to be created production commenced filming with location photography four days were spent in titan missile museum south of tucson arizona disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a fiberglass capsule shell to stand in for phoenixs booster and command module old missile silo provided a large set that budget would have prohibited building from scratch but small size created difficulties each camera move was planned in advance to work around areas where lighting would be added and electricians and grips donned rock climbing harnesses to move down shaft and attach lights to give greater dimension to rocket and lend missile a futuristic appearance leonetti chose to offset missile s metallic surface with complementary colors using different colored gels made rocket appear longer than it actually was to complete effect shots from phoenixs nose downwards and from engines up were filmed with a 30 mm lens to lengthen missile thompson 64 after completion of phoenix shots crew moved to two weeks of nighttime shooting in angeles national forest zimmerman created a village of fourteen huts to stand in for montana cast enjoyed scenes as a chance to escape their uniforms and wear normal clothes last location shoot was at an art deco restaurant in los angeles union station which stood in for dixon hill holonovel frakes wanted a sharp contrast with dark mechanical borg scenes while cinematographer wanted to shoot scene in black and white paramount executives deemed test footage too experimental and idea was dropped site made using high wattage lights impractical so leonetti opted to use dimmer master lights near ceiling and took advantage of a large window to shine diffused lights through to give scene a black and white feel leonetti made sure to use light without any coloration i like creating separation with lighting as opposed to using color he explained you can t always rely on color because actor might start to melt into background by separating leonetti made sure that principal actors stood out of backdrop thompson 66 shoot used a ten piece orchestra 15 stuntmen and 120 extras to fill seats nemecek 329 among nightclub patrons were braga moore and film s stunt coordinator ronnie rondell after location shooting was completed shooting on new engineering set began may 3 set lasted less than a day in its pristine condition before it was borgified filming then proceeded to bridge during normal operation scenes leonetti chose to cast on principals this required ceiling of set to be removed and lighting grids to be situated around sides these lights were then directed towards actors faces at 90 degree angles set was lined with window paneling backed by red lights which would blink intermittently during red alert status these lights were supplemented by what leonetti called interactive light these were off stage red gelled lights that cast flashing rims on bridge set and heads of crew for borg intrusion lighting originated solely from instrument panels and red alert displays fill light on these scenes was reduced so that cast would pass through dark spots on bridge and interiors out of limited range of these sources small 30 and 50 watt lights were used to throw localized shafts of light onto sets next came action sequences and battle for enterprise a phase filmmakers dubbed borg hell frakes directed borg scenes similar to a horror film creating as much suspense as possible to balance these elements he added more comedic elements to earth scenes intended to momentarily relieve audience of tension before building it up again leonetti reconfigured lighting to reflect takeover of ship interiors when ship gets borgified everything is changed into more of a squared off robotic look with sharp edges but rounded images he explained to give corridor walls more shape leonetti lit them from underneath since halls were so small and ceilings would be visible in many of shots special attention was paid to hiding light fixtures for live action spacewalk scenes visual effects supervisor ronald b moore spent two weeks of bluescreen photography at deflector set frakes regarded filming scene to be most tedious in film because of amount of preparation it took for each day s shoot since rest of enterprise e as well as backdrop of earth were to be added later in post production it became confusing to coordinate shots moore used a laptop with digital reproductions of set to orient crew and help frakes understand what finished shot would look like a one armed actor portrayed borg whose arm worf slices off to accurately portray effect intended and actors shoes were fitted with lead weights to remind actors they were to move slowly as if actually wearing gravity boots mcdonough recalled that he joined stewart and dorn in asking whether they could do shots without weights as they hired us because we are actors but production insisted on using them last scene filmed was film s first picard s borg nightmare one camera shot begins inside iris of picard s eyeball and pulls back to reveal captain aboard a massive borg ship shot continues to pull back and reveal exterior of a borg ship scene was inspired by a new york city production of sweeney todd demon barber of fleet street in which stage surrounded audience giving a sense of realism shot was filmed as three separate elements merged with digital effects crew used a 50 mm lens to make it easier for effects team to dissolve closeup shots with other elements starting from stewart s eye camera pulled back requiring key light to increase in intensity up to 1000 so that there was enough depth to keep eye sharp surface of stage proved too uneven to accomplish smooth dolly pullback required by effects team who needed a steady shot to blend a computer generated version of picard s eye with pullback dolly track was raised off stage floor and layered with pieces of double thick birch plywood chosen for its smooth finish entire set for scene was wide and high gaps left by dolly reveal were filled in later digitally thompson 62 principal photography finished on july 2 1996 two days over schedule but still under budget shooting took a total of sixty days effects majority of first contacts effects were handled by industrial light magic under direction of john knoll smaller effects sequences such as phaser fire computer graphics and transporter effects were delegated to a team led by visual effects supervisor david accustomed to directing episodes for television series frakes was frequently reminded by effects artist terry frazee to think big blow everything up most of effects sequences were planned using low resolution computer generated animatics these rough animated storyboards established length action and composition allowing producers and director to ascertain how sequences would play out before they were shot first contact was last film to feature a physical model of enterprise for ship s dramatic introduction effects team combined motion control shots of enterprise model with a computer generated background sequence supervisor dennis turner who had created generations energy ribbon and specialized in creating natural phenomena was charged with creating star cluster modeled after eagle nebula nebular columns and solid areas were modeled with basic wireframe geometry with surface shaders applied to make edges of nebula glow a particle render that ilm had devised for earlier tornado film twister was used to create a turbulent look within nebula once shots of enterprise had been captured turner inserted ship into computer generated background and altered its position until images matched up magid 69 opening beauty pass of new enterprise was responsibility of visual effects cinematographer marty rosenberg who handled all other miniatures explosions and some live action bluescreen elements rosenberg had previously shot some of enterprise d effects for generations but had to adjust his techniques for new model cinematographer used a 50 mm lens instead of 35 mm used for generations because smaller lens made new enterprises dish appear stretched out knoll decided to shoot model from above and below as much as possible side views made ship appear too flat and elongated rosenberg preferred motion control passes of ships over computer generated versions as it was much easier to capture a high level of detail with physical models rather than trying to recreate it by computer graphics for borg battle knoll insisted on closeup shots that were near alien vessel necessitating a physical model ilm layered their model with an additional five inches of etched brass over a glowing neon lightbox for internal illumination to make borg vessel appear even larger than it was knoll made sure that an edge of it was facing camera like prow of a ship and that cube broke edges of frame to give cube greater depth and texture rosenberg shot vessel with harsher light i created this really odd raking three quarter backlight coming from right or left side which i balanced out with nets and a couple of little lights i wanted it to look scary and mysterious so it was lit like a point and we always had camera to it we never just had it coming straight at us he said small lights attached to cube s surface helped to create visual interest and convey scale model was deliberately shot with a slow determined pacing to contrast with federation ships engaged in battle with borg impact of federation weaponry on borg cube was simulated using a model of cube model had specific areas which could be blown up multiple times without damaging miniature for final explosion of cube rosenberg shot ten cube miniatures with explosive packed lightweight skins cubes were suspended from pipes sixty feet above camera on ground safety glass was placed over lens to prevent damage while camera was covered with plywood to protect it from bits of plastic that rained down after each explosion smaller borg sphere was a model that was shot separately from cube and digitally added in post production time travel vortex sphere creates was simulated with a rocket re entry effect forms in front of ship then streams backwards at high speed interactive lighting was played across computer generated enterprise model for when ship is caught in time vortex miniature enterprise was again used for spacewalk sequence even on large model it was hard to make miniature appear realistic in extreme close up shots to make pullback shot work camera had to be within one eighth of an inch from model painter kim smith spent several days on a tiny area of model to add enough surface detail for close up but even then focus was barely adequate to compensate crew used a

head a mechanical spine hangs from rest of her upper body right lowering of borg queen s head into her body took ilm five months to produce frakes considered entrance of borg queen when her head shoulders and steel spine are lowered by cables and attached to her body as signature visual effect in film scene was difficult to execute taking ilm five months to finish jaeger devised a rig that would lower actress on set and applied a prosthetic spine over a blue suit so that ilm could remove krige s lower body this strategy enabled filmmakers to incorporate as many live action elements as possible without resorting to further digital effects to make prosthetics appear at proper angle when her lower body was removed krige extended her neck forward so it appeared in line with spine knoll did not want it to seem that queen was on a hard mechanical rig we wanted her to have appropriate float he explained using separate motion control passes on set knoll shot lower of upper torso and secondary sequence with krige s entire body a digital version of borg body suit was used for lowering sequence at which point image was morphed back to real shot of krige s body animated claws of suit were created digitally as well using a detailed model as reference to animators shot required krige to realistically portray strange pain or satisfaction of being reconnected to her body music film composer jerry goldsmith scored first contact his third star trek feature goldsmith wrote a sweeping main title which begins with alexander courage s star trek fanfare instead of composing a menacing theme to underscore borg goldsmith wrote a pastoral theme linked to humanity s hopeful first contact theme uses a four note motif used in goldsmith s star trek v final frontier score which is used in first contact as a friendship theme and general thematic link bond 156 a menacing march with touches of synthesizers was used to represent borg in addition to composing new music goldsmith used music from his previous star trek scores including his theme from motion picture norman klingon theme from same film is used to represent worf because of delays with paramount s ghost and darkness already short four week production schedule was cut to just three weeks while berman was concerned about move bond 158 goldsmith hired his son joel to assist bond 155 young composer provided additional music for film writing three cues based on his father s and a total of 22 minutes of music joel used variations of his father s borg music and klingon theme as worf fights hand to hand joel said that he and his father decided to use theme for worf separately when borg invade sickbay and medical hologram distracts them joel wrote what critic jeff bond termed almost material of tuning strings and clarinet but cue was unused while joel composed many of film s action cues his father contributed to spacewalk and phoenix flight sequences during fight on deflector dish goldsmith used low register electronics punctuated by stabs of violent dissonant strings in a break with star trek film tradition soundtrack incorporated two licensed songs roy orbison s ooby dooby and steppenwolf s magic carpet

contact limited edition complete motion picture score gnp crescendo records retrieved august 21 2013 themes frakes believes that main themes of first contact and star trek as a whole are loyalty friendship honesty and mutual respect this is evident in film when picard chooses to rescue data rather than evacuate ship with rest of crew film makes a direct comparison between picard s hatred of borg and refusal to destroy enterprise and that of captain ahab in herman melville s novel moby dick moment marks a turning point in film as picard changes his mind symbolized by his putting down his phaser a similar moby dick reference was made in star trek ii wrath of khan and although braga and moore did not want to repeat it they decided it worked so well they could not leave it out in first contact individually inscrutable and faceless borg fulfill role of similarly unreadable whale in melville s work picard like ahab has been hurt by his nemesis and author elizabeth hinds said it makes sense that picard should opt for perverse alternative of remaining on board ship to fight borg rather than take only sensible option left to destroy ship several lines in film refer to 21st century dwellers being primitive with people of 24th century having evolved to a more utopian society in end it is lily 21st century woman who shows picard 24th century man that his quest for revenge is primitive behavior that humans had evolved to not use lily s words cause picard to reconsider and he quotes ahab s words of vengeance recognizing death wish embedded therein nature of borg specifically as seen in first contact has been subject of critical discussion author joanna zylinska notes that while other alien species are tolerated by humanity in star trek borg are viewed differently because of their cybernetic alterations and loss of personal freedom and autonomy members of crew who are assimilated into collective are subsequently viewed as polluted by technology and less than human zylinska draws comparisons between technological distinction of humanity and machine in star trek and work of artists such as oliver drew parallels between borg s combination of many into an artificial one and thomas hobbes s concept of leviathan nature of perilous first contact between species as represented by films such as independence day aliens and first contact is a marriage of classic fears of national invasion and loss of personal identity release 1996 marked 30th anniversary of star trek franchise first contact was heavily marketed to an extent not seen since release of star trek motion picture in 1979 several novelizations of film were written for different age groups playmates toys produced six and nine inch action figures in addition to ship models and a phaser

gilbey of independent considered film wise to dispense with cast of original series for first time a star trek movie actually looks like something more ambitious than an extended tv show he wrote conversely critic bob thompson felt that first contact was more in spirit of 1960s television series than any previous installment globe and mail elizabeth said that first contact succeeded in improving on stilted previous entry in series and that it featured a renewed interest in storytelling kenneth turan of los angeles times wrote first contact does everything you d want a star trek film to do and it does it with cheerfulness and style adrian martin of age noted that film was geared towards pleasing fans strangers to this fanciful world first delineated by gene roddenberry will just have to struggle to comprehend as best they can he wrote but cult followers will be in heaven new york times janet maslin said that film s convoluted plot will boggle all but hard core devotees of series while variety joe leydon wrote that film did not require intimate knowledge of series and that fans and non fans alike would enjoy film while renzetti considered lack of old characters from previous seven movies a welcome change maslin said that without original stars series now lacks much of its earlier determination it has morphed into something less innocent and more derivative than it used to be something is ever less likely to enjoy conversely roger ebert called first contact one of best star trek films and james berardinelli found film most entertaining star trek feature in a decade it has single handedly revived star trek movie series at least from a creative point of view he wrote film s acting met with mixed reception lisa schwarzbaum of entertainment weekly appreciated that guest stars woodard and cromwell were used in inventive contrast to their better known images as a serious dramatic actress and dancing farmer in babe respectively lloyd rose of washington post felt that while woodard and cromwell managed to take care of themselves frakes direction of other actors was not inspired steve persall of st petersburg times opined that only cromwell received a choice role in film so he steals show by default a couple of reviews noted that data s interactions with borg queen were among most interesting parts of film critic john griffin credited spiner s work as providing ambivalent frisson to feature empire magazine s adam smith wrote that some characters particularly troi and crusher were lost or ignored and that rapid pacing of film left no time for those unfamiliar with series to know or care about characters likewise emily carlisle of bbc praised woodard s spiner s and stewart s performances but felt film focused more on action than characterization stewart whom thompson and renzetti considered overshadowed by william shatner in previous film received praise from richard corliss of time as patrick stewart delivers a line with a majestic ferocity worthy of a royal shakespeare company alumnus audience gapes in awe at a special effect more imposing than any ilm digital doodle here is real acting in a star trek film special effects were generally praised jay carr of boston globe said that first contact successfully updated star trek creator gene roddenberry s concept with more elaborate effects and action thompson s assessment mirrored carr s he agreed that film managed to convey much of original 1960s television show and contained enough special effects wonders and interstellar gunplay to sate all types of viewers ebert wrote that while previous films had often looked clunky in effects department first contact benefited from latest in effects technology a dissenting opinion was offered by scott who wrote that aside from key effects sequences frakes aims to distract trekkers from distinctly cheap looking remainder critics reacted favorably to borg describing them as akin to creatures from hellraiser renzetti credited them with breathing new life into crew of enterprise while simultaneously trying to kill them borg queen received special attention for her combination of horror and seduction ebert wrote that while queen looks like no notion of sexy i have ever heard of he was inspired to keep an open mind carr said she proves that women with filmy blue skin lots of external tubing and bad teeth can be sleekly seductive accolades 20 awardsbest makeupmichael westmorescott wheelerjake awardsbest makeupmichael westmorescott wheelerjake circuit community awardsbest visual
