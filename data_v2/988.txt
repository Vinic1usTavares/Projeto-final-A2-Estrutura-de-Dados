egardus alternatively engardus or johannes echgaerd was a european composer of music in late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries almost no information survives about his life and only three of his works are known a certain johannes ecghaerd who held chaplaincies in bruges and diksmuide may be a possible match for egardus extant works a canon and two appear to be less complex than music by mid century composers possibly because they date from either very early or very late in egardus career biography thumb 220 px a 1735 engraving of st donatian s cathedral in bruges as it appeared about 270 years after johannes ecghaerd was appointed succentor in 1370 little is known with certainty about his life enigma of his biography stems from a difficulty in knowing whether he was flemish or italian a northern origin is suggested by his name a copy of one of his works in a flemish manuscript and a possible citation of his music by thomas fabri but with only one other exception all of his works are found in northern italian manuscripts and that exception a polish manuscript has strong italian connections cuthbert pp 170 71 most important biographical research on composer was conducted by reinhard strohm who notes that it was more common for northern works and composers to travel to italy than opposite strohm p 43 strohm identifies a magister johannes ecghaerd appointed as succentor of st donatian s cathedral sint in bruges in 1370 as a possible match for composer this appointment suggests to strohm that echgaerd would have been born by or before 1340 strohm pp 44 45 strohm also finds connections to a work by thomas fabri a dutch composer in text of furnos reliquisti an unlikely coincidence if they were not working in close proximity to each other johannes egardus held

that egardus s music is less complex than other mid century composers but this lack of complexity can either be attributed to an early date for its composition contemporaneous with philippe de vitry
