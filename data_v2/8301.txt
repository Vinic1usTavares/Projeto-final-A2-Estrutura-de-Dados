crater is deep depression south of summit mount baker lummi or also known as koma kulshan or simply kulshan is a active glaciated andesitic stratovolcano in cascade volcanic arc and north cascades of washington in united states mount baker has second most thermally active crater in cascade range after mount saint helens about due east of city of bellingham whatcom county mount baker is youngest volcano in mount baker volcanic field while volcanism has persisted here for some 1 5 million years current glaciated cone is likely no more than 140 000 years old and possibly no older than 80 90 000 years older volcanic edifices have mostly eroded away due to glaciation after mount rainier mount baker is most heavily glaciated of cascade range volcanoes volume of snow and ice on mount baker is greater than that of all other cascades volcanoes except rainier combined it is also one of snowiest places in world in 1999 mount baker ski area located to northeast set world record for recorded snowfall in a single season mt baker is third highest mountain in washington and fifth highest in cascade range if little tahoma peak a subpeak of mount rainier and a subpeak of mount shasta are not counted located in mount baker wilderness it is visible from much of greater victoria nanaimo and greater vancouver in british columbia and to south from seattle and on clear days tacoma in washington indigenous peoples have known mountain for thousands of years but first written record of mountain is from spanish explorer gonzalo lopez de haro who mapped it in 1790 as great mount carmel explorer george vancouver renamed mountain for 3rd lieutenant joseph baker of hms discovery who saw it on april 30 1792 history thumb align right mount baker from oak bay british columbia 1903 photo charles edward clarke mount baker was well known to indigenous peoples of pacific northwest indigenous names for mountain include koma kulshan or kulshan lummi white sentinel and puncture wound i e crater sam ik white mountain white sentinel and or in language of unidentified koma tribe in 1790 manuel quimper of spanish navy set sail from nootka a temporary settlement on vancouver island with orders to explore newly discovered strait of juan de fuca accompanying quimper was first pilot gonzalo lopez de haro who drew detailed charts during six week expedition although quimper s journal of voyage does not refer to mountain one of haro s manuscript charts includes a sketch of mount baker spanish named snowy volcano as it reminded them of white clad monks of carmelite monastery british explorer george vancouver left england a year later his mission was to survey northwest coast of america vancouver and his crew reached pacific northwest coast in 1792 while anchored in dungeness bay on south shore of strait of juan de fuca joseph baker made an observation of mount baker which vancouver recorded in his journal six years later official narrative of this voyage was published including first printed reference to mountain by mid 1850s mount baker was a well known feature on horizon to explorers and fur traders who traveled in puget sound region isaac i stevens first governor of washington territory wrote about mount baker in 1853 climbing history thumb left mount baker from frazier river albert bierstadt brooklyn museum first european ascent edmund thomas coleman an englishman who resided in victoria british columbia canada and a veteran of alps made first attempt to ascend mountain in 1866 he chose a route via skagit river but was forced to turn back when local native americans refused him passage later that same year coleman recruited whatcom county settlers edward eldridge john bennett and john tennant to aid him in his second attempt to scale mountain after approaching via north fork of nooksack river party navigated through what is now known as coleman glacier and ascended to within several hundred feet of summit before turning back in face of an overhanging cornice of ice and threatening weather coleman later returned to mountain after two years at 4 00 pm on august 17 1868 coleman eldridge tennant and two new companions david ogilvy and thomas stratton scaled summit via middle fork nooksack river marmot ridge coleman glacier and north margin of roman wall notable ascents 1948 north ridge ad ai 2 3 3700 feet fred beckey ralph and dick august 1948 geology right thumb upright 1 8 panorama from northwest showing lincoln and colfax peaks black buttes and mount baker present day cone of mount baker is relatively young it is perhaps less than 100 000 years old volcano sits atop a similar older volcanic cone called black buttes which was active between 500 000 and 300 000 years ago much of mount baker s earlier geological record eroded away during last ice age which culminated 15 000 20 000 years ago by thick ice sheets that filled valleys and surrounded volcano in last 14 000 years area around mountain has been largely ice free but mountain itself remains heavily covered with snow and ice isolated ridges of lava and hydrothermally altered rock especially in area of sherman crater are exposed between glaciers on upper flanks of volcano lower flanks are steep and heavily vegetated volcanic rocks of mount baker and black buttes rest on a foundation of non volcanic rocks left thumb park and rainbow glaciers on northeast flank deposits recording last 14 000 years at mount baker indicate that mount baker has not had highly explosive eruptions like those of other volcanoes in cascade volcanic arc such as mount st helens glacier peak or mount meager massif nor has it erupted frequently during this period four episodes of magmatic eruptive activity have been recently recognized magmatic eruptions have produced tephra pyroclastic flows and lava flows from summit vents and schriebers meadow cone most destructive and most frequent events at mount baker have been lahars or debris flows and debris avalanches many if not most of these were not related to magmatic eruptions but may have been induced by magma intrusion steam eruptions earthquakes gravitational instability or possibly even heavy rainfall eruptive history early history research beginning in late 1990s shows that mount baker is youngest of several volcanic centers in area and one of youngest volcanoes in cascade range pliocene hannegan caldera is preserved northeast of mount baker volcanic activity in mount baker volcanic field began more than one million years ago but many of earliest lava and tephra deposits have been removed by glacial erosion pale colored rocks northeast of modern volcano mark site of ancient 1 15 million years old kulshan caldera that collapsed after an enormous ash eruption one million years ago subsequently eruptions in mount baker area have produced cones and lava flows of andesite rock that constitutes much of other cascade range volcanoes such as rainier adams and hood from about 900 000 years ago to present numerous andesitic volcanic centers in area have come and disappeared through glacial erosion largest of these cones is black buttes edifice active between 500 000 and 300 000 years ago and formerly bigger than today s mount baker modern craters and cone thumb right sampling fumarole gas at sherman crater in 1981 mount baker was built from stacks of lava and volcanic breccia prior to end of last glacial period which ended about 15 000 years ago two craters are on mountain ice filled carmelo crater is under summit ice dome this crater is source for last cone building eruptions highest point of mount baker grant peak is on exposed southeast rim of carmelo crater which is a small pile of andesitic scoria lying on top of a stack of lava flows just below carmelo crater is deeply dissected on its south side by younger sherman crater this crater is south of summit and its ice covered floor is below summit ice dome this crater is site of all holocene eruptive activity hundreds of fumaroles vent gases primarily and thumb left view south into sherman crater from grant peak in 2004 sherman peak at left fumaroles of west rim at right lava flows from summit vent erupted between 30 000 and 10 000 years ago and during final stages of edifice construction blocky pyroclastic flows entered volcano s southeastern drainages an eruption from sherman crater 6 600 years ago erupted a blanket of ash that extended more than to east today sulfurous gases reach surface via two fumarole pathways dorr fumarole northeast of summit and sherman crater south of summit both are sites of hydrothermal alteration converting lavas to weak white to yellow clays sulfur is a common mineral around these fumaroles at sherman crater collapses of this weakened rock generated lahars in 1840s mazama park eruptive period 6 600 years ago around 6 600 years ago a series of discrete events culminated in largest tephra producing eruption in postglacial time at mount baker this is last episode of undoubted magmatic activity preserved in geologic record first largest collapse in history of volcano occurred from roman wall and transformed into a lahar that was over deep in upper reaches of middle fork of nooksack river it was at least deep downstream from volcano at that time nooksack river is believed to have drained north into fraser river this lahar is unlikely to have reached bellingham bay next a small hydrovolcanic eruption occurred at sherman crater triggering a second collapse of flank just east of roman wall that collapse also became a lahar that mainly followed course of first lahar for at least and also spilled into tributaries of baker river finally an eruption cloud deposited ash as far as downwind to northeast and east historical activity thumb left steam plume rising from sherman crater december 1999 telephoto taken from bellingham washington several eruptions occurred from sherman crater during 19th century they were witnessed from bellingham area a possible eruption was seen in june 1792 during spanish expedition of dionisio alcala galiano and cayetano valdes their report read in part thumb right mount baker looms over farms of samish river delta north of bay view washington in 1843 explorers reported a widespread layer of newly fallen rock fragments like a snowfall and that forest was on fire for miles around these fires were unlikely to have been caused by ashfall however as charred material is not found with deposits of this fine grained volcanic ash which was almost certainly cooled in atmosphere before falling rivers south of volcano were reportedly clogged with ash and native americans reported that many salmon perished reports of flooding on skagit river from eruption are however probably greatly exaggerated a short time later two collapses of east side of sherman crater produced two lahars first and larger of which flowed into natural baker lake increasing its level by at least location of 19th century lake is now covered by waters of modern dam impounded baker lake similar but lower level hydrovolcanic activity at sherman crater continued intermittently for several decades afterward on 26 november 1860 passengers who were traveling by steamer from new westminster to victoria reported that mount baker was puffing out large volumes of smoke which upon breaking rolled down snow covered sides of mountain forming a pleasing effect of light and shade in 1891 about of rock fell producing a lahar that traveled more than and covered retrieved 2009 03 31 thumb left easton glacier on south flank in 2003 superimposed black line indicates its extent in 1985 activity in 20th century decreased from 19th century numerous small debris avalanches fell from sherman peak and descended boulder glacier a large one occurred on july 27 2007 right thumb mount baker and boulder glacier as seen from southeast in early march 1975 a dramatic increase in fumarolic activity and snow melt in sherman crater area raised concern that an eruption might be imminent heat flow increased more than tenfold additional monitoring equipment was installed and several geophysical surveys were conducted to try to detect movement of magma increased thermal activity prompted public officials and puget power to temporarily close public access to popular baker lake recreation area and to lower reservoir s water level by if those actions had not been taken significant avalanches of debris from sherman crater area could have swept directly into reservoir triggering a disastrous wave that could have caused human fatalities and damage to reservoir other than increased heat flow few anomalies were recorded during geophysical surveys nor were any other precursory activities observed that would indicate that magma was moving up into volcano several small lahars formed from material ejected onto surrounding glaciers and acidic water was discharged into baker lake for many months activity gradually declined over next two years but stabilized at a higher level than before 1975 increased level of fumarolic activity has continued at mount baker since 1975 but no other changes suggest that magma movement is involved current research at mount baker a considerable amount of research has been done at mount baker over past decade and it is now among most studied of cascade volcanoes recent and ongoing projects include gravimetric and gps based geodetic monitoring fumarole gas sampling tephra distribution mapping new interpretations of schriebers meadow lava flow and hazards analyses mapping of carmelo and sherman craters and interpretations of eruptive history continue as well mount baker volcano research center maintains an online archive of abstracts of this work and an extensive
