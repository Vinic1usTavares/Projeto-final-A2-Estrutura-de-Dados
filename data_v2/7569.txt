panther class was a group of two torpedo cruisers and built for austro hungarian navy in 1880s ships primary armament was their four torpedo tubes though they also carried a battery of medium and light caliber guns ships were ordered in an effort to strengthen defensive capabilities of austro hungarian navy during a period where funding for more expensive ironclad warships could not be secured from parliament since austro hungarian naval designers did not have sufficient experience designing vessels of type navy ordered ships from british armstrong shipyard work took from late 1884 to early 1886 after arriving in austria hungary in 1886 two ships served in a variety of roles these included active duty with main fleet in home waters overseas training cruises and showing flag abroad during world war i cruisers were mobilized for coastal defense duties but saw no major action apart from panther shelling montenegrin forces in 1916 after war both vessels were surrendered to britain as war prizes and were broken up for scrap in 1920 design austro hungarian marinekommandant navy commander vizeadmiral vice admiral maximilian daublebsky von sterneck argued in a memorandum of 8 september 1884 addressed to kaiser franz joseph i fleet was too weak and must be expanded core of fleet ten ironclad warships were weak and out of date by international standards torpedo vessels were too few in number and too slow to be of use and wooden frigates and corvettes were useless as warships he acknowledged that government had failed to meet fleet plan that had been outlined by vadm wilhelm von tegetthoff in early 1870s owing to chronically short naval budgets approved by imperial council of austria and diet of hungary since new more powerful and thus more expensive ironclads could not be built sterneck made argument that cheaper defensive weapons should be acquired these included naval mines and more effective torpedo armed ships in memorandum he outlined requirements for a so called torpedo ram cruiser such a vessel should have a reinforced bow for ramming as well as torpedoes for attacks on larger warships cruisers would also be small and fast enough to undertake patrol and reconnaissance duties bilzer p 32 thumb left leopard underway sterneck suggested a ship of about with a speed of he also predicted that type would lead to development of larger vessels around armed with large caliber guns and protected only with deck armor these latter ships would be capable of engaging ironclads directly and would be much cheaper than traditional ironclads sterneck called for three of 1 500 ton cruisers to be built along with several other recommendations to strengthen fleet on 18 september franz joseph replied to sterneck authorizing him to proceed with his plans since fleet had no vessels of type and thus no experience designing cruisers to fit his requirements offers were extended to five british shipyards with only design requirements being a speed of at least an armament of guns on smallest possible displacement austro hungarian navy established a commission to examine designs submitted by british firms armstrong received contract in part because they could build ships more cheaply commission requested ventilation for boilers be improved and requested that armament consist of four deck mounted torpedo tubes two 12 cm guns and ten hotchkiss revolver cannon bilzer pp 32 33 naval architect siegfried popper was sent to britain to supervise construction of ships while vessels were under construction popper discovered that designers had made a serious error distributing weight of ships such that difference between forward and aft draft was to rectify problem armstrong made a series of proposals from simply adding of ballast to bow extending forecastle deck or replacing 12 cm guns with heavier guns all of these were rejected instead a series of smaller changes were made to correct trim which included adding of iron ballast increasing coal storage increasing thickness of conning tower walls lengthening forecastle slightly and shifting storage for pinnace and cutter forward bilzer pp 33 34 by acquiring foreign built ships austro hungarian navy would also gain experience building modern small cruisers in fact panther and leopard provided basis for follow on design which was a slightly enlarged version of earlier ships gardiner pp 277 p 87 they were originally classified as torpedo ships equivalent of a torpedo cruiser in other navies in 1903 they were reclassified as 3rd class cruisers then in 1909 as small cruisers kleine

long at waterline and long overall they had a beam of and a draft of normally and when fully loaded they displaced normally and up to at full load their crew numbered 13 officers and 165 men though this later increased to 198 gardiner p p 38 ships propulsion system consisted of a pair of two cylinder vertical compound steam engines steam was provided by six cylindrical fire tube boilers that were trunked into two funnels engines were rated at for a top speed of on trials panther reached a speed of from slightly slower than her sister ship which made from greger p 27 these speeds were achieved using forced draft running machinery normally resulted in a speed of during speed trials armstrong experimented with using smaller screws with lower pitch in an attempt to exceed but tests proved unsuccessful bilzer p 34 ships had a cruising radius of at a more economical speed of greger p 27 unlike earlier cruising ships of austro hungarian navy panther and did not carry a sailing rig to supplement their steam engines panther and leopard were armed with two 35 caliber cal guns manufactured by krupp in single mounts which were sponsoned abreast of funnels these were supported by a battery of four 47 mm quick firing guns and six 47 mm hotchkiss revolver cannon they were also armed with four torpedo tubes torpedo tubes were located singly in bow stern and at either beam in june 1909 panther was rearmed with four 45 cal guns and ten 47 mm qf guns along with her original torpedo tubes leopard was similarly reequipped following year panther class ships were protected with a

history thumb leopard date unknown after their crews arrived to take them back to austria hungary in early 1886 both vessels were taken into navy s shipyard in pola where their armament was installed over course of 1887 to include their torpedo tubes both ships took part in barcelona universal exposition which saw a squadron of ironclads and cruisers sent to represent austria hungary at opening ceremonies coincidentally both ships ran aground during training operations in late june 1888 two cruisers spent much of early 1890s laid up with panther being reactivated in 1896 for a major training cruise in pacific ocean from may 1896 to february 1898 and leopard returning to service in 1897 to participate in an international naval demonstration off island of crete during greco turkish war leopard went on a training cruise in pacific in 1900 1901 for naval cadets while panther spent those years in reserve latter went on a cruise to morocco in 1902 and to eastern africa in 1905 to arrange a trade treaty with ethiopia before embarking on another cruise in pacific in meantime leopard served with main austro hungarian fleet in home waters in mid 1900s bilzer pp 35 pp 107 185 leopard went on another tour of pacific in 1907 1909 and she was relieved in east asian waters by panther in april 1909 latter remaining there until november 1910 leopard was laid up from 1910 to 1913 during which time panther served as a station ship in trieste at outbreak of world war i in july 1914 both ships were assigned to coastal defense special group panther shelled montenegrin forces on mount lovcen overlooking naval base in cattaro bay in january 1916 supporting an offensive by austro hungarian army to take heights action ultimately forced montenegro out of war leopard was stationed in pola for duration of war greger p p pp 8 9 after austria hungary s defeat in november 1918 both ships were ceded as war prizes to victorious allies and britain received both vessels under terms of
