2 3rd machine gun battalion was formed in june 1940 as part of 7th division and served in egypt syria netherlands east indies and new guinea during world war ii under command of lieutenant colonel arthur blackburn when it was raised battalion was primarily a south australian unit although it had sub units formed in victoria tasmania and western australia after completing training in australia in april 1941 battalion embarked for middle east in june july 1941 it saw action against vichy french forces during syria lebanon campaign during which time battalion was heavily involved in supporting various elements of 7th division following japan s entry into war decision was made to transfer a large number of australian troops from middle east to pacific region in early 1942 as japanese advanced through netherlands east indies majority of battalion was captured during battle of java a small number of battalion s personnel returned to australia and it was subsequently re raised in mid 1942 it was later attached to 6th division as a corps unit and served in papua new guinea during aitape wewak campaign in 1944 1945 battalion was disbanded in january 1946 history formation and training 2 3rd machine gun battalion was one of four machine gun battalions that were raised as part of all volunteer second australian imperial force 2nd aif for service overseas during world war ii motorised infantry units equipped with wheeled motor vehicles motorcycles and sometimes tracked carriers machine gun battalions were formed to provide a greater level of support by fire than that which was organically available within ordinary infantry battalions at its peak 2 3rd was equipped with 124 motor vehicles of various descriptions and 50 motorcycles developed by british army concept within australian army had its genesis during gallipoli campaign in 1915 when machine guns assigned to infantry battalions initially two and then later four had been grouped together and co ordinated at brigade level to help compensate for lack of artillery support over course of war on western front concept had evolved through establishment of machine gun companies in 1916 and machine gun battalions in 1918 similar formations had also been established amongst australian light horse units serving in sinai and palestine campaign during inter war years machine gun battalions had been deemed unnecessary when army was reorganised in 1921 they were not re raised but in 1937 as army looked to expand as fears of war in europe loomed four such units were raised within part time militia by converting light horse units and motorising them when world war ii broke out decision was made to raise several machine gun battalions within 2nd aif allocated at a rate of one per division 2 3rd machine gun battalion was formed on 17 june 1940 in south australia upon formation battalion was commanded by lieutenant colonel arthur blackburn a world war i veteran who had received victoria cross for actions at pozieres designated a south australian battalion its personnel were nevertheless recruited from several australian states south australians predominated but there were also men from victoria tasmania and western australia with many of battalion s cadre staff of officers and senior non commissioned officers having served previously in militia with various light horse regiments and infantry battalions in common with other australian machine gun battalions colours chosen for battalion s unit colour patch ucp were black and gold these were presented in a triangular shape with a border of grey initially battalion was stretched across several locations with companies being formed in seymour victoria brighton tasmania and northam western australia tasmanians and western australians had initially been intended to join 2 2nd machine gun battalion and during its formative period companies completed basic training in their home locations before concentrating together at south australia with tasmanians sailing to melbourne to link up with victorians prior to entraining for journey west while western australians crossed nullarbor plain at this point unit s establishment was completed as battalion structure was finalised it was structured along same lines as other 2nd aif machine gun battalions which consisted of between 800 and 900 personnel organised into a headquarters element consisting of three platoons signals anti aircraft and administration and four machine gun companies each equipped with 12 vickers machine guns to make a total of 48 across entire battalion within machine gun companies there were three platoons these were numbered sequentially starting from 1 to 3 in headquarters company through to 13 to 15 in d company a light aid detachment of electrical and mechanical engineers was also attached fighting against vichy french palestine and syria right thumb 2 3rd machine gun battalion personnel set up a vickers machine gun during an exercise in syria october 1941 alt soldiers set up a machine gun in a wooded area in early april 1941 battalion less d company which travelled west for home leave entrained at oakbank near to woodside south australia where they had moved previous february from there battalion travelled overland to sydney where they embarked upon ss ile de france from pyrmont wharf bound for middle east as part of a large convoy of troopships sailing via fremantle where d company rejoined battalion they sailed on to colombo which was reached in late april where troopship put in for repairs and shore leave was given to all battalion personnel departing again in early may they continued on alone crossing red sea in a week and making landfall at port tewfik troops had to endure a two day wait before disembarkation whereupon they were taken to eastern side of suez canal by lighter and then transferred by train to kantara upon arrival in middle east 2 3rd was assigned to 7th division 2nd aif s second division and subsequently joined them in palestine establishing a camp at hill 95 to north of gaza there battalion undertook a vigorous physical training regime to regain fitness lost from sea voyage final elements of unit identity were issued at time and colour patches it also finally began to receive its vehicles and heavy equipment including its vickers machine guns as preparations were made for battalion to join fighting in western desert in end this did not eventuate as 7th division was committed to syria lebanon campaign in early june to secure allied eastern flank from attack due to presence of vichy french troops campaign was politically sensitive and as a result of heavy censorship not widely reported in australia at time nature of fighting where it was reported was also downplayed with vichy forces outnumbering allies and also being better equipped for 2 3rd campaign saw them heavily involved throughout short but sharply contested campaign with each of four machine gun companies supporting separate efforts by elements of 7th division and also british troops seeing action around metula quneitra sidon and damour before vichy french requested an armistice in mid july 2 3rd s casualties during campaign amounted to one officer and 41 other ranks killed or wounded in aftermath of campaign 2 3rd stayed on as part of allied occupation force established in syria and lebanon to defend against a possible drive south by axis forces through caucasus battalion defended a position north east of beirut around bikfaya initially but was moved around to various locations including aleppo on turkish border throughout remainder of 1941 they endured a bitter cold and snowy winter at fih near tripoli which was punctuated by leave drafts to tel aviv into action against japanese java and captivity in late 1941 japanese entered war attacking pearl harbor and launching an invasion of malaya faced with a threat closer to home australian government pressed for return of its troops from middle east and so in early 1942 7th division began withdrawing from their garrison posts in syria and lebanon 2 3rd left village of fih and moved to a camp at hill 69 in palestine on 14 january 1942 they remained there until 31 january when they boarded a train which took them to kantara where they were ferried across canal to continue journey to port tewfik where majority of battalion totalling 636 personnel of all ranks boarded troopship orcades men who were in hospital or on course were subsequently reposted to 2 2nd machine gun battalion and remained in middle east later seeing action at el alamein others who did not board orcades included battalion s b echelon essentially all its vehicles baggage and heavy weapons and its maintenance personnel these embarked on eight smaller vessels silver willow penrith castle shillong tarifa industria and tricolor these ships were to follow orcades up at its eventual destination which was at time still being kept secret even to troops on board orcades a fast transport capable of 26 knots set sail for colombo before even battalion s baggage could be brought on board on 8 february 1942 ship reached its intermediate destination from where it was escorted by cruiser hms dorsetshire as situation in pacific worsened for allies singapore had fallen in early february and japanese were steadily advancing through netherlands east indies allies made decision to hastily make a stand orcades reached oosthaven in sumatra on 15 february and troops from orcades were ferried ashore on tanker van where they were grouped together as boost force under orders to take up defence of palembang airfields and providing protection to civilians as they were evacuated missing many of their weapons troops were re equipped with rifles from armoury however shortly after their arrival they were ordered to re embark on tanker which eventually caught up with orcades and transferred its personnel for remainder of journey to batavia there fresh orders reached them units aboard orcades 2 2nd pioneers an engineer field company an anti aircraft regiment as well as transport and medical personnel were ordered to form an ad hoc force along with a squadron from british 3rd king s own hussars and an artillery battery from us 131st field artillery regiment this force under blackburn who was promoted to brigadier came to be known as blackforce with headquarters being established at batavia in blackburn s stead d company commander major edward lyneham was promoted to take over command of battalion thumb left alt soldiers move between military vehicles next to a building 2 3rd machine gun battalion personnel at plantation java blackburn established his force into a brigade formation utilising pioneers and machine gunners as infantry battalions and forming a third infantry battalion from troops that were assigned to garrison base as well as logistics and administrative personnel and members of aif who had been able to get out of singapore before it fell due to presence of a large amount of equipment on wharf which had been intended to be sent to singapore before its fall blackforce was able to re equip itself handsomely with vehicles including carriers and armoured cars bren guns thompson sub machine guns and mortars but there were no machine guns concentrating around civilian airport at battalion formed part of blackforce s defensive garrison tasked with protecting batavia s five airfields from japanese paratroopers b company was detached in this time to defend buitenzorg military airfield shortly afterwards they came under air attack from japanese mitsubishi a6m zeroes on 22 february during which one member of 2 3rd was killed while six others were wounded two of these wounded were later smuggled out of indies by medical personnel back to australia with one rejoining battalion there later in year as japanese began advancing further in indies blackburn sought to re orient his troops and machine gunners were subsequently moved to leuwiliang area west of buitenzorg along an expected main avenue of advance and they were given task for defence bridge over tjianten river following battle of java sea japanese were able to land a force around banten bay and marek on western tip of java and subsequently began advancing east towards batavia and buitenzorg forcing blackforce to itself east of tjianten river to make a stand south of buitenzorg on 3 march battalion went into action around leuwiliang for first time as dutch troops began to withdraw occupying positions in support of 2 2nd pioneers who held bridge over tjianten river they were alerted to advancing japanese by presence of fifth columnists who were seen to be laying out marking panels a short time later a force of five japanese light tanks attempted to cross river but were rebuffed by anti tank rifles and small arms plan had been for dutch troops to make a stand at djasinga but faulty intelligence resulted in a rout and dutch began to withdraw back to bandung flooding through blackforce s lines in ensuing chaos dutch engineers blew up bridge at tjianten river for next couple of days battalion fought several skirmishes with c company bearing brunt of japanese attacks suffering seven killed and 28 wounded while inflicting about 200 casualties on japanese as allied defence of island began to collapse machine gunners were ordered to hold up japanese around leuwiliang for a day after this blackforce began moving towards on 5 march as part of efforts to reach tjilatjap on southern coast of island to secure passage back to australia ultimately this never eventuated and blackforce was ordered to surrender on 9 march 1942 following dutch capitulation day before they would subsequently endure three and a half years in captivity as japanese prisoners of war being sent to camps across south east asia including infamous thai burma railway forced to endure brutal conditions over worked in labour camps and inadequately provided for casualties amongst these men were high re organisation and garrison duties in australia while troops who had boarded orcades went into captivity on java five officers and 257 other ranks that had been transported on eight smaller ships returned to australia in last week of march 1942 arriving at port adelaide battalion s vehicles weapons and heavy equipment was moved to morphettville racecourse and remaining personnel concentrated at sandy creek on 15 april 1942 order was passed to re form battalion under lieutenant colonel sidney reed battalion s original second in command reinforcements arrived from various locations including machine gun training battalion based at camden new south wales while others came from 2 1st machine gun battalion to provide a cadre of experienced personnel in may battalion moved to balcombe on mornington peninsula in victoria where they undertook range shoots planning exercises and in mid july 2 3rd received orders to move north to cowra by road along way they stopped at ingleburn new south wales where a draft of almost 400 reinforcements was received result of this was that in its second incarnation about half battalion came from new south wales instead of south australia battalion remained in cowra where they carried out training for ten months eventually proceeding north to south east queensland in may 1943 based around deception bay area north of brisbane a company was deployed to moreton island and another to bribie island in late june b company embarked upon dutch vessel ss and deployed to netherlands new guinea as part of merauke force remaining there in a defensive capacity until may 1944 while b company was deployed to merauke remainder of battalion moved to atherton tablelands in mid august 1943 at which time battalion was transferred to command of 6th division assigned as a corps unit rather than a direct command unit lieutenant colonel roy gordon who had raised original c company in 1940 took over command of battalion in february 1944 a long period of relative inactivity subsequently followed as a result of inter allied service politics which saw us army assume primacy of operations in pacific and indecision about future role of australian forces in pacific campaign during this time battalion was based around wondecla south west of cairns battalion was transferred to tropical war establishment during this period as part of an army wide reorganisation intended to optimise units for jungle warfare as a result of this change battalion was required to return all of its vehicles with intention that its guns would largely be carried across battlefield by soldiers moving on foot 2 3rd remained at wondecla until 2 december 1944 when they entrained for cairns and subsequently boarded transport evangeline a former cruise ship bound for new guinea where they were to undertake their final campaign of war aitape wewak final campaign thumb right alt aerial view of an amphibious beach landing farida force landing at dove bay may 1945 although it had been intended to deploy australians as part of allied efforts to recapture philippines this did not eventuate instead australian troops were tasked with relieving us forces around new guinea so that they could be redistributed in pacific 6th division was subsequently assigned to take over from us xi corps around aitape wewak campaign that followed was in words of author eustace keogh essentially a mopping up campaign with division being tasked with security of airstrip and base area and ensuring that contact was maintained with japanese forces in area these tasks were to be achieved without large scale offensive action due to contingency plans for division to be re deployed to philippines in event this did not occur and 6th division remained in aitape wewak for remainder of war with priority of effort being given to campaigns in philippines and borneo arrival of 6th division took place over several months initially they were camped around tadji defending airfield there but after christmas majority of battalion headquarters headquarters company and two machine gun companies was assigned to 19th brigade as they advanced west along coast towards switching to providing support to 16th brigade in early january as it drove towards abau in open country of coastal area machine guns proved quite effective while this took place b and d companies were assigned to 17th brigade with whom they undertook a mainly defensive role around aitape while accompanying infantry patrols into interior in february 1945 as australians began advancing into thick hilly interior utility of machine guns decreased at behest of brigadier roy king commander of 16th brigade 2 3rd machine gun battalion was hastily converted into a standard infantry battalion which was achieved with a quick issue of rifles sub machine guns and mortars from then until end of war battalion took part in ground advance through wewak and beyond fighting a series of small scale patrol actions initially advancing through and and finally town of but while b company was assigned to farida force and carried out an amphibious landing around dove bay in early may battalion later moved into mandi and brandi areas where they were tasked with re invigorating australian operations in area as japanese resistance around plantations increased by late july majority of battalion moved to wewak point while two companies remained in vicinity of mandi bandi operations in area had killed 59 japanese for loss of four men from 2 3rd killed in action and eight wounded battalion s final action of war came on 7 august when a patrol killed four japanese a week later japanese surrender was announced bringing combat operations officially to an end battalion s final campaign of war cost them 94 battle casualties disbandment in late august following conclusion of hostilities 2 3rd was concentrated at wewak point in 19th brigade s area where final parades were held and education classes commenced to prepare soldiers for discharge and return to civilian life meanwhile following conclusion of hostilities battalion s personnel were slowly transferred to other units or repatriated back to australia for demobilisation in early december 1945 2 3rd s remaining personnel returned to australia aboard british aircraft carrier hms implacable arriving in sydney and following month in january 1946 after final clearances had been obtained unit was disbanded during war battalion lost 202 men killed or died on active service of which 56 were killed in action 139 died while prisoners of war and seven in accidents or illness on active service members of battalion received following decorations one distinguished service order three military crosses four military medals one british empire medal and 21 mentions in despatches in addition one member was appointed as a commander of order of british empire and four were appointed as members of order of british empire thumb left alt medals being presented to soldiers on parade final parade at wewak point 2 october 1945 after war australian army moved away from machine gun battalion construct and consequently no similar units have been raised since with role being subsumed into support companies of individual infantry battalions concept was arguably misunderstood by australian commanders throughout war and this may have influenced decision to move away from concept when units had been established intent had been that machine gun battalions would provide highly mobile fire support however this was largely only applicable in theatres where principles of open warfare could be applied once focus of australian army combat operations shifted to pacific machine gun battalions were largely misused being employed in a static defensive capacity against short and medium range targets or for menial tasks rather than as offensive fire support weapons that could have been employed to provide long range fire support medium machine guns were also largely utilised in same manner as light machine guns such as bren other reasons identified for concept s limited use include distrust of overhead fire by some commanders a preference for organic fire support over attached sub units over estimating difficulty of transporting vickers guns in jungle and a tendency to ignore targets that could not be seen difficulties of target acquisition in dense jungle also contributed for 2 3rd syrian campaign was only one of its three campaigns where it was employed wholly as a machine gun unit in support of infantry on java and in aitape wewak it was utilised as infantry battle honours 2 3rd machine gun battalion
