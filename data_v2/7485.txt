suillus quiescens is a pored mushroom of genus suillus in family suillaceae first collected in 2002 on santa cruz island off coast of california in association with bishop pine pinus muricata species was scientifically described and named in 2010 in addition to its distribution in coastal california it was also found forming ectomycorrhizae with roots of pine seedlings in eastern sierra nevada coastal oregon and southern cascade mountains it resembles suillus brevipes but can be distinguished from that species by its paler colored immature cap and by tiny colored glands on stipe that darken with age discovery fruit bodies of fungus were first collected in 2002 on santa cruz island in santa barbara county they were named provisionally as a new species suillus quiescens in conference proceedings published in 2005 species was officially described and named in a 2010 mycologia publication specific epithet quiescens refers to organism s ability to wait dormant quiescent in soil until it encounters pine roots phylogeny based on phylogenetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer region in non functional rna of a number of suillus species s quiescens is distinct from other morphologically similar species such as s brevipes s and s occidentalis s quiescens sequences which were obtained from fruit bodies and from mycorrhizal root tips formed a clade analysis showed that s quiescens sequences were matches to some unidentified suillus sequences found from mycorrhizae of pine seedlings collected from oregon and california description thumb right suillus quiescens resembles s brevipes shown here cap ranges in shape from hemispheric to broadly convex and has a diameter of cap color is deep brown in mature specimens and lighter shades of brown in younger mushrooms young specimens have a sticky layer of gluten on cap that dries out in maturity edge of cap is rolled inwards in young specimens flesh of cap is whitish and does not change color when bruised or cut tubes on underside of cap are light yellow to bright orange yellow tube mouths are usually less than 1 mm wide stipe is usually between long less frequently reaching up to it is either same width throughout or slightly larger bulbous at base color of upper portion of stipe is pale to light yellow while lower portion may be light brown or covered with streaks of glutinous material like that on cap stipe surface is covered with fine glands that are initially slightly darker than color of stipe surface but deepen to brown or nearly black after drying color of spore print was not determined from initial collections but is thought to be yellow brown to brown based on accumulated spore deposit seen on surface of caps of neighboring fruit bodies elongate spores are oblong in face view with dimensions of 6 1 14 7 by 2 4 3 7 um most spores have a single large drop of oil in them spore bearing cells basidia are club shaped two or four spored and measure 20 2 26 2 by 5 2 6 7 um similar species with its short stipe and sticky cap s quiescens is similar to s brevipes it may be distinguished from latter species by color of young light brown cap glandular dots at top of stipes in mature specimens and yellowish color at top of stipe habitat and distribution thumb right s quiescens forms mycorrhizal associations with bishop pine fruit bodies grow together in small groups on ground in association with bishop pine pinus muricata it is most common suillus species on santa cruz island its type locality and it has also been collected at santa rosa island and point reyes national seashore in california santa cruz and santa rosa two of four islands that make up northern channel islands have a mediterranean climate with cool and wet winters and warm and dry summers most species of suillus do not have spores that survive in soil for extended periods of time but spores of s quiescens can tolerate dry conditions and heat typical of california another study showed that viable s quiescens spores were present in steam pasteurized soil planted in oregon fields authors suggest that s quiescens is an early successional species that fruits in young forests and whose spores remain dormant in soil for extended periods of time until roots of a suitable pine host are encountered references external links photos at mushroom observer category fungi described in 2010 category fungi of united states quiescens
