short beaked echidna tachyglossus aculeatus is one of four living species of echidna and only member of genus tachyglossus it is covered in fur and spines and has a distinctive snout and a specialized tongue which it uses to catch its insect prey at a great speed like other extant monotremes short beaked echidna lays eggs monotremes are only group of mammals to do so short beaked echidna has extremely strong front limbs and claws which allow it to burrow quickly with great power as it needs to be able to survive underground it has a significant tolerance to high levels of carbon dioxide and low levels of oxygen it has no weapons or fighting ability but repels predators by curling into a ball and deterring them with its spines it lacks ability to sweat and cannot deal with heat well so it tends to avoid daytime activity in hot weather it can swim if needed snout has mechanoreceptors and electroreceptors that help echidna to detect its surroundings during australian winter it goes into deep torpor and hibernation reducing its metabolism to save energy as temperature increases it emerges to mate female echidnas lay one egg a year and mating period is only time otherwise solitary animals meet one another male has no further contact with female or his offspring after mating a young echidna is size of a grape but grows rapidly on its mother s milk which is very rich in nutrients baby echidnas eventually grow too large and spiky to stay in pouch and around seven weeks after hatching are expelled from pouch into mother s burrow at around six months of age they leave burrow and have no more contact with their mothers species is found throughout australia where it is most widespread native mammal and in coastal and highland regions of eastern new guinea where it is known as mungwe in daribi and chimbu languages flannery t 1990 mammals of new guinea robert brown associates it is not threatened with extinction but human activities such as hunting habitat destruction and introduction of foreign predatory species and parasites have reduced its distribution in australia taxonomy and naming short beaked echidna was first described by george shaw in 1792 he named species aculeata thinking that it might be related to giant anteater since shaw first described species its name has undergone four revisions from m aculeata to ornithorhynchus hystrix echidna hystrix echidna

tongue is animal s sole means of catching prey and can protrude up to outside snout snout s shape resembling a double wedge gives it a significant mechanical advantage in generating a large moment so makes it efficient for digging to reach prey or to build a shelter augee gooden and musser pp 103 104 tongue is sticky because of presence of glycoprotein rich mucus which both lubricates movement in and out of snout and helps to catch ants and termites which adhere to it tongue is protruded by contracting circular muscles that change shape of tongue and force it forwards and contracting two muscles attached to caudal end of tongue and to mandible protruded tongue is stiffened by a rapid flow of blood which allows it to penetrate wood and soil retraction requires contraction of two internal longitudinal muscles known as when tongue is retracted prey is caught on backward facing keratinous teeth located along roof of buccal cavity allowing animal both to capture and grind food

because animal burrows it must tolerate very high levels of carbon dioxide in inspired air and will voluntarily remain in situations where carbon dioxide concentrations are high it can dig up to a metre into ground to retrieve ants or evade predators and can survive with low oxygen when area is engulfed by bushfires echidna can also dive underwater which can help it to survive sudden floods during these situations heart rate drops to around 12 beats per minute around one fifth of rate at rest this process is believed to save oxygen for heart and brain which are most sensitive organs to such a shortage laboratory testing has revealed echidna s cardiovascular system is similar to that of seal following devastation of a bushfire echidnas can compensate for lack of food by reducing their daytime body temperature and activity through use of torpor for a period of up to three weeks echidna s optical system is an uncommon hybrid of both mammalian and reptilian characteristics

allows it to see distant objects clearly augee gooden and musser p 57 unlike placental mammals including humans echidna does not have a ciliary muscle to distort geometry of lens and thereby change focal length and allow objects at different distances to be viewed clearly whole eye is believed to distort so distance between lens and retina instead changes to allow focusing visual ability of an echidna is not great and it is not known whether it can perceive colour however it can distinguish between black and white and horizontal and vertical stripes eyesight is not a crucial factor in

individually augee gooden and musser pp 91 92 short beaked echidnas are typically active in daytime though they are ill equipped to deal with heat because they have no sweat glands and do not pant therefore in warm weather they change their patterns of activity becoming crepuscular or nocturnal body temperatures above 34 degc 93 degf are believed to be fatal and in addition to avoiding heat animal adjusts its circulation to maintain a sustainable temperature by moving blood to and from skin to increase or lower heat loss in areas where water is present they can also swim to keep their

slower than when it is active metabolism can drop to one eighth of normal rate augee gooden and musser p 109 echidnas begin to prepare for hibernation between february and april when they reduce their consumption and enter brief periods of torpor males begin hibernating first while females that have reproduced start later during periods of hibernation animals average 13 separate bouts of torpor which are broken up by periods of arousal lasting 1 2 days on average these interruptions tend to coincide with warmer periods males end their hibernation period in mid june while reproductive females return to full activity in july and august nonreproductive females and immature echidnas may not end hibernation until two months later during body temperature can vary by 4 degc per day metabolic rate is around 30 of that of placental mammals making it lowest energy consuming mammal this figure is similar to that of other animals that eat ants and termites augee gooden and musser p 113 burrowing animals also tend to have low metabolism generally augee gooden and musser p 114 echidnas hibernate even though it is seemingly unnecessary for survival they begin their hibernation period while weather is still warm and food is generally always plentiful augee gooden and musser p 110 one explanation is that echidnas maximize their foraging productivity by exercising caution with their energy reserves another hypothesis is that they are descended from ectothermic ancestors but have taken to periodic endothermy for reproductive reasons so that young can develop more quickly supporters of this theory argue that males hibernate earlier than females because they finish their contribution to reproduction first and they awake earlier to undergo spermatogenesis in preparation for mating while females and young lag in their annual cycle during hibernation period animals stay in entirely covered shelter augee gooden and musser p 111 border thumb short beaked echidna forages at australian national botanic garden canberra short beaked echidnas can live anywhere with a good supply of food and regularly feast on ants and termites they are believed to locate food by smell using sensors in tips of their snouts by shuffling around seemingly arbitrarily and using their snout in a probing manner a study of echidnas in new england new south wales has shown that they tend to dig up scarab beetle larvae in spring when prey are active but eschew this prey when it is inactive leading to conjecture that echidnas detect prey using hearing augee gooden and musser p 99 vision is not believed to be significant in hunting as blind animals have been observed to survive in wild echidnas use their strong claws to pull apart nests and rotting logs to gain access to their prey augee

vigorously towards end of southern winter and early in spring when their fat reserves have been depleted after hibernation and nursing augee gooden and musser p 97 at this time ants have high body fat and echidna targets their mounds animal also hunts beetles and earthworms providing they are small enough to fit in a 5 mm gap proportion of ants and termites in their diets depends on availability of prey and termites make up a larger part in drier areas where they are more plentiful augee gooden and musser p 98 however termites are preferred if available as their bodies contain a smaller proportion of indigestible exoskeleton termites from rhinotermitidae family are avoided due to their chemical defences scarab beetle larvae are also a large part of diet when and where available in new england study 37 of food intake consisted of beetle larvae although echidna had to squash prey in its snout as it ingested it due to size echidnas are powerful diggers using their clawed front paws to dig out prey and create burrows for shelter they may rapidly dig themselves into ground if they cannot find cover when in danger they bend their belly together to shield soft unprotected part and can also urinate giving off a pungent liquid in an attempt to deter attackers males also have single small spurs on each rear leg believed to be a defensive weapon that has since been lost through evolution echidnas typically try to avoid confrontation with predators instead they use colour of their spines which is similar to vegetation of dry australian environment to avoid detection they have good hearing and tend to become stationary if sound is detected it is likely that echidnas are keystone species in ecosystem health in australia due to their contribution through bioturbation reworking of soils through their digging activity this is based on estimation that a single echidna will move up to 204 m3 of soil a year that it is most widespread of any terrestrial australian species is relatively common and that other have been heavily impacted by human settlement in australia they are most common in forested areas with abundant termite filled fallen logs in agricultural

echidnas has been less affected by land clearance than have some other species since they do not require a specialized habitat beyond a good supply of ants and termites as a result they can survive in cleared land if cut down wood is left in area as logs can be used as shelters and sources of insects however areas where land has been completely cleared for single crops that can be mechanically harvested such as wheat fields have seen extinctions over a decade long period around one third of echidna deaths reported to wildlife authorities in victoria were due to motor vehicles and majority of wounded animals handed in were traffic accident victims studies have shown they often choose to traverse drainage culverts under roads so this is seen as a viable means of reducing deaths on busy

concluded that goannas and cats were main predators although foxes absent in kangaroo island would be expected to be a major threat they were eaten by indigenous australians and early european settlers of australia hunting and eating of echidna in new guinea has increased over time and caused a decline in population and distribution areas it is now believed to have disappeared from highland areas killing of echidnas was a taboo in traditional culture but since tribespeople have become increasingly westernised hunting has increased and animals have been more easily tracked down due to use of dogs augee gooden and musser p 119 infection with introduced parasitic tapeworm is considered fatal for echidna this waterborne infection is contracted through sharing drinking areas with infected dogs foxes cats and dingos which do not die from parasite infection is seen as being more dangerous in drier areas where more animals are sharing fewer bodies of water increasing chance of transmission augee gooden and musser p 121 wildlife preservation society of queensland runs an australia wide survey called echidna watch to monitor species echidnas are also known to be affected by
