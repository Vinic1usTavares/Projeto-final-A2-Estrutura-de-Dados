chrisette michele kellman andy chrisette michele epiphany allmusic retrieved june 27 2009 production team stargate and singer songwriter ne yo had written for beyonce s second album b day but tor erik hermansen of stargate said that they might not have gone in direction they did on song tune did not suit beyonce s voice and ne yo wrote lyrics from a male perspective although it was not based upon his personal experiences ne yo wrote song in country style thinking of country singers shania twain and faith hill during sessions when ne yo heard them playing song with a guitar he thought it sounded like country music but when drums were incorporated into music it was brought to an r b vibe and ne yo considered making an r b country western music song instead when team worked with ne yo they recorded song with a male vocalist however they thought a female vocalist would be more suitable and ne yo also thought that it was empowering for a woman to sing it eriksen of stargate said it was an a r person who suggested that song would work better when sung by a woman two labels wanted song while beyonce worked on material for b day she was pleased with demo of irreplaceable that was presented to her however irreplaceable did not seem to fit on b day which was supposed to be a hard hitting club album swizz beatz who was working on album declared that beyonce would be crazy not to include song on record beyonce asked for changes to song including addition of drums vocal arrangements and singing in a higher register than demo espen lind and amund bjorklund from norwegian

could relate to in keeping with theme of album recording was engineered by jim caruana and mixed by jason goldstein at sony music studios in new york city goldstein was hired to mix b day he said this song was really simple to mix it was produced by stargate and sounds are really good and they all made sense and there was lots of room for all instruments goldstein used a board equalizer for drums treatment for acoustic guitars he used analogue flanger of a tc 1210 spatial expander to sweeten sound and to give them a little bit more spread goldstein thought irreplaceable sounded a bit old school an eighth note delay echo was placed on song s lead vocal at using echo farm plug in software for backing vocals goldstein used echo farm with a quarter note delay at and sony s oxford dynamics compressor limiter in dual mono mode compressor was placed in classic setting to emulate la 2a leveling amplifier and warmth button used to add harmonics oxford dynamics was used for bass in a different setting goldstein passed final mix through oxford eq and inflator plug ins pro tools software was used to print aux track into a 44 1khz 24 bit cd and then into a 24 bit cd master after sessions for irreplaceable ended hermansen said that everyone felt they had captured something special and that beyonce had done track justice but there were still concerns that urban radio might not play song as it featured acoustic guitars and had more of a pop appeal but then it became biggest urban record ever hermansen said songwriting controversy a controversy arose over writing credits on irreplaceable ne yo told mtv apparently beyonce was at a show somewhere and right before song came on she said i wrote this for all my ladies and then song came on song is a co write i wrote lyrics i wrote all lyrics beyonce helped me with melodies and harmonies and vocal arrangement and that makes it a co write meaning my contribution and her contribution made that song what it is in 2011 ne yo said that he wrote song for himself but thought that it would be better suited for beyonce some of beyonce s fans read ne yo s remark as disrespectful towards her however he clarified his comment later through twitter writing i said i originally wrote song for me once i realized how song comes across if sung by a guy that s when i decided to give it away composition irreplaceable is a mid

shipley of stylus magazine noted that guitar strum can be found in rihanna s 2007 single hate that i love you a song co produced by stargate and ne yo rob sheffield of rolling stone wrote that chris brown s 2007 single with you another stargate produced song also features same element he wrote with you is even if you can instantly tell that producer stargate was just trying to roll out irreplaceable one more time while billboard magazine wrote that it leans a bit too heavily to song jim derogatis of chicago sun times wrote that irreplaceable resembles ballads sung by whitney houston spence d of ign wrote that song was inspired by aretha franklin s work since irreplaceable consists of several variations in and octave range lyrics of irreplaceable concern breakdown of a woman s relationship with her boyfriend after she discovers his infidelity and song sounds a lot like a statement of independence sarah rodman of boston globe wrote with a heretofore unknown grasp of nuance beyonce combines heartache bravado and anger as she tells a cad he s far from irreplaceable and that in fact her new man will be arriving momentarily hermansen said that irreplaceable is a song that people from all walks of life can enjoy beyonce said that song is a little honest and basically we can t forget our power and our worth and sometimes you re so in love you forget that and sometimes you feel like you re not being appreciated and sometimes they forget that they can be replaced song s lyrics are constructed in verse pre chorus chorus form it begins with guitar strumming and beyonce sings hook intro to left to left everything you own in a box to left in bar seven she sings first verse arguing with her boyfriend about indifference of their relationship and tells him to walk away pre chorus and chorus follow you must not know bout me i can have another you by tomorrow i could have another you in a minute don t you ever for a second get to thinking you re irreplaceable in second verse beyonce recollects moment she discovered her boyfriend s infidelity same pattern leads to second chorus towards end beyonce sings bridge where she tells her lover replacing you is so easy song closes with an ad libbed chorus boston globe noted that beyonce sings some parts of it in a higher register that complements lyrics wounded sensibility release during production of irreplaceable

prediction song became successful on urban charts it was played in new york and on country radio stations shortly after release of irreplaceable beyonce told mtv i love irreplaceable i think it s important to have those songs i ve had so many people come up to me in tears saying i experienced my first breakup if it wasn t for song i wouldn t be strong enough to not call i wouldn t know how
