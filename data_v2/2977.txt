robert catesby born no earlier than 3 march 1572 died 8 november 1605 was leader of a group of english catholics who planned failed gunpowder plot of 1605 born in warwickshire catesby was educated in oxford his family were prominent recusant catholics and presumably to avoid swearing oath of supremacy he left college before taking his degree he married a protestant in 1593 and fathered two children one of whom survived birth and was baptised in a protestant church in 1601 he took part in essex rebellion but was captured and fined after which he sold his estate at chastleton protestant james i who became king of england in 1603 was less tolerant of catholicism than his followers had hoped catesby therefore planned to kill him by blowing up house of lords with gunpowder during state opening of parliament prelude to a popular revolt during which a catholic monarch would be restored to english throne early in 1604 he began to recruit other catholics to his cause including thomas wintour john wright thomas percy and guy fawkes described latterly as a charismatic and influential man over following months he helped to bring a further eight conspirators into plot whose naissance was planned for 5 november 1605 a letter sent anonymously to william parker 4th baron monteagle alerted authorities and on eve of planned explosion during a search of parliament fawkes was found guarding barrels of gunpowder news of his arrest caused other plotters to flee london warning catesby along their way with a much diminished group of followers catesby made a stand at holbeche house in staffordshire against a 200 strong company of armed men he was shot and later found dead clutching a picture of virgin mary as a warning to others his body was exhumed and subsequently decapitated his head exhibited outside parliament early life childhood robert catesby was third and only surviving son of sir william and anne nee throckmorton catesby and was born after 2 march 1572 at his father s main residence in lapworth robert was a lineal descendant of sir william catesby 1450 1485 influential councillor of richard iii captured at battle of bosworth and executed on his mother s side he was descended from sir robert throckmorton of coughton and his second wife elizabeth hussey his parents were prominent recusant catholics his father had suffered years of imprisonment for his faith and in 1581 had been tried in star chamber alongside william vaux 3rd baron vaux of harrowden and his brother in law sir thomas tresham for harbouring jesuit edmund campion head of sir thomas throckmorton was also fined for his recusancy and spent years in prison another relation sir francis throckmorton had been executed in 1584 for his involvement in a plot to free mary queen of scots in 1586 robert was educated at gloucester hall in oxford a college noted for its catholic intake those either studying at university or wishing to take public office could not do so without first swearing oath of supremacy an act which would have compromised catesby s catholic faith presumably to avoid this consequence he left without taking his degree and may then have attended seminary college of douai in 1588 robert was imprisoned at wisbech castle along with francis tresham adulthood in 1593 he married catherine leigh granddaughter of sir thomas leigh of stoneleigh abbey in warwickshire catherine came from a wealthy protestant family and brought with her a dowry of ps2 000 but also a religious association that offered robert some respite from recusancy laws then in effect from death of his grandmother following year he inherited a property at chastleton in oxfordshire couple s first son william died in infancy but their second son robert survived and was baptised at chastleton s protestant church on 11 november 1595 when catesby s father died in 1598 his estates at ashby st ledgers were left to his wife while catesby and his family remained at chastleton catesby had seemed happy to remain a church papist but after his wife s death later that year he became radicalised and reverted to a more fanatical catholicism in 1601 catesby was involved in essex rebellion earl of essex s purpose might have lain in furthering his own interests rather than those of catholic church but catesby hoped that if essex succeeded there might once more be a catholic monarch rebellion was a failure however and wounded catesby was captured imprisoned at wood street counter and fined 4 000 marks equivalent to over ps6 million as of 2008 by elizabeth i sir thomas tresham helped pay some of catesby s fine following which catesby sold his estate at chastleton several authors speculate about catesby s movements as elizabeth s health grew worse he was probably among those principal imprisoned by a government fearing open rebellion and in march 1603 he possibly sent christopher wright to spain to see if philip iii would continue to support english catholics after elizabeth s death catesby funded activities of some jesuit priests and while visiting them made occasional use of alias mr roberts gunpowder plot background catholics had hoped that persecution they suffered during elizabeth s reign would end when she was succeeded in 1603 by james i his mother mary queen of scots executed in 1587 for treason had been a devout catholic and james s attitude appeared moderate even tolerant towards catholics protestant rulers across europe had however been target of several assassination attempts during late 16th century and until 1620s some english catholics believed that regicide was justifiable to remove tyrants from power much of james s political writing was concerned with such matters and refutation of catholic argument that faith did not need to be kept with heretics shortly after he discovered that his wife anne who had been raised lutheran and had abstained from anglican communion at her english coronation had been sent a rosary from pope clement viii james exiled all jesuits and other catholic priests and reimposed collection of fines for recusancy catesby soon began to lose patience with new dynasty british author and historian antonia fraser describes catesby s mentality as that of crusader who does not hesitate to employ sword in cause of values which he considers are spiritual writing after events of 1604 1606 jesuit priest father tesimond s description of his friend was favourable his countenance was exceedingly noble and expressive his conversation and manners were peculiarly attractive and imposing and that by dignity of his character he exercised an irresistible influence over minds of those who associated with him fellow conspirator ambrose rookwood shortly before his own death said that he loved and respected him catesby as his own life while catesby s friend father john gerard claimed he was respected in all companies of such as are counted there swordsmen or men of action and that few were in opinions of most men preferred before him and he increased much his acquaintance and friends author mark nicholls suggests that bitterness at failure of essex s design nevertheless seems to have sharpened an already well honed neurosis early stages right thumb 300px alt a monochrome engraving of eight men in 17th century dress all have beards and appear to be engaged in discussion a

was he and not fawkes today most often associated with 5 november who devised what became known as gunpowder plot has largely been forgotten precise date on which he set events in motion is unknown but it is likely that he first had idea early in 1604 sometime around june of previous year he was visited by his friend thomas percy a great grandson of 4th earl of northumberland percy was reported to have had a wild youth before he became a catholic and during elizabeth s final years had been entrusted by 9th earl with a secret mission to james s court in scotland to plead with king on behalf of england s catholics he now complained bitterly about what he considered to be james s treachery and threatened to kill him catesby replied no no tom thou shalt not venture to small purpose but if thou wilt be a traitor thou shalt be to some great advantage percy listened while catesby added i am thinking of a most sure way and i will soon let thee know what it is during on 31 october he sent for his cousin thomas wintour who was at huddington court in worcestershire with his brother robert thomas was educated as a lawyer and had fought for england in low countries but in 1600 had converted to catholicism following earl of essex s failed rebellion he had travelled to spain to raise support for english catholics a mission which authorities would later describe as comprising part of a spanish treason although thomas declined his invitation catesby again invited him in february next year when wintour responded to summons he found his cousin with swordsman john wright catesby told him of his plan to kill king and his government by blowing up parliament howse with gunpowder in that place have they done us all and perchance god hath designed that place for their punishment wintour at first objected to his cousin s scheme but catesby who said that nature of disease required so sharp a remedy won him over despite catholic spain s moves toward diplomacy with england catesby still harboured hopes of foreign support and a peaceful solution wintour therefore returned to continent where he tried unsuccessfully to persuade affable constable of castile to press for good terms for english catholics in forthcoming peace negotiations he then turned to sir william stanley an english catholic and veteran commander who had switched sides from england to spain and exiled welsh spy hugh owen both cast doubt on plotters chances of receiving spanish support owen did however introduce wintour to guy fawkes whose name catesby had already supplied as a confidant gentleman who might enter their ranks fawkes was a devout english catholic who had travelled to continent to fight for spain in dutch war of independence wintour told him of their plan to doe some whatt in if with us nott and thus in april 1604 two men returned home wintour told catesby that despite positive noises from spanish he feared that deeds would nott this was a response that in nicholls s opinion came as no surprise to catesby who wanted and expected nothing less on sunday 20 may in well to do strand district of london catesby met thomas wintour john wright thomas percy and guy fawkes at an inn called duck and drake percy had been introduced to plot several weeks after wintour and fawkes s return to england alone in a private room all swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book and then in another room celebrated mass with jesuit priest and friend to catesby john gerard robert keyes was admitted to group in october 1604 and was charged with looking after catesby s lambeth house where gunpowder and other supplies were to be stored two months later catesby recruited his servant thomas bates into plot after latter accidentally became aware of it and by march 1605 three more were admitted thomas wintour s brother robert john grant and john wright s brother christopher further recruitment although state opening of parliament was planned for february 1605 concern over plague delayed it until 3 october a contemporaneous government account has plotters engaged in digging a tunnel beneath parliament by december 1604 but no other evidence exists to prove this and no trace of a tunnel has since been found if story is true plotters ceased their efforts when tenancy to undercroft beneath house of lords became available several months later early in june 1605 catesby met principal jesuit in england father henry garnet on thames street in london while discussing war in flanders catesby asked about morality of killing innocents garnet said that such actions could often be excused but according to his own account during a second meeting in july he showed catesby a letter from pope which forbade rebellion catesby replied whatever i mean to do if pope knew he would not hinder for general good of our country father garnet s protestations prompted catesby s next reply i am not bound to take knowledge by you of pope s will soon after father tesimond told father garnet that while taking catesby s confession he had learned of plot father garnet met with catesby a third time on 24 july at white webbs in enfield chase home of catesby s wealthy relative anne vaux and a house long suspected by government of harbouring jesuit priests without acknowledging that he was aware of precise nature of plot priest tried in vain to dissuade catesby from his course thumb upright left alt a full length portrait of a middle aged man wearing a grey doublet with grey tights and brown fur draped over his shoulders james i by john de critz c 1606 by 20 july 1605 36 barrels of gunpowder had been stored in undercroft but ever present threat of plague yet again prorogued opening of parliament this time until 5 november 1605 catesby had borne much of scheme s financial cost thus far and was running out of money as their plans moved closer to fruition during a secret meeting at bath in august at which he percy and thomas wintour were present plotters decided that company being yet but few he was to be allowed to call in whom he thought best catesby soon added ambrose rookwood a staunch catholic who was both young and wealthy but who most importantly owned a stable of fine horses at coldham for plan to work rookwood and his horses needed to be close to other conspirators and so catesby persuaded him to rent clopton house at stratford upon avon francis tresham was brought into plot on 14 october also descended from william catesby tresham was robert s cousin and as young children two had often visited white webbs although his account of meeting is weighted with hindsight when captured he sought to distance himself from affair he asked catesby what support for catholics would be forthcoming once king had been killed catesby s answer necessity of catholics was such that it must needs be done in fraser s opinion demonstrates his unwavering view on matter held at least since his first meeting with thomas wintour early in 1604 final conspirator to be brought in was everard digby on 21 october at harrowden catesby confided in digby during a delayed feast of saint luke like rookwood digby was young and wealthy and possessed a stable of horses catesby told him to rent coughton court near alcester so that he would better to be able to do good to cause kidnap princess elizabeth day after tresham s recruitment catesby exchanged greetings in london with fawkes s former employer lord montague and asked him parliament i think brings your lordship up now montague told him that he was visiting a relative and that he would be at parliament in a few weeks time catesby replied i think your lordship takes no pleasure to be there montague who had already been imprisoned for speaking out in house of lords against anti papist legislation and who had no inclination to be present while more laws were introduced agreed following plot s failure he became a suspect and was arrested but after intense lobbying he was released some months later recruitment of rookwood tresham and digby coincided with a series of meetings in various taverns across london during which last remaining details were worked out fawkes would light fuse and escape by boat across thames an uprising would start in midlands during which princess elizabeth was to be captured fawkes would escape to continent and explain to catholic powers what had happened in england monteagle letter thumb upright alt three quarter length portrait of an elderly gentleman william parker baron monteagle by john de critz c 1615 several of conspirators expressed worries about fellow catholics who would be caught up in planned explosion percy was concerned for his patron northumberland and when young earl of arundel s name was mentioned catesby suggested that a minor wound might keep him from chamber on that day keyes s suggestion to warn earl of peterborough was however derided on 26 october william parker 4th baron monteagle tresham s brother in law received an anonymous letter while at his house in hoxton warning him not to attend parliament and forecasting that they shall receive a terrible blow this parliament and yet they shall not see who hurts them uncertain of its meaning he delivered it to secretary of state robert cecil 1st earl of salisbury in an extraordinary act of bravado catesby had planned to go hunting with james but was warned of betrayal by monteagle s servant he immediately suspected that tresham was responsible for letter a view which was shared by thomas wintour together two confronted recently recruited conspirator and threatened to hang him but tresham managed to convince pair that he had not written letter and next day urged them to abandon plot catesby waited for percy s return from north before making his decision he thought letter too vague to constitute any meaningful threat to plan and decided to forge ahead as fawkes made a final check on gunpowder other conspirators took up their positions in midlands salisbury already aware of certain stirrings before he received letter did not yet know exact nature of plot or who exactly was involved he elected to wait to see how events unfolded on 3 november catesby met with wintour and percy in london although nature of their discussion is unknown fraser theorises that some adjustment of their plan to abduct princess elizabeth may have occurred as later accounts told how percy had been seen at duke of york s lodgings enquiring as to movements of king s daughter nicholls mentions that a week earlier on same day that monteagle received his letter catesby was at white webbs with fawkes to discuss kidnapping prince henry rather than princess elizabeth death late on monday 4 november catesby john wright and bates left for midlands ready for planned uprising that night fawkes was discovered guarding gunpowder in undercroft beneath house of lords as news of his arrest spread next day most of conspirators still in london fled catesby s party ignorant of what was happening in london paused at dunstable when his horse lost a shoe when rookwood caught them up and broke to them news of fawkes s arrest group which now included rookwood catesby bates wright brothers and percy rode toward dunchurch at about 6 00 pm that evening they reached catesby s family home at ashby st ledgers where his mother and robert wintour were staying to keep his mother ignorant of their situation catesby sent a message asking wintour to meet him at edge of town group continued to dunchurch where they met digby and his hunting party and informed them that king and salisbury were dead thus persuading them to continue with plan on 6 november they raided warwick castle for supplies before continuing to norbrook to collect stored weapons from there they continued their journey to huddington catesby gave bates a letter to deliver to father garnet and other priests at coughton court informing them of what had transpired and asking for their help in raising an army in wales where catholic support was believed to be strong priest begged catesby and his followers to stop their wicked actions and to listen to pope s father garnet fled and managed to evade capture for several weeks catesby and others arrived at huddington at about 2 00 pm and were met by thomas wintour terrified of being associated with fugitives family members and former friends showed them no sympathy left thumb on 6 november 1605 fugitives raided warwick castle for supplies back in london under pain of torture fawkes had started to reveal what he knew and on 7 november government named catesby as a wanted man early that morning at huddington remaining outlaws went to confession before taking sacrament in fraser s opinion a sign that none of them thought they had long to live party of fugitives which included those at centre of plot their supporters and digby s hunting party by now had dwindled to only thirty six in number they continued through pouring rain to hewell grange home of young lord windsor he was absent however so they helped themselves to further arms ammunition and money locals were unsupportive on hearing that catesby s party stood for god and country they replied that they were for king james as well as god and country party reached holbeche house on staffordshire boundary at about 10 00 pm
