50000 quaoar provisional designation is a non resonant trans neptunian object cubewano and a possible dwarf planet in kuiper belt a region of icy planetesimals beyond neptune it measures approximately in diameter about half diameter of pluto object was discovered by american astronomers chad trujillo and michael brown at palomar observatory on 5 june 2002 signs of water ice on surface of quaoar have been found which suggests that cryovolcanism may be occurring on quaoar a small amount of methane is present on its surface which can only be retained by largest kuiper belt objects in february 2007 weywot a synchronous moon in orbit around quaoar was discovered by brown weywot is measured to be across both objects were named after mythological figures from native american tongva people in southern california quaoar is tongva creator deity and weywot is his son history discovery quaoar was discovered by astronomer chad trujillo on 5 june 2002 when he identified it in images acquired by samuel oschin telescope at palomar observatory night before discovery was submitted to minor planet center on 6 june with trujillo and his colleague michael brown credited for discovery at time of discovery quaoar was located in constellation ophiuchus at an apparent magnitude of 18 5 its discovery was formally announced at a meeting of american astronomical society on 7 october 2002 earliest image of quaoar was found on a photographic plate imaged on 25 may 1954 from palomar observatory sky survey quaoar s discovery has been cited as brown as having contributed to reclassification of pluto as a dwarf planet name quaoar is named for tongva creator god following international astronomical union iau naming convention for non resonant kuiper belt objects after creator deities tongva people are native to area around los angeles city where quaoar was discovered michael brown and his team had picked name with more intuitive spelling but preferred spelling among tongva was qua o ar upon discovery of quaoar prior to iau approval of its name quaoar was temporarily referred as object x after planet x at that time quaoar was thought to be a possible tenth planet with a size comparable to that of pluto after announcement of its discovery quaoar was provisionally designated as it was discovered in year 2002 minor planet number 50000 for quaoar was not a coincidence but chosen to commemorate a particularly large object found in search for a pluto sized object in kuiper belt parallel to similarly numbered 20000 varuna however subsequent even larger discoveries such as 136199 eris were simply numbered according to order in which their orbits were confirmed physical characteristics thumb left artist s impression of quaoar s moderately red surface along with its moon weywot quaoar s albedo or reflectivity could be as low as 0 1 similar to s albedo of 0 127 this may indicate that fresh ice has disappeared from quaoar s surface surface is moderately red meaning that quaoar is relatively more reflective in red and near infrared spectrum than in blue kuiper belt objects varuna and are also moderately red in spectral class larger kuiper belt objects are often much brighter because they are covered in more fresh ice and have a higher albedo and thus they present a neutral color a 2006 model of internal heating via radioactive decay suggested that unlike orcus quaoar may not be capable of sustaining an internal ocean of liquid water at mantle core boundary presence of methane and other volatiles on quaoar s surface suggest that it may support a tenuous atmosphere produced from sublimation of volatiles with a measured mean temperature of upper limit of quaoar s atmospheric pressure is expected to be in range of a few due to quaoar s small size and mass possibility of quaoar having an atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon monoxide has been ruled out since gases would escape from quaoar possibility of a methane atmosphere with upper limit being less than 1 microbar was considered until 2013 when quaoar occulted a 15 8 magnitude star and revealed no sign of a substantial atmosphere placing an upper limit to at least 20 nanobars under assumption that quaoar s mean temperature is and that its atmosphere consists of mostly methane upper limit of atmosphere pressure was tightened to 10 nanobars after another stellar occultation in 2019 mass and density because quaoar is a binary object mass of system can be calculated from orbit of secondary quaoar s estimated density of around and estimated size of suggests that it is a dwarf planet american astronomer michael brown estimates that rocky bodies around in diameter relax into hydrostatic equilibrium and that icy bodies relax into hydrostatic equilibrium somewhere between and with an estimated mass greater than quaoar has mass and diameter usually required for being in hydrostatic equilibrium according to 2006 iau draft definition of a planet 5 kg 800 km and brown states that quaoar must be a dwarf planet light curve amplitude analysis shows only small deviations suggesting that quaoar is indeed a spheroid with small albedo spots and hence a dwarf planet planetary scientist erik asphaug has suggested that quaoar may have collided with a much larger body stripping lower density mantle from quaoar and leaving behind denser core he envisioned that quaoar was originally covered by a mantle of ice that made it to bigger than its present size and that it collided with another kuiper belt object about twice its size an object roughly diameter of pluto or even approaching size of mars this model was made assuming quaoar actually had a density of 4 2 g cm3 but more recent estimates have given it a more pluto like density of only 2 g cm3 with no more need for collision theory size size estimates for km thumb upright right hubble photo used to measure size of quaoar thumb upright right quaoar compared to earth and moon quaoar is thought to be an oblate spheroid around in diameter being slightly flattened in shape estimates come from observations of stellar occultations by quaoar in which it passes in front of a star in 2013 and 2019 given that quaoar has an estimated oblateness of and a measured equatorial diameter of quaoar is believed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium being described as a maclaurin spheroid quaoar is about as large and massive as if somewhat smaller than pluto s moon charon quaoar is roughly half size of pluto quaoar was first trans neptunian object to be measured directly from hubble space telescope images using a method comparing images with hubble point spread function psf in 2004 quaoar was estimated to have a diameter of with an uncertainty of using hubble s measurements given its distance quaoar is on limit of hubble s resolution of 40 milliarcseconds and its image is consequently smeared on a few adjacent pixels by comparing carefully this image with images of stars in background and using a sophisticated model of hubble optics psf brown and trujillo were able to find best fit disk size that would give a similar blurred image this method was also applied by same authors to measure size of dwarf planet eris at time of its discovery in 2002 quaoar was largest object found in solar system since discovery of pluto quaoar s size was subsequently revised downward and was later superseded in size as larger objects and were discovered uncorrected 2004 hubble estimates only marginally agree with 2007 infrared measurements by spitzer space telescope that suggest a higher albedo 0 19 and consequently a smaller diameter adopting a uranian satellite limb darkening profile suggests that 2004 hubble size estimate for quaoar was approximately 40 percent too large and that a more proper estimate would be about 900 km in 2010 quaoar was estimated to be about in diameter using a weighted average of spitzer and corrected hubble estimates in observations of object s shadow as it occulted an unnamed 16th magnitude star on 4 may 2011 quaoar was estimated to be in diameter measurements from herschel space observatory in 2013 suggested that quaoar has a diameter of in that same year quaoar occulted a 15 8 magnitude star yielding a chord length of consistent with herschel estimate another occultation by quaoar in june 2019 also yielded a similar chord length of cryovolcanism in 2004 signs of crystalline ice were found on quaoar indicating that temperature rose to at least sometime in last ten million years speculation began as to what could have caused quaoar to heat up from its natural temperature of some have theorized that a barrage of mini meteors may have raised temperature but most discussed theory speculates that cryovolcanism may be occurring spurred by decay of radioactive elements within quaoar s core since then 2006 crystalline water ice was also found on but present in larger quantities and thought to be responsible for very high albedo of that object 0 7 more precise observations of quaoar s near infrared spectrum in 2007 indicated presence of small quantities 5 of solid methane and ethane given its boiling point of methane is a volatile ice at average surface temperatures of quaoar unlike water ice or ethane both models and observations suggest that only a few larger bodies pluto and can retain volatile ices whereas dominant population of small tnos lost them quaoar with only small amounts of methane appears to be in an intermediary category orbit and rotation quaoar orbits at about from sun with an orbital period of 288 8 years quaoar has a low orbital eccentricity of 0 meaning its orbit is nearly circular its orbit is moderately inclined to ecliptic at approximately 8 degrees typical for population of small classical kuiper belt objects kbos but exceptional among large kbos quaoar is not significantly perturbed by neptune unlike pluto which is in 2 3 orbital resonance with neptune pluto orbits sun twice for every three orbits completed by neptune quaoar is largest body that is classified as a cubewano or classical kuiper belt object by both minor planet center and deep ecliptic survey although dwarf planet makemake which is larger is also classified as a cubewano quaoar occasionally moves closer to sun than pluto as pluto s aphelion farthest distance to sun is beyond and below quaoar s orbit quaoar s rotation period is uncertain and two possible rotation periods of quaoar are given 8 64 hours or 17 68 hours derived from rotational light curves of quaoar observed on march through june 2003 its rotation period is measured to be 17 hours satellite thumb upright quaoar and its moon weywot imaged by hubble space telescope in 2006 quaoar has one known moon weywot full designation 50000 quaoar i weywot discovered in 2006 it is thought to be somewhere under 200 km in diameter exploration thumb upright left quaoar from new horizons viewed at a distance of 14 au it was calculated that a flyby mission to quaoar could take 13 57 years using a jupiter gravity assist based on launch dates of 25 december 2016 22 november 2027 22 december 2028 22 january 2030 or 20 december 2040 quaoar would be 41 to 43 au from sun when spacecraft arrives in july 2016 long range reconnaissance imager lorri aboard new horizons spacecraft took a sequence of four images of quaoar from a distance of about 14 au pontus brandt at johns hopkins applied physics laboratory and his colleagues have studied an interstellar probe that would potentially fly by quaoar in 2030s before continuing to interstellar medium quaoar has been chosen as a flyby target for such a mission particularly for its escaping methane atmosphere and possible cryovolcanism as well as its close proximity to nose notes references external links quaoar
