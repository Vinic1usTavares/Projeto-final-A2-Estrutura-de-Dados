creaky gaming tropes with occasional belly laugh and said he had a better time finding his own fun than playing through missions patterson of electronic gaming monthly noted that those who are looking for cost benefit would be disappointed by lack of content especially those who had already finished main game but he was interested in enter dominatrix for its behind scenes aspects which he
