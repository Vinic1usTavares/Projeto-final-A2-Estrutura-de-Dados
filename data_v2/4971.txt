polytolypa is a monotypic genus of fungus containing single species polytolypa hystricis first classified in onygenaceae family as of 2008 it is considered to be in ajellomycetaceae although there is still uncertainty as to its phylogenetic relationships with other similar genera this species is only known from a single specimen derived in laboratory from a specimen of dung of north american porcupine erethizon dorsatum collected in ontario canada polytolypa hystricis contains bioactive compounds that have antifungal activity taxonomy phylogeny and naming thumb 160px left polytolypa hystricis was initially grown from dung of north american porcupine erethizon dorsatum pictured genus was first described in 1993 by university of toronto mycologists j a scott and d w malloch who grew fungus in moist chamber cultures of porcupine dung collected in stoneleigh ontario canada generic name polytolypa is from greek word poly polu meaning many and meaning skein of yarn specific epithet hystricis comes from greek hystrix or porcupine genus has been classified in onygenaceae a fungal family characterized by species capable of digesting human hair in vitro and with spores that are punctate with minute surface punctures when viewed with scanning electron microscopy however as scott and colleagues demonstrated using traditional laboratory tests to determine activity p is not able to digest hair there is still uncertainty as to its phylogenetic relationships with other similar genera polytolypa is thought to be evolutionarily most closely related to genera and spiromastix grouping of polytolypa and spiromastix represent a sister clade to clade based on analysis of partial nuclear lsu sequence data however phylogenetics of polytolypa are still unclear and await further study 10th edition of dictionary of fungi 2008 considers genus to be in ajellomycetaceae family although uncertainty with this classification is indicated in entry in contrast online mycological database mycobank classifies genus in onygenaceae description ascus containing reproductive structures or ascomata are minute spherical bodies typically 200 400 mm in diameter they start out white but gradually become rusty brown in maturity ascomata which may be clustered together in groups or scattered about grow in a shallow layer of hairs actually fungal mycelia called a tomentum ascomata have appendages composed of numerous coiled sometimes branched helices of hyphae that are coiled 3 15 times ascospores produced by polytolypa are ellipsoidal yellow to yellow orange in color with dimensions of 2 5 5 by 3 4 mm viewed with a light microscope their surfaces appear to be smooth but under scanning electron microscopy they are revealed to be densely marked with punctures and small hard sharp projections structures that produce ascospores are called asci in polytolypa they are numerous spherical and measure 9 10 by 12 13 mm each ascus contains eight ascospores which are released when ascus dissolves away at maturity anamorph asexual form of fungus resembles genus habitat and distribution polytolypa hystricis is known only from dung of north american porcupine erethizon dorsatum porcupine dens accumulate thick layers of nutrient rich dung hair and urine that are degraded by a succession of fungi these fungi are disseminated by arthropods such as insects or by porcupine themselves bioactive compounds chemical analysis has shown that polytolypa hystricis contains a unique chemical named polytolypin as well two compounds known previously as metabolites from canker both polytolypin and one of previously identified compounds have moderate antifungal activity against species while alone can inhibit growth of candida albicans see also coprophilous fungi references external links category category fungi of north america category fungi described in 1993 category monotypic genera category feces
