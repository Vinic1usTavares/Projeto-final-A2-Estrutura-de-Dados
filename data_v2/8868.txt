2nd ranger infantry company airborne was a ranger light infantry company of united states army active during korean war as a small special operations unit it specialized in irregular warfare a segregated unit all of its personnel including its officers were african americans activated and trained as a successor organization to 2nd ranger battalion from world war ii 2nd ranger company was formed and trained extensively in airborne warfare deployed to south korea in december 1950 company quickly adopted motto of buffalo rangers and worked extensively as a scouting force for u s 7th infantry division in this role company undertook several major operations against chinese people s volunteer army including operation tomahawk in early 1951 even though racial politics often resulted in company receiving untrained replacements it performed well in many small scale engagements during this time in summer of 1951 company was employed along front line as an advance force to push back chinese attacks as front lines became more static company was highly regarded for its actions capturing and holding hill 581 during battle of river in which company inflicted hundreds of casualties on chinese without a single ranger being killed disbanded in august 1951 along with all other ranger companies unit s soldiers accrued several awards in its 10 month existence these included four campaign streamers nine silver star medals and over 100 purple heart medals subsequent research has focused on economy of force of how rangers were employed and how their performance was impacted by racist policies of their time origins 350px right thumb 1st ranger company graduates from ranger training in november 1950 on 25 june 1950 korean war began when north korean people s army invaded republic of korea rok with 90 000 well trained and equipped troops who easily overran smaller and more poorly equipped republic of korea army in response united states u s and united nations un began an intervention campaign to prevent south korea from collapsing u s troops engaged north koreans first at battle of osan where they were badly defeated on 5 july by better trained north koreans from there u s and un suffered a steady stream of defeats that pushed them back to pusan perimeter by august at same time north korean agents began to infiltrate behind un lines and attack military targets and cities un units spread out along pusan perimeter had a difficult time repelling these units as they were untrained in combating guerrilla warfare north korean special forces units like nk 766th independent infantry regiment had great success in defeating rok troops prompting u s army chief of staff general j lawton collins to order creation of an elite force which could infiltrate through enemy lines and attack command posts artillery tank parks and key communications centers or facilities all u s army ranger units which had previously undertaken this role had been disbanded after world war ii because they required time consuming training specialization and expensive equipment with defeat of nk 766th regiment at battle of p ohang dong and strength of u s infantry units in question u s commanders felt recreation of ranger units was essential in early august as battle of pusan perimeter began eighth united states army ordered lieutenant colonel john h mcgee head of its g 3 operations miscellaneous division to create a new experimental army ranger unit eighth army ranger company to trial concept of reestablishing small light infantry companies that specialized in infiltration and irregular warfare in meantime ranger training center was established at fort benning georgia organization with successful development of eighth army ranger company establishment of additional ranger companies was ordered composition of new 2nd army ranger infantry company was formulated on table of organization and equipment documents of world war ii ranger units 2nd ranger infantry company was organized into three heavily armed platoons which were overseen by a headquarters element of five men each platoon comprised 36 men in three squads two assault squads and one heavy weapons squad each platoon was also furnished with 60 mm m2 mortars m20 super bazookas and m1918 browning automatic rifles one sniper was designated for each platoon with remainder of troops being equipped with m1 garand and m2 carbine rifles they were authorized two vehicles an m38 jeep and an m35 2 1 2 ton cargo truck overall company was far more heavily armed than both eighth army ranger company and standard infantry companies like other numbered ranger companies its organization called for 5 officers and 107 enlisted men ranger company was assigned no mess medical or transportation assets and so had to be attached to a battalion at all times as no independent ranger battalion headquarters was activated in korea troops for ranger company were to be airborne qualified so ranger training center heavily recruited troops from 82nd airborne division and 11th airborne division who had already completed united states army airborne school in spite of this only one ranger operation in conflict ever required an airborne landing they initially wore a black and gold scroll as a shoulder sleeve insignia but that insignia was later redesignated ranger tab and rangers adopted a black red and white scroll similar to that unofficially worn by ranger battalions in world war ii soon after arriving in korea unit took to nickname buffalo rangers which u s newspapers had applied to unit as a homage to buffalo soldiers buffalo subsequently became both division s motto as well as its password for patrols upon their return to company lines 2nd ranger company was only ranger company in history of u s army to consist entirely of african americans history formation and training u s army which up until that point typically did not allow african american soldiers to serve in special forces units authorized african americans to apply to become rangers however in spite of executive order 9981 which had de segregated u s military in 1948 army opted to pool all black applicants into one company by 1950 most units were still de facto segregated and in 82nd airborne division ranger applicants came from all black units including 3rd battalion 505th airborne infantry tank battalion and 80th anti aircraft artillery battalion many of applicants were world war ii veterans who had seen combat and many others had served with 555th parachute infantry battalion of a pool of 5 000 applicants on 2 october ranger training school selected 22 officers and 314 enlisted men for first three ranger companies which were entirely white a fourth all african american company was organized several days later 2nd ranger infantry company airborne was organized on 9 october 1950 assuming lineage of a company of 2nd ranger battalion it had an initial strength of 135 enlisted men and 5 officers under command of first lieutenant warren e allen company commander and second lieutenant james c queen executive officer originally it had been designated 4th ranger infantry company airborne but two companies switched designations apparently to prevent accusations of racial discrimination unit was formally activated on 25 october 1950 at fort benning thumb left 300px 2nd ranger company on a ferry in san francisco en route to korea in 1950 rangers trained extensively in reconnaissance long range patrols motorized scouting setting up roadblocks land navigation camouflage concealment and adjusting indirect fire they undertook frequent live fire exercises many at night simulating raids ambushes and infiltrations rangers trained 60 hours per week and ran each day and frequently held speed marches which were considered traditions for ranger training from world war ii training for numbered companies included much of program used by second lieutenant ralph puckett to train eighth army ranger company in spite of a 30 percent dropout rate most of men completed course and graduated on 15 november 1950 rangers left fort benning on 3 december and traveled to camp stoneman california with 4th ranger company they sailed for japan on 9 december aboard transport uss general h w butner bound for front lines in korean war company arrived at yokohama japan on 24 december and was flown from tachikawa air base to taegu five days later korea arriving in korea at 11 15 on 30 december 2nd ranger company was attached to 32nd regimental combat team 7th infantry division x corps which was regrouping in having been badly mauled in battle of chosin reservoir a battle which signaled unexpected entry of chinese troops into war next day division was ordered to tanyang and wonju to block chinese southward advance along main roads and railroads in area on 6 january rangers arrived at changnim ni with regimental headquarters where they were used as a security element for its medical units to protect them from infiltration rangers established counter guerrilla patrols around regiment s main aid station and headquarters they first saw combat at 02 00 on 7 january driving off 20 north korean guerrillas who had inadvertently run into one of their roadblocks they then repulsed a company sized second attack on position in this action rangers lost their first killed in action sergeant first class isaac baker as well as three wounded north koreans had 50 killed at 09 00 9 january 3rd platoon conducted a patrol to changnim where they ambushed an advance north korean patrol killing 11 while suffering one wounded in a six hour firefight from 09 00 to 14 45 company soon created a curfew attacking anyone they encountered after dark a move which effectively disrupted communications and resupply to local chinese guerrilla unit which instead opted to move out of rangers area of operation on 14 january rangers formed armored spearhead of 1st battalion 32nd infantry attack on village of ri as part of an offensive to push chinese forces back from tanyang area company entered village at 07 30 and was ambushed by a battalion of chinese troops entrenched there in fortified positions rangers were able to capture village and fend off a counterattack with their heavy weapons suffering five killed and five wounded while killing 100 chinese soldiers however as it moved to reinforce another u s infantry company advancing north 2nd ranger company was hit by a strong chinese counterattack and was forced to withdraw after running out of ammunition it suffered another six killed and three wounded continued patrols and skirmishes in tanyang area as well as non battle casualties to frostbite and sickness in middle of korean winter whittled down 2nd ranger company to 67 men by end of january x corps commander major general ned almond ordered all black replacements to be sent to ranger company even though they had not been trained as rangers this action seen as a racist move by historians was done to keep almond s troops segregated although ranger replacements were in short supply and order effectively ensured that company was brought back to at full strength it nevertheless reduced company s effectiveness reinforcements from many career fields including many non combat troops joined company and had to be retrained 7th infantry division reached full strength and saw action around and pyeongchang as part of an effort to push north korean and chinese forces back above 38th parallel and away from seoul in early february 7th infantry division engaged in a series of successful limited objective small unit attacks and ambushes before advancing slowly as it cleared enemy hilltop positions throughout remainder of month in this time 2nd ranger company acted as a probing force and spearhead for attacks on 20 february it led 17th infantry regiment in an attack on taking town from a superior force of chinese troops action was undertaken with several war correspondents observing battle bringing international attention to ranger unit rangers were commended for a particularly aggressive attack in which they pursued and surprised a chinese column moving into village persisting in their attack with fixed bayonets even when it became apparent that chinese force was larger than anticipated chinese were routed in heavy fighting a few days later field commanders reported to pentagon that company was performing extremely well and it was pulled from lines for a new mission operation tomahawk thumb 300px captain warren allen company commander 1st lieutenant vincent willie wilburn 2nd platoon leader and 1st lieutenant james mother queen company s executive officer in front of company s command post at tanyang pass in 1951 on 28 february 1951 2nd ranger company was attached to 187th airborne regimental combat team rct alongside 4th ranger infantry company and began unit training jumps and tactical exercises in preparation for a combat parachute drop these exercises continued throughout march 1951 as much of un force conducted aggressive operation ripper as a large scale counteroffensive against chinese and north korean forces to follow up this attack lieutenant general matthew ridgway commander of eighth army planned operation tomahawk a mission to insert 187th rct and rangers behind chinese lines to cut off chinese supplies and force them to retreat north of seoul during three weeks of training rangers were reinforced by another platoon of african american rangers directly from ranger school under lieutenant antonio anthony on 23 march 187th and attached rangers were dropped around munsan ni northwest of seoul with mission to hold an airhead to interfere with chinese and north korean logistical network and linkup with 6th medium tank battalion 18 hours after drop force of 3 500 left taegu in 150 transports over yellow sea and over north korean coast 2nd ranger company dropped from its aircraft at 09 15 first time in history u s army rangers conducted an aerial insertion into combat suffering only two rangers injured from jump force was nonetheless able to surprise and capture several positions of nk 19th division rangers massed and moved south to a terrain feature known as hill 151 linkup point with 6th tank battalion company surprised and overwhelmed a chinese platoon in a village north of hill killing six and capturing twenty they then took hill despite north korean resistance killing eleven and capturing one and forcing two platoons of north koreans to retreat from hill rangers suffered one killed and two wounded by 18 00 they had linked up with advancing 64th medium tank battalion of u s 3rd infantry division over next five days rangers commenced mopping up north korean and chinese resistance advancing north retraining and lull in april 2nd ranger infantry company was reattached to 7th infantry division this time to 31st regimental combat team company spent month training replacements with up to 400 enlisted men filtering into company by may process of transferring these men to other units began as u s army units throughout korea driven by necessity began slowly desegregating rangers eventually settled at a force of 123 men among them first white member of unit medic joe russo by may rangers were emplaced at hill 258 on front lines between 31st rct and 7th marine regiment of u s 1st marine division they conducted frequent patrols along an outpost network often encountering and engaging chinese troops they fortified hill and surrounding areas which served as an advance outpost to warn 7th infantry division if chinese attacked during this period fighting entered a lull and troops resumed their rest and recuperation rotations allen pryor and freeman left on one such rotation with a number of men leaving queen and only 80 enlisted men on hill hill 581 shortly after this however chinese infiltrators began appearing regularly in undermanned 2nd company s area and by 15 may queen discovered chinese were moving in force to hill 581 several miles from their position from which chinese could fortify and attack hill 258 queen led platoon on a sneak attack of chinese force on 17 may covered by 7th division artillery fire at 15 00 they engaged surprised chinese conducting a double envelopment supported by continued artillery fire by 17 00 rangers secured hill 581 from chinese who suffered 50 killed and 90 wounded in attack chinese troops counterattacked in force at 23 00 with two battalions of infantry supported by snipers and mortar fire aided by 7th division artillery fire rangers held hill against chinese resistance rangers repulsed four successive chinese assaults by one of battalions expending all of their grenades by 02 00 on 18 may and running short on ammunition by 03 00 at that point second chinese battalion commenced its assault surprising rangers and driving them from peak of hill 581 queen counterattacked and retook hill by 05 00 at 06 45 chinese gave up attack having been severely mauled in unsuccessful attempt to take hill 581 chinese losses amounted to at least 120 killed and several hundred injured rangers having relied on tight interlocking crossfire and well dug in positions suffered only 10 wounded in battle commanders in 7th infantry division were stunned by 2nd ranger company s effectiveness in fight and as a result of action company came to be considered a model unit 2nd ranger company then moved east to help relieve 7th marines which was reeling from chinese attacks in three days of intermittent fighting company conducted a number of search and destroy missions this culminated in an attack on hill 545 where an estimated company of chinese troops who had previously pushed marines back were themselves surprised by rangers and forced to withdraw losing 15 killed to rangers two wounded final battles and disbandment in june 1951 with peace talks underway in panmunjom ranger company was employed aggressively in offensive roles as a means to secure a better position for un at bargaining table after a number of operations north of 38th parallel with 7th division on 8 june rangers were moved to attack hill 772 an operation crafted by allen to win a strategically advantageous high ground position along front line that morning company with support from 7th division artillery advanced on hill which was first blanketed with napalm strikes from u s air force p 51 mustangs chinese forces resisted sporadically but withdrew at end of day having lost eight men killed and another thirty wounded against this rangers had lost only seven wounded on 11 july rangers continued attack backed by 31st rct who seized high ground near ni and forced chinese troops to retreat further in this attack one ranger was killed and eight were wounded following this another lull in fighting along 38th parallel occurred during which both sides took time to fortify their positions and conduct fewer patrols as need for offensive action diminished on 10 july u s army ordered deactivation of all of its ranger companies in doing so army noted that establishment of ranger companies had only been a trial directed by pentagon which had been completed decision was further clarified in relation to 2nd ranger company with army stating that racial differences had prevented company from being used effectively in offensive operations as a result of decision to disband ranger units 2nd ranger company was deactivated on 1 august 1951 while it was still in korea like many of other ranger units most of 2nd ranger company veterans were folded into 187th rct as an airborne unit it was believed that by sending men to 187th their airborne skills could be used nevertheless in end it turned out that operation tomahawk was last airborne jump of war and as a result former rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again awards and decorations 2nd ranger infantry company was awarded four campaign streamers for its service in korean war in 1955 unit was again designated a company of 2nd battalion 75th ranger regiment and that unit carries on 2nd ranger company s lineage conflict year s service campaign streamer ccf intervention 1950 first un counteroffensive with arrowhead device 1950 ccf spring offensive 1951 un summer fall offensive 1951 rangers of company also received numerous individual decorations nine rangers received silver star rangers were warren e allen norman collins curtis courts james freeman john a jones james edward posey james c queen and george and 11 received bronze star medals a total of 103 purple heart medals were awarded to 84 members of company with 11 rangers receiving two purple hearts and four rangers receiving three analysis veterans of 2nd ranger company reunited during a memorial day parade in 2011 thumb 2nd ranger infantry company was one of sixteen ranger companies formed in 1950 and one of seven to see combat in korea subsequent military science studies of korean war rangers have analyzed their economy of force focusing on how well u s military employed rangers as special forces in a thorough analysis of operations of all ranger units in korean war major chelsea y chae proposed in a 1996 thesis to u s army command and general staff college that rangers in korea were misused and ineffective chae contended that ranger formations lack of support personnel made them a logistical and administrative liability as they had to be attached to conventional units for support furthermore chae argued that small size of ranger ranger companies were allowed a strength of 112 to 122 men as compared to standard infantry company strength of 211 meant they lacked manpower to conduct basic tactical maneuvers and their employment with divisional elements meant they did not have necessary intelligence information to conduct effective infiltration operations he concluded that these problems were due to lack of understanding of ranger capabilities limitations inherent in rangers force structure and basic distrust of elite forces in his own 2003 thesis lieutenant colonel victor j bond said 2nd ranger company s performance in korea had been exemplary in spite of racial discrimination against it troops who had already been well trained members of airborne units before joining company quickly gained cohesion and were exceptional soldiers bond also contended that rangers did not properly receive credit for their actions in korea noting company did not receive republic of korea presidential unit citation or u s presidential unit citation even though units to which they were attached were decorated bond also said many of accomplishments of company were attributed to white units due in part to command climate precipitated by almond finnigan s war 2nd ranger infantry company was honored in 2013 korean war
