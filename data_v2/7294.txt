profit of ps6 000 growth continued throughout early 1990s with six stores by december 1991 and a further seven a year later in 1995 smith failed to plan for more warehouse space and retail growth pushed their storage capacity past its limits in response to unacceptably high stock theft a new warehouse was built although it reduced profits from ps850 000 in 1994 to ps400 000 in 1995 operational difficulties were resolved throughout 1996 when a new office in hong kong opened to support product sourcing and operations in uk early to mid 2000s expansion and management buyout although enduring a

economic recession poundland reported strong sales in a time of economic crisis with 2008 2009 revenue just short of up from ps330m previous year despite this poundland closed stores not financially viable even if well positioned such as in west ealing where it was believed that high rental costs were one of reasons why company pulled out of area former ceo jim mccarthy suggested there is a misconception that poundland is a better business in a recession saying that they are better during normal economic conditions but robust enough to manage well under any conditions when rate of vat was reduced in november 2008 from 17 5 to 15 poundland s prices remained fixed at ps1 having kept single price of ps1 for 18 years while absorbing duty and increased supplier costs saying that savings would be passed on in other ways reports emerged in september 2008 that poundland s owners advent international were to put retail chain up for sale with figures showing that value retailers were seeing business boom during economic recession noting that value conscious customers were switching from traditional larger supermarket retailers for everyday necessities retailer announced in 2010 a

of different prices in acquired stores business operations sales strategy thumb right items on sale at poundland that cost more than ps1 for much of its history poundland promoted their sales strategy through slogan yes everything s ps1 yet started selling items that cost more than ps1 from mid 2010s onwards advertising standards authority received complaints that slogan was thus misleading and required it ceased usage there had been plans to expand price offering in 2009 such as a ps2 section 50p section etc but they were decided against at time after understanding overwhelming message from customers was not to change easily understandable single price strategy for majority of stock sold at ps1 company does not need to transmit pricing information to stores and associate price tags with each item with some manufacturers being apprehensive about selling their brands in a discount environment store offers alternative of selling products under their own brand inflation can present challenges to single price retailers as primary marketing strategy requires products never to increase in price however inflation can also be to an advantage as some products which may previously have retailed below ps1 therefore cheaper elsewhere may then become better value for ps1 problems arising from inflation are dismissed by poundland such as freight costs which become lower when pound is weaker in turn counteracting impact various sales tactics are adopted to counteract inflation and reduce costs including decreasing quantity of an item within a set such as removing a pencil within a larger pack and replacing known brands with their own brand alternatives examples of branded products being replaced include after eights and toblerone both being confectionery products poundland s

products stocked by poundland accounting for roughly 70 of total stock would carry poundland branding and logo however retailer determined it could increase sales by removing poundland branding and instead marketing their own sub brand of products some of products sold under in house brand are supplied by manufacturers who are worried about their brand being sold in discount stores and would rather allow their products to sell without their own branding attached as well as their in house brand lines retailer sells many products from familiar brands such as colgate walkers and cadbury poundland were reported to be britain s largest seller of batteries in 2009 stocking brands such as sony panasonic and kodak in competitively priced quantities with kodak aa batteries being a high seller 2009 poundland also sell large quantities of their stock to other retailers off shelf where it is cheaper for these retailers to pay ps1 each for a bulk purchase than it would be to pay a discounted bulk purchase rate elsewhere from 2016 pep co clothing items were sold in poundland branches although similar to retailer s contemporary sales strategy of multiple priced items clothing
