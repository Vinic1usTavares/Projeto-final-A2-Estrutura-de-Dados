chrysler building is an art deco style skyscraper located in turtle bay neighborhood on east side of manhattan new york city at intersection of 42nd street and lexington avenue near midtown manhattan at structure was world s tallest building for 11 months before it was surpassed by empire state building in 1931 it is tallest brick building in world with a steel framework chrysler is eighth tallest building in city tied with new york times building originally a project of real estate developer and former new york state senator william h reynolds building was constructed by walter chrysler head of chrysler corporation and served as corporation s headquarters from 1930 until mid 1950s chrysler building s construction was characterized by a competition with 40 wall street and empire state building to become world s tallest building although chrysler building was built and designed specifically for car manufacturer corporation did not pay for its construction and never owned it rather walter chrysler decided to pay for it himself so that his children could inherit it when chrysler building opened there were mixed reviews of building s design ranging from its being inane and unoriginal to that it was modernist and iconic perceptions of building have slowly evolved into its now being seen as a paragon of art deco architectural style and in 2007 it was ranked ninth on list of america s favorite architecture by american institute of architects history context thumb left alt a view of chrysler building from empire state building chrysler building from empire state building both erected as part of new york city s 1920s building boom in mid 1920s new york s metropolitan area surpassed london s as world s most populous metropolitan area and its population exceeded ten million by early 1930s era was characterized by profound social and technological changes consumer goods such as radio cinema and automobile whose use grew exponentially in 1920s became widespread in 1927 walter chrysler s automotive company chrysler corporation became third largest car manufacturer in united states behind ford and general motors following year chrysler was named time magazine s person of year economic boom of 1920s and speculation in real estate market fostered a wave of new skyscraper projects in new york city chrysler building was built as part of an ongoing building boom that resulted in city having world s tallest building from 1908 to 1974 following end of world war i european and american architects came to see simplified design as epitome of modern era and art deco skyscrapers as symbolizing progress innovation and modernity 1916 zoning resolution restricted height that street side exterior walls of new york city buildings could rise before needing to be setback from street this led to construction of art deco structures in new york city with significant setbacks large volumes and striking silhouettes that were often elaborately decorated art deco buildings were constructed for only a short period of time but because that period was during city s late 1920s real estate boom numerous skyscrapers built in art deco style predominated in city skyline giving it romantic quality seen in films and plays chrysler building project was shaped by these circumstances land on which chrysler building stands was donated to cooper union for advancement of science and art in 1902 site is roughly a trapezoid with a frontage on lexington avenue a frontage on 42nd street and a frontage on 43rd street site bordered old boston post road which predated and ran aslant of manhattan street grid established by commissioners plan of 1811 as a result east side of building s base is similarly aslant planning thumb left upright a view of chrysler building from 42nd street originally chrysler building was to be reynolds building a project of real estate developer and former new york state senator william h reynolds prior to his involvement in planning building reynolds was best known for developing coney island s dreamland amusement park when amusement park was destroyed by fire in 1911 reynolds turned his attention to manhattan real estate where he set out to build tallest building in world in 1921 reynolds rented a large plot of land at corner of lexington avenue and 42nd street with intention of building a tall building on site in 1927 after several years of delays reynolds hired architect william van alen to build a forty story building there van alen was respected in his field for his work on albemarle building at broadway and 24th street designing it in collaboration with his partner h craig severance van alen and severance complemented each other with van alen being an original imaginative architect and severance being a shrewd businessperson who handled firm s finances however relationship between them became tense over disagreements on how best to run firm breaking point came after a 1924 article in architectural review that praised albemarle building s design which article attributed to van alen while ignoring severance s role altogether architects partnership dissolved acrimoniously several months later with lawsuits over firm s clients and assets lasting over a year this ended up being decisive for design of future chrysler building since severance s more traditional architectural style would otherwise have restrained van alen s more modern outlook design by february 2 1928 proposed building s height had been increased to 54 stories which would have made it tallest building in midtown proposal was changed again two weeks later with official plans for a 63 story building a little more than a week after that plan was changed for third time with two additional stories added by this time 42nd street and lexington avenue were both hubs for construction activity due to removal of third avenue elevated s 42nd street spur which was seen as a blight on area 52 story chanin building diagonally across intersection from reynolds s proposed building was also under construction because of elevated spur s removal real estate speculators believed that lexington avenue would become broadway of east side causing a ripple effect that would spur developments farther east in april 1928 reynolds signed a 67 year lease for plot and finalized details of his ambitious project van alen s original design for skyscraper called for a base whose first floor showroom windows would be triple height and above would be 12 stories with glass wrapped corners to create impression that tower was floating in mid air reynolds s main contribution to building s design was his insistence that it have a metallic crown despite van alen s initial opposition metal and crystal crown would have looked like a jeweled sphere at night originally skyscraper would have risen with 67 floors these plans were approved in june 1928 van alen s drawings were unveiled in following august and published in a magazine run by american institute of architects aia eventually this design would prove too advanced and expensive for reynolds he instead devised an alternate design for reynolds building which was published in august 1928 new design was much more conservative with an italianate dome that a critic compared to governor al smith s bowler hat and a brick arrangement on upper floors that simulated windows in corners a detail that remains in current chrysler building this design almost exactly reflected shape setbacks and layout of windows of current building but with a different dome construction and finalization of plans with design complete groundbreaking for reynolds building took place on september 19 1928 but reynolds did not have means to carry on construction reynolds sold plot lease plans and architect s services to walter chrysler for 2 million on october 15 1928 that same day goodwin construction company began demolition of what had been built a contract was awarded on october 28 and demolition was completed on november 9 chrysler s initial plans for building were similar to reynolds s but with 808 foot building having 68 floors instead of 67 plans entailed a ground floor pedestrian arcade a facade of stone below fifth floor a brick and terracotta facade above and a three story observation dome with bronze and glass at top however chrysler wanted a more progressive design and he worked with van alen to redesign skyscraper to be tall at new height chrysler s building would be taller than woolworth building a building in lower manhattan that was world s tallest at time thumb upright one of radiator cap themed ornaments from late 1928 to early 1929 modifications to design of dome continued in march 1929 press published details of an artistic dome that had shape of a giant thirty pointed star which would be crowned by a sculpture five meters high final design of dome included several arches and triangular windows lower down design was affected by walter chrysler s intention to make building chrysler corporation s headquarters and as such various architectural details were modeled after chrysler automobile products such as hood ornaments of plymouth see building s gargoyles on 31st floor and eagles on 61st floor were designed to signify flight and to exemplify machine age of 1920s even topmost needle was built using a process similar to one chrysler used to manufacture his cars with precise hand craftmanship in his autobiography chrysler says he suggested that his building be taller than eiffel tower meanwhile excavation of new building s foundation began in mid november 1928 and was completed in mid january 1929 when bedrock was reached a total of of rock and of soil was excavated for foundation equal to 63 of future building s weight construction of building proper began on january 21 1929 carnegie steel company provided steel beams first of which was installed on march 27 and by april 9 first upright beams had been set into place steel structure was a few floors high by june 1929 35 floors high by early august and completed by september despite a frantic steelwork construction pace of about four floors per week no workers died during construction of skyscraper s steelwork chrysler lauded this achievement saying it is first time that any structure in world has reached such a height yet entire steel construction was accomplished without loss of life in total 391 881 rivets were used and approximately 3 826 000 bricks were manually laid to create non loadbearing walls of skyscraper walter chrysler personally financed construction with his income from his car company chrysler building s height officially surpassed woolworth s on october 16 1929 thereby becoming world s tallest structure same year that chrysler building s construction started banker george l ohrstrom proposed construction of a 47 story office building at 40 wall street downtown shortly thereafter ohrstrom modified his project to have 60 floors but it was still below woolworth and 808 foot chrysler building project as announced in 1928 h craig severance van alen s former partner and architect of 40 wall street increased 40 wall s height to with 62 floors in april of that year it would thus exceed woolworth s height by and chrysler s by 40 wall street and chrysler building started competing for distinction of world s tallest building empire state building on 34th street and fifth avenue entered competition in 1929 race into sky as popular media called it at time was representative of country s optimism in 1920s which helped fuel building boom in major cities 40 wall street tower was revised from to 925 feet in april 1929 which would make it world s tallest severance increased height of his project and then publicly claimed title of world s tallest building emporis data see source no 4 line 4 briefly held world s tallest title until it was eclipsed by spire of chrysler building construction of 40 wall street began in may 1929 at a frantic pace and it was completed twelve months later in response van alen obtained permission for a spire and had it secretly constructed inside frame of his building spire was delivered to site in four different sections on october 23 1929 one week after surpassing woolworth building s height and one day before catastrophic wall street crash of 1929 started spire was assembled according to one account bottom section of spire was hoisted to top of building s dome and lowered into 66th floor of building then within 90 minutes rest of spire s pieces were raised and riveted in sequence helping raise tower s height to 1 046 feet van alen who witnessed process from street along with its engineers and walter chrysler compared experience to watching a butterfly leaving its cocoon in structure and metal work of chrysler building an article published in october 1930 edition of architectural forum van alen explained design and construction of crown and needle steel tip brought chrysler building to a height of greatly exceeding 40 wall street s height however contemporary news media did not write of spire s erection nor were there any press releases celebrating spire s erection even new york herald tribune which had virtually continuous coverage of tower s construction did not report on spire s installation until days after spire had been raised chrysler realized that his tower s height would exceed empire state building s as well having ordered van alen to change chrysler s original roof from a stubby romanesque dome to narrow steel spire however empire state s developer john j raskob reviewed plans and realized that he could add five more floors and a spire of his own to his 80 story building and subsequently acquired nearby plots needed to support that building s height extension two days later empire state building s co developer former governor al smith announced updated plans for that skyscraper with an observation deck on 86th floor roof at a height of higher than chrysler s 71st floor observation deck at completion thumb right chrysler building in 1932 in january 1930 it was announced that chrysler corporation would maintain offices in chrysler building during automobile show week and first leases by outside tenants were announced in april 1930 before building was officially completed building was formally opened on may 27 1930 in a ceremony that coincided with 42nd street property owners and merchants association s meeting that year in lobby of building a bronze plaque that read in recognition of mr chrysler s contribution to civic advancement was unveiled former governor smith former assemblyman martin g mccue and 42nd street association president george w sweeney were among those in attendance by june it was reported that 65 of available space had been leased by august building was declared complete but new york city department of construction did not mark it as finished until february 1932 added height of spire allowed chrysler building to surpass 40 wall street as tallest building in world and eiffel tower as tallest structure chrysler building was thus first man made structure to be taller than and as one newspaper noted tower was also taller than highest points of five states chrysler building was appraised at 14 million but was exempt from city taxes per an 1859 law that gave tax exemptions to sites owned by cooper union city had attempted to repeal tax exemption but cooper union had opposed that measure because chrysler building retains tax exemption it has paid cooper union for use of their land since opening van alen s satisfaction at these accomplishments was likely muted by walter chrysler s later refusal to pay balance of his architectural fee chrysler alleged that van alen had received bribes from suppliers and van alen had not signed any contracts with walter chrysler when he took over project van alen sued and courts ruled in his favor requiring chrysler to pay van allen 840 000 or 6 of total budget of building however lawsuit against chrysler markedly diminished van alen s reputation as an architect which along with effects of great depression and negative criticism ended up ruining his career van alen ended his career as professor of sculpture at nearby beaux arts institute of design and died in 1954 according to author neal bascomb chrysler building was his greatest accomplishment and one that guaranteed his obscurity completed chrysler building garnered mixed reviews in press van alen was hailed as doctor of altitude by architect magazine while architect kenneth murchison called van alen ziegfeld of his profession comparing him to popular broadway producer ziegfeld jr building was praised for being an expression of intense activity and vibrant life of our day and for teem ing with spirit of modernism epitome of modern business life stand ing for progress in architecture and in modern building methods an anonymous critic wrote in architectural forum october 1930 issue chrysler stands by itself something apart and alone it is simply realization fulfillment in metal and masonry of a one man dream a dream of such ambitions and such magnitude as to defy comprehension and criticism of ordinary men or by ordinary standards negative critics included journalist george s chappell who called chrysler s design distinctly a stunt design evolved to make man in street look up and douglas haskell who said that building embodies no compelling organic idea others compared chrysler building to an upended swordfish or claimed it had a little nemo like design lewis mumford a supporter of international style and one of foremost architectural critics of united states at time despised building for its inane romanticism meaningless voluptuousness and void symbolism chrysler building s distinction as world s tallest building was short lived john raskob realized 1 050 foot empire state building would only be taller than chrysler building and raskob was afraid that walter chrysler might try to pull a trick like hiding a rod in spire and then sticking it up at last minute another revision brought empire state building s roof to making it tallest building in world by far when it opened on may 1 1931 however chrysler building is still world s tallest steel supported brick building chrysler building fared better commercially than empire state building did by 1935 chrysler had already rented 70 of its floor area while empire state had only leased 23 of its area and was popularly derided as empty state building contrary to popular belief chrysler corporation was never involved in construction or ownership of chrysler building although it was built and designed for corporation and served as its headquarters until mid 1950s it was a project of walter p chrysler for his children in his autobiography chrysler wrote that he wanted to erect building so that his sons would have something to be responsible for later history thumb 250px left height comparison of buildings in new york city chrysler family inherited property after death of walter chrysler in 1940 with property being under ownership of w p chrysler building corporation in 1944 corporation filed plans to build a 38 story annex to east of building at 666 third avenue in 1949 this was revised to a 32 story annex costing 9 million annex building designed by reinhard hofmeister had a facade similar to that of original chrysler building stone for original building was no longer manufactured and had to be specially replicated construction started on annex in june 1950 and first tenants started leasing in june 1951 building itself was completed by 1952 and a sky bridge connecting two buildings seventh floors was built in 1959 family sold building in 1953 to william zeckendorf for its assessed price of 18 million 1953 deal included annex and nearby graybar building which along with chrysler building sold for a combined 52 million new owners were zeckendorf s company webb and knapp who held a 75 interest in sale and corporation who held a 25 stake at time it was reported to be largest real estate sale in new york city s history in 1957 chrysler building its annex and graybar building were sold for 66 million to lawrence wien s realty syndicate setting a new record for largest sale in city in 1960 complex was purchased by sol goldman and alex dilorenzo who received a mortgage from massachusetts mutual life insurance company in 1961 building s stainless steel elements including needle crown gargoyles and entrance doors were polished for first time a group of ten workers steam cleaned facade below 30th floor and manually cleaned portion of tower above 30th floor for a cost of about 200 000 massachusetts mutual obtained outright ownership in 1975 after goldman and dilorenzo defaulted on mortgage company purchased building for 35 million in 1978 they devised plans to renovate facade heating ventilation air conditioning elevators lobby murals and cloud club headquarters in a 23 million project this renovation was completed in 1979 they delegated leasing of building s space to edward s gordon company which leased of vacant space within five years during massachusetts mutual s ownership of chrysler building tower received two historic designations building was designated as a national historic landmark in 1976 and and as a new york city landmark in 1978 although city only landmarked lobby and facade massachusetts mutual had opposed city landmark designation because it would cause inevitable delay in moving new tenants into skyscraper at time building had of vacant floor space representing 40 of total floor area in september 1979 building was sold again this time to entrepreneur and washington redskins owner jack kent cooke in a deal that also transferred ownership of los angeles kings and lakers to jerry buss spire underwent

announced that transaction had been completed and that abu dhabi investment council was now 90 owner of building with tishman speyer retaining 10 from 2010 to 2011 building s energy plumbing and waste management systems were renovated this resulted in a 21 decrease in building s total energy consumption a 64 decrease in water consumption and an 81 rate of waste being recycled in 2012 building received a leed gold accreditation from u s green building council which recognized building s environmental sustainability and energy efficiency abu dhabi investment council and tishman speyer put chrysler building on sale again in january 2019 it was reported in march 2019 that aby rosen s holding llc in a joint venture with austrian signa group had reached an agreement to purchase chrysler building albeit at a steeply discounted price architecture thumb building s distinctive art deco crown and spire chrysler building is considered a leading example of art deco architecture it is constructed of a steel frame in filled with masonry with areas of decorative metal cladding structure contains 3 862 exterior windows approximately fifty metal ornaments protrude at building s corners on five floors reminiscent of gargoyles on gothic cathedrals 31st floor contains gargoyles and replicas of 1929 chrysler radiator caps 61st eagles a nod to america s national bird chrysler building uses bright nirosta stainless steel extensively in its design an alloy developed in germany by krupp a german acronym for stahl meaning non rusting steel it was first use of this 18 8 stainless steel in an american project composed of 18 chromium and 8 nickel nirosta was used in exterior ornaments window frames crown and needle steel was an integral part of van alen s design as e e thum explains use of permanently bright metal was of greatest aid in carrying of rising lines and diminishing circular forms in roof treatment so as to accentuate gradual upward swing until it literally dissolves into sky stainless steel producers used chrysler building to evaluate durability of product in architecture in 1929 american society for testing materials created an inspection committee to study its performance which regarded chrysler building as best location to do so a subcommittee examined building s panels every five years until 1960 when inspections were canceled because panels had shown minimal deterioration exterior setbacks chrysler building s height and legally mandated setbacks influenced van alen in his design walls of lowermost sixteen floors rise directly from sidewalk property lines except for a recess on one side that gives building a u shaped floor plan above fourth floor there are setbacks on floors 16 18 23 28 and 31 making building compliant with zoning law of 1916 this gives building appearance of a ziggurat on one side and a u shaped palazzo on other above 31st floor there are no more setbacks until 60th floor above which structure is funneled into a maltese cross shape that blends square shaft to finial according to author and photographer cervin robinson floor plans of first sixteen floors were made as large as possible to optimize amount of rental space nearest ground level which was seen as most desirable u shaped cut above fourth floor served as a shaft for air flow and illumination area between floors 28 and 31 added visual interest to middle of building preventing it from being dominated by heavy detail of lower floors and eye catching design of finial they provide a base to column of tower effecting a transition between blocky lower stories and lofty shaft designs between setbacks ground floor exterior is covered in polished black granite from shastone while three floors above it are done in white marble from georgia there are two main entrances on lexington avenue and on 42nd street each three floors high with shastone granite surrounding each proscenium shaped entryway at some distance into each main entryway there are revolving doors located beneath intricately patterned metal and glass screens designed so as to embody art deco tenet of amplifying entrance s visual impact a smaller side entrance on 43rd street is only one story high there are storefronts consisting of large nirosta steel framed windows at ground level with office windows on second through fourth floors west and east elevations of building contain air shafts above fourth floor while north and south sides contain receding setbacks below 16th floor facade is clad with white brick interrupted by white marble bands in a manner similar to a basket weaving windows arranged in grids do not have window sills frames being flush with facade between 16th and 24th floors exterior exhibits vertical white brick columns that are separated by windows on each floor this visual effect is made possible by presence of aluminum spandrels between columns of windows on each floor there are abstract reliefs on 20th through 22nd floor spandrels while 24th floor contains decorative pineapples above third setback consisting of 24th through 27th floors facade contains horizontal bands and zigzagged gray and black brick motifs above fourth setback between 27th and 31st floors shaft starts to appear at each corner of 31st floor large car hood ornaments made of nirosta steel serve as visually striking objects that make base look larger these corner extensions help counter a common optical illusion seen in tall buildings with horizontal bands whose taller floors would normally look larger 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of hubcaps and fenders which symbolizes both chrysler corporation and serves as a visual signature of building s art deco design bonnet embellishments take shape of mercury s winged helmet and resemble hood ornaments installed on chrysler vehicles at time shaft of tower was designed to emphasize both horizontal and vertical each of tower s four sides contains three columns of windows each framed by bricks and an unbroken marble pillar that rises along entirety of each side spandrels separating windows contain alternating vertical stripes in gray and white brick while each corner contains horizontal rows of black brick interior interior of building contains several innovative elements partitions between offices are soundproofed and divided into interchangeable sections so that layout of any could be changed quickly and comfortably pipes under floors carry both telephone and electricity cables lobby triangular shaped lobby is regarded as a paragon of art deco style with clear influences of german expressionism chrysler wanted design to impress other architects and automobile magnates so he imported various materials without giving consideration to extra costs incurred he covered walls with huge slabs of african red granite on floor he marked a path from entrances to elevators using travertine from siena originally van alen s plans for lobby included four large supporting columns but they were removed after chrysler objected on grounds that columns made lobby appear cramped lobby has dim lighting that gives it a somewhat subdued quality although appliques of lamps are striking and iconic both combine to create an intimate atmosphere and act to highlight place vertical bars of fluorescent light are covered with belgian blue marble and mexican amber onyx which soften and diffuse light to both illuminate and blend with red marble walls lobby also contains four elevator banks each with a different design ceiling contains a mural named transport and human endeavor commissioned by edward trumbull in 1930 mural s theme is energy and man s application of it to solution of his problems and it pays homage to golden age of aviation and machine age mural is painted in shape of a y with ocher and golden tones central image of mural is a muscled giant whose brain directs his boundless energy to attainment of triumphs of this mechanical era according to a 1930 pamphlet that advertised building mural s art deco style is manifested in characteristic triangles sharp angles slightly curved lines chrome ornaments and numerous patterns mural depicts several silver planes including spirit of st louis as well as furnaces of incandescent steel and building itself there is a wall panel dedicated to work of surveyors masons carpenters plasterers and builders fifty different figures were modeled after workers who participated in its construction in 1999 mural was returned to its original state after a restoration that removed polyurethane coating and filled in holes added in 1970s presently lobby is only publicly accessible part of chrysler building when building opened first and second floors housed a public exhibition of chrysler vehicles this exhibition was closed before world war ii elevators there are 32 elevators in skyscraper clustered into groups of six or eight at time of opening 28 of these elevators were for passenger use each bank serves different floors within building with several express elevators going from lobby to a few landings in between while local elevators connect landings with floors above these intermediate landings as per walter chrysler s wishes elevators were designed to run at a rate of despite speed restriction enforced in all city elevators at time this restriction was loosened soon after empire state building opened in 1931 as that building had also been equipped with high speed elevators chrysler building also had three of longest elevator shafts in world at time of completion over course of a year van alen painstakingly designed these elevators with assistance of l t m ralston who was in charge of developing elevator cabs mechanical parts cabs were manufactured by otis elevator company while doors were made by tyler company dimensions of each elevator were deep by wide doors are made of metal and covered with eight types of exotic woods when doors are closed they resemble tall fans set off by metallic palm fronds rising through a series of silver parabolas whose edges were set off by curved lilies from outside as noted by curcio however when a set of doors is open cab behind doors resembles an exquisite art deco room these elements were influenced by egyptian designs which significantly impacted art deco style according to vincent curcio these elevator interiors were perhaps single most beautiful and next to dome most important feature of entire building even though woods in elevator cabs were arranged in four basic patterns each cab had a unique combination of woods one writer stated that if anything building is based on patterned fabrics elevators certainly are three of designs could be characterized as having geometric mexican and vaguely art nouveau motifs which reflect various influences on design of entire building roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also customized to cab hidden behind these plates were ceiling fans curcio wrote that these elevators are among most beautiful small enclosed spaces in new york and it is fair to say that no one who has seen or been in them has forgotten them curcio compared elevators to curtains of a ziegfeld production noting that each lobby contains lighting that peaks in middle and slopes down on either side decoration of cabs interiors was also a nod to chrysler corporation s vehicles cars built during building s early years had dashboards with wooden moldings both doors and cab interiors were considered to be works of extraordinary basement on 42nd street side of chrysler building a staircase from street leads directly under building to new york city subway s at grand central 42nd street station it is part of structure s original design interborough rapid transit company which at time was operator of all routes serving 42nd street station originally sued to block construction of new entrance because it would cause crowding but new york city board of transportation pushed to allow corridor anyway chrysler eventually built and paid for building s subway entrance work on new entrance started in march 1930 and it opened along with chrysler building two months later basement also had a water bottling unit that would filter tap water into drinkable water for building s tenants drinkable water would then be bottled and shipped to higher floors above 60th floor thumb right upright view from one of north facing triangular windows cloud club private cloud club formerly occupied 66th through 68th floors it opened in july 1930 with some three hundred members all wealthy males who formed city s elite its creation was spurred by texaco s wish for a proper restaurant for its executives prior to renting fourteen floors in building cloud club was a compromise between william van alen s modern style and walter chrysler s stately and traditional tastes a member had to be elected and if accepted paid an initial fee of 200 plus a 150 to 300 annual fee there was a tudor style foyer on 66th floor with oak paneling and an old english style grill room with wooden floors wooden beams wrought iron chandeliers and glass and lead doors main dining room located on 67th floor was connected to 66th floor by a renaissance style marble and bronze staircase and had a futuristic appearance with polished granite columns and etched glass appliques in art deco style there was a mural of a cloud on ceiling and a mural of manhattan on dining room s north side it is believed that dining room was an inspiration for rainbow room and rockefeller center luncheon club both located at 30 rockefeller center on same floor walter chrysler and texaco both had private dining rooms 68th floor mainly contained service spaces in 1950s and 1960s members left cloud club for other clubs texaco whose executives comprised most of cloud club s membership moved to westchester county in 1977 and club closed two years later although there have been several projects to rehabilitate club or transform it into a disco or a gastronomic club these plans have never materialized as then owner cooke reportedly did not want a conventional restaurant operating within old club tishman speyer rented top two floors of old cloud club old staircase has been removed as have many of original decorations which prompted objections from art deco society of new york private offices originally walter chrysler had a two story apartment on 69th and 70th floors with a fireplace and a private office office also contained a gymnasium and bathrooms in city chrysler also had a unit on 58th through 60th floors which served as his residence however chrysler did not use his gym much instead choosing to stay at chrysler corporation s headquarters in detroit later 69th and 70th floors were converted into a dental clinic in 2005 a new york times report found that one of dentists charles weiss had operated at clinic s current rooftop location since 1969 office still had suite s original bathroom and gymnasium observation deck from building s opening until 1945 it contained a observation deck on 71st floor called celestial for fifty cents visitors could transit its circumference through a corridor with vaulted ceilings painted with celestial motifs and bedecked with small hanging glass planets center of observatory contained toolbox that walter p chrysler used at beginning of his career as a mechanic it was later preserved at chrysler technology center in auburn hills michigan an image of building resembling a rocket hung above it according to a contemporary brochure views of up to were possible on a clear day but small triangular windows of observatory created strange angles that made viewing difficult depressing traffic when empire state building opened in 1931 with two observatories at a higher elevation chrysler observatory lost its clientele after observatory closed it was used to house radio and television broadcasting equipment since 1986 old observatory has housed office of architects harvey morse and interests crown thumb upright detail of art deco ornamentation at crown chrysler building is renowned for and recognized by its terraced crown which is an extension of main tower composed of seven radiating terraced arches van alen s design of crown is a cruciform groin vault of seven concentric members with transitioning setbacks mounted one behind another entire crown is clad with nirosta steel ribbed and riveted in a radiating sunburst pattern with many triangular vaulted windows transitioning into smaller segments of seven narrow setbacks of terraced crown due to curved shape of dome nirosta sheets had to be measured on site so most of work was carried out in workshops on building s 67th and 75th floors according to robinson its dormers each smaller and higher than previous one continue wedding cake layering of building itself this concept is carried forward from 61st floor whose eagle gargoyles echo treatment of 31st to spire which extends concept of higher and narrower forward to infinite
