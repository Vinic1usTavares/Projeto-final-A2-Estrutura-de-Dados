1999 2000 south west indian ocean tropical cyclone season was first on record in which two storms leon eline and hudah struck mozambique at tropical cyclone intensity or with maximum sustained winds of at least 120 km h 75 mph most notable storm of season was eline which was third longest lasting storm on record in basin it lasted for 29 days while traversing southern indian ocean making strongest landfall in decades along eastern madagascar in late february storm was first in a series of three storms that struck country in early 2000 along with gloria in march and hudah in april collectively three storms killed at least 316 people season started on november 1 1999 and ended for most of basin on april 30 2000 for mauritius and seychelles season continued until may 15 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in basin despite destructive nature of season it began later than usual cyclone astride originated toward end of december bringing rainfall and gusty winds to northern madagascar while in region in january cyclones babiola and connie both formed east of madagascar and took southerly tracks connie passed near reunion island producing of rainfall in mountainous peaks and killing two people eline longest lasting storm of season struck mozambique while country was experiencing its worst flooding in 50 years collectively causing around 700 deaths and about 500 million in damage storm also killed 12 people in zimbabwe and 21 in south africa just two weeks after eline struck madagascar tropical storm gloria affected same general region bringing additional deaths and damage cyclone hudah in april was strongest storm of season reaching peak 10 minute winds of 220 km h 140 mph it caused three deaths in mozambique although its effects were worse in madagascar where there were 111 deaths final storm of season was tropical storm innocente which dissipated on april 24 in addition to named storms there were four unnamed tropical disturbances or storms as well as one subtropical cyclone that formed in southern mozambique channel toc season summary meteo france office mfr on reunion island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within basin during season agency estimated intensity through dvorak technique which utilized continuous satellite imagery in basin since may 1998 wind estimates were sustained over 10 minutes to be converted to 1 minute winds by dividing by 0 88 as compared to a divisor of 0 80 in previous years warnings on tropical cyclones in region were from coast of africa to 90deg e south of equator joint typhoon warning center a joint united states navy united states air force task force also issued tropical cyclone warnings for region beginning this season mfr changed their method for labeling tropical disturbances classifying them sequentially by number in previous years agency labeled disturbances by letter and number of subsequent unnamed storm season began later than usual third consecutive one to do so there were no indications of tropical cyclogenesis before middle of december putting season among latest 20 since 1967 in terms of seasons first storms on december 26 mfr utilized quikscat satellite for first time in basin to assess a storm s intensity during season 14 tropical disturbances formed which is near average and they tended to last longer than normal eleven of these disturbances became tropical depressions of which nine attained gale force winds and were named in addition four storms reached tropical cyclone intensity or 10 minute sustained winds of 120 km h 75 mph 9 named storms and 4 tropical cyclones is also basin average for each category in a given year there were 61 days in which a storm was active greater than median of 48 and more than double than previous season in general storms formed south of 10deg s with exception of first storm astride and most storms generally tracked east to west due to a strong ridge east of madagascar systems severe tropical storm astride on december 23 a circulation with accompanying convection became evident about 400 km 250 mi southeast of diego garcia becoming a tropical disturbance while moving to south thunderstorms organized more aided by low wind shear good outflow warm waters and its position beneath an anticyclone curving west southwestward due to a ridge to south system intensified into a tropical depression and later tropical storm astride on december 25 that day jtwc classified system as tropical cyclone 03s storm developed a large area of convection prompting mfr to upgrade it to a severe tropical storm on december 26 estimating 10 minute winds of 95 km h 60 mph on december 27 jtwc upgraded astride to equivalent of a minimal hurricane due to appearance of an eye feature estimating 1 minute winds of 120 km h 75 mph later that day storm weakened unexpectedly perhaps related to wind shear from a trough to south convection deteriorated markedly and weakening storm turned more to west northwest on december 29 due to a weaker ridge convection reorganized slightly although it was dislocated from center early on december 30 storm passed about 70 km 45 mi northeast of tromelin island curving back to west astride struck northeastern madagascar between vohemar and antsiranana on december 31 as a minimal tropical storm it emerged into mozambique channel as a tropical depression and despite forecasts to contrary it reintensified into a tropical storm before passing near mayotte on january 2 early next day astride weakened back to tropical depression status before moving ashore eastern mozambique near pemba dissipating soon after on tromelin astride brought strong winds including 10 minute sustained winds of 101 km h 63 mph and gusts to no damage was reported in madagascar during storm s passage there when astride passed just south of mayotte it brought gusts to strong enough to knock over some banana trees and to destroy a stone house storm also dropped of rainfall over 24 hours including in one hour heavy rainfall accompanied astride s final landfall penetrating as far inland as malawi tropical cyclone babiola toward beginning of january intertropical convergence zone itcz remained active across much of basin with low pressure and widespread thunderstorms one such area persisted southeast of diego garcia and organized sufficiently to be classified as a tropical disturbance on january 3 that day jtwc issued first of three tropical cyclone formation alerts noting increase in convection system moved to northeast along southeastern edge of a ridge near equator but turned back to southwest on january 5 that day convection increased over center after having previously been dislocated due to wind shear late on january 5 jtwc initiated advisories on tropical cyclone 02s and on next day mfr upgraded system to tropical storm babiola storm accelerated to southwest and continued to intensity an irregular eye formed on january 8 prompting mfr to upgrade babiola to tropical cyclone status outflow and eye became more pronounced after further strengthening and cyclone attained peak 10 minute winds of 155 km h 100 mph on january 9 jtwc by contrast estimated peak 1 minute winds of 165 km h 105 mph around time of peak intensity babiola began turning more to south due to an approaching trough late on january 9 cyclone passed about 400 km 250 mi east of rodrigues increased shear weakened eyewall and convection and babiola weakened below cyclone status on january 11 early next day jtwc discontinued advisories as storm was beginning to become extratropical mfr followed suit later on january 12 although agency continued to track babiola storm shifted south southwestward on january 13 before resuming its southeast trajectory influenced by a ridge to south on january 14 remnants of babiola passed just west of ile amsterdam where gusts reached later that day storm merged with trough that had originally turned it to southeast intense tropical cyclone connie an area of thunderstorms formed on january 22 east of northern tip of madagascar organizing into a tropical disturbance three days later by late on january 25 mfr upgraded system to tropical storm connie and on same day jtwc initiated advisories on storm as tropical cyclone 08s with favorable conditions connie gradually organized while initially stationary later beginning a steady southeast motion on january 26 jtwc upgraded storm to equivalent of a minimal hurricane on january 27 around same time that mfr upgraded connie to tropical cyclone status storm s eye became well defined as winds increased and mfr estimated peak 10 minute winds of 185 km h 115 mph on january 28 on same day jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 220 km h 140 mph increased shear weakened storm as it curved southwestward and late on january 29 connie passed about 130 km 80 mi northwest of reunion storm turned to southeast again and became extratropical on february 1 dissipating next day while passing northwest of mauritius outer fringes of connie brought heavy rains peaking at over span of six days or equivalent to a month s worth of precipitation these rains helped relieve extreme drought conditions storm also produced gusts of and one person died after falling off his roof storm also brought heavy rainfall to reunion totaling of which occurred in over 24 hours wind gusts there reached in france many roads across island were damaged and about 40 000 people lost power while more than 100 homes were destroyed two persons were killed and 600 people were left homeless although agriculture sector suffered most significant damages overall damage was minor moderate tropical storm damienne same monsoon trough that spawned connie also produced an area of convection southeast of diego garcia on january 28 circulation slowly organized and mfr classified it as a tropical disturbance on january 30 a nearby trough steered system southeastward initially and later to southwest on january 31 system became a tropical depression and later moderate tropical storm damienne next day reaching peak winds of 65 km h 40 mph also on february 1 jtwc initiated warnings on tropical cyclone 10s which estimated 1 minute winds of 95 km h 60 mph increased wind shear removed convection on february 2 causing marked weakening and prompting jtwc to discontinue advisories that day this was despite forecasts of strengthening to near tropical cyclone status as a weak tropical disturbance damienne turned to a rapid westward motion passing north of rodrigues and tromelin circulation dissipated on february 7 off northeast coast of madagascar intense tropical cyclone leon eline on february 1 a low pressure area formed within monsoon trough to south of indonesia which would eventually become tropical cyclone leon in australian basin as well as tropical cyclone 11s according to jtwc storm tracked westward across much of indian ocean fluctuating in strength due to changes in atmosphere after crossing 90deg e mfr began tracking system as tropical storm eline on february 8 storm continued westward across indian ocean and intensified greatly as it approached east coast of madagascar late on february 17 eline made landfall near mahanoro with 10 minute winds of 165 km h 105 mph making it strongest storm to hit country in several decades storm rapidly weakened over land but restrengthened in mozambique channel to reach peak 10 minute winds of 185 km h 115 mph on february 22 eline made landfall about 80 km 50 mi south of beira mozambique near peak intensity and quickly weakened over land well defined circulation moved across southern african finally dissipating over eastern namibia on february 29 throughout its duration leon eline lasted 29 days a record longevity for a storm in south west indian ocean track was over 11 000 km 6 800 mi or about 25 of earth s circumference eline struck while madagascar was in midst of a cholera epidemic that had killed over 1 000 people storm directly killed at least 64 people in madagascar although tropical storm gloria struck shortly thereafter compounding upon damage and making it difficult to discern individual damage totals damage from eline was estimated at us 9 million collectively two storms killed 205 people in country destroyed about half of rice harvest and left 10 000 homeless in region around vatomandry where eline made landfall 65 of houses were damaged 90 of crops were lost and 75 of health facilities were wrecked before eline struck mozambique worst floods since 1951 had affected nation since january killing about 150 people additional rainfall and flooding from eline created country s worst natural disaster in a century combined effects destroyed over of crop fields and killed 40 000 cattle eline s passage disrupted ongoing relief efforts with port in beira blocked for two weeks due to five sunken ships high levels along limpopo river isolated town of xai xai with water levels along river reaching as high as above normal in some areas as well as wide a dam broke along river flooding town of chokwe in middle of night and trapping several unprepared residents about 55 people drowned in sofala province after rescue helicopters arrived too late to save them around 20 000 people in capital city of maputo lost their homes in addition to floods strong winds blew away many roofs and some entire houses made of mud combined effects of preceding floods and eline left about 300 000 people homeless about 700 deaths and damage estimated at 500 million 2000 usd cyclone and floods disrupted much of economic progress mozambique had made in 1990s since end of its civil war elsewhere in southern africa eline brought strong winds and heavy rainfall when it crossed into eastern zimbabwe due to maintaining a well defined structure rivers overflowed their banks in country damaging crops and houses while leaving 15 000 people homeless storm killed 12 people in country flooding from storm extended southward into swaziland and south africa in latter country eline dropped of rainfall in over three days causing limpopo river to reach its highest level in 15 years officials opened dams along limpopo river to prevent structural damage which caused higher levels along river to east at least 21 people died in country and about 80 000 people were left homeless forcing many people into churches and schools damage in limpopo province alone was estimated at 300 million usd to north eline dropped about of rainfall in southern malawi while gusty winds caused a power outage in blantyre farther west rainfall rates of 50 100 mm 2 4 in were also reported in botswana severe tropical storm felicia while eline was making landfall on madagascar another area of convection formed to its east on february 17 within itcz its structure was similar to a monsoon depression due to a large circulation with weak winds near center however it was organized enough to be classified as a tropical disturbance on february 18 to southeast of diego garcia it moved southeastward with increasing convection prompting mauritius meteorological service to name it felicia while still as a tropical depression on february 20 convection however remained disorganized and there were several small circulations within broad gyre after turning to southwest due to a nearby trough felicia s circulation became more compact as evidenced by a quikscat pass outflow increased as wind shear decreased and felicia became a moderate tropical storm on february 21 on same day jtwc initiated advisories on storm as tropical cyclone 12s late on february 22 jtwc upgraded storm to equivalent of a minimal hurricane while mfr estimated peak 10 minute winds of 110 km h 70 mph this was based on a 100 km 60 mi wide eye feature that had developed in storm s center around time of peak intensity felicia passed about 500 km 310 mi southeast of rodrigues interaction of trough and a ridge to east increased wind shear causing storm to weaken on february 24 storm became extratropical while still maintaining a well defined circulation it slowed and looped back to northwest due to a ridge to south gradually becoming less defined and dissipating on february 26 severe tropical storm gloria on february 27 a circulation formed within monsoon trough between diego garcia and st brandon displaced due to wind shear but organized enough for mfr to track it as tropical disturbance 8 shear gradually decreased allowing thunderstorms to organize as it moved westward on february 28 jtwc classified system as tropical cyclone 15s and on february 29 mfr upgraded it to tropical depression status depression turned west northwestward before rounding a ridge and turning to southwest thunderstorms organized into a central dense overcast on march 1 prompting mfr to upgrade it to moderate tropical storm gloria only 150 km 95 mi from northeast coast of madagascar gloria continued quickly to southwest gradually intensifying and developing an eye feature on that basis mfr estimated peak 10 minute winds of 95 km h 60 mph or severe tropical storm status by time it made landfall 10 km 6 mi north of sambava operationally jtwc upgraded gloria to equivalent of a minimal hurricane with 1 minute winds of 120 km h 75 mph although agency downgraded storm to same peak as mfr structure initially remained well defined although circulation became difficult to locate as it progressed through country on march 4 system exited madagascar into mozambique channel with scattered thunderstorms slowly reforming on next day jtwc discontinued advisories although mfr continued monitoring system labeling it as a tropical disturbance on march 8 later that day gloria made landfall near inhambane in southeastern mozambique before turning to a southward drift dissipating on march 10 as a developing disturbance gloria produced winds approaching gale force on st brandon similar conditions were reported on tromelin when gloria struck madagascar it produced sustained winds of 72 km h 45 mph at antalaha about 70 km 45 mi south of sambava storm brought heavy rainfall with reporting a two day total of rains from gloria occurred less than two weeks after cyclone leon eline struck country bringing additional flooding landslides and damage in sambava near where gloria moved ashore storm killed 18 people destroyed hundreds of homes and damaged a road connecting area to capital of madagascar antananarivo farther inland cyclone killed 40 people at overall gloria killed at least 66 people although exact toll was initially unknown due to disrupted communications before gloria emerged into mozambique channel various news outlets noted potential for storm to affect storm ravaged mozambique however minimal rainfall accompanied gloria s final landfall rains were enough to delay flights for a day which were transporting relief aid following eline s devastating landfall in mozambique very intense tropical cyclone hudah a tropical low formed in australian basin on march 24 moving westward due to a strong subtropical ridge to south despite having intensified enough bureau of meteorology did not name system and on march 25 system crossed into south west indian ocean whereupon it was named hudah an eye formed and storm intensified into a tropical cyclone on march 27 well to southeast of diego garcia structure fluctuated due to dry air although hudah was able to intensify steadily on march 31 after conditions became more favorable next day mfr upgraded it to a very intense tropical cyclone estimating peak 10 minute winds of 225 km h 140 mph by contrast jtwc estimated 1 minute winds of 235 km h 145 mph cyclone hudah maintained peak winds until making landfall just southeast of antalaha madagascar on april 2 it weakened greatly over land but like eline it re intensified over mozambique channel it re attained tropical cyclone status on april 5 and reached 10 minute winds of 160 km h 100 mph by time it made landfall on mozambique near pebane mozambique on april 8 it dissipated by next day while in vicinity hudah brought moderate winds to rodrigues st brandon and tromelin cyclone affected same parts of madagascar that were previously impacted by eline and gloria waves reached at least 8 m 26 ft in height along coast storm was considered worst to affect antalaha region in 20 years where 90 of homes were destroyed it was estimated that storm left at least 100 000 people homeless in madagascar and there were 111 deaths in mozambique damage was much less than expected and storm affected areas farther north in country than where eline struck heavy rainfall occurred along coast but was insufficient to cause river flooding strong winds damaged roofs and downed trees mostly around pebane and storm killed three people subtropical depression 13 on april 6 a cold front exited southeast coast of africa into mozambique channel producing a small circulation on next day southeast of mozambique on april 7 system organized into subtropical depression 13 and gradually separated from dissipating cold front a ridge to south steered depression northward as system became better defined however persistent wind shear initially prevented convection from organizing over center on april 9 depression turned northwestward toward mozambique as thunderstorms increased aided by a decrease in wind shear through a shift in jet stream center came very close to mozambique coast near inhambane due to small radius of maximum winds coastline was spared from strong gusts although system dropped of rainfall in inhambane over 48 hours storm turned toward east on april 11 away from land convection organized thereafter into an eye feature but was weaker than thunderstorms in typical tropical cyclones resulting in its subtropical classification mfr estimated peak 10 minute winds of 95 km h 60 mph on april 12 noting that system should have been named but also that its structure has had no recent analogue in basin meanwhile jtwc issued three tropical cyclone formation alerts but never issued advisories an increase in wind shear deteriorated eye feature and convection promptly causing weakening on april 15 circulation dissipated off southwest coast of madagascar moderate tropical storm innocente final storm of year had its origins in australian basin an area of convection persisted on april 8 to southwest of indonesia developing a distinct center two days later while moving to west however thunderstorms were unable to organize due to wind shear on april 11 mfr estimated that system became a tropical disturbance although since it was east of 90deg e agency did not issue advisories at that time on next day system crossed into basin and was classified as tropical disturbance 14 over next few days convection waxed and waned with strongest winds in northern periphery on april 14 jtwc began tracking system as tropical cyclone 26s disturbance maintained a general west southwest trajectory influenced by a ridge to south after slowing down and encountering a more favorable environment system intensified into moderate tropical storm innocente on april 17 reaching peak 10 minute winds of 70 km h 45 mph operationally mfr upgraded innocente to storm status a day earlier only to downgrade and re upgrade it was maintained as a depression during this time return of wind shear again caused weakening beginning on april 18 a weak circulation persisted for several days turning to northwest with brief increases in thunderstorms on april 24 innocente dissipated although circulation drew moisture from south to produce heavy rainfall on mauritius peaking at around 400 mm 8 in other systems right thumb satellite image of long tracked tropical depression in march throughout latter half of january thunderstorms persisted in mozambique channel on january 12 mfr classified an area of convection as tropical disturbance 3 although agency ceased issuing advisories on next day convection persisted with an associated exposed circulation as of january 22 two days later mfr issued one bulletin on system before dropping advisories jtwc tracked system as an area of potential development until january 26 when thunderstorms weakened disturbance brought heavy rainfall to southwestern madagascar which followed a prolonged drought in morombe rainfall over 36 hours accumulated to average yearly total this caused flooding and damage to crops and preceded devastating flooding that affected nation over subsequent months toward end of february itcz produced a large area of convection in eastern portion of basin which would spawn two disturbances on february 29 tropical disturbance 9 formed within system well to southeast of diego garcia convection organized slightly despite easterly wind shear which left circulation exposed on march 1 jtwc classified it as tropical cyclone 17s estimating winds of tropical storm force next day mfr by contrast classified it as a tropical depression while moving generally southwestward convection weakened on march 3 due to wind shear and circulation steered more to west northwest after nearly dissipating on march 5 thunderstorms reorganized possibly due to influence from monsoon it turned back to east possibly due to interaction with approaching cyclone norman in australian basin convection soon after diminished over depression and system dissipated on march 11 near 90dege on march 1 tropical disturbance 10 formed within same system that spawned previous depression only farther to west it also encountered wind shear preventing much intensification system remained nearly stationary and failed to organize more mfr issued its last advisory on march 3 mfr also issued bulletins on norman as tropical disturbance 11 which briefly entered basin on march 10 before dissipating storm names a tropical disturbance is named when it reaches moderate tropical storm strength if a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status west of 55dege then sub regional tropical cyclone advisory centre in madagascar assigns appropriate name to storm if a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status between 55dege and 90dege then sub regional tropical cyclone advisory centre in mauritius assigns appropriate name to storm a new annual list is used every year so no names are retired this was last season to feature all female names in basin astride babiola connie damienne eline felicia gloria
