clients from receiving a fair trial subsequent events 2008 raid state authorities raided yearning for zion ranch in schleicher county texas in april 2008 after texas child protective services cps and other authorities received a number of phone calls from rozita swinton an adult colorado resident swinton falsely claimed to be a 16 year old victim of physical and sexual abuse named sarah who was living at ranch subsequent reports stated that swinton had repeatedly posed as a child victim sarah was not blond blue eyed teen bride she claimed to be but rather a 33 year old african american woman living in colorado springs colo named rozita swinton it s not first time swinton has been accused of duping authorities she s been arrested for false reporting in two separate cases in colorado allegedly setting off frantic manhunts by repeatedly impersonating abuse victims but even as she now faces possible charges in texas swinton remains an elusive and enigmatic figure as one woman who cared for her beliefs swinton might well be a victim of sexual abuse who fractured into multiple personalities to cope with trauma others who ve known her view her as a masterful manipulator with an insatiable appetite for attention in a brief conversation with newsweek swinton only added to mystery there are so many lies about me that have been published she said without elaborating a girl matching sarah s description was not found and authorities rounded up members of church subsequently children 213 boys and 250 girls were separated from their parents and transported to fort concho a

children were unhealthy mistreated or in danger of suffering abuse at hands of flds they were returned to ranch elissa wall who participated in raid by educating texas officials on people publicly defended state s actions saying they have reason to fear that girls are being married and having children at way too young of an age they have reason to fear that children are in a dangerous place it doesn t mean mothers don t love their children it doesn t mean they don t want to be good mothers it just means there are reasons for what texas is doing legal proceedings thumb right 125px warren

to a hospital by helicopter on july 27 2010 conviction of warren jeffs as an accomplice to elissa wall s rape was overturned because instructions given to jurors were erroneous state authorities considered retrying jeffs in utah though matter was complicated when wall was accused of fabricating a key piece of evidence during first trial wall s attorneys had used medical records for proof of a 2002 miscarriage and thus proof of intimacy in marriage michael jeffs defense attorney interviewed jane blackmore wall s midwife at time of miscarriage in november 2010 and alleged that wall had

dwight garner from new york times found story both creepy and quite moving caroline leavitt from people magazine wrote coming on heels of raid on flds compound in eldorado wall s story couldn t be more timely her descriptions of polygamous sect s rigidity are shocking but what s most fascinating is immensely likeable author s struggle to reconcile her longing for happiness with her terror of its consequences fritz lanham of houston chronicle felt that book was too long and that narrative proceeded at too slow a pace he was also critical of reconstructed conversations that appear in book describing them as often sounding contrived film film rights were optioned by sharp independent and killer films in 2008 jeffrey sharp and christine vachon agreed to collaborate in creation of a film
