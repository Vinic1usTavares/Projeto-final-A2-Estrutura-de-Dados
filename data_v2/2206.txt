new york and new jersey campaign was a series of battles in 1776 and winter months of 1777 for control of port of new york and state of new jersey during american revolutionary war between british forces under general sir william howe and continental army under general george washington howe was successful in driving washington out of new york but overextended his reach into new jersey and ended active campaign season in january 1777 with only a few outposts near city british held new york harbor for rest of war using it as a base for expeditions against other targets first landing unopposed on staten island on july 3 1776 howe assembled an army composed of elements that had been withdrawn from boston in march following their failure to hold that city combined with additional british troops as well as hessian troops hired from several german principalities washington had new england soldiers as well as regiments from states as far south as virginia landing on long island in august howe defeated washington in largest battle of war but continental army was able to make an orderly retreat to manhattan under cover of darkness and fog washington suffered a series of further defeats in manhattan with exception of skirmish at harlem heights and eventually withdrew to white plains new york at that point howe returned to manhattan to capture forces washington had left in north of island washington and much of his army then crossed hudson river into new jersey and retreated all way across delaware river into pennsylvania shrinking due to ending enlistment periods desertions and poor morale howe ordered his troops into winter quarters in december establishing a chain of outposts from new york to burlington new jersey washington in a tremendous boost to american morale launched a successful strike against trenton garrison after crossing icy delaware river prompting howe to withdraw his chain of outposts back to new brunswick and coast near new york while washington established his winter camp at morristown during remaining winter months both sides skirmished frequently as british sought forage and provisions britain maintained control of new york city and some of surrounding territory until war ended in 1783 using it as a base for operations elsewhere in north america in 1777 general howe launched a campaign to capture philadelphia leaving general sir henry clinton in command of new york area while general john burgoyne led an attempt to gain control of hudson river valley moving south from quebec and failed at saratoga northern new jersey was scene of skirmishing between opposing forces for rest of war background when american revolutionary war broke out in april 1775 british troops were under siege in boston they defeated patriot forces in battle of bunker hill suffering very high casualties when news of this expensive british victory reached london general william howe and lord george germain british official responsible determined that a decisive action should be taken against new york city using forces recruited from throughout british empire as well as troops hired from small german states fischer pp 76

raise troops and take command of new york s defenses schecter p 67 lee had made some progress on city s defenses when word arrived in late march 1776 that british army had left boston after washington threatened them from heights south of city concerned that general howe was sailing directly to new york washington hurried regiments from boston including general israel putnam who commanded troops until washington himself arrived in mid april schecter pp 67 90 at end of april washington dispatched general john sullivan with six regiments to north to bolster faltering quebec campaign johnston p 63 thumb left upright george washington by charles willson peale 1776 general howe rather than moving against new york withdrew his army to halifax nova scotia and regrouped while transports full of british troops shipped from bases around europe and intended for new york began gathering at halifax in june he set sail for new york with 9 000 men assembled there before all of transports arrived lengel p 135 german troops primarily from hesse kassel as well as british troops from henry clinton s ultimately unsuccessful expedition to carolinas were to meet with howe s fleet when it reached new york general howe s brother admiral lord howe arrived at halifax with further transports after general sailed and immediately followed when general howe arrived in outer harbor of new york ships began sailing up undefended narrows between staten island and long island on july 2 and started landing troops on undefended shores of staten island that day washington learned from prisoners taken that howe had landed 10 000 men but was awaiting arrival of another 15 000 schecter pp 100 103 general washington with a smaller army of about 19 000 effective troops lacked significant intelligence on british force and plans and was uncertain exactly where in new york area howes intended to strike he consequently split continental army between fortified positions on long island manhattan and mainland locations fischer pp 89 381 and also established a flying camp in northern new jersey this was intended as a reserve force that could support operations anywhere along new jersey side of hudson lundin p 109 capture of new york city thumb admiral richard howe from a mezzotint engraving by r dunkarton after painting by john singleton copley howe brothers had been granted authority as peace commissioners by parliament with limited powers to pursue a peaceful resolution to conflict king george iii was not optimistic about possibility of a peace yet i think it right to be attempted whilst every act of vigour is unremittingly carried on ketchum 1973 p 94 their powers were limited to granting of general and special pardons and to confer with any of his majesty s subjects on july 14 pursuant to these powers admiral howe sent a messenger with a letter addressed to george washington esq across harbor ketchum 1973 p 103 washington s adjutant joseph reed politely informed messenger that no person with that title was in their army admiral howe s aide wrote that of an address should not have prevented letter s delivery and howe was said to be visibly annoyed by rejection ketchum 1973 p 104 a second request addressed to george washington esq etc was similarly rejected although messenger was told that washington would receive one of howe s adjutants in that fruitless meeting held july 20 washington pointed out that limited powers howe brothers had been given were not of much use as rebels had done no wrong requiring an amnesty thumb left general william howe 1777

positions driving americans back to their brooklyn heights fortifications general howe then began to lay siege to works but washington skillfully managed a nighttime retreat through his unguarded rear across east river to manhattan island howe then paused to consolidate his position and consider his next move fischer pp 88 102 thumb upright 1 3 lord stirling leading an attack against british in

much of background but formations of red coated soldiers are visible through it small figures some clearly uniformed others not obviously so fight in foreground during battle british had captured general john sullivan admiral howe convinced him to deliver a message to congress in philadelphia and released him on parole washington also gave his permission and on september 2 sullivan told congress that howes wanted to negotiate and had been given much broader powers to treat than those they actually held this created a diplomatic problem for congress which did not want to be seen as aggressive which is how some representatives felt a direct rejection of appeal would appear ketchum p 116 consequently congress agreed to send a committee to meet with howes in a move they did not think would bear any fruit on september 11 howe brothers met with john adams benjamin franklin and edward rutledge in staten island peace conference it had exactly outcome americans expected ketchum 1973 p 117 during this time washington who had previously been ordered by congress to hold new york city was concerned that he might have escaped one trap for another since army was still vulnerable to being surrounded on manhattan to keep his escape routes open to north he placed 5 000 troops in city which then only occupied lower portion of manhattan and took rest of army to harlem heights in first recorded use of a submarine in warfare he also attempted a novel attack on royal navy launching turtle in a failed attempt to sink admiral howe s flagship schecter pp 170 174 on september 15 general howe landed about 12 000 men on lower manhattan quickly taking control of new york city americans withdrew to harlem where they skirmished next day but held their ground fischer pp 102 107 rather than attempting to dislodge washington from his strong position a second time howe again opted for a flanking maneuver landing troops with some opposition in october in westchester county he sought once again to encircle washington to defend against this move washington withdrew most of his army to white plains where after a short battle on october 28 he retreated further north retreat of washington s forces was aided by a dense fog which concealed their movement to british troops this isolated remaining continental army troops in upper manhattan so howe returned to manhattan and captured fort washington in mid november taking almost 3 000 prisoners thumb upright 1 3 depiction of british landing at palisades near fort lee new jersey watercolor attributed to thomas davies four days later november 20 fort lee across hudson river from fort washington was also taken washington brought much of his army across hudson into new jersey but was immediately forced to retreat by aggressive british advance fischer pp 109 125 general howe after consolidating british positions around new york harbor detached 6 000 men under command of two of his more difficult subordinates henry clinton and hugh earl percy to take newport rhode island which they did without opposition on december 8 ridpath p 2531 while he sent general lord cornwallis to chase washington s army through new jersey americans withdrew across delaware river into pennsylvania in early december reactions outlook of continental army and thus revolution itself was bleak these are times that try men s souls wrote thomas paine in american crisis fischer p 140 washington s army had dwindled to fewer than 5 000 men fit for duty and would be significantly reduced after enlistments expired at end of year schecter pp 266 267 spirits were low popular support was wavering and congress had abandoned philadelphia fearing a british attack fischer pp 138 142 washington ordered some of troops that returned from failed invasion of quebec to join him and also ordered general lee s troops which he had left north of new york city to join him fischer p 150 lee whose relationship with washington was at times difficult made excuses and only traveled as far as morristown new jersey when lee strayed too far from his army on december 12 his exposed position was betrayed by loyalists and a british company led by lieutenant colonel banastre tarleton surrounded inn where he was staying and took him prisoner lee s command was taken over by john sullivan who finished marching army to washington s camp across river from trenton schecter pp 262 266 thumb left upright 1 2 a hand drawn period sketch depicting locations of british outposts in new jersey orientation is with north to right capture of lee presented howes with a problematic prisoner as with a number of other continental army leaders he had previously served in british army because of this howes at first treated him as a deserter with threats of military punishment however washington intervened tying treatment of lee to treatment of prisoners he held lee was ultimately treated well and apparently offered british commanders advice on how to win war lengel p 289 because americans did not have a prisoner of comparable rank lee remained a prisoner in new york until 1778 when he was exchanged for richard prescott leckie p 471 failure of continental army to hold new york also brought about a rise in loyalist activity as city became a haven for refugee supporters of crown from elsewhere across region british therefore actively recruited in new york and new jersey to build regiments of provincial militia with some success loyalists in these areas may have been motivated by seeing elements of rebel army head home after their enlistments ended ketchum 1973 pp 181 189 one new york patriot militia leader wrote that thirty of his men rather than with him had instead signed up with enemy ketchum 1973 p 190 on november 30 admiral howe offered amnesty to anyone that had taken up arms against crown provided they swore an oath to it washington responded with his own proclamation suggesting that those who did not renounce such oaths should immediately go behind british lines ketchum 1973 pp 191 193 as a result new jersey became a civil battlefield with militia activity as well as spying and continuing for rest of war lundin pp 403 news of capture of new york was favorably received in london and general howe was awarded order of bath for his work ketchum 1973 p 269 combined with news of recovery of quebec circumstances suggested to british leaders that war could be ended with one more year s campaigning ketchum 1973 p 191 news of admiral howe s amnesty proclamation was met with some surprise as its terms were more lenient than hardliners in government expected politicians opposed to war pointed out that proclamation failed to mention primacy of parliament furthermore howes were criticized for failing to keep parliament informed of various peace efforts they embarked on ketchum 1973 p 192 howe s strategy with campaign at an apparent conclusion for season british established a chain of outposts in new jersey stretching from perth amboy to bordentown and entered winter quarters they controlled new york harbor and much of new jersey and were in a good position to resume operations in spring with rebel capital of philadelphia in striking distance schecter pp 259 263 howe detached general clinton with 6 000 men to occupy newport rhode island as a base for future operations against boston and connecticut clinton occupied newport in early december without opposition fischer p 137 howe then sketched a campaign for following year in a letter to lord germain 10 000 men at newport 10 000 for an expedition to albany to meet an army descending from quebec 8 000 to cross new jersey and threaten philadelphia and 5 000 to defend new york if additional foreign forces were available operations could also be considered against southern states ketchum 1973 p 212 washington s counterstrike while worrying over how to hold his army together washington organized attacks on relatively exposed british outposts which were as a result continually on edge due to ongoing militia and army raids german commanders carl von donop and johann rall whose brigades were at end of chain of outposts were frequent targets of these raids but their repeated warnings and requests for support from general james grant were dismissed fischer pp 182 190 thumb upright 1 2 emanuel leutze s 1851 painting washington crossing delaware is an iconic image of american history beginning in mid december washington planned a two pronged attack on rall s outpost in trenton with a third diversionary attack on donop s outpost in bordentown plan was aided by fortuitous presence of a militia company that drew donop s entire 2 000 man force away from bordentown to south that resulted in a skirmish at mount holly on december 23 consequence of this action was that donop was not in a position to assist rall when washington s attack on trenton took place fischer pp 188 203 on night of december 25 26 washington and 2 400 men stealthily crossed delaware and surprised rall s outpost following morning in a street to street battle killing or capturing nearly 1 000 hessians this action not only significantly boosted army s morale it also brought cornwallis out of new york he reassembled an army of more than 6 000 men and marched most of them against a position washington had taken south of trenton leaving a garrison of 1 200 at princeton cornwallis then attacked washington s position on january 2 1777 and was three times repulsed before darkness set in fischer pp 209 307 during night washington once again stealthily moved his army going around that of cornwallis with intention of attacking princeton garrison schecter p 267 hugh mercer leading american advance guard encountered british soldiers from princeton under command of charles mawhood british troops engaged mercer and in ensuing battle mercer was mortally wounded washington sent reinforcements under general john cadwalader which were successful in driving mawhood and british from princeton with many of them fleeing to cornwallis in trenton british lost more than one quarter of their force in battle and american morale rose with victory schecter p 268 defeats convinced general howe to withdraw most of his army from new jersey only leaving outposts at new brunswick and perth amboy washington entered winter quarters at morristown having retaken most of state from british however provisions for both armies were limited and commanders on both sides sent out parties to forage for food and other supplies for next few months they engaged in a forage war in which each targeted foraging parties of other this led to numerous skirmishes and minor confrontations including battle of millstone british also sniped with each other over subject of provisions lord percy resigned his command after a series of disagreements with howe came to a head over ability of newport station to provide forage to new york and new jersey forces fredriksen p 386 aftermath thumb general charles cornwallis 1st marquess cornwallis by john singleton copley british gained control of new york harbor and surrounding agricultural areas and held new york city and long island until war ended in 1783 ward p p xlii americans suffered significant casualties and lost important supplies but washington managed to retain core of his army and avoid a decisive confrontation that could have ended war with bold strokes of trenton and princeton he had regained initiative and boosted morale ketchum pp 395 396 areas around new york city in new york new jersey and connecticut were an ongoing battleground for rest of war ward pp 616 628 early reports that general howe sent to his superiors in london concerning battles at trenton and princeton attempted to minimize their significance blaming rall for trenton and trying to recast princeton as a nearly successful defense not everyone was fooled by his accounts in particular lord germain in a letter to hessian general leopold philip von heister germain wrote that officer who commanded forces at trenton and to whom this misfortune is to be attributed has lost his life by his rashness ketchum 1973 p 324 heister in turn had to report loss to his ruler frederick ii landgrave of hesse kassel with news that not only had an entire brigade been lost but sixteen regimental colors and six cannon as well news reportedly enraged frederick who broadly suggested that heister return home which he did turning over command of hessian forces to wilhelm von knyphausen ketchum 1973 pp 325 326 frederick also ordered extensive inquiries into events of 1776 that took place in new york from 1778 to 1782 these inquiries created a unique archive of materials about campaign fischer p 427 news of washington s successes reached paris at a critical time britain s ambassador to france lord stormont was preparing complaints to france s foreign minister comte de vergennes concerning semi secret financial and logistical support france had been giving to rebels stormont had learned that supplies bound for america were to be shipped under french flags where they had previously sent under american colors he wrote that french court was extremely happy with news and that french diplomatic position noticeably hardened that m de vergennes is hostile in his heart and anxious for success of rebels i have not a shadow of a doubt ketchum 1973 pp 388 389 next steps british planned two major operations for 1777 campaign season first was an ambitious plan to gain control of hudson river valley whose central thrust was a move along lake champlain by army from quebec under general john burgoyne execution of this plan ultimately failed ending with surrender of burgoyne s army at saratoga new york in october second operation was general howe s plan to take philadelphia which after a difficult start met with success in september lengel pp 216 250 washington s strategy in 1777 continued to be a basically defensive one he successfully fended off an attempt by howe to draw him into a general engagement in northern new jersey but was unable to prevent howe s later success taking philadelphia he did send material help to general horatio gates who was tasked with defending against burgoyne s movements lengel pp 220 221 major general benedict arnold and daniel morgan s riflemen all played a notable role in defeat of burgoyne following which france entered war ketchum 1997 p 515 legacy thumb upright a plaque commemorating
