m32 armored recovery vehicle was an armored recovery vehicle arv used during world war ii and korean war by united states and was based on chassis of m4 sherman during world war ii british also used several hundred m32s which were obtained through lend lease in 1944 first four prototypes were produced in january 1943 labeled t5 t5e1 t5e2 t5e3 and t5e4 after a series of tests at aberdeen proving grounds prototypes were approved as m32 m32e1 m32e2 m32e3 and m32e4 however m32e4 never entered production there were also variants that had horizontal volute spring suspension hvss which were demarcated by an a1 after model lima locomotive started production of vehicles in june 1943 with five m32b2s and 46 m32b3s pressed steel car produced 163 m32s and 475 m32b1s in 1944 they also produced 298 m32b3s baldwin locomotive produced 195 m32b1s while 398 m32b1s were produced by federal machine before end of 1944 many m32s were converted into m34 prime movers used to pull heavy artillery m32s were used after 1944 during operation overlord and subsequent battles in european theater of operations it was also used during korean war it was phased out after introduction of m74 tank recovery vehicle in 1954 when heavier tanks were produced such as m46 patton m32 had a winch boom and an a frame jib it was armed with two machine guns and a mortar mainly to provide cover for an emergency retreat specifications m32 tank recovery vehicle was an armored recovery vehicle based on chassis of m4 sherman adding an boom an a frame jib and a winch it was long adding when boom which is used to lift damaged vehicles was fully extended width was and height was it weighed either m32 m32b1 and m32b3 or m32b2 depending on model engine varied between which variant of m4 sherman it was based upon so m32 and m32b1 model had a continental c1 or c4 9 cylinder radial gasoline engine running at 2 400 rpm m32b2 model had a general motors twin diesel engine running at 2 100 rpm and m32b3 model had a ford gaa v8 gasoline engine running at 2 600 rpm engines varied depending on variant of m4 sherman vehicle was based on because m32s were based on m4 sherman range and fuel capacity varied between and respectively depending on engine however top speed remained constant at doyle 2011 p 413 hogg 2014 p 40 it had a spicer manual transmission with one reverse and five forward gears suspension was for earlier variants and hvss for variants demarcated with an a1 it had between of armor depending on location it had an armament that consisted of an 81 mm mortar which was used to cover emergency retreats and a m2 browning machine gun combined with a m1919 machine gun there were 20 hand grenades fragmentation mk ii and six smoke grenades in crew compartment armament was used only for self defense as vehicle was not designed to be used as an offensive weapon development history in early 1942 us army began mobilizing and reequipping for war in europe based on british combat experience from earlier in war united states ordnance department determined that army would need vehicles that could be used to recover armored vehicles that had been damaged in combat british had already developed several armored recovery vehicles based on m4 sherman such as avre and however ordnance department did not wish to use these variants and ordered several new arv prototypes to be developed also based on m4 sherman ware 2014 pp 109 110 basic prototypes of m32 were created by lima locomotive on january 11 1943 prototypes were labeled t5 t5e1 t5e2 t5e3 and t5e4 these designs competed against t2 and t7 designs which both had a turret mounted boom at aberdeen proving grounds t5 was declared superior to t2 and t7 designs after several weeks of testing four prototypes were sent to aberdeen t5 and t5e1 camp hood t5e2 and camp seely t5e4 however during testing t5e3 s engine was damaged so it could not go through further testing standardized designs of t5 t5e1 t5e2 t5e3 and t5e4 as m32 m32e1 m32e2 m32e3 and m32e4 in june 1943 this protocol also terminated t7 project however m32e4 did not enter production hunnicutt 1971 pp 474 476 many m32s were converted into m34 prime movers which were used to tow heavy artillery were unarmed and had special equipment to pull heavy artillery hogg 2014 p 81 production history production of m32 was started by lima locomotive which converted five m32b2s in june 1943 they also intermittently produced 26 m32b3s in may 1944 followed by 20 more vehicles in summer of 1944 pressed steel car produced 163 m32s and 475 m32b1s from december 1943 to december 1944 pressed steel car also converted 298 m4a3 shermans into m32b3s between may and december 1944 baldwin locomotive works and federal machine were licensed to produce m32 variants in november 1944 baldwin locomotive works produced 195 m32b1s before june 1945 and latter produced 385 m32b1s before may of that year in total 1562 m32s were produced service history left thumbnail an recovery vehicle backing up into a ditch after passing a bridge on road to hamhung during korean war m32 entered service with us army in july 1943 they served in italian campaign caddick adams 2013 p 197 operation overlord and many other battles in european theater of operations a1 variants which were converted by baldwin locomotive in 1945 also served until end of korean war hunnicutt 1971 p 477 m74 tank recovery vehicle replaced after korean war in 2001 p 27 after production of heavier tanks such as m46 patton hunnicutt 1971 p 478 m32 was considered inadequate for its role as an armored recovery vehicle especially during korean war because of narrow tracks which gave vehicle insufficient flotation to move over poor terrain such as mud and power of engine was insufficient to pull large tanks such as m26 pershing some m32b1s were also shipped to britain under lend lease where they were designated arv mark iii by british army chamberlain ellis 1969 p 131 ordnance department attempted to replace m32 with t12 armored recovery vehicle in 1944 in m26 pershing companies but t12 became too expensive and so was never put on production line zaloga 2000 p 34 m32 was also planned to have mine exploding equipment such as t1e1 earthworm and t2e1 mine exploder however only t1e1 had any service with vehicle chamberlain ellis 1969 p 121 several m32s were loaned to israeli army in late 1940s by u s they saw service in suez crisis six day war and yom kippur war to tow super shermans haskew 2016 p 216 several m32s saw service in mexican army under nickname until 1998 u s loaned mexico these m32s shortly after world war ii haskew 2016 p 218 some m32 and were also sent to tito s yugoslavia during informbiro period variants m32 original version based on m4 sherman 163 were produced by pressed steel car in 1944 green 2014 pp 102 103 m32b1 a m32 based on m4a1 1 085 were produced by federal machine baldwin locomotive and pressed steel car some were also shipped to britain under lend lease it was named arv mark iii by british army m32b2 a m32 based on 26 were produced by lima locomotive m32b3 a m32 based on m4a3 344 were produced by lima locomotive and pressed steel car a m32 based on never entered production had a chrysler engine a m32 with hvss suspension a m32b1 with hvss suspension 175 were converted by baldwin locomotive a m32b2 with hvss suspension a m32b3 with hvss suspension m34 prime mover m34 prime movers were simply m32b1 recovery vehicles without towing cable and were just used for pulling towed artillery into place zaloga 2011 p 40 it was typically reserved for pulling heavy artillery such as 240 mm howitzer bishop 2002 p 60 it lacked any armament and had four seats for crew vehicle also had tail lights electric outlets for stopping of towed loads and multiple stowage ports production started in 1944 and ended in 1945 additional equipment t1e1 mine exploder earthworm this mine exploding equipment which was meant to be used with boom on m32 was essentially t1 mine exploder with slightly different trailing discs developed and produced in 1943 it saw limited use in war t2e1 mine exploder this mine exploding equipment which was meant to be used with boom on m32 was essentially t2 mine exploder but scaled up for use by u s marines it was impractical and project was abandoned in october 1943 references citations bibliography external
