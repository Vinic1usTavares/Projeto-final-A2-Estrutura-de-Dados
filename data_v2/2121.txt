liberty head double eagle or coronet double eagle is an american twenty dollar gold piece struck as a pattern coin in 1849 and for commerce from 1850 to 1907 it was designed by mint of united states chief engraver james b longacre largest denomination of united states coin authorized by mint act of 1792 was eagle or ten dollar piece large amount of bullion being brought east after discovery of gold in california in 1840s caused congress to consider new denominations of gold coinage gold dollar and double eagle were result after considerable infighting at philadelphia mint chief engraver james b longacre designed double eagle and it began to be issued for commerce in 1850 only one 1849 double eagle is known to survive and it rests in national numismatic collection at smithsonian coin was immediately successful merchants and banks used it in trade it was struck until replaced by saint gaudens double eagle in 1907 and many were melted when president franklin d roosevelt recalled gold coins from public in 1933 millions of double eagles were sent overseas in international transactions throughout its run to be melted or placed in bank vaults many of latter have now been repatriated to feed demand from collectors and those who desire to hold gold inception under mint act of 1792 largest denomination coin was gold eagle or ten dollar piece also struck were a half eagle 5 and quarter eagle 2 50 bullion flowed out of united states for economic reasons for much of late 18th and early 19th centuries eagle s size made it convenient for use in international transactions and faced with likelihood that most being struck were exported director of mint elias boudinot ended its production in 1804 in 1838 coinage resumed after congress revised weight and fineness of american gold coins new eagle was struck to a design by christian gobrecht who was one of mint s engravers in 1836 public ledger a philadelphia newspaper proposed issuance of both a gold dollar and a twenty dollar piece they wrote of latter twenty silver dollars are an encumbrance in a pocket if we are to have larger coins let them be of gold along with eagle which has size of half dollar we would recommend double eagle which would be of size of our silver dollar and would contain value of twenty others perceived a need for a large u s gold coin to be used in international transactions american merchants sometimes used high denomination latin american gold coins for that purpose no proposal for a gold twenty dollar piece was considered until after california gold rush beginning in 1848 greatly increased amount of metal available in united states increase in supply of gold caused silver coins to be worth more than their face value and they were heavily exported generating new support for a gold dollar to take their place in commerce quantity of gold made a larger denomination desirable as well to more efficiently convert gold to coins in january 1849 north carolina congressman james iver mckay amended his previously introduced legislation for a gold dollar to provide for a double eagle as well he wrote to mint director robert m patterson who responded there can be no other objection to double eagle except that it is not needed it will be a handsome coin between half dollar and dollar in size concerned about likely whig opposition to coinage bill mckay got his fellow democrat new hampshire senator charles atherton to introduce bill in senate on february 1 1849 atherton was chairman of senate finance committee mckay introduced a version of bill into house on february 20 debate began same day dollar was attacked on ground it would be too small double eagle on claim that it would be heavily abraded in circulation and would become lightweight mckay did not respond substantively but stated that if no one wanted these denominations they would be unasked for at mint and would not be coined pennsylvania representative joseph ingersoll a whig spoke against bill noting that patterson opposed new denominations ingersoll stated that a twenty dollar piece would be doubled into a ponderous and unparalleled size nevertheless bill providing for issuance of gold dollar and double eagle passed both houses by large margins and was signed into law by president james k polk on march 3 1849 according to numismatist david lange double eagle was a banker s coin intended to simplify transfers of large sums between financial institutions and between nations preparation act authorizing gold dollar and double eagle precipitated conflict at philadelphia mint there officers including chief coiner franklin peale were mostly friends and relations of director patterson outsider in their midst was chief engraver james b longacre successor to gobrecht who had died in 1844 a former copper plate engraver longacre had been appointed through political influence of south carolina senator john c calhoun patterson despised calhoun and longacre became a loner at mint most of peale s formal duties were performed by his predecessor adam eckfeldt who continued to do work of chief coiner despite his retirement peale spent resulting free time running a private medal business taking commissions from public and using government s facilities including its contamin portrait lathe this machine used in peale s medal work was needed to reduce models of new designs to coin sized reductions from which working dies could be made so long as no new coin designs were needed dies could be reproduced mechanically without using contamin device although it belonged to his department longacre did not use contamin lathe much until congress ordered that two new coins be struck when longacre began work on two new coins in early 1849 he had no assistants he completed work on gold dollar first anxious to show that he could create a coin design in may he requested that patterson hire another engraver to assist him director declined willing only to have engraving work contracted out this was unsatisfactory to longacre who was responsible under law for proper execution of coinage dies and who could not supervise outside work as longacre worked on double eagle design according to numismatist walter breen peale with patterson s tacit approval began harassment longacre prepared a large model of new coin in wax and was instructed to give it to peale for use in preparing a metal which could be used in lathe operation failed and longacre s model was destroyed longacre had however made a cast of his model in plaster and was able to use it in machine resulting steel die had to be hardened in peale s department as longacre put it it unluckily split in process according to numismatic historian don taxay peale s adoption of a process not normally used at mint together with its catastrophic failures seems more than coincidental longacre set forth on a third attempt to create a die he was hampered not only by continued opposition of peale but by poor lighting and noxious fumes that penetrated his office at philadelphia mint a friend new york engraver charles cushing wright arranged for peter f cross to assist longacre with making hubs and dies cross made first obverse die in november and december 1849 at longacre s direction and chief engraver made reverse on december 22 1849 patterson wrote to treasury secretary william m meredith that dies were completed he enclosed a double eagle asking meredith if he approved of piece to send word as quickly as possible to allow coinage of 1849 double eagles in quantity before any reply could be received peale objected on december 24 complaining that relief of head of liberty was so high that pieces struck using philadelphia mint s steam powered machinery could not fully bring out design coin sent to meredith had been coined on a medal press by hand in addition peale alleged that head was in such high relief that coins would not stack patterson sent peale s letter to meredith on december 25 noting that this meant there would be a lengthy delay longacre completed lower relief dies about january 12 1850 peale did not test them for two weeks when he did he rejected them stating that liberty s head opposed eagle on reverse making it difficult for full design to be brought forth he stated that longacre would have to move position of head longacre outraged appealed to director patterson who took no action but early next month came to see longacre in his office he told engraver that taylor administration which had taken office in march 1849 had decided on longacre s removal and urged him to send in his resignation as quickly as possible longacre did not resign but went to washington to see secretary meredith he found that patterson had lied to meredith about a number of matters for example when longacre took a new double eagle from his pocket meredith expressed surprise believing that dies from which it had been made had been broken longacre kept his job according to numismatic author q david bowers longacre s last set of dies were completed in february 1850 and were accepted breen however stated that first production coins appeared about january 26 1850 only one 1849 double eagle is known to be extant it forms part of smithsonian institution s national numismatic collection specimen sent to meredith is and is said to have been owned in 1950s by coin dealer william k nagy whose former business partner john w haseltine supposedly acquired it from meredith estate nagy allegedly stated that he had sold coin to a private collector one 1849 piece in gilt brass was later struck for philadelphia druggist and numismatist robert coulton davis who had close ties to mint its location is also unknown design obverse depicts a head of liberty in greco roman style facing left with her hair pulled back according to numismatists jeff garrett and ron guth attractively in a bun some of her hair descends back of her neck she wears a coronet inscribed liberty and is surrounded by thirteen stars representative of original states and year of issue reverse features a heraldic eagle holding a double ribbon on which e pluribus unum is inscribed double ribbon is an allusion by longacre to denomination of piece he was designing design is a variant on great seal of united states eagle protects a shield which represents nation and holds an olive branch and arrows above bird longacre again placed thirteen stars arranged as a halo together with an arc of rays longacre s initials jbl appear on truncation of head gold dollar and twenty dollar piece were first american federal coins on which designer s initials appear on gold dollar only l is used longacre s designs for double eagle and type i gold dollar 1849 1854 are similar art historian cornelius vermeule disliked double eagle and other longacre coins showing liberty calling them routine he did find that reverse has some commendable points of heraldic imagery and likened that side of coin to frontispiece for a patriotic brochure daily alta california in may 1850 reprinted a piece from an unnamed eastern newspaper which said of new piece we cannot say that we admire it eagle on reverse is imperfectly formed and marred by some adjacent intended for radiance we suppose by which whole thing is rendered confused journal of commerce a new york periodical suggested that piece be replaced with one showing george washington on one side and on other a handsome eagle standing out as if it were not ashamed of itself boston evening transcript suggested that mint authorities should be stopping issuance of this very shabby coin manager of mint would seem to be utterly destitute of taste to allow such a specimen to go forth bowers writing in 2004 stated that despite negative contemporary reaction design of double eagle is now very popular among collectors production type i 1850 1866 double eagle soon became most popular gold coin in terms of number of pieces struck during denomination s life from 1850 to 1933 far more gold was struck into double eagles than into all other denominations combined of all gold coins struck from start of gold coinage for circulation in 1795 to end in 1933 just under half of coins struck were double eagles but 78 of gold used was struck into twenty dollar pieces according to bowers double eagle represented most efficient way to coin a given quantity of gold bullion into coin form regular production of double eagle began with striking of just over a million at philadelphia in 1850 and 141 000 at new orleans mint that year double eagles were struck at new orleans every year from 1850 to 1861 generally in small quantities in early years of liberty head double eagle when no mint was in far west some california gold was presented there for coining into double eagles once san francisco mint opened in 1854 new orleans mintages were light as for most part only local gold was deposited and there was not much of it philadelphia mint continued to receive much of california gold after louisiana seceded from union in 1861 some of double eagles from new orleans that year though bearing standard designs were struck under authority of state of louisiana and later confederacy that mint then closed reopening in 1879 branch mints at charlotte and which also closed with civil war had limited coinage facilities and struck no denomination higher than a half eagle a shortage of gold coins occurred in california and far west in early 1850s federal authorities refused to accept gold dust for payment of customs duties and private minters soon stepped into breach california senator william gwin proposed legislation to establish assay offices in california and for issuance of high denomination gold coins as large as 10 000 although most of his proposals were defeated an assay office was established at san francisco nevertheless two waves of panic related to money roiled california and in 1852 congress established san francisco mint first double eagle was coined there on april 3 1854 struck in proof condition that piece is now part of national numismatic collection just over half of double eagles struck between 1850 and 1933 were minted at san francisco many of high grade san francisco type i double eagles known today were taken from shipwrecks where they had rested for over a century these ships included ss brother jonathan ss central america and ss yankee blade thousands of almost pristine 1857 double eagles struck at san francisco 1857 s went down with central america when it sank off east coast of united states that september as did some 435 people including captain william herndon cargo was salvaged beginning in 1980s once litigation over its ownership was settled pieces were marketed to public brother jonathan a luxurious paddle steamer en route from san francisco north to portland sank in july 1865 few survived wreck thousands of double eagles and other coins on board were salvaged beginning in 1996 and once litigation concluded many mint state double eagles came on market thumb right upright 1861 paquet reverse word liberty on double eagles between 1850 and 1858 was originally spelled by longacre who converted second l into an i this is visible under magnification in 1860 assistant engraver anthony c paquet completed a revision of reverse with taller narrower letters after production had begun in early 1861 at philadelphia and san francisco it was noticed that design lacked a rim high enough to protect design from abrasion and mint went back to old reverse only a handful of philadelphia specimens were not melted but by time word reached san francisco to stop production western mint had issued 20 000 pieces a philadelphia specimen sold at auction for 1 610 000 in august 2006 setting a record for liberty head double eagle series in february 2013 an 1866 s double eagle with no motto was discovered in saddle ridge hoard in gold country on western slope of sierra nevada in california only a very small number of proof coins in liberty head double eagle series were struck for sale to public beginning in 1858 at philadelphia breen noted few collectors could afford them even then type ii 1866 1876 with nation in midst of an internal war in november 1861 secretary of treasury salmon p chase received a proposal that american coinage bear an expression of faith in god after various wordings were considered in god we trust was placed on new two cent piece in 1864 act of march 3 1865 that authorized copper nickel three cent piece also required motto to appear on all coins large enough to bear it pursuant to this mandate longacre began re engraving various denominations of u s coinage in 1866 he added in god we trust to all coins that did not already have it excepting pieces smaller in diameter than nickel a coin which began to be struck that year san francisco mint used up leftover double eagle reverse dies from 1865 before switching over during 1866 longacre made required addition to double eagle by slightly enlarging circle of stars on reverse and placing motto within it he took opportunity to make other changes to double eagle shield on reverse was given rococo sides previously they had been straight a ninth leaf was added to olive branch and shape of leaves was changed finials of scroll were made smaller though more elaborate on left hand scroll finials impinge less on letters in pluribus than before eagle s wings and tail feathers were also slightly elongated in 1870 carson city mint opened in nevada at urging of silver mining interests so that ore could be refined and converted to coin locally in addition to silver it struck gold half eagles eagles and double eagles 1870 cc double eagle like other coins from that mint s first year of operations is a great rarity only 3 789 were struck one sold for 414 000 at auction in march 2009 carson city double eagles circulated for most part only locally since they were only struck in response to deposit of gold bullion and request of depositor that it be coined into twenty dollar pieces heavy production of coin occurred in san francisco and satisfied needs of californians and those in export trade as gold did not circulate in east most philadelphia pieces of this era were either sent west or exported and melted in november 1872 chief engraver william barber longacre s successor submitted a set of to show how following year s date would appear on coinage they were approved but on january 18 1873 chief coiner a loudon snowden filed a written complaint stating that 3 in date too closely resembled an 8 barber was ordered to redo his work this decision affected most denominations of u s coins differences between closed 3 and open 3 on double eagle are small one difference is that on closed 3 two knobs on 3 are equal in size on open 3 upper one is somewhat smaller all carson city and most san francisco issues from that year are closed 3 type iii 1877 1907 thumb right obverse of 1904 double eagle william barber s modifications left more room for date in 1876 william barber altered double eagle s reverse emboldening in god we trust two varieties are known as heavy motto and light motto types he made more extensive changes for following year s production he truncated liberty s neck at a sharper angle to allow more space for date which was punched into dies by hand in longacre s original version tip of liberty s coronet is very close to seventh star clockwise from date beginning in 1877 it points between sixth and seventh stars a more noticeable change was made to reverse where denomination formerly twenty d was spelled out as twenty dollars phrase e pluribus unum on ribbon that eagle bears was enlarged new dies initially created difficulties at mint and barber made minor adjustments to design over first few months of production many double eagles were struck at san francisco between 1877 and 1883 beginning in 1881 mintage of double eagles at philadelphia was sharply curtailed for seven years 1881 1887 only 4 521 were made at that mint for circulation none being struck in 1882 1883 and 1887 they were struck yearly in proof at philadelphia 1883 mintage 92 1884 71 and 1887 121 are great rarities mintage of 2 325 at new orleans in 1879 only postwar strikings there is unexplained breen suggested that local mint superintendent might have anticipated demand for denomination double eagles were unpopular in commerce in south as were eagles millions of double eagles were sent to europe as payment in international transactions beginning in 1880s often in cloth bags containing 250 coins for a total of 5 000 per bag thumb left upright a 1900 cartoon from puck magazine shows gold standard represented by double eagle triumphant over silver in 1900 william barber s successor as chief engraver his son charles e barber slightly adjusted design other modifications to u s coins about that time suggest that he most likely did it as part of a plan to re engrave all denominations most significant change made by charles barber was smoothing back of eagle s neck in 1904 mint set records for production of double eagles 6 256 699 at philadelphia and 5 134 175 at san francisco highs for series for those mints only higher production of double eagles after liberty head series ended was figure of 8 816 000 from philadelphia in 1928 1891 discovery of gold at cripple creek colorado in 1891 led to a gold rush there greater availability of gold in colorado was one reason denver mint was authorized in 1904 it opened in 1906 about a dozen proofs were struck for presentation to dignitaries when production of double eagles was inaugurated at denver on april 4 1906 replacement in 1904 president theodore roosevelt complained to his secretary of treasury leslie m shaw about designs on american coinage and enquired if a sculptor such as president s friend augustus saint gaudens could be hired to provide beautiful up to date designs following year mint hired saint gaudens to create new designs for four gold pieces then being struck as well as cent other commissions delayed him and as he became more ill with cancer that would kill him his work slowed chief engraver barber repeatedly objected to design saint gaudens finally submitted which shows liberty striding across a rocky outcrop on grounds that its relief was too high after saint gaudens s death on august 3 1907 barber produced his own low relief version of saint gaudens s coin its striking began in late 1907 and it entered commerce that december thereby putting an end to liberty head double eagle series collecting large quantities of double eagles were melted in 1930s by government after they were called in under president franklin d roosevelt although many of double eagles exported in bulk in late 19th and early 20th centuries were melted records show that most sent to united kingdom were recoined into sovereigns millions remained in banks large quantities of double eagles were found in vaults of european banks beginning in 1940s and were placed on numismatic market many common and low grade liberty head double eagles have been sold as investments valued based on their bullion content type i double eagles have been recovered from shipwrecks bringing many high grade early specimens onto market with romance of treasure coins increasing public demand in 19th century double eagles were little collected numismatists did not yet consider mint marked coins to be distinct from those without even proof coins with mintages in dozens or low hundreds sold on secondary market at a slight increase from face value and probably many were spent in hard times in 1909 early numismatic writer edgar h adams published a catalog of american gold issues no liberty head double eagle was considered by adams to be worth more than value inscribed on it as it became clear in 1940s that withdrawal of gold coins in 1933 had left several late date saint gaudens double eagles unexpectedly rare collector interest grew in denomination massive importation of double eagles held overseas once americans were allowed to own gold again in 1974 added to supply but according to numismatic writer and coin dealer bowers today they are of such wide popularity fascination and interest that record prices achieved at an important sale in 1949 seem like incredible bargains there are many ways to collect liberty head double eagles some wishing only a few pieces may choose one each of three major types or seek pieces from five mints that struck them carson city double eagles are highly popular as 1870 cc is almost unobtainable collectors may limit themselves to carson city type iii pieces 1877 1893 collectors seeking one double eagle per year of mintage will find it expensive to fill 1886 entry a year in which double eagles were only struck at philadelphia and just 1 000 business strikes and 106
