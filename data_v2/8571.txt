territorial force was a part time volunteer component of british army created in 1908 to augment british land forces without resorting to conscription new organisation consolidated 19th century volunteer force and yeomanry into a unified auxiliary commanded by war office and administered by local county territorial associations territorial force was designed to reinforce regular army in expeditionary operations abroad but because of political opposition it was assigned to home defence members were liable for service anywhere in uk and could not be compelled to serve overseas in first two months of first world war territorials volunteered for foreign service in significant numbers allowing territorial units to be deployed abroad they saw their first action on western front during initial german offensive of 1914 and force filled gap between near destruction of regular army that year and arrival of new army in 1915 territorial units were deployed to gallipoli in 1915 and following failure of that campaign provided bulk of british contribution to allied forces in sinai and palestine campaign by war s end territorial force had fielded twenty three infantry divisions and two mounted divisions on foreign soil it was demobilised after war and reconstituted in 1921 as territorial army force experienced problems throughout its existence on establishment fewer than 40 per cent of men in previous auxiliary institutions transferred into it and it was consistently under strength until outbreak of first world war it was not considered to be an effective military force by regular army and was denigrated by proponents of conscription lord kitchener chose to concentrate territorial force on home defence and raise new army to reinforce british expeditionary force bef in france a decision which disappointed territorials need to replace heavy losses suffered by bef before new army was ready forced kitchener to deploy territorial units overseas compromising force s ability to defend homeland to replace foreign service units territorial force was doubled in size by creating a second line which mirrored organisation of original first line units second line units assumed responsibility for home defence and provided replacement drafts to first line second line competed with new army for limited resources and was poorly equipped and armed provision of replacements to first line compromised second line s home defence capabilities until a third line was raised to take over responsibility for territorial recruitment and training second line s duties were further complicated by expectation later confirmed that it too would be deployed overseas territorial units were initially deployed overseas to free up regular units from non combat duties on western front individual battalions were attached to regular army formations and sent into action and territorials were credited with playing a key role in stopping german offensive first complete territorial division to be deployed to a combat zone arrived in france in march 1915 territorial divisions began participating in offensive operations on western front from june 1915 and at gallipoli later that year because of way it was constituted and recruited territorial force possessed an identity that was distinct from regular army and new army this became increasingly diluted as heavy casualties were replaced with conscripted recruits following introduction of compulsory service in early 1916 territorial force was further eroded as a separate institution when county territorial associations were relieved of most of their administrative responsibilities by war s end there was little to distinguish between regular territorial and new army formations background thumb left alt

conceded in parliament in february 1900 that instead of augmenting regular army s defence of british coast auxiliary forces were main defence beckett 2011 p 2008 pp 20 26 questionable performance of

met with opposition from auxiliary interests in government and yeomanry in particular proved resistant to change a royal commission on auxiliary forces concluded in 1904 that volunteer organisations were not fit to defend country unaided and that only effective solution would be to introduce conscription beckett 2011 pp 208 209 this option regarded as political suicide by all parties was immediately rejected brodrick s successor h o arnold forster also failed to overcome opposition to his reform efforts simkins 2007 p pp 202 2011 pp 209 212 in december 1905 a liberal government took

lieutenants and run by traditional county military elites beckett 2011 pp 213 2008 pp 31 2008 p 2 militia representatives refused to accept haldane s plans to allocate a proportion of militia as a reserve for regular army and incorporate remainder into territorial force after three attempts to persuade them haldane abolished militia and created special reserve beckett 2011 p 216 crucially haldane s efforts were based on premise that home defence rested with navy and that imperative for army reform was to provide an expeditionary capability dennis pp 5 6 his reorganisation of regular army created a six division expeditionary force and his plan was for territorial force to reinforce it after six months of training following mobilisation representatives of existing auxiliary forces

was introduced in 1910 to allow territorials to volunteer in advance dennis p 19 it was illegal to amalgamate or disband territorial units or transfer members between them beckett 2008 p 63 reception reforms were not received well by auxiliaries exclusion of militia rendered haldane s target of just over 314 000 officers and men for territorial force unattainable new terms of service imposed an

compulsory service simkins 2007 p 17 in his opinion territorial force was last chance for volunteer tradition and its failure would pave way for conscription mitchinson 2008 p 7 advocacy for compulsory service was led by national service league nsl which regarded reliance on a naval defence against invasion as complacent and a strong home army as essential dennis p 17 a bill sponsored by

did not attend at all in 1909 some 37 per cent of rank and file were under 20 years old in opinion of inspector general of home forces this proportion rendered force too immature to be effective in 1913 approximately 40 000 territorials were under 19 years old minimum age at which they could volunteer for service overseas barely seven per cent of force had accepted imperial service obligation seriously compromising its viability as a reinforcement for expeditionary force beckett 2011 pp 221 p 24 because military authorities regarded territorial force as weak and saw no value in an

until direct voluntary recruitment into territorial force ceased in december 1915 had chosen force in preference to new or regular armies they had elected to join local regiments and been imbued with an esprit de corps during their training in those regiments own second and later third lines mitchinson 2014 pp 191 2008 p 73 strong sense of locality was reinforced by a shared civilian background it was not uncommon for territorials to be employed in same office mill or factory and many territorial memoirs betray a sense of family or club a similar sentiment was exploited in raising new army pals battalions but in territorial force this was reinforced by a pedigree that new army units did not possess most territorial units could trace a lineage back to early or mid 19th century through units of yeomanry or volunteers which had for generations been a part of local communities and social life beckett 2008 p 2014 pp 6 15 2007 pp 82 83 replacements in first half of war territorial casualties were generally replaced with drafts from a battalion s own reserve although there were some cases of replacements being sourced from different regions or non territorial units in mid 1916 ranks of territorial units were still largely populated by men who had volunteered specifically for service as a territorial in their local regiment mitchinson 2014 pp 185 186 190 192 legal protections for

retained responsibility for supplying replacements to first and second line units but when unable to do so replacements were sent from training reserve system was organised by region so even if a battalion did not receive replacements from its own regiment they were generally sourced from an appropriate locality but it did not guarantee unit integrity james pp 39 2014 pp 204 206 thumb upright

at least 26 different regiments during battle mitchinson 2014 pp 201 203 others experienced substantial dilution by end of offensive 149th northumberland brigade for example received large numbers of

beckett 2008 pp 63 68 military authorities stated their desire to replenish units with replacements from same regiment or regimental district but stressed that military service acts had removed any obligation to do so and that military expediency sometimes necessitated not doing so mitchinson 2014 pp 200 201 as availability of men of military age dwindled it became increasingly difficult to source replacements from some sparsely populated regions largely rurally recruited 48th south midland and 54th east anglian divisions became increasingly diluted as war progressed while more urbanised

than a handful of men who had embarked with them at start of war territorial units that fought in 1917 and 1918 subject to same system of replacements as rest of british land forces bore little resemblance beyond a geographic origin to those that had sailed in 1914 and 1915 by 1918 there was little to differentiate between regular territorial and new army divisions mitchinson 2014 pp 209 210

territorials against what they perceived as a hostile and patronising attitude from military authorities beckett 2004 p 136 territorial officers and specialists such as doctors vets drivers cooks and dispatch riders received less pay than their counterparts in new army and regular units officers were considered junior to their regular counterparts of same rank leading some to remove t insignia from their uniforms as a badge of inferiority and commanders of second line brigades and third line battalions were a rank lower than their regular counterparts mitchinson 2014 pp 42 45 47 212 although territorial force provided many officers for regular army very few were appointed to higher commands despite pre war promises by haldane that they would be in 1918 government efforts to defend military record on senior territorial promotions failed to acknowledge that most were temporary and in home units ian macpherson under secretary of state for war conceded that just ten territorial officers commanded brigades and only three had been promoted to highest grade of general staff officer beckett 2011 pp 233 235 territorials received scant recognition for their early enthusiasm army council refused to grant any special decorations for those who had accepted imperial service obligation before war territorial war medal awarded to those who had volunteered for service overseas in first months of war was denied to volunteers who had been held back even though they rendered invaluable service training rest of army those who served in india received no campaign medal dennis pp 50 53 three territorial divisions sent to india in 1914 felt penalised by their early readiness men were placed on lower peacetime rates of pay gunners had to purchase

disappointed by kitchener s decision to bypass territorial force associations assisted in recruiting new army alongside their own work raising and equipping territorial units cambridgeshire denbighshire and east riding associations for example together raised 11 new army units in december 1914 associations performed remarkably well in equipping their units despite fact that war office prioritised new army units and in case of leicestershire associations threatened to penalise manufacturers who dealt with any institution other than war office competitive nature of system led to supply according to highest bidder rather than military necessity and in consequence inflated prices as a result territorials were relieved of responsibility for purchase and supply of equipment in favour of a centralised system in may 1915 pp 115 2007 pp 272 2014 p 40 in december 1915 direct recruitment into territorial force ceased next year associations were rendered largely superfluous when administration of several territorial services including second and third line units and home service battalions was taken from them mitchinson 2014 p 50 in march 1917 many territorial depots were shut down as a result of war office centralisation and later same year territorial records offices were closed council of county territorial associations met in september to discuss loss of

opening campaigns of war and arrival of new armies in 1915 demobilisation of territorial force commenced in december 1918 and debate about its reconstitution was begun beckett 2011 p 244 service rendered by force during war and considerable political influence it possessed ensured its survival but there was an extended discussion about what role it should play in absence of any invasion threat there was no requirement to maintain a significant force for home defence and a part time body of volunteers could have no place in imperial garrison with conscription established as means of expanding regular army in a major conflict which ten year rule anyway regarded as unlikely there was no need to maintain a body of volunteers for this role only purpose military authorities could find for territorial force was provision of drafts to reinforce army in medium scale conflicts within empire accordingly war office recommended in march 1919 that force should be liable for service overseas and receive no guarantees about unit integrity dennis pp 38 45 winston churchill secretary of state for war responsible for reconstituting force considered a mandatory imperial obligation unfair and resisted its imposition territorial representatives recognised necessity of such an obligation but opposed force being used simply as a reserve of manpower for army rather than operating as a second line in its own brigades and divisions as haldane had intended territorial support for imperial obligation eventually persuaded churchill to accept it and concerns about unit integrity were allayed by pledge churchill s promise that force would be deployed as complete units and fight in its own formations final sticking point was resolved by resurrection of militia to provide reinforcement drafts to regular army dennis pp 55 57 60 another issue was military aid to civil power during industrial unrest that followed war thinly stretched army was reluctant to become involved so churchill proposed using territorials concerns that force would be deployed to break strikes adversely affected recruitment which had recommenced on 1 february 1920 resulting in promises that force would not be so used government nevertheless deployed territorial force in all but name during miner s strike of april 1921 by hasty establishment of defence force new organisation relied heavily on territorial facilities and personnel and its units were given territorial designations territorials were specially invited to enlist although those that did were required to resign from territorial force their service in defence force counted towards their territorial obligations and they were automatically re admitted to territorial force once their service in defence force was completed dennis pp 60 65 77 territorial force was officially reconstituted in 1921 by territorial army and militia act 1921 and renamed in october as territorial army difficulties posed in war by an auxiliary that maintained a separate identity from regular army were still enshrined in reconstituted auxiliary they were finally addressed by armed forces conditions of service act passed on outbreak of second world war in september 1939 restrictions on territorial terms of service and transfer between units were removed and territorial status was suspended for duration next war would be fought from start
