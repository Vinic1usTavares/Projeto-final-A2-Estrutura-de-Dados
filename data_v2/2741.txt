project isinglass was code name given to two heavily classified crewed reconnaissance aircraft studied by central intelligence agency cia as potential replacements for lockheed a 12 and sr 71 during mid 1960s first proposal under isinglass name a high altitude plane to fly at was considered an insufficient advancement over existing aircraft second much more advanced design sometimes referred to as project rheinberry 2001 p 100 was an air launched rocket powered boost glide aircraft that would use a very high altitude trajectory to avoid defenses this aircraft was considered too costly for development and project was abandoned in 1967 origins project isinglass was developed as a result of vulnerability of existing crewed reconnaissance aircraft such as lockheed u 2 and lockheed a 12 to soviet air defenses in early 1960s catalysed by shooting down in may 1960 of francis gary powers day 2010 although there were continuing plans to overfly soviet union with a 12 referred to by cia as project 1994 p 201 these failed to come to pass and cia began plans for an aircraft with superior performance to replace oxcart convair proposal initial aircraft proposed under project isinglass name was developed by convair division of general dynamics and was developed from work done on super hustler fish and kingfish programs as well as leveraging off work done on f 111 tactical bomber convair s design utilised avionics and hydraulics systems that had been developed for use by f 111 and was intended to be capable of cruising at speeds of mach 4 to mach 5 at an altitude of feasibility study conducted by general dynamics was completed in fall of 1964 aircraft was determined to be too costly and was also still considered potentially vulnerable to projected soviet air defense capabilities so project was halted mcdonnell proposal thumb right a b 52 carrying two d 21 drones isinglass would have been carried and launched in this fashion design and development an alternative design completed by mcdonnell aircraft in 1965 is usually considered part of project isinglass however some documents refer to aircraft as having been codenamed project rheinberry mcdonnell s proposed boost glide aircraft submitted to cia independently of convair isinglass proposals featured a small crewed rocket powered craft with a high lift to drag 2008 that would be air launched by a b 52 bomber while flying over atlantic ocean aircraft would ignite its rocket engine and adopt a trajectory that would take it over soviet union at speeds of mach 20 and at an altitude of over before descending over pacific ocean to a landing at groom lake nevada as a glider landing on lake bed using a skid landing gear isinglass rheinberry concept was considered to be superior to spy satellites in a number of ways including rapid turnaround time and quick response capability as there was little funding to be had from cia budget mcdonnell developed aircraft using its own funds although technical support gleaned from oxcart was supplied by cia mcdonnell rheinberry proposal s shape remains classified although it has been described as being similar to space shuttle albeit much reduced in size a 1 3 cross sectional model of aircraft was constructed to illustrate principles used in its construction simulations showed that aircraft would be essentially unstoppable by existing or projected air defenses even surface to air missiles armed with nuclear warheads could do no better than force aircraft to change course to avoid fringe effects of explosions cancellation following fourteen months of work mcdonnell had developed aircraft to point where serious proposals were made for its construction however neither cia nor national reconnaissance office had an official requirement for such an aircraft in addition projected cost of aircraft was astronomical cost for eight aircraft being projected to be 2 6 billion usd in 1965 dollars inflation adjusted us billion in a sum considered to be far too high for available budget in addition there were concerns that aircraft s trajectory could be mistaken for that of an incoming ballistic missile when cia failed to receive approval for funding mcdonnell approached u s air force with project however air force proved uninterested in adopting cia project despite support of general bernard schriever chief of air force systems command therefore in late 1967 isinglass project was terminated with a brief effort to revive project in 1968 proving unsuccessful engine development although development of isinglass rheinberry aircraft was conducted using mcdonnell s own funding united states air force s air force rocket propulsion laboratory did fund development of aircraft s intended engine pratt whitney xlr 129 intended to be a reusable rocket engine atherton 1971 p 2 to be powered by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen and producing thrust at full throttle development of xlr 129 continued even after cancellation of project isinglass and was considered for use by space shuttle but was cancelled in early 1970s see also references notes citations bibliography further reading external links project isinglass project rheinberry encyclopedia
