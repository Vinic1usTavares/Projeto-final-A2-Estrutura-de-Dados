ham wall is an english wetland national nature reserve nnr situated west of glastonbury on somerset levels and managed by royal society for protection of birds rspb since last ice age decomposing plants in marshes of brue valley in somerset have accumulated as deep layers of peat that were commercially exploited on a large scale in twentieth century consumer demand eventually reduced and in 1994 landowners fisons gave their old workings to what is now natural england who passed management of ham wall section to rspb ham wall reserve was constructed originally to provide reed bed habitat for bittern which at time was at a very low population level in uk site is divided into several sections with independently controllable water levels and machinery and cattle are used to maintain quality of reed beds there are important breeding populations of wetland birds including rare little bittern and great white egret and area hosts several other uncommon animals and plants rspb works with other organisations as part of avalon marshes partnership to coordinate conservation issues across somerset levels reserve is open year round and has nature trails hides and viewing points it lies within somerset levels nnr and somerset levels and moors ramsar and special area of conservation site potential future threats may result from increasing unpredictability in uk climate leading to heavy summer rains and extensive flooding sea level rise will make drainage of levels more difficult and current water pumping facilities may become inadequate landscape at end of last glacial period about 10 000 years ago river valley that would eventually form somerset levels gradually became salt marsh as melting glaciers caused sea levels to rise by around 6 500 to 6 000 years ago marshes had become reed beds interspersed with rhynes ditches and open water and parts of area were in turn colonised by wet woodland when plants died in oxygen poor environment they decayed to form peat and as layers built up they eventually formed a large raised bog which may have reached an extent of in roman times formation of bog was aided by somerset levels large water catchment area high rainfall in mendips and blackdown hills and raised marine clay deposits which restricted drainage to sea natural england 2013 pp 3 12 same impermeable material underlies peat which in places is up to thick williams 1970 pp 6 8 history thumb former peat workings now part of reserve somerset levels have been occupied since neolithic period around 6 000 years ago when people exploited reed swamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways such as sweet and post tracks williams williams 1992 pp 35 38 and they were site of salt extraction during romano british period much of landscape was owned by church in middle ages when substantial areas were drained and rivers diverted but raised bogs remained largely intact only inclosure acts of 18th century mostly between 1774 and 1797 led to significant draining of peat bogs although river bure still regularly flooded reclaimed land in winter havinden 1982 pp 135 136 following 1801 brue drainage act parts of brue were straightened and new feeder channels constructed body gallop 2001 p 7 glastonbury canal which runs through reserve was opened in 1833 it was superseded from 1854 by bristol and exeter railway line that once ran next to it on its way from glastonbury to highbridge railway line closed in 1966 body gallop 2001 pp 41 43 railway and canal both carried peat and people by twentieth century large areas of levels were exploited to meet demands of horticulture for peat owners of workings fisons reaching an annual production of in early 1990s when demand for peat fell towards end of century fisons transferred ownership of much of their land to english nature now natural england in 1994 enabling creation of of wetland nature reserves from diggings english nature handed management of at ham wall to royal society for protection of birds rspb managing rest of land itself apart from an extension to somerset wildlife trust s existing reserve at westhay moor reserve name derives from ham wall rhyne which flows through site rhyne is a local name for drainage channels between plots of land pronounced reens in east and rhine in west of levels area ham is an old term for pasture or meadow and ham wall may have been a bank to hold water on flooded fields ham walls lies within somerset levels national nature reserve and somerset levels and moors ramsar and special area of conservation site natural england 2013 p 25 reserve creation thumb upright bittern impetus for creating ham wall reserve was plight of bittern with only 11 males present in uk in 1997 breeding season much of its reed bed habitat was deteriorating and key coastal sites in eastern england were at risk of salt water flooding so an opportunity to create a new inland site was attractive to rspb peat excavations already had bund walls that allowed water levels on reserve to be easily managed in sections and workings had removed peat down to underlying marine clay a depth of in this area water levels were managed using sluices pipes and wind pumps to create reed beds with about 20 open water and ditches were deepened and widened to restrict reed encroachment and provide a habitat for fish particularly common rudd introduced to provide food for bitterns by completion of major works in 2013 reserve contained of reed bed including of deep water channels and ditches of wet woodland and of grass latter being mainly on bunds and some higher ground ham wall along with lakenheath fen in suffolk has been a key part of a bittern recovery programme initiated in 1994 as part of united kingdom biodiversity action plan both reserves created extensive new reed beds thereby adding significant additional breeding habitat initial funding for recovery scheme was ps60 000 from english nature in 1994 augmented by two rounds of eu funding in 1996 2000 and 2002 2006 access and facilities thumb open water and canal reedbed and ditches hides and viewpoints visitor centre and toilet block woodland footpaths reserve is about west of glastonbury and can be accessed by car from minor road that runs between villages of meare on and ashcott on a39 route 3 of sustrans national cycle network runs near reserve nearest bus access is in ashcott away and railway station in bridgwater is distant natural england s shapwick heath nnr is on opposite side of meare ashcott road natural england 2010 reserve is open and free to enter at all times although its car park has a charge for non members of rspb and closes at night there are toilets and a small visitor centre which sells light snacks and is usually open only at weekends main access to reserve on leaving car park is ham wall loop this follows north bank of canal crosses at a bridge and returns via a parallel grass track in total a short spur runs to avalon hide from canal footpath and two further circular walks and in length are accessed from grass track a section of boardwalk also linking two trails there are two bird hides and six viewing platforms or screens on reserve dogs on leads are allowed on ham wall loop which includes public rights of way but only assistance dogs can be taken elsewhere reserve attracts 70 000 visitors annually management main management of reserve involves cutting reeds in rotation to rejuvenate reed beds and prevent their drying out two machines are used an amphibious tracked reed cutter to harvest wetter areas and a faster for islands and where water levels have been lowered native breeds of cattle are also used to graze reed bed margins cut reeds are turned into a peat free compost and sold for domestic use rspb is one of members of avalon marshes partnership which also includes somerset wildlife trust natural england hawk and owl trust south west heritage trust environment agency and historic england which work together on conservation issues in area between 2012 and 2016 scheme was supported by a heritage lottery fund grant of ps1 772 500 with additional investment of ps920 080 from other sources avalon marshes centre run by natural england is near ham wall reserve network of reserves and private land managed for conservation in avalon marshes means that wetland management can be carried out on a landscape scale joint schemes include reed bed management across area somerset wildlife trust 2012 pp 1 4 improved pedestrian and cycle access somerset wildlife trust 2012 pp 70 74 and provision of visitor facilities at ashcott corner between ham wall and shapwick heath reserves somerset wildlife trust 2012 pp 75 77 fauna and flora birds thumb grey heron at ham wall following sporadic appearances by males over a number of years bitterns were first unequivocally proved to have bred at ham wall in 2008 and reserve now typically holds 18 20 breeding males probably about its maximum capacity with another 20 males elsewhere in avalon marshes reserve has attracted three other heron species that are attempting to colonise uk formerly rare great white egret first bred in 2012 and has nested in small numbers every year since on reserve and neighbouring wetlands little bittern was present from 2009 bred in 2010 and has been present every year since although breeding by this reclusive bird is difficult to prove in such a large expanse of reed bed at least six including four males were present in spring 2017 third coloniser is cattle egret which had bred elsewhere in somerset from 2008 to 2010 an influx in 2017 led to six pairs attempting to breed at ham wall four successfully and 30 birds were present in january 2018 other typical wetland species include grey herons some of which nest in reed beds instead of more usual trees typically two to three pairs marsh harriers three nesting females in 2017 hobbies bearded tits and cetti s reed and sedge warblers a winter evening roost of common starlings is one of largest in uk and attracts visitors to see hundreds of thousands sometimes millions of these birds assemble before descending into reed bed rare visitors to reserve in recent years include a collared pratincole and a whiskered tern in 2016 a singing male pied billed grebe in 2013 a blue winged teal in 2012 and a heron in 2011 other animals and plants thumb upright scarlet tiger moth on reserve in july 2009 otters breed on reserve and two artificial holts have been placed in reed beds for their use water voles can also be found in suitable habitat grass snakes three species of newts common toads and common frogs are found throughout avalon marshes and non native marsh frogs occur at ham wall and neighbouring shapwick heath a recent intervention has been construction of a new edf energy funded eel pass to make it easier for european eels to enter reserve from nearby river huntspill and south drain young eels may remain on reserve for up to 20 years before returning to sea to breed invertebrates found in wetland include several nationally uncommon aquatic molluscs including shining ram s horn snail and depressed river mussel insects include purple hairstreak silver washed fritillary and scarlet tiger moth although marsh fritillary narrow bordered bee hawk moth and large marsh grasshopper have been lost to area since mid 1990s suggesting some conservation issues 19 species of dragonflies and damselflies have been recorded at ham wall including a roost of thousands of four spotted chasers lesser silver water beetle occurs in wet woodland and very rare leaf beetle oulema erichsoni was noted in 2015 apart from common reed that dominates marshes restricted range plants found in brue valley wetlands include rootless duckweed marsh cinquefoil water violet milk parsley and round leaved sundew threats thumb flooding on levels in 2003 greater unpredictability in uk climate may lead to heavy summer rains which would adversely affect ground nesting birds invertebrates and other wildlife natural england 2013 pp 36 37 although this inland site is not directly threatened by salt water incursion in same way as east coast reserves like rspb and titchwell marsh retrieved 11 april 2018 sea level rise will make drainage of somerset levels more difficult and current water pumping facilities may become inadequate despite environment agency planning recent significant river flooding events occurred on levels in november 2012 and following cyclone dirk in winter 2013 2014 latter leaving of agricultural land under water for over a month water based sport and recreation elsewhere in levels could possibly enable non native species to invade wetlands and number of visitors to area can cause congestion on local roads particularly those coming for winter evening starling roost natural england 2013 p 64 references cited texts download download category geography of somerset category national nature
