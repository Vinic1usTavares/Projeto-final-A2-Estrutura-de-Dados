city poverty rates in bay area are shifting such that they are increasing more rapidly in suburban areas than in urban areas it is not yet clear whether suburbanization of poverty is due to relocation of poor populations or shifting income levels in respective regions however mid 2000s housing boom encouraged city dwellers to move into newly cheap houses in suburbs outside of city and these suburban housing developments were then most impacted by 2008 housing bubble burst as such people in poverty experience decreased access to transportation due to underdeveloped public transport

that is a characteristic of california s coast with moist mild winters and dry summers it is largely influenced by cold california current which penetrates natural mountainous barrier along coast by traveling through various gaps in terms of precipitation this means that bay area has pronounced wet and dry seasons wet season which roughly runs between november and march is source of about 82 of annual precipitation in area in south bay and further inland while wet season is cool and mild summer dry season is characterized by warm sunny days while in san francisco and areas closer to golden gate strait dry season is periodically affected by fog due to bay area s diverse topography result of clashing tectonic plates region is home to numerous microclimates that lead to pronounced differences in climate and temperature over short distances within city of san francisco natural and artificial topographical features direct movement of wind and fog resulting in startlingly varied climates between city blocks along golden gate strait oceanic wind and fog from pacific ocean are able to penetrate mountain barriers inland into bay area during summer rising hot air in california s interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from north pacific high through golden gate which creates city s characteristic cool winds and fog microclimate phenomenon is most pronounced during this time when fog penetration is at its maximum in areas near golden gate strait while south bay and areas further inland are sunny and dry along san francisco peninsula gaps in santa cruz mountains one south of san bruno mountain and another in crystal springs allow oceanic weather into interior and causing a cooling effect for cities along peninsula and even as far south as san jose this weather pattern is also source for delays at san francisco international airport in marin county north of golden gate strait two gaps north of muir woods bring cold air across marin headlands with cooling affect reaching as far north as santa rosa further inland east bay receives oceanic weather that travels through golden gate strait and further diffuses that air through berkeley hills niles canyon and hayward pass into livermore valley and altamont pass here resulting breeze is so strong that it is home to one of world s largest array of wind turbines further north carquinez strait funnels ocean weather into san joaquin river delta causing a cooling effect in stockton and sacramento so that these cities are also cooler than their central valley counterparts in

had extended their breeding range southward with nesting sites as far south as hunters point in san francisco on west side and hayward on east side while further studies have found nesting sites as far south as los gatos creek watershed indicating that nesting range now includes entire length of san francisco bay most nests were built on man made structures close to areas of human disturbance

extension through mission peak roughly follow hayward fault and diablo range which includes mount diablo and mount hamilton and runs along calaveras fault in total bay area is traversed by seven major fault systems with hundreds of related faults all of which are stressed by relative motion between pacific plate and north american plate or by compressive stresses between these plates fault systems include hayward fault zone concord green valley fault calaveras fault clayton marsh creek greenville fault rodgers creek fault and san gregorio fault significant blind thrust faults faults with near vertical motion and no surface ruptures are associated with portions of santa cruz mountains and northern reaches of diablo range and mount diablo these hidden faults which are not as well known pose a significant earthquake hazard among more well understood faults scientists estimate a 63 probability of a magnitude 6 7 earthquake occurring along either hayward rogers creek or san andreas fault
