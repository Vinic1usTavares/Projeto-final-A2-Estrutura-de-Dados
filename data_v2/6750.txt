collybia cirrhata is a species of fungus in tricholomataceae family of agaricales order gilled mushrooms species was first described in scientific literature in 1786 but not validly named until 1803 found in europe northern eurasia and north america it is known from temperate boreal and alpine or arctic habitats it is a saprobic species that grows in clusters on decaying or blackened remains of other mushrooms fruit bodies are small with whitish convex to flattened caps up to in diameter narrow white gills and slender whitish stems long and up to thick c cirrhata can be distinguished from other two members of collybia by absence of a sclerotium at base of stem mushroom although not poisonous is considered inedible because of its insubstantial size taxonomy and phylogeny species first appeared in scientific literature in 1786 as agaricus amanitae by august johann georg karl batsch agaricus amanitae subsp cirrhatus proposed by christian hendrik persoon in 1800 is considered synonymous a later combination based on this name collybia amanitae was published by hanns kreisel in 1987 however kreisel noted combination to be indicating that he did not believe name to be validly published according to article 34 1 of rules for botanical nomenclature which states a name is not validly published when it is not accepted by author in original publication first correct name was published in 1803 by heinrich christian friedrich schumacher who called species agaricus cirrhatus french mycologist lucien quelet transferred it to collybia in 1879 resulting in binomial by which it is currently known species had also been transferred to microcollybia by georges metrod in 1952 and again by lennox in 1979 because metrod s transfer was considered a nomen nudum and thus invalid according to nomenclatural rules genus microcollybia has since been wrapped into collybia molecular phylogenetics have shown that c cirrhata forms a monophyletic clade with remaining two species of collybia because c cirrhata is only one of three collybia species lacking sclerotia it has been suggested that this character trait is an that is unique to a single terminal species within a clade specific epithet is derived from latin meaning curled charles horton peck called it fringed rooted collybia in united kingdom it is commonly known as piggyback description thumb left small fruit bodies typically grow in dense clusters cap is initially convex when young later becoming convex to flattened or slightly depressed in center reaching a diameter of cap margin starts out rolled or curved inward but straightens out as it matures cap surface ranges from dry to moist smooth to covered with fine whitish hairs and is mostly even with translucent radial grooves at margin it is changing color somewhat depending on hydration becoming a grayish orange when watery or old and usually is white with a very faint pinkish flush when fresh flesh is whitish quite thin and has no distinctive taste or odor gills are adnate to slightly arcuate curved into shape of a bow with a tooth meaning that gills curve up to join stem but then very close to stem gill edge curves down again there are between 12 and 20 gills that extend completely from cap edge to stem and three to five tiers of lamellulae shorter gills that do not extend completely from cap edge to stem gills are thin narrow to moderately broad and white to pinkish buff gill edges are even and same color as gill faces stem is long and up to thick equal in width throughout to slightly enlarged downward flexible and filamentous but not fragile stem surface is dry whitish to grayish orange sometimes with tiny hairs on upper portion that become coarser near base stem base often has rhizomorph like strands or copious whitish mycelia stem unlike other two species of collybia do not originate from a sclerotium stem becomes hollow as it matures although it is not considered poisonous c cirrhata is too small and insubstantial to be considered edible microscopic characteristics in deposit spores appear white individual spores are ellipsoid to tear shaped in profile to ellipsoid or roughly cylindric in face or back view with dimensions of 4 8 6 4 by 2 2 8 sometimes up to 3 5 um they are smooth inamyloid and unreactive to staining with melzer s reagent and methyl blue respectively basidia spore bearing cells of hymenium are roughly club shaped four spored and measure 17 5 21 by 4 8 5 6 um gills do not have cystidia gill tissue is made of hyphae that are interwoven to roughly parallel and inamyloid hyphae are 2 8 8 4 um in diameter and smooth cap tissue is made of interwoven hyphae beneath center of cap but radially oriented over gills it too is inamyloid these hyphae are 3 5 8 4 um in diameter smooth but have irregularly thickened walls cap cuticle is an ixocutis a gelatinized layer of hyphae lying parallel to cap surface hyphae comprising this layer are 2 8 6 4 um in diameter smooth and thin walled they are covered with scattered short pouch like outgrowths cuticle of stem is a layer of parallel vertically oriented hyphae hyphae measure 3 5 4 2 um and are smooth slightly thick walled and pale yellowish brown in alkaline solution they give rise to a covering of tangled and branched caulocystidia cystidia on stem that have multiple septa caulocystidia are 2 8 4 8 um in diameter smooth thin walled and shaped like contorted cylinders clamp connections are present in hyphae of all tissues similar species collybia cirrhata is most likely to be confused with remaining members of collybia which have a similar external appearance c is distinguished by its dark reddish brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds while c cookei has wrinkled often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange other similar mushrooms include baeospora myosura and species of strobilurus but these species only grow on pine cones habitat and distribution like all species remaining in genus collybia c cirrhata is saprobic and is typically found growing on decaying or blackened remains of other mushrooms occasionally fruit bodies may be found growing on moss or soil without any apparent connection to decaying mushrooms although these observations may represent instances where remnant host tissue possibly from a previous season has decayed to such an extent that it remains as buried fragments in substrate known hosts include lactarius russula giganteus and collybia cirrhata is known from temperate boreal and alpine or arctic habitats fungus is widespread in europe including bulgaria denmark germany greece latvia scandinavia slovakia switzerland turkey and united kingdom mushroom is also common in northern montane regions of north america in asia fungus has been reported in korea and in hokkaido northern japan it is also known from greenland a 2009 publication suggested that based on known evidence species distribution may be circumboreal references external
