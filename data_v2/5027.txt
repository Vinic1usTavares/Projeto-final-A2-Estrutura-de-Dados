once stood etymology origin of seneca village s name is uncertain however a number of theories have been advanced one theory suggests that word seneca came from roman philosopher seneca younger whose book moral epistles was often read by african american activists and abolitionists village could have also been named after seneca nation of native americans according to central park conservancy historian sara cedar miller seneca could have been an amalgamation of anti native american and anti black slurs another theory posits that seneca village could be named after west african nation of senegal origin country for many of village s residents name could have also come from use as a code word on underground railroad when fugitive slaves from southern united states were being hidden in nearby areas existence right thumb 300x300px map showing former location of seneca village egbert viele ca 1857 development land was originally purchased by a white farmer named john whitehead in 1824 one year later whitehead began selling off smaller lots from his property at time area was far from core of new york city which was centered south of 23rd street in what is now lower manhattan on september 27 1825 a young african american man named andrew williams purchased three lots from whiteheads for 125 on same day african methodist episcopal zion church ame zion church trustee epiphany davis bought twelve lots for 578 ame zion church bought six additional lots same week and by 1832 at least 24 lots had been sold to african americans additional nearby development was centered around york hill a plot bounded by where sixth and seventh avenues would have been built between 79th and 86th streets york hill was mostly owned by city but were purchased by william matthews a young african american in late 1830s matthews s african union church also bought land in seneca village around that time more african americans began moving to seneca village after slavery in new york state was outlawed in 1827 in 1830s people from york hill were forced to move so that a basin for croton distributing reservoir could be built so many of york hill s residents migrated to seneca village later during potato famine in ireland many irish immigrants came to live in seneca village swelling village s population by 30 percent during this time both african americans and irish immigrants were marginalized and faced discrimination throughout city despite their social and racial conflicts elsewhere african americans and irish in seneca village managed to live in close proximity by 1855 one third of village s population was irish george washington plunkitt who later became a tammany hall politician was born in 1842 to two of first irish settlers in village pat and sara plunkitt richard

board houses in seneca village were referred to as shanties which reflected their roughshod outward appearance though some of houses resembled log cabins while houses were not professionally constructed their interiors were an improvement on cramped tenements of lower manhattan land ownership among black residents was much higher than that in city as a whole more than half of blacks owned property in 1850 five times as much as property ownership rate of all new york city residents one fifth of seneca village s inhabitants owned their residences many of seneca village s black residents were landowners and relatively economically secure compared to their downtown counterparts at least one property owner lyons family lived in lower manhattan but owned property in seneca village nevertheless many of residents were still poor since they worked in service industries such as construction day labor or food service and only three residents two grocers and an innkeeper could be considered middle class many black women worked as domestic servants many residents squatted boarding in homes they did not own demonstrating that there was significant class stratification even with seneca village s high land ownership rate residents relied on abundant natural resources nearby such as fish from nearby east river and hudson river and firewood from nearby forests some residents also had gardens and barns and fed their livestock scraps of garbage two bone disposal plants were located nearby at 66th and 75th streets inhabitants in 1855 a new york state census found that seneca village had 264 residents on average residents had lived there for 22 years three quarters of 264 residents recorded in 1855 had lived in seneca village since 1840 or before and nearly all had lived there since 1850 at this time in new york city s history most of city s population lived below 14th street region above 59th street was only sporadically developed and was semi rural or rural in character after slavery in new york was outlawed african american men in state could vote as long as they had 250 worth of property and had lived in state for at least three years of 13 000 black new yorkers 91 were qualified to vote and of voting eligible black population 10 lived in seneca village purchase of land by blacks had a significant effect on their political engagement blacks in seneca village were extremely politically engaged in proportion to rest of new york community institutions economic and cultural stability of seneca village enabled growth of several community institutions village had three churches two schools and two cemeteries by 1855 two thirds of inhabitants 180 of 264 total were regular churchgoers two of churches first african methodist episcopal zion church of yorkville and african union church were all black churches while all angels church was racially mixed ame zion church a denomination officially established in lower manhattan in 1821 owned property for burials in seneca village beginning in 1827 in 1853 church established a congregation and built a church building in seneca village according to new york post cornerstone included a capsule with a bible a hymn book church s rules a letter with names of its five trustees and copies of newspapers tribune and sun church building was destroyed as part of razing of seneca village african union church purchased lots in seneca village in 1837 about from ame zion church it had 50 congregants church building contained one of city s few black schools at time colored school 3 founded in mid 1840s one of teachers in school was 17 year old catherine thompson all angels church was founded in 1846 as an affiliate of st michael s episcopal church main campus of which was located at amsterdam avenue and 99th street all angels was intended to be a mission to residents of seneca village and nearby areas at first church was hosted in a white policeman s home but a wooden church at 84th street was built in 1849 congregation was racially diverse with black parishioners from seneca village and irish and german parishioners from other nearby areas it had only 30 parishioners from seneca village when community was razed church relocated a few blocks west and was officially incorporated at corner of 81st street and west end avenue other nearby settlements alt thumb blockhouse no 1 a structure that predated central park while seneca village was largest former settlement in what is now central park it was also surrounded by smaller areas that were occupied mainly by irish and german immigrants one of these areas called pigtown was a settlement of 14 mostly irish families located in modern park s southeastern corner and was so named because residents kept hogs and goats pigtown was originally located farther south from sixth to seventh avenues somewhere within 50s numbered streets but was forced northward because of complaints about pungent animal smells an additional 34 families mainly irish lived in an area bounded by 68th and 72nd streets between seventh and eighth avenues nearby on current site of tavern on green were a collection of bone boiling plants which employed people from seneca village and nearby settlements to southwest of seneca village was settlement of which is now part of upper west side between 66th and 81st streets there were also two german settlements one at modern day park s northern end and one south of current jacqueline kennedy onassis reservoir many of irish and german residents were also farmers with their own gardens an additional settlement in northeast corner of central park included a portion of former boston post road that corner contains mcgowan s pass a topological feature that was site of a hessian encampment during american revolutionary war and blockhouse no 1 a still extant fortification built during war of 1812 mount st vincent s academy was also sited near mcgowan s pass until 1881 demise planning of central park by 1840s members of city s elite were publicly calling for construction of a new large park in manhattan two of primary proponents were william cullen bryant editor of new york evening post and andrew jackson downing one of first american landscape designers special committee on parks was formed to survey possible sites for proposed large park one of first sites considered was jones s wood a tract of land between 66th and 75th streets on upper east side area was occupied by multiple wealthy families who objected to taking of their land particularly jones and schermerhorn families downing stated that he would prefer a park of at least at any location from 39th street to harlem river following passage of an 1851 bill to acquire jones s wood schermerhorns and joneses successfully obtained an injunction to block acquisition and transaction was invalidated as unconstitutional second site proposed for a large public park was a area labeled central park bounded by 59th and 106th streets between fifth and eighth avenues central park plan gradually gained support from a variety of groups after a second bill to acquire jones s wood was nullified new york state legislature passed central park act in july 1853 act authorized a board of five commissioners to start purchasing land for a park and it created a central park fund to raise money in years prior to acquisition of central park seneca village community was referred to in pejorative terms including racial slurs park advocates and media began to describe seneca village and other communities in this area as shantytowns and residents there as squatters and vagabonds and scoundrels irish and black residents were often described as wretched and debased residents of seneca village were also accused of stealing food and operating illegal bars village s detractors included egbert viele park s first engineer who wrote a report about refuge of five thousand squatters living on future site of central park criticizing residents as people with very little knowledge of english language and with very little respect for law while a minority of seneca village s residents were landowners most residents had formal or informal agreements with landlords only a few residents were squatters with no permission from any landlord razing in 1853 central park commissioners started conducting property assessments on more than 34 000 lots in and near central park central park commissioners had completed their assessments by july 1855 and new york state supreme court confirmed this work following february as part of tax assessment residents were offered an average of 700 for their property minority of seneca village residents who owned land were well compensated for instance andrew williams was paid 2 335 for his house and three lots and even though he had originally asked for 3 500 final compensation still represented a significant increase over 125 that he had paid for property in 1825 clearing occurred as soon as central park commission s report was released in october 1855 city began enforcing little known regulations and forcing seneca village residents to pay rent members of community fought to retain their land for two years residents protested and filed lawsuits to halt sale of their land however in mid 1856 mayor fernando wood prevailed and residents of seneca village were given final notices in 1857 city government acquired all private property within seneca village through eminent domain and on october 1 city officials in new york reported that last holdouts living on land that was to become central park had been removed a newspaper account at time suggested that seneca village would not be forgotten as many a brilliant and stirring fight was had during campaign but supremacy of law was upheld by policeman s bludgeons all of inhabitants of village were evicted by 1857 and all of properties within central park were razed only institution from seneca village to survive was all angels church which relocated a couple of blocks away albeit with an entirely new congregation there are few records of where residents went after their eviction as community was entirely destroyed to date no one has been identified as a descendant of a seneca village resident elsewhere in central park impact of eviction was less intense some residents such as foundry owner edward snowden simply relocated elsewhere squatters and hog farmers were most affected however as they were never compensated some traces of seneca village persisted in later years as workers were uprooting trees at corner of 85th street and central park west in 1871 they came upon two coffins both containing black people from seneca village a half century later a gardener named gilhooley inadvertently found a graveyard from seneca village while turning soil at same site site was named gilhooley s burial plot in honor of his discovery rediscovery settlement was largely forgotten for more than a century after its demolition public interest in seneca village was invigorated after publication of roy rosenzweig and elizabeth blackmar s 1992 book park and people a history of central park which described community extensively memorials seneca village project was formed in 1998 as a collaboration between cynthia copeland of new york historical society nan

a sexton for all angels church and a deposit of items in backyard of two other seneca village residents archaeologists filled over 250 bags with artifacts including bone handle of a toothbrush and leather sole of a child s shoe public nature of site within central park meant that guards monitored site to ensure that it was undisturbed by public also archaeologists were asked to fill holes they
