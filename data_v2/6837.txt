itchen navigation is a disused canal system in hampshire england that provided an important trading route from winchester to sea at southampton for about 150 years improvements to river itchen were authorised by act of parliament in 1665 but progress was slow and navigation was not declared complete until 1710 it was known as a navigation because it was essentially an improved river with main river channel being used for some sections and cuts with locks used to bypass difficult sections its waters are fed from river itchen it provided an important method of moving goods particularly agricultural produce and coal between two cities and intervening villages on its completion it was capable of taking shallow barges of around in width and in length but traffic was fairly modest 18 310 tons of freight were carried in 1802 one of better years and there were never more than six boats in use on waterway following opening of london and southampton railway in 1840 traffic declined sharply and navigation ceased to operate in 1869 there were various attempts to revitalise it but none were successful there had also been several proposals to link it to basingstoke canal to form an inland route from london to southampton during its life which likewise did not come to fruition revival of interest in inland waterways following end of second world war has resulted in tow path alongside canal becoming part of itchen way long distance footpath and is a popular route for walkers itchen navigation preservation society was formed in 1970s but progress was slow a joint venture between environment agency and hampshire and isle of wight wildlife trust in 2005 led to formation of itchen navigation trust and two years later they obtained a grant from heritage lottery fund funding creation of itchen navigation heritage trail project which has sought to conserve and interpret remains route provides habitat for a diverse flora and fauna which has resulted in it being designated as a european special area of conservation and a site of special scientific interest history river itchen had been commercially important since before norman times with a staithe for unloading boats recorded at bishopstoke in 960 and stone for winchester cathedral built when winchester was capital city of england was probably transported by water from quarries of caen in france first recorded improvements to river were made by godfrey de lucy who was bishop of winchester between 1189 and 1204 he funded works himself and as a consequence was granted right to levy tolls on goods transported on river by king john there was considerable trade in wool and leather but centres for this moved to calais and melcombe regis in 1353 and as trade declined so did navigable parts of river it was noted to be in poor condition in 1452 and a report for commissioners of sewers in 1617 suggested that much of it was obstructed by mills which had been built on banks construction of canal was authorised by an act of parliament passed in 1665 act allowed a number of rivers to be made navigable and in each case undertakers were appointed to carry out work as were commissioners chosen from local justices who were responsible for confirming tolls undertakers made very slow progress and it was not until 1710 that work was completed they had built locks and some artificial cuts to bypass difficult sections of river and created a towing path for horses route was long of which were new cuts and although some of rest used course of river much of it followed secondary streams new undertakers were not appointed as old ones died and by 1767 navigation was effectively owned by one man a mr edward pyott local people felt that he was exceeding his powers and they obtained a second act of parliament in 1767 which noted that pyott had created a trading and carrying monopoly as he would refuse to carry coal and other goods which interfered with his own activities preamble to act claimed that this was harming poor and inhabitants of winchester act was unusual as it was obtained without pyott s consent and created a new group of commissioners from local justices and dignitaries they were empowered to set rates for tolls and owner was obliged to transport all goods at established rates if there were not sufficient boats and owner did not provide more they could license others to provide carriage services they could also order that locks wharves and warehouses should be erected size of boats was specified and were to be capable of carrying between 20 and 30 tons of cargo tolls set were quite moderate and a group of merchants appear to have leased river from pyott for a period after 1767 but he eventually took control again some additional locks were added and by 1795 there were fifteen three made of masonry blocks and twelve with turf sides there were also two single gates or half locks lowest lock was at woodmill where navigation joined estuary of river itchen on its way to southampton water main wharves at southampton end were at northam about below lock and barges worked down to them on tide or were punted if tide was rising as river was tidal below woodmill lock structure was rebuilt in 1829 with a third set of gates facing downstream to prevent high tides flooding navigation route map shows navigation in deep blue or green for drained section to distinguish it from river shown in light blue deep blue is normally used to represent navigable waterways but is used here for clarity operation following death of pyott ownership of navigation was bought by james d arcy by then married to widow of one of pyott s sons there were still mortgages of ps4 666 outstanding all of them owned by members of pyott s family on which interest had to be paid he appears to have leased tolls to proprietors according to a local newspaper report of time and then to edward knapp before taking over again in 1794 around 1802 navigation was carrying of freight of which were coal and culm were salt tons were chalk and remaining tons were made up of other goods average annual income was quoted as ps3 735 but this probably included freight charges as well as tolls since d arcy managed both he operated four barges with prospects of a link between navigation and basingstoke canal being constructed undertaking was valued at ps24 000 and d arcy sold a half share in it to his agent george hollis he then sold other half to him and moved to ireland hollis became sole proprietor from 1804 having bought out his sleeping partner throughout its life navigation had almost been a monopoly but hollis planned to end this and obtained an act of parliament in 1802 to make it an open navigation where anyone could use it on payment of appropriate tolls these were laid down in act ending setting of tolls by commissioners act also specified that he had three years to put river in order which he appears to have achieved since he then leased it to a group of merchants from 1808 a number of detractors argued that navigation was in a poor condition hoping to force hollis to concede water rights to mills and traffic declined another act of 1811 allowed hollis to raise tolls and eight years later he held a meeting at winchester guildhall explaining why he needed to raise tolls further meeting asked him to postpone his next bill for a year in return for which they would give him ps1 200 for one year s tolls wharfage and rent he would spend ps600 on repairs and remaining ps600 would amount to 5 per cent interest on estimated value of navigation which was then ps12 000 he obtained his act of parliament a year later which raised tolls but commissioners reduced freight charges at same time resulting in operation being more profitable for hollis and less so for barge owners decline thumb left remains of brambridge lock hollis raised mortgages to pay for improvements but receipts were down to ps1 821 in 1839 last full year of operation before london and southampton railway opened receipts were obtained from tolls as all freight was moved by independent carriers at this point hollis gave control of navigation to members of his family his son managed it until 1841 when a banker called w w bulpett who was a took over in 1847 he was given notice to quit by hollis family despite having done a good job but he refused f w hollis eventually obtained most of shares from other family members and started legal action to remove bulpett railway competition had caused a sharp drop in receipts from ps1 012 in 1843 to ps430 in 1861 and payments to shareholders and ceased in 1850 and 1857 in 1863 bulpett was replaced by mr clarke formerly manager of andover canal but bulpett returned when he won action brought by hollis however his re instatement was short lived as navigation ceased to operate in january 1869 last month in which tolls were collected mortgages of ps19 708 were outstanding of which ps2 607 dated from original construction by pyott a plan to buy waterway by j r stebbings of southampton in 1871 fell through a further attempt to buy navigation was made in 1909 by patrick o carroll an estate agent from southsea he created a company called itchen navigation ltd with a capital of ps20 000 but they were unable to establish who owned it and so company never traded extensions during life of canal there were several proposals to link canal to basingstoke canal to provide an inland route between london and southampton first was in 1788 and was initiated by basingstoke canal company six months after they started work on their main line a survey for a proposed route was made but no further progress occurred basingstoke committee then investigated a link to andover canal but in december 1792 interest switched back to a link with itchen a meeting was held in southampton which was chaired by mayor and included james d arcy on committee it became part of a much grander scheme to link bristol to salisbury and onwards to london but although most of this soon died away itchen to basingstoke link was still being considered in 1796 by which time it was called london and southampton ports junction canal two routes were surveyed by different engineers one costing ps127 000 and other ps157 566 main focus was on providing a safe route between london and southampton in view of war with france at time and threat to shipping using a coastal route however prices were rising and there were a number of other canal schemes in difficulty at time which resulted in it being put on hold until 1807 meanwhile grand surrey canal was being proposed in 1800 and ralph dodd main promoter suggested that it could easily be extended to join itchen previous scheme received more attention in 1807 by which time it had become portsmouth southampton and london junction canal from winchester it would pass through alton and farnham to join either basingstoke canal at aldershot or wey and godalming navigations at godalming to speed construction it was suggested that summit tunnel could be replaced by a railway with tunnel being built in due course widely divergent costs for project were discussed original estimate was ps140 000 if railway was built and ps200 000 if tunnel was built opponents suggested cost would be nearer ps700 000 and john rennie estimated tunnel line would cost ps440 790 in 1809 opponents argued that real intent was to improve water supply for basingstoke canal or to line pockets of george hollis owner of itchen navigation there was considerable interest in scheme as 1 244 shares of ps100 had been subscribed by early 1809 but with opposition from land and mill owners and rennie s report indicating much higher costs project was dropped one final proposal was made in 1902 experiments had been carried out on wey and godalming using electric traction to pull barges scheme was for a canal from ditton on river thames through guildford godalming and alton to join itchen at winchester 250 ton barges would be pulled along from towpath by engines fed from overhead catenary wires however although such a system was operational in france nothing came of proposal closure although navigation ceased to operate from january 1869 woodmill lock remained in use to enable barges to reach mill at west end which was on main river channel just above start of first cut most of bridges over navigation were owned by navigation and their condition deteriorated manager mr bulpett was notified that he had 21 days to repair shawford bridge in 1879 he replied to winchester highway board that navigation was insolvent and he would help them to transfer responsibility for it to county council board carried out temporary repairs when bulpett agreed that navigation would meet full cost of repairing it properly if it ever reopened following year bulpett was threatened with legal action over state of bishopstoke bridge but at this point it was agreed that navigation had no income and could not be sold and so county would have to maintain bridges in 1911 a mr bowker from shawford successfully applied for towpath to be diverted but this was overturned when rev j h du boulay appealed against decision diversion was sanctioned in 1914 although there have been doubts about legality of action and subsequently two further diversions were made at chickenhall near southern end and at hockley near northern end no maintenance was carried out on waterway until formation of catchment boards thus responsibility for waterway as a drainage channel passed to hampshire catchment board in 1942 and some work was carried out to maintain integrity of waterway these responsibilities later passed to southern water authority and now reside with environment agency in 1960s value of towpath as a leisure amenity began to be recognised deputy county clerk for hampshire walked along towpath from end to end in 1966 together with members of ramblers association he decided that rather than challenge legality of towpath diversions he would invite local authorities through which navigation ran to assume responsibility for maintaining towpath these organisations were southampton county borough council eastleigh borough council winchester rural district council and winchester city council construction of weirs at most of locks by southern water authority resulted in water levels being restored on significant parts of navigation powers of navigation were enshrined in acts of parliament obtained in 1665 1767 1795 1802 1811 and 1820 none of which have been repealed restoration thumb right lock conservation work in progress at mansbridge lock newer technologies of road and rail led to navigation falling into disuse some lengths of system were drained or allowed to overgrow with vegetation increasingly difference between canal and river became less obvious although it is still possible to identify remains of original locks threat to remains which construction of m3 motorway posed spurred winchester tenants and residents association and local branch of inland waterways association into action in 1975 with both suggesting that waterway could be restored two groups later co operated and itchen navigation preservation society was formed little progress was made but in 2005 environment agency and hampshire and isle of wight wildlife trust promoted formation of itchen navigation trust they were committed to conserving remains rather than a full restoration to navigable standards a request was made to heritage lottery fund in united kingdom for funds to restore watercourse known as itchen navigation heritage trail project funding was granted and a five year restoration project began work has included widening aperture at college mead lock and construction of a bypass channel around malm lock to assist movement of fish and other aquatic fauna navigation has been designated a european special area of conservation as well as a site of special scientific interest due to rich diversity of wildlife found along system and its historical importance route official head of canal was at blackbridge wharf winchester just to south of wharf mill a grade ii listed water mill dating from 1885 and college walk which spans river at blackbridge an eighteenth century stone bridge which is also grade ii listed below bridge channel splits with river flowing to west and navigation to east blackbridge wharf was accessed by wharf bridge oldest surviving bridge over navigation dating from 1760s close by manager s house a warehouse and some stables have also survived navigation flows past grounds of winchester college which uses waterway for rowing practice rowing eights use a winding basin just above remains of st catherine s hill lock which now contains a modern sluice mechanism and was location of a water powered sawmill located to west of lock it passes st catherine s hill an iron age hill fort and some plague pits which were common graves for victims of 1666 plague it then passes under former didcot newbury and southampton railway whose line from winchester to shawford junction was operational between 1891 and 1966 before being diverted through a culvert under junction 11 of m3 motorway originally this was site of a bridge which carried road from winchester to botley but this was replaced by a full headroom concrete tunnel in late 1930s when junction between that road and new winchester bypass was built over navigation ordnance survey 1 2500 map 1953 1964 when m3 motorway was constructed following almost same line as bypass where it crossed navigation tunnel was reduced to a culvert although original plans for motorway would have destroyed most of top pound building of m3 across twyford down a small area of ancient chalk downland was controversial at time but removal of winchester bypass which ran to west of st catherine s hill close to navigation and its conversion back to grassland has brought tranquility back to valley canal is on western edge of twyford down and continues through twyford lane end lock before it briefly rejoins river some south of junction are tumbling bay hatches originally used to control levels in water meadows to east of river a modern sluice was installed just to north of 19th century hatches in 1971 and controls flow to twyford drain main channel to east of navigation which follows river channel almost to shawford bridge modern maps however label drain as river itchen ordnance survey 1 25 000 map 2012 a leat from this stretch was created at around time of construction of canal to provide water for twyford mead water meadows farming of water meadows continued until around 1930 after closure of navigation itself it was a labour intensive method of land management but controlled flooding of meadows with deposition of silt from water enabled land to produce two crops of hay per year as well as grazing for sheep and cattle demonstrations of techniques used to flood meadows are still carried out occasionally below twyford next lock is compton lock only one built on a river section it is also called compton place lock or twyford lock and extra flow compared to other locks may explain erosion that has taken place resulting in a circular area of water between upper and lower gates just above shawford bridge river and navigation diverged with shawford mill just below junction building still stands bridge is a modern construction and is located at a point where towpath crosses to western bank just to south is a weir at site of shawford single gates which probably ensured mill had an adequate head of water village of twyford lies to east and twyford drain splits with western channel rejoining river below mill and eastern channel continuing as a relief channel there are two more locks on navigation called malm lock and college mead lock before navigation rejoins river by junction is intake for water treatment works thumb remains of allbrook lock on former itchen navigation after some river continues straight ahead and another cut begins turning sharply to right soon remains of brambridge lock are reached which include a derelict eel trap design of gates which included vents near top of structure to allow surplus water to pass through was clearly shown in a drawing dating from 1880 below it were brambridge single gates probably used to maintain water levels for a mill of which some brickwork remains there were hatches to allow water to return to river channel either side of gates one of which is now a modern sluice navigation runs along an embankment for about which is high before it reaches allbrook lock this was moved in 1838 when railway line was built and was repaired in 1944 it has a chamber built of bricks whereas other locks are turf sided a bridge carries over tail of lock having been widened since it was first built at head of lock is a gauging station where environment agency measure flow and level of water thumb right itchen navigation below withymead lock showing footpath navigation turns to west passing under railway line and then loops back to return to eastern side of railway it runs along northern edge of some railway sidings which form part of eastleigh works to reach withymead lock this was unusual as it included a bypass channel to take excess water around lock whereas other locks used vents in gates just below lock navigation rejoins river channel at barton bay barton river leaves navigation following a course to west of channel a horse bridge carried towpath over river which used to supply water to barton peveril mill next cut began a little further south with bishopstoke or stoke lock at head of it there are four bridges on bishopstoke road as it crosses barton river navigation river channel and tailrace of shears mill bishopstoke ordnance survey 1 2500 map 2012 mill was a large four storey building which was demolished in 1920s four years before demolition two water turbines of and diameter were installed and were retained after demise of mill in hope that they could be used to generate dc power for village several community groups were looking at possibility of restoring water turbines to generate electricity next lock is conegar lock which was also called stoke conegar or lock just above it are some hatches which supplied water to adjacent water meadows they were built of dressed stone and are best preserved of original hatches there is no modern sluice at conegar lock and change in level has resulted in fast flowing rapids which have cut back channel above lock a little further south at fish house bay navigation crossed barton river diagonally as mill stream made its way back to main river a footbridge on eastern bank carried towpath over barton river but navigation below this point is dry with its line occupied by a vegetable garden below conegar next section is least preserved part of navigation which skirted to east of eastleigh sewage treatment works to a point where it was crossed by railway from to two lengths have been filled in and although there is a footpath it follows approximate route of navigation rather than actual towpath railway bridge was built in 1841 and originally had two arches one for navigation and another for landowners replacement was necessary in 1979 and bridge was demolished part of it was replaced by an embankment but a large diameter concrete tube was provided or sufficient size to carry navigation should it be reinstated next lock is lock house lock which was also called chickenhall lock name reflects fact that there was a lock keeper s cottage by structure but this has long since disappeared navigation then passes to east of southampton airport while further east is river channel and itchen valley country park between two waterways is decoy covert a small wood which contained a duck decoy lock nearby is called decoy pond lock below which is sandy lock there is little water in this section since its main supply has been cut off and although there are springs along this section channel is periodically blocked where occupation bridges have been replaced by earth embankments sandy lock has much barbed wire in it possibly dumped when wartime defences of airport were dismantled final lock on this section is mans bridge lock shortly after modern crossing by m27 motorway cut then rejoins main river and passes under a27 road current bridge was constructed in 1975 and replaced a bailey bridge erected during second world war just below it is a single arched stone bridge dating from early nineteenth century which was original course of road it has been restored and is used as a footbridge thumb woodmill situated at limit of tidal itchen final lock was sea lock at woodmill there are no visible remains of it although its location can still be seen mill was to west and now forms part of woodmill outdoor activities centre with main building used as a canoe shop centre was set up in late 1960s and is a registered charity navigation officially continued downstream to a wharf at northam and although there was never a towpath on tidal section itchen way long distance footpath follows eastern bank of river for most of way nothing remains of northam quay and bridge has been rebuilt twice since first construction of 1796 last time in 1954 river also passes under cobden bridge and a railway bridge built in 1866 with two sets of round iron columns supporting structure over main channel which retains most of its original appearance and now forms part of west coastway line flora and fauna thumb right a water vole on itchen navigation between locks 9 and 10 itchen navigation supports a rich flora and fauna and one benefit of 5 year grant funded restoration project has been regular monitoring and publishing of reports to document this annual reports on populations of birds bats otters water voles and butterflies damselflies and dragonflies have been produced with occasional reports on other aspects while environment agency has produces fisheries reports as part of project a number of engineering works have been carried out to stabilise banks and trees have been cut back to reduce amount of shade and encourage growth of marginal vegetation in case of water vole survey this has been concentrated on sections where work has been carried out whereas butterfly damselfly and dragonfly survey has tended to cover whole navigation vegetated berms containing marginal plants have been placed along banks project has tried to avoid installation of revetments as vertical faces prevent wildlife accessing banks but where a is necessary to combat erosion it has been built of oak and a berm placed in front of it to soften edge in recognition of fact that many people use towpath to exercise their dogs dog dips have been installed at allbrook and shawford these provide easy access into water for dogs and owners are encouraged to only allow dogs to swim at these locations to conserve bank in other places water vole surveys have followed best practice described in water vole conservation handbook 2006 and have also recorded evidence of otter brown rat and american mink populations while carrying out work surveyors have also counted sightings of kingfisher heron moorhen and coot bat survey recorded common pipistrelle soprano pipistrelle daubenton s noctule and serotine bats in 2011 bat boxes have been erected near allbrook and there was some evidence that they were being used 2009 fisheries survey recorded large numbers of young atlantic salmon in lower river but although fish weirs have been provided wild parr were not recorded near winchester above there a large population of brown trout thrives eels were monitored for first time in 2009 when their distribution was found to be variable points of interest references sources external links itchen
