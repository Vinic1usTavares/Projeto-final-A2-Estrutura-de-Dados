referred to as kingdom of prussia or simply prussia legally personal union between brandenburg and prussia continued until dissolution of holy roman empire in 1806 however by this time emperor s overlordship over empire had become a legal fiction hence after 1701 brandenburg was de facto treated as part of prussian kingdom frederick and his successors continued to centralize and expand state

neugebauer 2006 p 126 in 1686 frederick william turned toward habsburg emperor with whom he concluded an alliance on 22 december 1686 for this alliance frederick william relinquished rights on silesia in favor of habsburgs and in turn received silesian county of schwiebus which bordered neumark frederick iii present at negotiations as crown prince assured habsburgs of continuation of alliance once he was in power and secretly concluded an amendment to return schwiebus to habsburgs which he eventually did in 1694 throughout his reign brandenburg prussia remained a habsburg ally and repeatedly deployed troops to fight against france in 1693 frederick iii began to sound out possibility of an elevation of his status at habsburg court in vienna and while first attempt was unsuccessful elevation to a king remained central goal on his agenda envisioned status elevation did not merely serve a decorative purpose but was regarded a necessity to prevail in political competition though frederick iii held elevated status of a prince elector this status was also gained by maximilian i of bavaria in 1623 during thirty years war also by elector of palatinate in peace of westphalia 1648 and by ernest augustus of house of hanover in 1692 neuhaus 2003 p 22 thus formerly exclusive club of prince electors now had nine members six of whom were secular princes and further changes seemed possible neugebauer 2006 p 127 within circle of prince electors august strong elector of saxony had secured polish crown in 1697 and house of hanover had secured succession of british throne from frederick iii s perspective stagnation in status meant loss of power and this perspective seemed to be confirmed when european royals ignored brandenburg prussia s claims in treaty of rijswijk 1697 frederick decided to raise duchy of prussia to a kingdom within holy roman empire no one could call himself king except emperor and king of bohemia however prussia was outside empire and hohenzollerns were fully sovereign over it practicability of this plan was doubted by some of his advisors and in any case crown was only valuable if recognized by european nobility most important holy roman emperor in 1699 negotiations were renewed with emperor leopold i who in turn was in need of allies since war of spanish succession was about to break out on 16 november 1700 emperor approved frederick s coronation in crown treaty with respect to poland lithuania who held provinces of royal prussia and ermland it was agreed that frederick would call himself king in prussia instead of king of prussia

in 1525 upheld claims to region grand master protested at emperor s court and pope sent a circular to all catholic regents to not accept frederick s royal status until 1787 papal documents continued to speak of prussian kings as margraves of brandenburg neither did polish lithuanian nobility accept frederick s royal status seeing polish province of royal prussia endangered and only in 2003 p 14 was prussian kingship accepted weber 2003 p 15 since brandenburg was still legally part of holy roman empire personal union between brandenburg and prussia technically continued until empire s dissolution in 1806 however emperor s power was only nominal by this time and brandenburg soon came to be treated as a de facto province of prussian kingdom although frederick was still only an elector within portions of his domain that were part of empire he only acknowledged emperor s overlordship over them in a formal way administration in mid 16th century margraves of brandenburg had become highly dependent on estates counts lords knights and towns no prelates due to protestant reformation in 1538 kotulla 2008 p 262 margraviate s liabilities and tax income as well as margrave s finances were controlled by kreditwerk an institution not controlled by elector and grosser ausschuss great committee of estates kotulla 2008 p 263 this was due to concessions made by joachim ii in 1541 in turn for financial aid by estates however kreditwerk went bankrupt between 1618 and 1625 margraves further had to yield veto of estates in all issues concerning better or worse of country in all legal commitments and in all issues concerning pawn or sale of elector s real property to reduce influence of estates joachim frederick in 1604 created a council called geheimer rat fur die privy council for electorate which instead of estates was to function as supreme advisory council for elector while council was permanently established in 1613 it failed to gain any influence until 1651 due to thirty years war until after thirty years war territories of brandenburg prussia were politically independent from each other connected only by common feudal superior frederick william who envisioned transformation of personal union into a real union started to centralize brandenburg prussian government with an attempt to establish geheimer rat as a central authority for all territories in 1651 but this project proved to be unfeasible instead elector continued to appoint a governor rat for each territory who in most cases was a member of geheimer rat most powerful institution in territories remained governments of estates regierung named in prussia and geheime in mark and cleves which were highest government agencies regarding jurisdiction finances and administration elector attempted to balance estates governments by creating amtskammer chambers to administer and coordinate elector s domains tax income and privileges such chambers were introduced in brandenburg in 1652 in cleves and mark in 1653 in pomerania in 1654 in prussia in 1661 and in magdeburg in 1680 also in 1680 kreditwerk came under aegis of elector frederick william s excise tax akzise which since 1667 replaced property tax raised in brandenburg for brandenburg prussia s standing army with estates consent was raised by elector without consultation of estates conclusion of second northern war had strengthened elector politically enabling him to reform constitution of cleves and mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of local estates in duchy of prussia he confirmed traditional privileges of estates in 1663 but latter accepted caveat that these privileges were not to be used to interfere with exertion of elector s sovereignty as in brandenburg frederick william ignored privilege of prussian estates to confirm or veto taxes raised by elector while in 1656 an akzise was raised with estates consent elector by force collected taxes not approved by prussian estates for first time in 1674 since 1704 prussian estates had de facto relinquished their right to approve elector s taxes while formally still entitled to do so in 1682 elector introduced an akzise to pomerania and in 1688 to magdeburg while in cleves and mark an akzise was introduced only between 1716 and 1720 due to frederick william s reforms state income increased threefold during his reign and tax burden per subject reached a level twice as high as in france duchhardt 2006 p 108 under rule of frederick iii i brandenburg prussian territories were de facto reduced to provinces of monarchy frederick william s testament would have divided brandenburg prussia among his sons yet firstborn frederick iii with emperor s backing succeeded in becoming sole ruler based on treaty of
