this best innings of his career as practically without exception every ball went where it was intended to go wisden noted his fast footwork and how he hit ball all round wicket with power and accuracy

passing mention a number of english players and commentators noted bradman s discomfort in playing short rising delivery revelation came too late for this particular match but was to have immense significance in next ashes series australia won match by an innings and regained ashes victory made an impact in australia with economy sliding toward depression and unemployment rapidly rising country found solace in sporting triumph story of a self taught 22 year old from bush who set a series of records against old rival made bradman a national hero statistics bradman achieved on tour and

hundreds and a triple as of 2018 no one has matched or exceeded 974 runs or three double centuries in one test series record of 974 runs exceeds second best performance by 69 runs and was achieved in two fewer innings bradman s first class tally 2 960 runs at an average of 98 66 with 10 centuries was another enduring record most by any overseas batsman on a tour of england on tour dynamic nature of bradman s batting contrasted sharply with his quiet solitary off field demeanour he was described as aloof from his teammates and he did not offer to buy them a round of drinks let alone share money given to him by whitelaw bradman spent a lot of his free time alone writing as he had sold rights to a book on his return to australia bradman was surprised by intensity of his reception he became a reluctant hero mick simmons wanted to cash in on their employee s newly won fame they asked bradman to leave his teammates and attend official receptions they organised in adelaide melbourne goulburn his hometown bowral and sydney where he received a brand new custom built chevrolet at each stop bradman received a level of adulation that embarrassed him this focus on individual accomplishment in a team game permanently damaged relationships with his contemporaries commenting on australia s victory team s vice captain vic richardson said we could have played any team without bradman but we could not have played blind school without clarrie grimmett harte 1993 p 327 a modest bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying i have always endeavoured to do my best for side

england although he did make 223 in 297 minutes in third test at brisbane and 152 in 154 minutes in following test at melbourne cashman et al 1996 p 573 however he scored quickly in a very successful sequence of innings against south africans in australian summer of 1931 32 for nsw against tourists he made 30 135 and 219 in test matches he scored 2 and his 299 not out in fourth test at adelaide set a new record for highest score in a test in australia record was beaten by bob cowper who scored 307 in 1965 66 australia won nine of ten tests played over two series at this point bradman had played 15 test matches since beginning of 1930 scoring 2 227 runs at an average of 131 he had played 18 innings scoring 10 centuries six of which had extended beyond 200 his overall scoring rate was 42 runs per hour with 856 or 38 5 of his tally scored in boundaries significantly he had not hit a six which typified bradman s attitude if he hit ball along ground then it could not be caught during this phase of his career his youth and natural fitness allowed him to adopt a machine like approach to batting south african fast bowler sandy bell described bowling to him as heart breaking with his sort of cynical grin which rather reminds one of sphinx he never seems to perspire williams 1996 pp 78 81 between these two seasons bradman seriously contemplated playing professional cricket in england with lancashire league club accrington a move that according to rules of day would have ended his test career a consortium of three sydney businesses offered an alternative they devised a two year contract whereby bradman wrote for associated newspapers broadcast on radio 2ue and promoted menswear retailing chain fj palmer and son however contract increased bradman s dependence on his public profile making it more difficult to maintain privacy that he ardently desired bradman s chaotic wedding to jessie menzies in april 1932 epitomised these new and unwelcome intrusions into his private life church was under siege all throughout day uninvited guests stood on chairs and pews to get a better view police erected barriers that were broken down and many of those invited could not get a seat just weeks later bradman joined a private team organised by arthur mailey to tour united states and canada he travelled with his wife and couple treated trip as a honeymoon playing 51 games in 75 days bradman scored 3 779 runs at 102 1 with 18 centuries although standard of play was not high effects of amount of cricket bradman had played in three previous years together with strains of his celebrity status began to show on his return home bodyline within marylebone cricket club mcc which administered english cricket at time few voices were more influential than plum warner s who when considering england s response to bradman wrote that it must evolve a new type of bowler and develop fresh ideas and strange tactics to curb his almost uncanny skill to that end warner orchestrated appointment of douglas jardine as england captain in 1931 as a prelude to jardine leading 1932 33 tour to australia with warner as team manager frith 2002 pp 40 41 remembering that bradman had struggled against bouncers during his 232 at oval in 1930 jardine decided to combine traditional leg theory with short pitched bowling to combat bradman he settled on nottinghamshire fast bowlers harold larwood and bill voce as spearheads for his tactics in support england selectors chose another three pacemen for squad unusually high number of fast bowlers caused a lot of comment in both countries and roused bradman s own suspicions bradman had other problems to deal with at this time among these were bouts of illness from an undiagnosed malaise which had begun during tour of north america williams 1996 pp 90 91 and that australian board of control had initially refused permission for him to write a column for sydney sun bradman who had signed a two year contract with newspaper threatened to withdraw from cricket to honour his contract when board denied him permission to write eventually paper released bradman from contract in a victory for board in three first class games against england before tests bradman averaged just 17 16 in 6 innings bradman 1950 p 60 jardine decided to give new tactics a trial in only one game a fixture against an australian xi at melbourne in this match bradman faced leg theory and later warned local administrators that trouble was brewing if it continued he withdrew from first test at sydney cricket ground amid rumours that he had suffered a nervous breakdown despite his absence england employed what were already becoming known as bodyline tactics against australian batsmen and won an ill tempered match left thumb famous

apologetic plum warner entered australian dressing room and was rebuked by woodfull woodfull s remarks that there are two teams out there and only one of them is playing cricket were leaked to press and warner and others attributed this to australian opening batsman jack fingleton however for many years even after fingleton s death a bitter war of accusation passed between fingleton and bradman as to who was real source of leak in a cable to mcc australian board of control repeated allegation of poor sportsmanship directed at warner by woodfull with support of mcc england continued with bodyline despite australian protests tourists won last three tests convincingly and regained ashes bradman caused controversy with his own tactics always seeking to score and with leg side packed with fielders he often backed away and hit ball into vacant half of outfield with unorthodox shots reminiscent of tennis or golf williams 1996 p 99 this brought him 396 runs at 56 57 for series and plaudits for attempting to find a solution to bodyline although his series average was just 57 of his career mean jack fingleton was in no doubt that bradman s game altered irrevocably as a consequence of bodyline writing fingleton 1949 p 198 constant glare of celebrity and tribulations of season forced bradman to reappraise his life outside game and to seek a career away from his

blazed two centuries in last two games of tour however when he returned to london to prepare for trip home he experienced severe abdominal pain it took a doctor more than 24 hours to diagnose acute appendicitis and a surgeon operated immediately bradman lost a lot of blood during four hour procedure and peritonitis set in penicillin and were still experimental treatments at this time peritonitis

seen with australia forced to follow on bradman fought hard to ensure mccabe s effort was not in vain and he secured draw with 144 not out it was slowest test hundred of his career and he played a similar innings of 102 not out in next test as australia struggled to another draw rain completely washed out third test at old trafford australia s opportunity came at headingley a test described by bradman as best he ever played in bradman 1950 pp 115 118 england batted first and made 223 during australian innings bradman backed himself by opting to bat on in poor light conditions reasoning that australia could score more runs in bad light on a good wicket than on a rain affected wicket in good light when he had option to go off he scored 103 out of a total of 242 and gamble paid off as it meant there was sufficient time to push for victory when an england collapse left them a target of only 107 to win australia slumped to 4 61 with bradman out for 16 an approaching storm threatened to wash game out but poor weather held off and australia managed to secure win a victory that retained ashes for only time in his life tension of occasion got to bradman and he could not watch closing stages of play a reflection of pressure that he felt all tour he described captaincy as exhausting and said he found it difficult to keep going euphoria of securing ashes preceded australia s heaviest defeat at oval england amassed a world record of 7 903 and their opening batsman len hutton scored an individual world record by making 364 in an attempt to relieve burden on his bowlers bradman took a rare turn at bowling during his third over he fractured his ankle and teammates carried him from ground with bradman injured and fingleton unable to bat because of a leg muscle strain bradman 1950 p

bowled between bat and pad for a duck baldwin 2005 p 108 an england batting collapse resulted in an innings defeat denying bradman opportunity to bat again and so his career average finished at 99 94

finished their career with a test average of more than 62 bradman scored centuries at a rate better than one every three innings in 80 test innings bradman scored 29 centuries only 11 players have since surpassed his total all at a much slower rate next fastest player to reach 29 centuries sachin tendulkar required nearly twice as long 148 innings to do so in addition bradman converted 41 of his centuries into double centuries his total of 12 test double hundreds comprising 15 of his innings remains most achieved by any test batsman and was accumulated faster than any other total for comparison next highest totals of test double hundreds are kumar sangakkara s 11 in 223 innings 4 9 brian lara s 9 in 232 innings 3 9 and wally hammond s 7 in 140 innings 5 next highest rate of scoring test double centuries was achieved by vinod kambli whose 21 innings included 2 double centuries 9 5 world sport hailed bradman as greatest phenomenon in history of cricket indeed in history of all ball games statistician charles davis analysed statistics for several prominent sportsmen by comparing number of standard deviations that they stand above mean for their sport top performers in his selected sports are bradman cricket batting 4 pele association football goals per game3 7 ty cobb baseball batting 6 jack nicklaus golf major 5 michael jordan basketball points per game3 4

need a career batting average of 392 while a basketball player would need to score an average of 43 0 points per game respective records are 366 and 30 1 when bradman died time allocated a space in its milestones column for an obituary playing style right thumb bradman hooks english left arm fast bowler bill voce during 1936 37 series position of bradman s left foot in relation to stumps is an example of how he used crease when batting bradman s early development was shaped by high bounce of ball on matting over concrete pitches he favoured horizontal bat shots such as hook pull and cut to deal with bounce and devised a unique grip on bat handle that would accommodate these strokes without compromising his ability to defend employing a side on stance at wicket bradman kept perfectly still as bowler ran in his backswing had a crooked look that troubled his early critics but he resisted entreaties to change bradman 1950 p 20 his backswing kept his hands in close to body leaving him perfectly balanced and able to change his stroke mid swing if need be eason 2004 p 88 another telling factor was decisiveness of bradman s footwork he used crease by either coming metres down wicket to drive or playing so far back that his feet ended up level with stumps when playing cut hook or pull robinson 1981 p 139 bradman s game evolved with experience he temporarily adapted his technique during bodyline series deliberately moving around crease in an attempt to score from short pitched deliveries bradman 1950 p 74 at his peak in mid 1930s he had ability to switch between a defensive and attacking approach as occasion demanded after second world war he adjusted to bat within limitations set by his age becoming a steady accumulator of runs fingleton 1949 pp 209 211 however bradman never truly mastered batting on sticky wickets wisden commented i f there really is a blemish on his amazing record it is absence of a significant innings on one of those sticky dogs of old after
