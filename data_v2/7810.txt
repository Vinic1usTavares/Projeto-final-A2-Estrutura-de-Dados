chapters into birth by sleep and 358 2 days development team planned to make use of mobile phones communication abilities to facilitate interaction between players coded was developed with 3d and 2d graphics to have game available on a range of mobile phones for distribution overseas game was designed around hardware that was more powerful than any yet available like final fantasy agito but developer were not as aggressive with this boundary pushing with coded to help it spread to overseas markets where mobile phones were not very powerful in terms of hardware early screenshots showed game in a wide screen format based on idea that more future models will feature a swivel screen few mobile phones however were able to support game s technical specifications so planned expansion to other japanese phone carriers and to united states were not possible it was announced alongside kingdom hearts birth by sleep and kingdom hearts 358 2 days at tokyo game show on september 20 2007
