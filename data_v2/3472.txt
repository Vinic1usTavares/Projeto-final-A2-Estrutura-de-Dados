investigation until 21st century it was designated as a scheduled ancient monument in 1937 in 2013 and 2014 royal commission on ancient and historical monuments of scotland carried out measured and geophysical using resistivity and a gradiometer surveys at tibbers with funding from historic scotland and castle studies trust layout occupying a ridge on west bank of river nith earliest phase of castle consisted of a small bailey or enclosure this bailey was revealed by geophysical survey in 2014 which also indicated that it contained timber buildings when richard siward remodelled castle it is likely that he added motte with its stone enclosure castle and replaced single small bailey with two large enclosures south of motte these enclosures may have housed a market as was case at lochmaben castle there are few examples in scotland of earthwork castles being rebuilt in stone four sided motte measures at summit enclosure castle on top is roughly rectangular measuring with a round tower at each corner little survives above ground of this structure though south south east tower survives best south side of enclosure castle had an additional tower which tower with south south east corner tower flanked entrance inside castle had a well on east side and a range of buildings extending along west and north sides these likely contained a great hall kitchens and a chamber there was a postern gate just south of north east tower this phase of tibbers is one of few authentic surviving remnants of english castle building in scotland during plantagenet occupation at its greatest extent tibbers castle measured by courtyard of enclosure castle is inner bailey outer and outermost baileys each cover an area of about ramparts enclosing site survive to a height of and are
