albums enjoyable clark would not work directly work with psychopathic records until 2009 s bang pow boom music and lyrics unlike previous insane clown posse albums tempest is not connected to dark carnival mythology which formed basis for icp s joker s cards series which began in 1992 with carnival of carnage and concluded with albums wraith shangri la and hell s pit however it references themes concepts and songs from previous albums joseph bruce violent j said that tempest is a concept album in its own right bruce describes album s concept as relating to both a violent storm which turns into a tornado and pulls people into a hurricane as well as a roller coaster according to bruce that s a lot like riding on a violent roller coaster i d assume you get jerked to left jerked to right sucked way up into sky and then you go shooting down to floor and then you jerk up to left and then you whip around to right well tempest is a storm in form of a roller coaster as a result of this concept album focuses on a variety of different moods tempest maintains much of horrorcore lyrical content icp is known for as well as their humorous perspective unlike previous albums this album does not contain any disses aimed at other rappers or music industry figures bruce and joseph utsler shaggy 2 dope s rapping on this album is described by allmusic reviewer david jeffries as being delivered in a carnival barker fashion that fits with their circus motif and contrasted bruce and utsler themselves as being like alice cooper with a attitude lyrics of growing again which describe violent j growing into a giant were inspired by bruce s weight gain bruce also says that song reflects feeling of being able to rap about anything we want i feel we have right for some songs to be softer and not about killing or dark carnival tower describes a war veteran and expert marksman climbing a college tower and shooting people with an arsenal of weapons a reference to charles whitman s
