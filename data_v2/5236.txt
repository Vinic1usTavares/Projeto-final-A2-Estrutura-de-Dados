and population transfers that affected several million members of soviet ethnic minorities between 1930s and 1950s around 32 000 people mostly armenians were settled by soviet government in areas cleared of after stalin s death new soviet leader nikita khrushchev delivered a secret speech in 1956 in which he condemned and reversed stalin s deportations of various ethnic groups many of which were allowed to their places of origin however even though they were released from special settlements meskhetian turks along with crimean tatars and volga germans remained in exile due to secrecy of their expulsion and politics of soviet union deportation of meskhetian turks remained relatively unknown and was subject to very little scholarly research until they were targeted by violent riots in uzbekistan in 1989 in 1991 newly independent georgia refused to give meskhetian turks right to return to meskheti region meskhetian turks numbered between 260 000 and 335 000 people in 2006 and are today scattered across seven countries of former soviet union where many are stateless background left thumb ruins of an old meskhetian settlement at in south georgia meskhetian turks also known as turks originally lived in meskheti region in south of present day georgia there is no consensus among historians regarding their origin either they are ethnic turks or georgians who converted to islam during ottoman rule of region ottoman army conquered meskheti region then part of principality of during turkish military expedition of 1578 turkish historians are of view that turkic tribes had settled in region as early as eleventh and twelfth centuries when georgian king david iv invited kipchaks turkic tribes to defend his border regions from seljuk turks area became part of russian empire in 1829 following russo turkish war in 1918 near end of world war i and at beginning of russian civil war georgia proclaimed independence while some muslim communities in meskheti proclaimed a semi autonomous confederation and prepared for a unification with dissolving ottoman empire ottoman troops moved into this area and numerous clashes broke out between christian and muslim populations of region in 1921 soviet forces took control of georgia and signed treaty of kars which divided between turkey and newly soviet georgia in 1920s joseph stalin emerged as new general secretary of communist party of soviet union ben kiernan an american academic and historian described stalin s era as by far bloodiest of soviet or even russian history between 1928 and 1937 meskhetian turks were pressured by soviet authorities to adopt georgian names 1926 soviet census listed 137 921 turks in georgian soviet socialist republic but this figure included azerbaijanis in 1939 soviet census most meskhetian turks were classified as azerbaijanis deportation thumb 250px right distribution of meskhetian turks within georgian ssr 1926 on 31 july 1944 soviet state defense committee decree n stated

republic said that it was ready to accept 50 000 people instead of planned 30 000 239 railcars were prepared to transport deportees and people were mobilized meskhetian turks were one of six ethnic groups from caucasus who were deported in 1943 and 1944 in their entirety by soviet secret police other five were chechens ingush balkars and kalmyks their deportation was relatively poorly documented historians date expulsion of meskhetian turks to soviet central asia either to 14 or 15november 1944 operation was completed by 26 november at start of operation soviet soldiers arrived as early as 4 00 a m at homes of meskhetian turks and did not tell them were they were being taken to population was not given advance notice nkvd notification stated you are to be deported get ready take foodstuffs for three days two hours for preparation studebaker trucks were used to drive meskhetian turks to nearby railway stations in deportation between 92 307 and 94 955 meskhetian turks distributed in 16 700 families were forcibly resettled from 212 villages they were packed into cattle wagons and deported eastwards to central asia by 4 00 p m on 17november 81 234 people had been dispatched official soviet records indicate that 92 307 persons were deported of whom 18 923 were men 27 309 were women and 45 989 were children under age of 16 52 163 were resettled in uzbek ssr 25

deported meskhetian turks were allowed to carry up to of personal belongings with them per family twice amount as crimean tatars during their previous deportation members of other minority ethnic groups were also deported with meskhetian turks including kurds and hemshils armenian muslims giving a total of approximately 115 000 evicted persons one source indicates that 8 694 kurds and 1 385 hemshils were deported as part of operation only women married to men of other non deported ethnic groups were spared each family was given two hours to collect their belongings for trip seven families were loaded into each boxcar 20 25 families into each carriage like other groups from caucasus they were transported several thousand miles to central asia they were sealed off in these cattle wagons for a month thumb cattle wagons used for soviet deportations 4 000 nkvd agents were appointed to carry out operation like previous deportations this one was also supervised by nkvd chief lavrentiy beria it was ordered by premier of soviet union joseph stalin stalin allocated 34 million rubles to nkvd in order to carry it out it was part of soviet forced settlement program and population transfer that affected several million members of non russian soviet ethnic minorities between 1930s and 1950s during world war ii alone 3 332 589 persons were deported in soviet union throughout caucasus about 650 000 people were deported in 1943 and 1944 this was last soviet deportation during world war ii until 1956 soviet authorities denied meskhetian turks any civic or political rights around 32 000 people mostly armenians were settled by soviet authorities in cleared areas possible reasons unlike other five ethnic groups of caucasus who were accused of axis collaboration during world war ii meskhetian turks were never officially charged by soviet government with any crime they were not close to any combat in spite of this they were deported as well german army never came within a range of 100 miles of meskheti region professor brian glyn williams concluded that deportations of meskhetian turks which coincided with deportation of other ethnic groups from caucasus and crimea lends strongest evidence that all deportations were a part of a larger concealed soviet foreign policy rather than a response to any universal mass treason of these people svante cornell pointed out that eviction was a part of a larger russian policy that had been in effect since 1864 to remove as many muslim minorities from caucasus as possible thumb 250px map showing territorial claims of soviet union towards turkey in 1945 beria sent an memorandum to stalin on 1944 in which he accused meskhetian turks of smuggling and of being used by turkish intelligence for espionage beria s secret decree painted meskhetian turks kurds and hemshils as untrustworthy population that must be removed from border region some historians interpret this eviction by stalin s plan to remove pro turkish group from border area in order to obtain parts of northeastern turkey in june 1945 vyacheslav molotov soviet minister of foreign affairs demanded of turkey that it cedes three anatolian provinces to soviet union kars ardahan and scholars alexandre bennigsen and marie concluded that deportation of meshketian turks was thus undertaken as a precaution in case of a soviet turkish war for eastern parts of turkey these claims and turkish straits crisis escalated until plans failed when turkey joined nato in 1951 soviet authorities tried to forge a state out of 108 different nationalities initially they tried to use this multiethnic state to exploit cross border ethnic groups to project influence into countries neighboring soviet union terry martin a professor of russian studies assessed that this had opposite effect soviet fear of capitalist influence eventually led to ethnic cleansing of its borderlands which encompassed meskhetian turks death toll meskhetian turks were placed under administration of special settlements purpose of these settlements was to be a system of cheap labor for economic progress of faraway parts of soviet union many of those deported performed forced labor special settlers routinely worked eleven to twelve hours a day seven days a week they suffered from exhaustion and frostbite and were denied their food rations if they did not meet their work quota lack of food was apparently so severe that soviet council of people s commissars adopted decree n 942 rs which provided of flour and of cereals to settlers from georgian ssr exiled peoples had to report to their surveillance organs on a weekly basis and were not allowed to travel anywhere outside their settlements however meskhetian turks were treated somewhat better than other ethnic groups in special settlements because they had not been accused of a specific crime during their first 12 years in special settlements exiled meskhetian turks coped with extreme deprivation and isolation from outside world they suffered a considerable hardship during first years in exile these included poor quality of food and medicine process of adaptation to new climate epidemics which included spotted fever and forced labor estimates of mortality rate of meskhetian turks differ karachay demographer d m estimated that 12 589 meshketian turks died due to deportation amounting to a 13 percent mortality rate of their entire ethnic group professor michael gave a higher figure of 15 000 fatalities among this ethnic group official but incomplete soviet archives recorded 14 895 deaths or a 14 percent to 15 7 percent mortality rate among people deported from georgian soviet socialist republic this list included all groups from region but meskhetian turks formed a large majority of them soviet archives also record that an additional 457 people died during transit to central asia high assessments give a figure of 30 000 and up to 50 000 dead by 1948 mortality rate had fallen to 2 8 on 26november 1948 presidium of ussr supreme soviet issued a decree which sentenced deported groups to permanent exile in those distant regions this decree applied to chechens and ingush crimean tatars volga germans balkars kalmyks and meskhetian turks aftermath stalin s successor new soviet leader nikita khrushchev delivered a secret speech at communist party congress on 24february 1956 condemning stalinist deportations but did not mention meskhetian turks among deported peoples decree of presidium of supreme soviet of ussr dated 28april 1956 and titled on removal of special deportation restrictions from crimean tatars balkars soviet turks kurds hemshils and members of their families deported during great patriotic war ordered release of these ethnic groups from administrative control of mvd bodies but did not envisage their return to their native lands unlike other deported peoples meskhetian turks were not rehabilitated they were one of three ethnic groups who were not allowed to return to their native lands other two being volga germans and crimean tatars thumb 250px right young meskhetian turks wearing t shirts commemorating deportation official soviet publications made no mention of either meskhetian turks nor their region of origin between 1945 and 1968 on 1968 a decree of presidium of supreme soviet acknowledged their deportation but its text claimed that meskhetian turks had taken roots in their new homes of kazakhstan and uzbekistan and called upon them to stay there meskhetian turks signed 144 petitions in 45 years demanding a right to return in 1964 they formed turkish association for national rights of turkish people in exile and tried to contact u n and amnesty international to help them return between 1961 and 1969 there were six attempts to return to georgia but these groups were all deported once again in 1960s soviet government resorted to repression in order to suppress meskhetian turk movement that demanded a right to return to region methods included arrests intimidation and imprisonment of meskhetian turk activists moreover on 26july 1968 vasil first secretary of communist party of georgian ssr announced that there was no room for return of that ethnic group in area and that only 100 families might return per year 1 211 meskhetian turks returned to georgia but were dispersed away from meskheti region to western part of country in june 1988 some 200 representatives of ethnic group protested in borjomi district demanding a right to return by 1989 only 35 families remained in georgia while only meskhetian turks who returned to meskheti region were eventually forced to leave it situation changed at least on paper in late 1980s when new soviet leader mikhail gorbachev decided to break all ties with stalinist past on 14november 1989 supreme soviet declared that forced displacement of ethnic groups during stalin s era including meskhetian turks was illegal and criminal on 1991 supreme soviet of russian socialist federal soviet republic under its chairman boris yeltsin passed law on rehabilitation of repressed peoples with article 2 denouncing all mass deportations as stalin s policy of defamation and genocide even after dissolution of soviet union in 1991 newly independent georgia refused to give meskhetian turks right to return to meskheti region one of rare exceptions in georgia was a politician historian and human rights activist who advocated for meskhetian turk right to move back to meskheti unlike other ethnic groups resettled during soviet deportations meskhetian turks were sparsely mentioned in books covering subject by historians alexander and robert conquest russian historian pavel polian considered all of deportations of entire ethnic groups during stalin s era including those from caucasus as a crime against humanity he also noted that charges of treason were both unfair and hypocritical considering that almost 40 000 meskhetian turks fought on soviet side during world war ii in june 1989 meskhetian turks were victims of uzbek nationalist violence in fergana valley until these events only few people were aware of existence of meskhetian turks and very little scholarly research had been conducted about them after ethnic clashes in fergana valley 70 000 meskhetian turks fled and were scattered across seven countries of former soviet union meskhetian turks numbered between 260 000 and 335 000 people in 2006 since russian officials refused to grant meskhetian turks status of russian citizens council of
