masters present who attempted this cut sakakibara was only one to succeed in cutting helmet despite fact that he had been unable to make cut in practice attempts despite success of gekiken kogyo performances in his later years sakakibara regretted their development in his view rules and strictures of gekiken were perverting kenjutsu into new forms that were no longer relevant to battlefield combat he disdained point scoring swordsmanship of other kendoka of his era ignoring light touches by his opponents in order to deliver his own powerful strikes nonetheless gekiken kogyo practices which he began created an interest in fencing which led ultimately to development of modern kendo later life in his later years sakakibara returned to coach and train in his dojo in kurumazaka after
