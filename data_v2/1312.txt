1915 galveston hurricane was a tropical cyclone that caused extensive damage in galveston area in august 1915 widespread damage was also documented throughout its path across caribbean sea and interior united states due to similarities in strength and trajectory storm drew comparisons with deadly 1900 galveston hurricane while newly completed galveston seawall mitigated a similar scale disaster for galveston numerous fatalities occurred along unprotected stretches of texas coast due to storm s storm surge overall major hurricane inflicted at least 30 million in damage and killed 403 405 people a demographic normalization of landfalling storms suggested that an equivalent storm in 2018 would cause 109 8 billion in damage in united states of atlantic hurricane database concluded storm formed near cabo verde on august 5 gradually strengthening into a hurricane as it tracked westward however it remained undetected by united states weather bureau until it passed over lesser antilles as a hurricane on august 10 storm inflicted damage to shipping on islands and flooded docks and streets in martinique and dominica two days later intensifying storm passed north of jamaica bringing winds to northern coast significant losses were reported to island s banana beet and sugar plantations while coastal surge washed out roads and destroyed wharves fifteen people in jamaica were killed most houses and coconut trees were destroyed on cayman brac west of jamaica and substantial damage occurred across cayman islands on august 14 hurricane clipped western extremity of cuba killing fourteen storm s winds were estimated at 145 mph 230 km h a on modern day saffir simpson hurricane wind scale this was ultimately hurricane s peak intensity over gulf of mexico hurricane

southwest of galveston much of coastal texas was affected by storm s rough surf with a total death toll of 275 cities along galveston bay were inundated by storm surge destroying entire towns and damaging numerous buildings galveston was largely protected by its seawall but strong waves caused extensive beach erosion that undermined 200 outlying homes ninety percent of homes outside protection of seawall on galveston island were destroyed most buildings in houston were impacted incurring 1 million in damage storm brought strong winds and torrential rainfall across east texas causing widespread cotton losses and damage to infrastructure highest rainfall total from storm was in san augustine texas hurricane weakened as it tracked farther inland degenerating into a tropical storm within a day of its landfall in texas a northeast curve soon followed resulting in a track into ozarks and ohio river valley storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on august 20 over ozarks and dissipated over gulf of saint lawrence three days later heavy rainfall and significant river flooding occurred along storm s path during this latter phase of its evolution levee breaches in along white river in arkansas and mississippi river in illinois flooded entire towns st louis missouri recorded its rainiest 24 hour period in history experiencing a deadly flood of river des peres and meramec river that impacted much of city and surrounding suburbs killing 20 people and destroying over a thousand homes meteorological history on august 5 1915 observations from cabo verde and marine vicinity suggested presence of a nearby tropical depression on this basis a 2008 reanalysis of official hurricane database concluded that depression formed by 12 00 utc that day tracking west system gradually strengthened over tropical atlantic attaining tropical storm intensity on august 6 and eventually reaching hurricane intensity three days later while well east of lesser antilles despite storm s power united states weather bureau was unaware of its existence for at least five days due to sparsity of data over open ocean frankenfield 1915 p 406 in a summary of storm published in monthly weather review following month bureau noted that there was nothing to indicate that conditions were favorable for formation of a tropical storm nor was there anything pronounced to indicate its direction of progression more conclusive evidence from weather observations in windward islands allowed weather bureau to begin monitoring hurricane and disseminating warnings on morning of august 10 at time hurricane was situated roughly between barbados and dominica storm crossed into caribbean sea following day passing south of st croix with growing intensity as indicated by rapidly falling pressures throughout region frankenfield 1915 p 407 between august 12 13 intensifying hurricane traversed caribbean sea between haiti and jamaica with a bearing slightly north of west shortly after passing jamaica storm became a major hurricane on morning of august 13 on august 14 storm moved near cuba s isle of pines and across peninsula as a with sustained winds of 145 mph 230 km h this was

hurricane made landfall near san luis pass approximately southwest of galveston texas frankenfield 1915 p 409 upon moving ashore hurricane had winds estimated at 130 mph 215 km h and a barometric pressure of 940 mbar hpa 27 76 inhg these values were estimated using a peripheral pressure of 953 mbar hpa 28 14 inhg measured at velasco texas at time pressure measured at texas landfall was lowest ever measured in united states after moving inland storm quickly weakened passing southwest of houston texas as a before diminishing to a weak tropical storm within a day of landfall concurrently storm began to slowly curve towards north and northeast moving into northeast texas on august 18 frankenfield 1915 p 408 two days later system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while tracking

splashes ashore united states weather bureau began issuing notices warning of storm s presence on august 10 with information first sent to caribbean islands followed by distribution to weather bureau s stations along gulf and atlantic coasts of united states via their arlington virginia radio station initial forecasts predicted that storm would cross hispaniola and southeastern cuba but these landfalls did not materialize later anticipating that hurricane would cross western cuba weather bureau issued a northeast storm warning for key west and miami florida on august 13 these warnings were briefly elevated later that day to hurricane warnings and extended northwards along to florida coast to boca grande while these warnings were scaled down after hurricane moved away from state falling pressures throughout u s gulf coast on august 15 led weather bureau to issue storm and hurricane warnings along u s coast from brownsville texas to apalachicola florida eventually narrowing in extent to texas coast as landfall drew nearer head of bureau s local office in galveston texas w p stewart cited warnings as sole reason for relatively low number of fatalities in unprotected areas of city
