americas summer concert series and some of her concert tours such as born this way ball artrave artpop ball and las vegas residency lady gaga enigma background judas was revealed as name of second single in gaga s interview for vogue gaga confirmed release of judas as second single on ryan seacrest s radio show on february 14 2011 and also revealed redone as co producer of song at 53rd grammy awards redone told mtv news that if previous single title track from born this way polarized people judas was expected to shock them more on talk show last call with carson daly gaga explained to host that judas was about always falling in love with wrong man over and over again judas is a very very dark song it s rad she added with msn canada gaga revealed metaphors and meaning behind song judas is a metaphor and an analogy about forgiveness and betrayal and things that haunt you in your life and how i believe that it s darkness in your life that ultimately shines and illuminates greater light that you have upon you someone once said to me if you have no shadows then you re not standing in light so song is about washing feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving demons from your past in order to move into greatness of your future i just like really aggressive metaphors harder thicker darker and my fans do as well so it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor but it is a metaphor gaga further elaborated on inspiration behind song as walking towards light force in her life and peering towards devil in back while clutching onto source of light i sing about what a holy fool i am and that although moments in my life are so cruel and relationships can be so cruel i m still in love with judas i still go back again to those evil things she said during her interview with google gaga added to song s meaning as honoring one s inner darkness in order to bring themselves into light one has to learn to forgive themselves in order to move on with their life with popjustice she clarified that she has a lot of things that have haunted her from her past including her choices men drug abuse being afraid to go back to new york confronting old romances hence judas represented something that was not good for her something she could not escape gaga said i keep going back and forth between darkness and light in order to understand who i am composition garibay said that judas sounded similar to many of gaga s previous singles like poker face lovegame bad romance and alejandro according to jocelyn vena of mtv judas finds gaga in a similar territory music wise but vocally she is in completely new territory according to popjustice in verses and pre chorus gaga hurls herself into a decadent half sung half rapped jamaican patois style jason gregory of gigwise called song a heavy slice of electro house of highest order song contains three hooks and begins with gaga singing line oh oh oh oh oh i m in love with judas accompanied by building synths this is followed by a thumping electronic beat as gaga sings juda a ah gaga utterance of these words are reminiscent of opening verse in bad romance gaga s vocals are partially spoken and at times have a caribbean accent first verse follows as when he comes to me i am ready i ll wash his feet with my hair if he needs forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain even after three times he betrays me i ll bring him down a king with no crown tone lightens up on song s chorus which is influenced by 80s pop in its melody as beat picks up a bit and gaga sings i m just a holy fool oh baby it s so cruel but i m still in love with judas baby after second verse and chorus song features a break down influenced by house music gaga chants lines in same way she does in middle of born this way then she sings i wanna love you but something s pulling me away from you jesus is my virtue judas is demon i cling to i cling to in this section gaga s vocals drew comparison to that of rihanna s by matthew perpetua of rolling stone he also added that her voice sounded less dark and dramatic and was full of bubbly sweetness popjustice wrote that breakdown sounded like tribal techno and whole song was a turbo charged wrongness anthem dan martin from nme wrote that breakdown was in dubstep genre with chorus being pure pop there were some similarities and influences of bad romance in song which gaga said was deliberate she explained that while sometimes it is important for her to push herself in new directions she did want her characteristic sound to be imbibed in her records i wanted judas to be an evolution from where i ve been before but in terms of formula i wanted there to be something about judas that reminded people of what i ve done in past she added according to sheet music published on musicnotes com song is written in time signature of common time and is composed in key of c minor with a tempo of 131 beats per minute gaga s voice ranges from tonal nodes of b3 to e5 and song follows a basic sequence of a fm7 cm b cm as its chord progression gaga had posted some of lyrics of song in february 2011 and next month she revealed more lyrics for judas in google interview gaga also confirmed that song was influenced by biblical judas iscariot according to popjustice lyrically on surface judas is a song about being double crossed and contemplating revenge but being repeatedly drawn to awfulness middle eight of song with lyrics but in cultural sense i just speak in future tense judas kiss me if or wear an ear condom next time talks about gaga being beyond ability to redeem herself in terms of traditional views of what a woman is supposed to be but i don t want to redeem myself because in cultural sense i believe that i m just before my time and if you don t like it wear an ear condom she explained main portion of song is about gaga in private and middle eight is about gaga in public two themes that are explored elsewhere on parent album too artwork and release in 42nd episode of gaga s web video series called transmission gagavision it was revealed that single s accompanying cover artwork was designed by gaga in microsoft word and featured a black background with word judas written in red capital letters in impact font below it was a red christian cross with a heart in middle gaga photographed design on her computer screen using her cellular telephone for texture which resulted in visible pixels on letters and cross as well as a faint reflection of her face and hands holding phone to appear on cover episode showed gaga sitting in a meeting with her creative team haus of gaga discussing specifics of her album release scattered around gaga were a number of photographs which were speculated by mtv as something judas related on one photo word judas was printed with a cross on it jocelyn vena from mtv felt that artwork could have easily appeared in director baz luhrmann s version of romeo and juliet 1996 on 41st episode of transmission gagavision gaga announced that song was going to be released soon she added abstract message along with announcement let cultural baptism begin if they were not who you were taught they would be would you still believe judas was scheduled to be sent to mainstream airplay on april 19 2011 and digital retailers on same day but after track was leaked to internet its release was brought forward to april 15 2011 this was done to counteract pre release leaks before release gaga tweeted about single saying i ve learned love is like a brick you can build a house or sink a dead body on april 15 2011 hours before song was played on radio she again tweeted even after three times he betrays me she wrote harking back to song s lyrics about love and betrayal in united kingdom song premiered on capital fm network on april 15 2011 during their program home run gaga addressed leak in 43rd episode of transmission gagavision likening it to a disembodiment saying a slow death just put me out of my f ing misery just put that sh out they were tearing song limb for limb first it was arm of song then liver critical reception right 190px thumb lady gaga performing judas on born this way ball tour standing on top of medieval castle prop 2012 judas was generally well received by most music critics jonathan van meter from vogue gave song a positive review saying song sounded like it was written for ronettes but was set to a dance beat mtv s james dinh noted that song was very similar in its composition to bad romance popjustice also compared it to bad romance describing it as a highly evolved titanium plated bad romance from year 2511 travelling half a millennium back in time to save music from a tidal wave of in club obsessed pop drivel and that s judas kevin o donnel from spin felt that song sounded like a rowdy industrial disco banger and described gaga s performance as insanely over top she alternates between rapping a robotic monotone and a crow like squawk before gliding into a more conventional chorus that hews closer to bad romance he complimented primal energy of music of judas and felt that breakdown was one of weirdest moments to hit pop music scene in 2011 slant magazines eric henderson noted that disconnection and deviation from gaga s previous single born this way was more pronounced with judas musically he felt that judas had same glitter jackhammer level as born this way though big anthemic chords are almost inverted not unlike inner city s big fun vs good life it s a good twin evil twin thing henderson continued that song conjured imagery of a disturbed vision of hell and in a warped sense song seemed more forward thinking to him and less of a message than gay great equation at heart of born this way amos barshad from new york declared that song reminded him of being drunk and dancing in a remote discotheque in berlin nmes dan martin was of opinion that judas was song that gaga should have come back with but he understood why she did not choose it as lead single from born this way given fact that song was characteristic of gaga s music pointing same thing matthew perpetua from rolling stone wrote that song played to gaga s established musical sensibilities he added that although judas certainly had its own charms and at least three insanely catchy hooks it leans hard on gaga s signature moves maura johnston of village voice summarized song as a twin of bad romance describing its instantly memorable wordless vocalizing a pummeling beat lyrics about a romance that is well bad digital spy s robert copsey gave song five out of five stars commending blasphemously camp chorus and comparing it to be worthy of eurovision a meets lordi affair that unsurprisingly takes a few listens to get your head around mark lepage from gazette praised song and understood that as gaga s music has progressed so has her themes and inspirations indicated by conflicted relationship she has with character judas in song rick fulton while writing in daily record compared it to like a prayer on steroids and gave it three out of five points nme called song gaga s worst single so far in november 2011 plagiarism allegations on august 4 2011 rebecca francescatti a chicago based songwriter filed a lawsuit against gaga and interscope for allegedly ripping off song juda from her album it s all about you according to nbc chicago bassist that worked on song with gaga brian gaynor also plays for francescatti a copy of lawsuit revealed francescatti seeks a cut from profits judas has earned on a song that copied and incorporated substantial original portions of work in june 2014 lawsuit was dismissed without trial by a federal judge in an act of summary judgment in chicago stating in part differences between songs juda and judas so outweigh purported similarities between melodies that they cannot be said to be even remotely similar we agree with defendants that songs do not have common lyrics themes are different and they do not sound at all alike musically thus we find similarity of expression to be quite clearly totally lacking two songs are so utterly dissimilar that reasonable minds could not differ as to a

accusations towards her that she s trashy or pretentious or this and that video is my way of saying i ve crossed line i won t even try to repent nor should i forgiveness and destiny also played a part in video and gaga wanted to portray a federico fellini esque story with apostles being revolutionaries in a modern day jerusalem they are led to jesus by gaga as magdalene although initially reported

line coming out of its lower lid before its release catholic league s president william anthony donohue criticized music video for its portrayal of gaga as mary magdalene he spoke exclusively to com about gaga s focus on judas and mary magdalene calling her increasingly irrelevant compared to people with real talent and attacked her for seemingly purposefully debuting song and video close to holy week and easter gaga noted in an interview with e that video was not meant to cause controversy in any way jokingly adding only controversial thing about this video is that i m wearing christian lacroix and chanel in same frame after its release catholic league released a statement clarifying that they did not find clip to be anti catholic although gaga toyed with religious iconography in it jason lipshutz from billboard described it as a motorcycle mayhem meets biblical betrayal mtv news james called video as a pure pop clip albeit one that looks great and is sure to earn ire of a few folks on religious right he added that judas is at its sacred heart an artistic explosion contained within confines of a traditional pop clip christian blauvelt from entertainment weekly did not like video at first calling it her weakest effort to date and attributing it to gibson s choreography and literal storyline however he admitted that after watching video a few times he became fond of it tris mccall from star ledger felt that there was neither anything blasphemous about video nor anything too daring about it mccall explained that dancing in video is a pleasure to watch but would have been better if camera work was more professional according to him only eye catching prop in video was gun that turned into a lipstick matthew perpetua from rolling stone was certain that video would offend some christians for its irreverent and highly sexualized take on jesus christ he also said that gaga interpreted biblical story in her own style oscar from slant magazine complimented production of video by calling it visually stunning while adding that judas is work of a repertory not a revolutionary it takes familiar from gaga s palette leather and chain aesthetic of telephone plaintive tear stained camera stare of bad romance and puts them all together for a competently executed work phil fox rose while reviewing video for washington post gave it a positive review stating that he found it moving both artistically and spiritually he then went on to explain how religion related accusations against gaga were completely biased vh1 found that video was inspired by madonna s like a prayer films our lady of assassins wild angels and romeo juliet and american television series lost nme named judas fourth worst music video ever describing it as an attempt to jump on madonna catholicism bandwagon that so incredibly misjudged it s quite comical at 2011 muchmusic video awards gaga won best international artist video award for judas song s music video also received two
