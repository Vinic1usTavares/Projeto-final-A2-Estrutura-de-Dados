african music and other genres a student and farmer protest movement termed rotaka had been gaining momentum across country since april 1971 these protests expressed popular rejection of policies and repression of president philibert tsiranana s neo colonial administration on 24 april 1972 secondary school students in capital of antananarivo protested in solidarity with city s medical university students to support revisions of colonial era curriculum and dismissal of teachers from france secondary school students in other major cities organized similar protests at their local high schools and those with musical poetic or theatrical talent spontaneously entertained their classmates at gatherings on first day of protests in antsirabe dama and raoul performed a song they called why we re on strike which dama had composed shortly before as they entertained protesters at their high school they were joined by other members of group to compose and perform new songs with diverse themes

themselves a musical act and had not chosen a name one of them spontaneously replied mahaleo name is most commonly translated as meaning free or independent but with nuance more precisely meaning to have enough power to win resist endure accomplish in addition to being part of dama s family name zafimahaleo word appealed to group as embodiment of their purpose to empower disenfranchised masses and exalt malagasy values and culture in post colonial era together they created and performed songs that affirmed malagasy identity and gave voice to concerns of rural communities and youth on 13 may security forces shot student protesters in antananarivo although bekoto had initially been reluctant to take sides because he was a largely apolitical adolescent and dating daughter of prime minister this event galvanized group members and led to intensification of student protests across island within days tsiranana announced his resignation and a transitional government was put in place under general gabriel dama participated in community meetings where potential policy reforms were developed as protest movement ended group traveled to antananarivo to perform at an event in support of transition organized on university of antananarivo campus this was their first performance before a large audience and despite an inadequate sound system that prevented most audience members from hearing them they enjoyed a strongly positive reception following this success group members returned to antsirabe to complete their high school studies raoul and nono completed baccalaureat exam in 1973 and moved into student dormitory in antananarivo to continue their studies at national university early years band s popularity continued to grow over coming years as younger band members completed their high school studies they performed frequent concerts in antananarivo staying overnight in student dorms with raoul and nono fafa moved to antananarivo shortly afterward to live with his parents and band often gathered at his family s home where they composed many of their early songs as each of younger boys passed their baccalaureat they moved to antananarivo to continue their studies at university which they paid through a combination of state subsidies and profits from their concerts political party representatives often approached band members to request them to become official supporters and party members but band preferred to remain politically independent another young and emerging group lolo sy ny tariny was recruited by political party mfm who attempted to pit two groups against each other although there were occasional arguments between bekoto and members of lolo sy ny tariny that garnered publicity band remained largely above political disputes mahaleo

exceeded capacity of venue prompting group to play same concert twice in one evening to enable all their waiting fans to enjoy performance tsiranana s ouster ushered in socialist second republic under admiral didier ratsiraka in 1975 but ineffectiveness of regime s philosophy soon fomented popular disillusionment persistent in their exposure of political problems like corruption and abuse of power

their concerts they continued to gain in popularity regularly performing live shows across madagascar and launching frequent tours to play for malagasy diaspora in major french population centers like
