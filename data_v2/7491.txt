leroy salter production conception before creating true detective nic pizzolatto had taught at university of north carolina at chapel hill depauw university and university of chicago inspired by hbo s series wire sopranos and deadwood he began working on a short story collection that he later published as between here and yellow sea in 2006 he published a novel galveston in 2010 and began trying to write for television his earlier attempts at television writing were unsuccessful because of a lack of money pizzolatto s first major gig in television writing came in 2011 as a screenwriter for amc s series killing he credits show with giving him a glimpse of inner workings of television industry pizzolatto grew increasingly dissatisfied with series creative direction and left two weeks into staff writing sessions for its second season true detective was intended to be a novel but once project took definite form pizzolatto thought narrative s shifts in time and perspective made it more suitable for television he pitched an adaptation of galveston and from may to july 2010 he developed six screenplays including an early 90 page draft of true detective pilot script pizzolatto secured a development deal with hbo for a potential pilot series shortly thereafter he wrote a second true detective script soon after his departure from killing thanks to support of production company and manager anonymous content which ultimately produced and developed project in house by april 2012 following a heated bidding period hbo commissioned eight episodes of true detective pizzolatto did not hire a writing staff because he believed a collaborative approach would not work with his isolated novelistic process and that a group would not achieve his desired result after working alone for about three months final copy of project script was 500 pages long cast and crew because series is an anthology each season has a self contained narrative following a disparate set of characters in various settings pizzolatto began contemplating lead roles while he was pitching series to networks in early 2012 true detective anthology format required actors to commit to only a single season so pizzolatto was able to attract film stars who normally avoid television series because of their busy schedules woody harrelson and matthew mcconaughey were among actors pizzolatto considered for star billing mcconaughey who had recently finished filming killer joe 2011 was contracted well before hbo commissioned season impressed with his performance in lincoln lawyer 2011 pizzolatto at first assigned him to play hart but mcconaughey convinced him to give him part of cohle when asked in a variety interview about his decision to switch parts actor replied i wanted to get in that dude s head obsession island of a man i m always looking for a guy who monologues it s something really important as i feel i m going into my better work to prepare for role mcconaughey created a 450 page analysis four stages of rustin cohle to study his character s evolution during season harrelson was season s next significant casting choice brought on to play hart at mcconaughey s request harrelson stated that he joined true detective partly because he wanted to work with certain people involved in project with whom he had previously collaborated in 2012 hbo film game change michelle monaghan agreed to play season s female lead maggie because she felt compelled by direction of plot and her character s story arc michael potts and tory kittles completed principal cast playing detectives maynard gilbough and thomas papania respectively major supporting roles in true detective first season include kevin dunn as major ken quesada alexandra daddario as lisa tragnetti and brad carter as charlie lange pizzolatto narrowed his search for a suitable director to cary joji fukunaga whom he knew from anonymous content and alejandro gonzalez inarritu fukunaga was formally appointed as director after inarritu pulled out of project due to film commitments in preparation for his work on series fukunaga spent time with a homicide detective of louisiana state police s criminal investigations division to develop an accurate depiction of a 1990s homicide detective s work fukunaga recruited adam arkapaw director of photography of top of lake as project cinematographer arkapaw came to director s attention for his work in animal kingdom 2010 and snowtown 2011 and was hired after two negotiated a deal at a meeting in san francisco alex digerlando who fukunaga had worked with on glory at sea in 2008 was appointed as production designer fukunaga said in an interview i knew what alex accomplished in swamps of louisiana and given some money how much more amazing he could be in building sets that would just be used for one or two days and be abandoned again filming initially true detective first season was due to shoot in arkansas but pizzolatto later chose to film in louisiana to take advantage of state tax incentives and area s distinctive landscape there s a contradictory nature to place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all everything lives under layers of concealment woods are thick and dark and impenetrable on other hand you have beauty of it all from a distance principal photography took three months between 100 and 110 days from january to june 2013 approximately five minutes of film were shot per day production staff constructed various set pieces among them a scorched chapel joel theriot s tent revival and louisiana state criminal investigations division offices last of which they built inside an abandoned light bulb warehouse near elmwood for dora lange crime scene crew filmed exterior shots at a remote sugarcane field outside which because it was partially burned inspired what digerlando called a moody and atmospheric backdrop for corresponding interior scenes scene in which cohle taking ginger hostage escapes a housing complex amidst gunfire was captured in bridge city as a single six minute tracking shot a technique fukunaga had employed in sin nombre 2009 and jane eyre 2011 shot in seven takes preparation for scene was extensive and demanding mcconaughey trained with mark norby to master a fighting style for his character and nature of shoot required a team of stunt coordinators make up artists and special effects crew on hand during its entire course elsewhere shooting took place at old kenner high school campus and nineteenth century fort macomb located outside new orleans filming schedule was not organized in episode sequence which made managing logistics much more challenging entire season was shot on 35 mm film which production staff chose to achieve a certain texture as well as a nostalgic quality season was filmed using a panavision millennium xl2 camera and choice of lens corresponded to period when a scene took place scenes set in 1995 and 2002 were captured with panavision pvintage lenses which produced a softer image because they were made of recycled low contrast glass as these scenes were written as a reflection of cohle and hart s memory production sought to make them as cinematic as possible to reflect what arkapaw called fragmentation of their lucid imaginations back through their past to achieve this they relied on wider lenses to exaggerate composition 2012 scenes were shot with panavision primo lenses visual palette in comparison was sharper and had much more contrast lending a modern crisp feeling to images and according to arkapaw pulling characters out from their environments to hopefully help audiences get inside their heads art design thumb left design team used an assortment of low poly meshes to develop a 3d landscape for show s title sequence which were later meticulously superimposed digital doubles such as this one of hart shown in upper left frame were created in some cases to allow more texture alt this image illustrates superimposition of true detective s title sequence in intermediate stages compared to final product joshua walsh was responsible for creating true detective artwork his work for show consists of over 100 individual devil s nests twig sculptures created by killer along with wall paintings and miniature sculptures of men made of beer cans among others according to digerlando walsh s interests in hunting and taxidermy made him perfect dude for job a blueprint for devil s nests was not well established in script other than specifications that structures be able to stand on their own and feature a spiral motif digerlando and walsh went with a tripod design that showed a spiral when viewed from base and contained ladder like crossing elements that symbolized killer s desire to ascend to a dark spiritual plane each design had subtle differences from one another digerlando cited work of henry and james charles castle as strong stylistic influences and sought a primitive look for sculptures one that revealed workings of a man with some deep inner urge to express himself to reflect this walsh built devil s nests using mud secondhand children s clothing reeds roots and other materials he felt killer would use season s title sequence was a collaboration between director patrick clair his santa monica based studio elastic his sydney based studio antibody and brisbane based company breeder design team emphasized southern louisiana s industrial landscape because it reflected characters traits and personal inner struggles clair stated that from start he had an unusually clear vision of true detective finished opening sequence using richard s photography book petrochemical america 2012 as a template production team initially photographed local scenery and resulting images were woven together to form core of title sequence by time production began animating they faced several problems photographic stills were too grainy and footage was too jagged as a result many shots were digitally altered and slowed to about a tenth of their original speed which according to clair evoked a surreal and floaty mood that perfectly captured what we were after creation of a 3d effect required design team to use an assortment of low poly meshes or 3d geometric models using a variety of animation and special effects techniques these images were later superimposed with painstaking care to avoid a sterile digitized look clair said most crucial thing to me was that this didn t feel digital so we went to great lengths to incorporate as much organic imagery as possible for some stills design team created digital doubles to develop more texture sequence s final cut was polished using optical glitching and motion distortion techniques sydney morning herald included opening sequence in a list of ten of best title sequences on television music season one s opening theme is far from any road an alternative country song originally composed by handsome family for their 2003 album singing bones true detective soundtrack features a compilation of gospel and blues music which were selected by pizzolatto and t bone burnett pair opposed use of cajun music and swamp blues for season s musical score because they felt it was overdone burnett said score was intended to be character driven rather than inspired by other crime fiction drama songs by bo diddley melvins primus staple singers wu tang clan vashti bunyan townes van zandt and captain beefheart appear in season one burnett also composed original pieces with rhiannon giddens who used a synthesizer and cassandra wilson hbo released an abridged soundtrack album featuring 14 tracks from true detective first two seasons on august 14 2015 through physical media and itunes themes and analysis masculinity and depiction of women commentators have noted masculinity as a theme in true detective christopher of southern spaces said show was about men living in a brutally masculine world and as such women are depicted as things to be saved and erotic obstacles a la double indemnity 1944 and chinatown 1974 slate willa paskin said true detective depiction of its female characters as sex workers deceased and a nagging wife seemed to reveal an intent to reflect protagonists blinkered worldview and very masculine southern cop culture they inhabited some commentators saw hart s characterization as a manifestation of this idea evident through his conventional view of women as virgins and whores as well as his treatment of maggie and audrey for example when hart confronts two men who had sex with audrey he is in essence charging other men a price for infringing on daughter he sees in a muddled way as both deserving of protection and badly in need of being controlled in her piece for salon janet turley said that women become reflections of men given that true detective universe is seen through eyes of show s male leads sam adams of indiewire contended that season s central story focused on horrible things men do to women many of which are never reported to or investigated by authorities adams wrote no one missed dora lange marie fontenot disappeared and police let a rumor stop them from following up furthermore he said role of women was more profound because cohle suffers through his ex wife and deceased daughter and hart is unable to deal appropriately with women who are there according to scott wilson a cultural studies lecturer at kingston university women are distinguished into three groups what he calls superegoic obscene and sacred maggie in wilson s interpretation is portrayed as superegoic wife who constantly makes demands on her guilty husband or partner tying him or her down and deflecting him or her from his symbolic role as police philosopher erin k stapleton subscribes to theory that dora lange s corpse serves to provide initial territory or orientation through which communities of true detective are formed it is through dora s corpse that cohle and hart s partnership is first clearly articulated and in addition to their own bond intimate knowledge of her body is basis of all of other relationships in their respective lives her narrative thus by proxy influences both men s character development as they dive deeper into their investigation religion true detective explores christianity and dichotomy between religion and rationality born into a devout catholic household pizzolatto said that as a child he saw religion as storytelling that acts as an escape from truth according to andrew romano at daily beast season alludes to pizzolatto s childhood and creates a parallel between christianity and supernatural theology of carcosa both are stories stories people tell themselves to escape reality stories that violate every law of universe romano believed this message is not critical of religion per se rather it shows how power of storytelling and religious zeal can wind you up in some pretty sick places jeff jensen from entertainment weekly has opined that show becomes more self aware through cohle s harsh critiques of religion which he viewed as a vehicle for commentary about pop culture escapism stapleton observed that crimes on true detective through its victims and implications of sacrifice and sexual violence respond to conservative christianity from which they originate and seek to exploit opportunities for pleasure of transgression such a structure offers theorist connole saw connections to philip marlowe and le morte d arthur lancelot in true detective presentation of cohle all knights whose duty to their liege lord is tempered with devotion to god other aspects of true detective evoke christian imagery including opening scene which connole felt mirrored crucifixion of jesus author and philosopher finn argued that cohle s evolution illustrates an affinity between buddhism and philosophical pessimism a self proclaimed pessimist cohle is however changed by a near death experience in season finale in which he has an epiphany seeing death as pure love this echoes buddhist concept of philosophical pessimism and influences alt a publicity portrait of chambers circa 1903 thumb upright pizzolatto used robert w chambers pictured king in yellow as backbone for much of season s story critics have offered many readings of influence of weird and horror fiction on true detective narrative often examining influence of robert w chambers short story collection king in yellow 1895 and thomas ligotti allusions to king in yellow can be observed in show s dark philosophy its recurring use of carcosa and yellow king as motifs throughout series and its symbolic use of yellow as a thematic signature that signifies insanity and decadence pizzolatto was accused of plagiarizing ligotti because of close similarities between lines in true detective and text from ligotti s nonfiction book conspiracy against human race 2010 accusations pizzolatto denied while acknowledging ligotti s influence other philosophers and writers identified as influences include arthur schopenhauer friedrich nietzsche gilles deleuze ray brassier emil and eugene thacker mathijs peters in a piece for film international argued that true detective probes philosophy through its approach to individuality self denial battle between dark and light and so forth ben woodard noted show s evolving philosophy which examines a setting where culture religion and society are direct by products of biological weakness woodward wrote biological programming gets recuperated and socially redistributed visions faiths and acerbic personalities take reins of uncertain ends creating a world where people go away even setting neylan argued emphasizes a world where decrepitude of human ordering cannot be hidden he stated this is not a place where hope fled it is a place where hope could never take root it is with these people and environs that real horror is sourced yet neylan observed that cohle s actions are not motivated by misanthropy rather a drive to challenge those who try to either disguise or manipulate this frailty of humans for their own benefit and in doing so cohle ultimately confronts an entire philosophical history which has taken its task as that of sweeping frailty away christopher orr at atlantic said true detective was in best sense a fusion of 1995 and zodiac 2007 because of its subject matter sleek cinematography and vivid unsettling aura some commentators noted further influences from comic book literature adams likened cohle to protagonist of alan moore s courtyard and drew parallels with grant morrison s invisibles for show s brief exploration of m theory with one of cohle s monologues comicsalliance and new york columnist abraham riesman cited top 10 as inspiration for season finale based on dialogue from episode s closing scene auteurism another principal topic of discussion among critics has been true detective auteurist sensibility auteurism from french auteur is a critical framework that assesses films or other works of art as reflections of personal vision of individual authors typically a director or writer at helm of each of season s episodes are pizzolatto and fukunaga its sole writer and director a partnership that provides show a unique place in a traditionally collaborative medium where broad sets of writers and directors work in tandem colin robertson at list saw twin peaks as most notable artistic antecedent to true detective first season seeing that both shows challenge crime drama cliches and use genre conventions of a whodunnit style mystery as a sublimely subversive diving board and leap off from there to tell a broader story reception viewership true detective debuted to 2 3 million u s viewers becoming hbo s highest rated series premiere since pilot episode of boardwalk empire ratings remained steady and peaked at finale which drew 3 5 million viewers overall season one averaged 2 33 million viewers and its average gross audience which includes dvr recordings reruns and hbo go streaming totaled 11 9 million viewers per episode thus becoming hbo s highest rated freshman show since first season of six feet under 13 years earlier reviews american press considered true detective to be among best television shows of 2014 many critics complimented work of both lead actors often singling out mcconaughey for further praise with his work described as jaw droppingly great and simply magnetic some reviewers singled out simple conversational scenes often in claustrophobic interiors as some of best acting in series characterization received mixed reviews cohle s speeches described by huffpost as mesmerizing monologues and by vanity fair as dense and interesting material were criticized by new york post as 70s era psycho babble which slowed down story several critics viewed portrayals of women as stereotypical either angry or aroused though michelle monaghan was praised for her performance in a thankless role pizzolatto and fukunaga as sole writer and director of entire series were able to exercise much stronger control over show than is usual for a tv series which let show take risks pacing dialogue and cinematography all departed at times from expectations for a television drama pizzolatto s scripts drew occasional criticism as self consciously literary and overwritten and several journalists attributed mistakes in script to pizzolatto s inexperience in writing tv drama despite criticism daily telegraph and uproxx described season as ambitious and dense with event and meaning flashback structure also divided critics it was described as impressively seamless and a major asset but fragmented approach to storytelling was considered a flaw by others uproxx praised fukunaga s atmospheric and hauntingly beautiful cinematography and boston globe complimented spare hollow percussive soundtrack with uproxx crediting creative control two men wielded for quality of result story of two mismatched detectives working on a case was described by several critics as a cliche though many reviewers felt this was made into a strength daily beast for example described narrative as having potential to be revolutionary and grantland reviewer felt that form is truly radical and forward thinking though he added that content is anything but emily nussbaum writing for new yorker was also critical considering real story to be a simpler tale one about heroic male outlines and closeups of female asses she described philosophical monologues as dorm room deep talk and argued that show had fallen for its own sales pitch other reviewers were more positive comments ranged from as frighteningly nervy and furious in its delivery and intent as prime david lynch to one of most riveting and provocative series i ve ever seen accolades right thumb upright alt a photograph of woody harrelson and matthew mcconaughey at 66th primetime emmy awards harrelson left and mcconaughey right at 66th primetime emmy awards as nominations for 66th primetime emmy awards approached early media reports named true detective among several potential miniseries candidates due to a revision made by academy of television arts sciences that recognized film and miniseries content as distinct categories by march 2014 hbo had submitted true detective as a drama series contender an unconventional move given show s anthology format and fierce competition from likes of breaking bad and house of cards hbo s decision was censured by fx president john landgraf who remarked to reporters at a press event my own personal point of view is that a miniseries is a story that ends a series is a story that continues to tell you truth i think it s actually unfair for hbo to put true detective in drama series category because essentially you can get certain actors to do a closed ended series a la billy bob thornton in fargo or matthew mcconaughey and woody harrelson in true detective who you can t get to sign on for a seven year regular drama series deal nevertheless true detective emerged as a frontrunner heading into primetime emmy season and in july 2014 was nominated for twelve awards its closest
