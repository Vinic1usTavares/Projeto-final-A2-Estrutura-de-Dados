ampato possibly from quechua hamp simi monolingual quechua and bilingual quechua spanish dictionary or from aymara both meaning frog is a dormant stratovolcano in andes of southern peru it lies about northwest of arequipa and is part of a north south chain that includes volcanoes hualca hualca and sabancaya last of which has been active in historical time ampato consists of three volcanic cones which lie on top of an older eroded volcanic edifice they were formed sequentially by extrusion of lava flows but ampato has also had explosive eruptions which have deposited ash lapilli and pumice in surrounding landscape one young lava flow has been dated to 17 000 6 000 years before present but a summit lava dome is even younger and holocene ash layers in surrounding peat bogs may testify to occurrence of recent eruptions present day volcano is covered by an ice cap and during last glacial maximum glaciers advanced to low altitudes in 1995 an inca mummy known as mummy juanita was discovered on ampato by johan reinhard it had been offered as a human sacrifice more than six hundred years earlier on mountain geography and geomorphology ampato lies south of colca canyon and at southern end of a chain of volcanoes formed by hualca hualca and sabancaya last of which has been historically active clockwise from northeast towns of japo baylillas corinta and surround volcano city of arequipa lies to southeast ampato is part of central volcanic zone of andes which in peru manifests itself as several dozen pleistocene volcanoes some of which erupted in historical time including el misti huaynaputina sabancaya and ubinas largest historical eruption of andes took place at huaynaputina other volcanoes in peruvian central volcanic zone are sara sara solimana coropuna chachani ticsani tutupaca yucamane and casiri thumb ampato seen from west volcano ampato consists of three individual steep sided cones which rise from a gentle glacially eroded foot these three cones are lined up in southwest northeast direction and highest one reaches an elevation of or ampato is one of highest volcanoes in central volcanic zone and 35th highest summit in andes summit of volcano is covered with an ice cap and edifice is incised by glacial valleys volcano is surrounded by three sets of moraines lowermost one at elevation has been attributed to last glacial maximum between 25 000 17 000 years ago middle one between to a late readvance at pleistocene holocene epoch boundary and higher ones above to holocene advances geology off western coast of south america nazca plate subducts beneath south america plate at a rate of this subduction process is responsible for volcanism in central volcanic zone and started during jurassic period after opening of southern atlantic ocean which triggered onset of subduction of nazca plate volcanic arc associated volcanism originally occurred within cordillera de la costa in jurassic but later it migrated resulting in emplacement of tacaza and toquepala groups and finally neogene barroso group present day volcanic arc is situated in area of barroso group but has a narrower extent basement beneath ampato is formed by sedimentary and volcanic rocks of western cordillera of peru and rocks are of mesozoic to cenozoic age a high plateau formed by ignimbrites and lavas of pliocene to miocene age rises above this basement terrain is cut by several different fault systems one of these northeastward striking sepina fault has been seismically active in 20th and 21st centuries and seems to have controlled development of ampato and sabancaya volcanoes composition ampato has erupted different volcanic rocks at different stages with earliest ones generating andesite and dacite and which define a potassium rich suite rocks contain amphibole biotite iron oxide olivine plagioclase pyroxene and titanium oxide processes such as fractional crystallization magma mixing and absorption of crustal material by developing magmas have been invoked to explain formation of magmas of both ampato and sabancaya estimating rate of magma production at ampato is difficult owing to uncertainties in determining volume of edifice and duration of repose times between eruptions on average it appears to be this rate does not consider spurt like behaviour volcano growth in fits and spurts has been observed at many other volcanic arc volcanoes vegetation western cordillera features various climate zones such as quechua and suni zones vegetation that occurs at high altitudes is dominated by pioneer plants with wetlands constituting additional centres of biodiversity eruptive history a thick pile of andesitic lava flows with additional scoria and which crops out on southern southeastern and southwestern side of ampato volcano is oldest volcanic stage of this volcano with argon argon dating yielding ages between 400 000 450 000 years before present above this formation another pile of dacitic lava flows constructed first ampato edifice which was about same size as present day volcano this pile stage is about thick in outcrops and was emplaced between 230 000 200 000 years before present after a pause in volcanic activity and an intermediary stage stage one date obtained on this stage is 77 000 4 000 years before present that produced andesitic dacitic lava flows which form a thick unit on top of eroded remnants of older ampato volcanics andesitic northern cone formed as first of three present day cones southern cone developed in several different stages a first stage generated lava flows emanating from summit dating of two such flows has produced ages of 34 000 8 000 and 40 000 3 000 years before present more than of block and ash flows was erupted onto eastern and western flanks of ampato and these flows consist of one andesitic and one dacitic formation both appear to relate to a lava dome forming stage of volcanic activity these block and ash flows are themselves covered on both eastern and western flanks by more thick lava flows which make up a thick unit and again consist of one andesitic and one dacitic unit both units appear to have been erupted during last glacial maximum either during or before last glacial maximum ampato erupted tephra during multiple explosive eruptions which today is preserved in two units baylillas and corinta deposits first consists of lapilli pumice and scoria and individual layers form thick sequences at large distances from volcano but are heavily eroded and thus difficult to measure in extent scoria flows identified on southwestern southern flanks of ampato correspond to this unit dacitic corinta deposits conversely were created during one large eruption which also left a crater on ampato it generated stratified thick tephra deposits which contain pumice embedded within ash rich layers and it is probably also source of pumice flow deposits on south southwestern flank these contain dacitic pumice fragments in a matrix rich in ash and have thicknesses of more than in few outcrops much of this unit was likely eroded away by glacial activity left thumb 262x262px aerial view of ampato back from northeast with active volcano sabancaya in front central cone grew in gap between northern and southern edifice and consists of lava flows again of andesitic to dacitic composition these flows are together maximally thick and one flow has been dated to 17 000 6 000 years before present a dacitic summit lava dome is not affected by glacial erosion and appears to be youngest eruption product of ampato early holocene 11 000 8 000 years before present ash layers in peat bogs around volcano may have originated either on ampato or on sabancaya late holocene tephra layers dated to 1 790 110 2 050 70 and 4 500 125 likewise may have been erupted from ampato but sabancaya is a more likely source for these ash layers hazards presently ampato is considered to be a dormant volcano potential hazards from future eruptions at ampato are lahars induced by melting of icecap and sub plinian eruptions considering history of explosive eruptions at this volcano peruvian geological service has published a hazard map that describes danger areas of both ampato and sabancaya hazards mapped include both fall of ash and formation of lahars which can advance to distances of in southerly valleys of ampato pyroclastic fallout primarily threatens vicinity of volcano but large eruptions can result in fallout over large areas around volcanic complex human history ampato was site of human sacrifice during inca times when about 1466 mummy juanita was offered for sacrifice on mountain along with two other girls and a boy sacrifice took place on a platform on summit of volcano and was presumably intended to calm mountain spirits during an eruption of neighbouring volcano sabancaya mummies were discovered in 1995 by johan reinhard and colleagues on summit of mountain such sacrifices with children being usual subjects are known as capacocha and discoveries of their mummies on mountains in andes has gained them a lot of attention process served to tie inka empire more closely together since children to be sacrificed were selected from entire realm and children adorned and their names remembered after sacrifice see also ananta references sources further reading reinhard johan ice maiden inca mummies
