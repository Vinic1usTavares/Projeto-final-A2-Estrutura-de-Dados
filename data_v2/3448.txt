themes novel drew comparisons sometimes unfavorably to warriors series with holly koelling from booklist noting that despite change in species much will be familiar to readers however book s fantasy elements are lightly introduced in this series start quest begins has a focus on protecting environment and in many ways humans pose dangers to animals bears by undertaking this quest are forced to gain survival skills as they go along and to do so without assistance of adults to mentor and guide them koelling noted that while bears are anthropomorphized they also maintain bear like qualities and characteristics reception reception to novel was positive and many reviewers praised realistic setting and behaviours of main characters koelling noted how novel has a balance of cute anthropomorphic characterisation and also gives a realistic view of how hard it is for bears to survive on their own koelling also recommended novel to warriors fans kirkus reviews had a more mixed review noting fans of genre would haunt shelves for next volume despite little plot advancement due to time spent introducing and developing characters in contrast jennifer lynn draper in school
