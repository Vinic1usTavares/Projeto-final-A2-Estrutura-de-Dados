rite of spring is a ballet and orchestral concert work by russian composer igor stravinsky it was written for 1913 paris season of sergei diaghilev s ballets russes company original choreography was by vaslav nijinsky with stage designs and costumes by nicholas roerich when first performed at theatre des champs elysees on 29 may 1913 avant garde nature of music and choreography caused a sensation many have called first night reaction a riot or near riot though this wording did not come about until reviews of later performances in 1924 over a decade later although designed as a work for stage with specific passages accompanying characters and action music achieved equal if not greater recognition as a concert piece and is widely considered to be one of most influential musical works of 20th century stravinsky was a young virtually unknown composer when diaghilev recruited him to create works for ballets russes rite was third such project after acclaimed firebird 1910 and petrushka 1911 concept behind rite of spring developed by roerich from stravinsky s outline idea is suggested by its subtitle pictures of pagan russia in two parts scenario depicts various primitive rituals celebrating advent of spring after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death after a mixed critical reception for its original run and a short london tour ballet was not performed again until 1920s when a version choreographed by leonide massine replaced nijinsky s original which saw only eight performances massine s was forerunner of many innovative productions directed by world s leading ballet masters gaining work worldwide acceptance in 1980s nijinsky s original choreography long believed lost was reconstructed by joffrey ballet in los angeles stravinsky s score contains many novel features for its time including experiments in tonality metre rhythm stress and dissonance analysts have noted in score a significant grounding in russian folk music a relationship stravinsky tended to deny music influenced many of 20th century s leading composers and is one of most recorded works in classical repertoire background thumb upright left stravinsky sketched by picasso 1920 igor stravinsky was son of fyodor stravinsky principal bass singer at imperial opera st petersburg and anna nee a competent amateur singer and pianist from an old established russian family fyodor s association with many of leading figures in russian music including rimsky korsakov borodin and mussorgsky meant that igor grew up in an intensely musical home in 1901 stravinsky began to study law at saint petersburg university while taking private lessons in harmony and counterpoint stravinsky worked under guidance of rimsky korsakov having impressed him with some of his early compositional efforts by time of his mentor s death in 1908 stravinsky had produced several works among them a piano sonata in f minor 1903 04 a symphony in e major 1907 which he catalogued as opus 1 and a short orchestral piece feu d artifice fireworks composed in 1908 in 1909 feu d artifice was performed at a concert in st petersburg among those in audience was impresario sergei diaghilev who at that time was planning to introduce russian music and art to western audiences white 1961 pp 52 53 like stravinsky diaghilev had initially studied law but had gravitated via journalism into theatrical world in 1907 he began his theatrical career by presenting five concerts in paris in following year he introduced mussorgsky s opera boris godunov in 1909 still in paris he launched ballets russes initially with borodin s polovtsian dances from prince igor and rimsky korsakov s scheherazade to present these works diaghilev recruited choreographer michel fokine designer leon bakst and dancer vaslav nijinsky diaghilev s intention however was to produce new works in a distinctively 20th century style and he was looking for fresh compositional talent having heard feu d artifice he approached stravinsky initially with a request for help in orchestrating music by chopin to create ballet les sylphides stravinsky worked on opening nocturne and closing valse his reward was a much bigger commission to write music for a new ballet firebird l oiseau de feu for 1910 season stravinsky worked through winter of 1909 10 in close association with fokine who was choreographing firebird during this period stravinsky made acquaintance of nijinsky who although not dancing in ballet was a keen observer of its development stravinsky was uncomplimentary when recording his first impressions of dancer observing that he seemed immature and gauche for his age he was 21 on other hand stravinsky found diaghilev an inspiration very essence of a great personality stravinsky pp 24 28 firebird was premiered on 25 june 1910 with tamara karsavina in main role and was a great public success this ensured that diaghilev stravinsky collaboration would continue in first instance with petrushka 1911 and then rite of spring synopsis and structure in a note to conductor serge koussevitzky in february 1914 stravinsky described rite of spring as a musical choreographic work representing pagan russia unified by a single idea mystery and great surge of creative power of spring in his analysis of rite pieter van den toorn writes that work lacks a specific plot or narrative and should be considered as a succession of choreographed episodes van den toorn pp 26 27 french titles are given in form given in four part piano score published in 1913 there have

that in 1907 08 stravinsky set to music two poems from sergey gorodetsky s collection yar another poem in anthology which stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read is which morton observes contains many of basic elements from which rite of spring developed including pagan rites sage elders and sacrifice of a young maiden likeness is too close to be coincidental hill pp 102 104 stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of genesis of rite in a 1920 article he stressed that musical ideas had come first that pagan setting had been suggested by music rather than other way round hill p 3 however in his 1936 autobiography he described origin of work thus one day in 1910 when i was finishing last pages of l oiseau de feu in st petersburg i had a fleeting vision i saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite sage elders seated in a circle watching a young girl dance herself to death they were sacrificing her to propitiate god of spring such was theme of sacre du printemps stravinsky p 31 by may 1910 stravinsky was discussing his idea with nicholas roerich foremost russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic and had provided stage designs for diaghilev s 1909 production of polovtsian dances pair quickly agreed on a working title great sacrifice russian velikaia van den toorn p 2 diaghilev gave his blessing to work although collaboration was put on hold for a year while stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for diaghilev ballet petrushka hill pp 4 8 in july 1911 stravinsky visited near smolensk where roerich was staying with princess maria tenisheva a noted patron of arts and a sponsor of diaghilev s magazine world of art here over several days stravinsky and roerich finalised structure of ballet stravinsky pp 35 36 thomas f kelly in his history of rite premiere suggests that two part pagan scenario that emerged was primarily devised by roerich kelly p 297 stravinsky later explained to nikolai findeyzen editor of russian musical gazette that first part of work would be called kiss of earth and would consist of games and ritual dances interrupted by a procession of sages culminating in a frenzied dance as people embraced spring part two sacrifice would have a darker aspect secret night games of maidens leading to choice of one for sacrifice and her eventual dance to death before sages original working title was changed to holy spring russian vesna sviashchennaia but work became generally known by french translation le sacre du printemps or its

stravinsky s sketchbooks show that after returning to his home at ustilug in ukraine in september 1911 he worked on two movements augurs of spring and spring rounds van den toorn p 24 in october he left ustilug for clarens in switzerland where in a tiny and sparsely furnished room an closet with only a muted upright piano a table and two and craft 1981 p 143 he worked throughout 1911 12 winter on score hill p 13 by march 1912 according to sketchbook chronology stravinsky had completed part i and had drafted much of part ii he also prepared a two hand piano version subsequently lost which he may have used to demonstrate work to diaghilev and ballet russes conductor pierre monteux in april 1912 van den toorn p 35 he also made a four hand piano arrangement which became first published version of rite he and composer claude debussy played first half of this together in june 1912 following diaghilev s decision to delay premiere until 1913 stravinsky put rite aside during summer of 1912 van den toorn p 34 he enjoyed paris season and accompanied diaghilev to bayreuth festival to attend a performance of parsifal stravinsky pp 37 39 stravinsky resumed work on rite in autumn sketchbooks indicate that he had finished outline of final sacrificial dance on 17 november 1912 during remaining months of winter he worked on full orchestral score which he signed and dated as completed in clarens march 8 1913 he showed manuscript to maurice ravel who was enthusiastic and predicted in a letter to a friend that first performance of le sacre would be as important as 1902 premiere of debussy s pelleas et melisande orenstein p 66 after orchestral rehearsals began in late march monteux drew composer s attention to several passages which were causing problems inaudible horns a flute solo drowned out by brass and strings and multiple problems with balance among instruments in brass section during fortissimo episodes van den toorn pp 36 38 stravinsky amended these passages and as late as april was still revising and rewriting final bars of sacrificial dance revision of score did not end with version prepared for 1913 premiere rather stravinsky continued to make changes for next 30 years or more according to van den toorn n o other work of stravinsky s underwent such a series of post premiere revisions van den toorn pp 39 42 stravinsky acknowledged that work s opening bassoon melody was derived from an anthology of lithuanian folk songs taruskin 1980 p 502 but maintained that this was his only borrowing from such sources van den toorn p 10 if other elements sounded like aboriginal folk music he said it was due to some unconscious folk memory van den toorn p 12 however morton has identified several more melodies in part i as having their origins in lithuanian collection taruskin 1980 p pp vii viii more recently richard taruskin has discovered in score an adapted tune from one of rimsky korsakov s one hundred russian national songs taruskin 1980 p 513 taruskin notes paradox whereby rite generally acknowledged as most revolutionary of composer s early works is in fact rooted in traditions of russian music taruskin 1980 p 543 realisation thumb upright nijinsky in 1911 depicted by john singer sargent in costume for his role in nikolai tcherepnin s ballet le pavillon d armide taruskin has listed a number of sources that roerich consulted when creating his designs among these are primary chronicle a 12th century compendium of early pagan customs and alexander s study of peasant folklore and pagan prehistory van den toorn pp 14 15 princess tenisheva s collection of costumes was an early source of inspiration when designs were complete stravinsky expressed delight and declared them a real miracle stravinsky s relationship with his other main collaborator nijinsky was more complicated diaghilev had decided that nijinsky s genius as a dancer would translate into role of ballet master he was not dissuaded when nijinsky s first attempt at choreography debussy s l apres midi d un faune caused controversy and near scandal because of dancer s novel stylised movements and his overtly sexual gesture at work s end stravinsky p p 263 it is apparent from contemporary correspondence that at least initially stravinsky viewed nijinsky s talents as a choreographer with approval a letter he sent to findeyzen praises dancer s passionate zeal and complete self effacement hill p 109 however in his 1936 memoirs stravinsky writes that decision to employ nijinsky in this role filled him with apprehension although he admired nijinsky as a dancer he had no confidence in him as a choreographer poor boy knew nothing of music he could neither read it nor play any instrument stravinsky pp 40 41 later still stravinsky would ridicule nijinsky s dancing maidens as knock kneed and long braided lolitas stravinsky s autobiographical account refers to many painful incidents between ballet master and dancers during rehearsal period stravinsky p 42 by beginning of 1913 when nijinsky was badly behind schedule stravinsky was warned by diaghilev that unless you come here immediately sacre will not take place problems were slowly overcome and when final rehearsals were held in may 1913 dancers appeared to have mastered work s difficulties even ballets russes s sceptical stage director serge grigoriev was full of praise for originality and dynamism of nijinsky s choreography p 84 conductor pierre monteux had worked with diaghilev since 1911 and had been in charge of orchestra at premiere of petrushka monteux s first reaction to rite after hearing stravinsky play a piano version was to leave room and find a quiet corner he drew diaghilev aside and said he would never conduct music like that diaghilev managed to change his mind charles reid thomas beecham an independent biography 1961 p 145 although he would perform his duties with conscientious professionalism he never came to enjoy work nearly fifty years after premiere he told enquirers that he detested it kelly pp 273 74 in old age he said to sir thomas beecham s biographer charles reid i did not like le sacre then i have conducted it fifty times since i do not like it now on 30 march monteux informed stravinsky of modifications he thought were necessary to score all of which composer implemented hill p 29 orchestra drawn mainly from concerts colonne in paris comprised 99 players much larger than normally employed at theatre and had difficulty fitting into orchestra pit kelly p 280 after first part of ballet received two full orchestral rehearsals in march monteux and company departed to perform in monte carlo rehearsals resumed when they returned unusually large number of rehearsals seventeen solely orchestral and five with dancers were fit into fortnight before opening after stravinsky s arrival in paris on 13 may walsh p 202 music contained so many unusual note combinations that monteux had to ask musicians to stop interrupting when they thought they had found mistakes in score saying he would tell them if something was played incorrectly according to doris monteux musicians thought it absolutely crazy at one point a climactic brass fortissimo orchestra broke into nervous laughter at sound causing stravinsky to intervene angrily kelly p 281 walsh p 203 role of sacrificial victim was to have been danced by

stravinsky all went peacefully however critic of l echo de paris adolphe foresaw possible trouble he wondered how public would receive work and suggested that they might react badly if they thought they were being mocked kelly p 282 on evening of 29 may gustav linor reported never has hall been so full or so resplendent stairways and corridors were crowded with spectators eager to see and to

roles rite followed some eyewitnesses and commentators said that disturbances in audience began during introduction and grew noisier when curtain rose on stamping dancers in augurs of spring but music historian richard taruskin asserts it was not stravinsky s music that did shocking it was ugly earthbound lurching and stomping devised by vaslav nijinsky marie rambert who was working as an assistant to nijinsky recalled later that it was soon impossible to hear music on stage hill pp 28 30 in his autobiography stravinsky writes that derisive laughter that greeted first bars of introduction disgusted him and that he left auditorium to watch rest of performance from stage wings demonstrations he says grew into a terrific uproar which along with on stage noises drowned out voice of nijinsky who was shouting step numbers to dancers stravinsky pp 46 47 two years after premiere journalist and photographer carl van vechten claimed in his book music after great war that person behind him became carried away with excitement and began to beat rhythmically on top of my head with his fists in 1916 in a letter not published until 2013 van vechten admitted he had actually attended

believed that trouble began when two factions began attacking each other but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards orchestra everything available was tossed in our direction but we continued to play on around forty of worst offenders were ejected possibly with intervention of police although this is uncorroborated through all disturbances performance continued without interruption unrest receded significantly during part ii and by some accounts maria piltz s rendering of final sacrificial dance was watched in reasonable silence at end there were several curtain calls for dancers for monteux and orchestra and for stravinsky and nijinsky before evening s programme continued kelly pp 292 94 among more hostile press reviews was that of le figaros critic henri quittard who called work a laborious and puerile barbarity and added we are sorry to see an artist such as m stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure kelly p 307 quoting quittard s report in le figaro 31 may 1913 on other hand gustav linor writing in leading theatrical magazine comoedia thought performance was superb especially that of maria piltz disturbances while deplorable were merely a rowdy debate between two ill mannered factions kelly pp 304 05 quoting linor s report in comoedia 30 may 1913 emile of les who had barely heard music wrote couldn t we ask m astruc to set aside one performance for well intentioned spectators we could at least propose to evict female element composer alfredo casella thought that demonstrations were aimed at nijinsky s choreography rather than at music kelly pp 327 28 translated from casella alfredo la scuola brescia 1961 a view shared by critic michel dimitri calvocoressi who wrote idea was excellent but was not successfully carried out calvocoressi failed to observe any direct hostility to composer unlike he said premiere of debussy s pelleas et melisande in 1902 calvocoressi pp 244 45 of later reports that veteran composer camille saint saens had stormed out of premiere stravinsky observed that this was impossible saint saens did not attend kelly p 283 stravinsky also rejected cocteau s story that after performance stravinsky nijinsky

impresario expressed his entire satisfaction with outcome stravinsky and craft 1959 pp 47 48 to maximilien steinberg a former fellow pupil under rimsky korsakov stravinsky wrote that nijinsky s

stravinsky confined to his bed by typhoid fever stravinsky p 49 did not join company when it went to london for four performances at theatre royal drury lane reviewing london production times critic was impressed how different elements of work came together to form a coherent whole but was less enthusiastic about music itself opining that stravinsky had entirely sacrificed melody and harmony for rhythm if m stravinsky had wished to be really primitive he would have been wise to score his ballet for nothing but drums ballet historian cyril beaumont commented on slow uncouth movements of dancers finding these in complete opposition to traditions of classical ballet white 1966 pp 177 78 after opening paris run and london performances events conspired to prevent further stagings of ballet nijinsky s choreography which kelly describes as so striking so outrageous so frail as to its preservation did not appear again until attempts were made to reconstruct it in 1980s on 19 september 1913 nijinsky married de pulszky while ballets russes was on tour without diaghilev in south america when diaghilev found out he was distraught and furious that his lover had married and dismissed nijinsky diaghilev was then obliged to re hire fokine who had resigned in 1912 because nijinsky had been asked to choreograph faune fokine made it a condition of his re employment that none of nijinsky s choreography would be performed buckle p 268 in a letter to art critic and historian alexandre benois stravinsky wrote t he possibility has gone for some time of seeing anything valuable in field of dance and still more important of again seeing this offspring of mine walsh p 219 quoting letter to benois of 20 sept 3 oct 1913 with disruption following outbreak of first world war in august 1914 and dispersal of many artistes diaghilev was ready to re engage nijinsky as both dancer and choreographer but nijinsky had been placed under house arrest in hungary as an enemy russian citizen diaghilev negotiated his release in 1916 for a tour in united states but dancer s mental health steadily declined and he took no further part in professional ballet after 1917 in 1920 when diaghilev decided to revive rite he found that no one now remembered choreography buckle p 366 after spending most of war years in switzerland and becoming a permanent exile from his homeland after

nicholas roerich designs retained lead dancer was lydia sokolova in his memoirs stravinsky is equivocal about massine production young ballet master he writes showed unquestionable talent but there was something forced and artificial in his choreography which lacked necessary organic relationship with music stravinsky pp 92 93 sokolova in her later account recalled some of tensions surrounding production with stravinsky wearing an expression that would have frightened a hundred chosen virgins ing up and down centre aisle while ansermet rehearsed orchestra hill pp 86 89 later choreographies ballet was first shown in united states on 11 april 1930 when massine s 1920 version was performed by philadelphia orchestra in philadelphia under leopold stokowski with martha graham dancing role of

first american designed production in 1937 was that of modern dance exponent lester horton whose version replaced original pagan russian setting with a wild west background and use of native american dances thumb bolshoi theatre in moscow where 1965 production of rite was described by a critic as soviet propaganda at its best in 1944 massine began a new collaboration with roerich who before his death in 1947 completed a number of sketches for a new production which massine brought to fruition at la scala milan in 1948 this heralded a number of significant postwar european productions mary in berlin 1957 followed horton in highlighting erotic aspects of virgin sacrifice as did maurice bejart in brussels 1959 bejart s representation replaced culminating sacrifice with a depiction of what critic robert johnson describes as ceremonial coitus royal ballet s 1962 production choreographed by kenneth macmillan and designed by sidney nolan was first performed on 3 may and was a critical

rite by choreographing a new production at new york s state theater johnson pp 235 36 new york times critic declared performance a triumph totally elemental as primal in expression of basic emotion as any tribal ceremony as hauntingly staged in its deliberate bleakness as it is rich in implication on 30 september 1987 joffrey ballet in los angeles performed rite based on a reconstruction of nijinsky s 1913 choreography until then thought lost beyond recall performance resulted from years of research primarily by millicent hodson who pieced choreography together from original prompt books contemporary sketches and photographs and recollections of marie rambert and other survivors hodson s version has since been performed by kirov ballet at mariinsky theatre in 2003 and later that year at covent garden in its 2012 13 season joffrey ballet gave centennial performances at numerous venues including university of texas on 5 6 march 2013 university of massachusetts on 14 march 2013 and with cleveland orchestra on 17 18 august 2013 music publishers boosey hawkes have estimated that since its premiere ballet has been subject of at least 150 productions many of which have become

performances on 18 february 1914 rite received its first concert performance music without ballet in st petersburg under serge koussevitzky hill p 8 on 5 april that year stravinsky experienced for himself popular success of rite as a concert work at casino de paris after performance again under monteux composer was carried in triumph from hall on shoulders of his admirers van den toorn p 6 rite had its first british concert performance on 7 june 1921 at queen s hall in london under eugene goossens its american premiere occurred on 3 march 1922 when stokowski included it in a philadelphia orchestra programme smith p 94 goossens was also responsible for introducing rite to australia on 23 august 1946 at sydney town hall as guest conductor of sydney symphony orchestra stravinsky first conducted work in 1926 in a concert given by concertgebouw orchestra in amsterdam stravinsky p 129 two years later he brought it to salle pleyel in paris for two performances under his baton of these occasions he later wrote that thanks to experience i had gained with all kinds of orchestras i had reached a point where i could obtain exactly what i wanted as i wanted it stravinsky p 137 commentators have broadly agreed that work has had a greater impact in concert hall than it has on stage many of stravinsky s revisions to music were made with concert hall rather than theatre in mind work has become a staple in repertoires of all leading orchestras and has been cited by leonard bernstein as most important piece of music of 20th century in 1963 50 years after premiere monteux then aged 88 agreed to conduct a commemorative performance at london s royal albert hall according to isaiah berlin a close friend of composer stravinsky informed him that he had no intention of hearing his music being murdered by that frightful butcher instead he arranged tickets for that particular evening s performance of mozart s opera marriage of figaro at covent garden under pressure from his friends stravinsky was persuaded to leave opera after first act he arrived at albert hall just as performance of rite was ending composer and conductor shared a warm embrace in front of unaware wildly cheering audience hill p 102 monteux s biographer john canarina provides a different slant on this occasion recording that by end of evening stravinsky had asserted that monteux almost alone among conductors never cheapened rite or looked for his own glory in it and he continued to play it all his life with greatest fidelity canarina p 301 music general character thumb upright left cover of 1913 four hand piano reduction of rite of spring first published version of work commentators have often described rites music in vivid terms paul rosenfeld in 1920 wrote of it pound ing with rhythm of engines whirls and spirals like screws and fly wheels grinds and shrieks like laboring metal rosenfeld p 202 in a more recent analysis new york times critic donal henahan refers to great crunching snarling chords from brass and thundering thumps from timpani composer julius harrison acknowledged uniqueness of work negatively it demonstrated stravinsky s abhorrence of everything for which music has stood these many centuries all human endeavour and progress are being swept aside to make room for hideous sounds harrison p 168 in firebird stravinsky had begun to experiment with bitonality use of two different keys simultaneously he took this technique further in petrushka but reserved its full effect for rite where as analyst e w white explains he pushed it to its logical conclusion white 1961 p 59 white also observes music s complex metrical character with combinations of duple and triple time in which a strong irregular beat is emphasised by powerful percussion white 1961 p 61 music critic alex ross has described irregular process whereby stravinsky adapted and absorbed traditional russian folk material into score he proceeded to pulverize them into motivic bits pile them up in layers and reassemble them in collages and montages ross p 90 duration of work is about 35 minutes instrumentation score calls for a large orchestra consisting of following instruments woodwinds 1

suddenly hill says just as it is bursting ecstatically into bloom there is then a reiteration of opening bassoon solo now played a semitone lower hill pp 62 63 first dance augurs of spring is characterised by a repetitive stamping chord in horns and strings based on e dominant 7 superimposed on a triad of e g and b van den toorn p 138 white suggests that this combination which stravinsky considered focal point of entire work was devised on piano since constituent chords are comfortable fits for hands on a keyboard white 1961 p 57 rhythm of stamping is disturbed by stravinsky s constant shifting of accent on and off beat ross p 75 before dance ends in a collapse as if from exhaustion alex a 2008 p 75 rest is noise london fourth estate has summed up pattern as follows one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight according to roger nichols 1978 p7 at first sight there seems no pattern in distribution of accents to stamping chords taking initial quaver of bar 1 as a natural accent we have for first outburst following groups of quavers 9 2 6 3 4 5 3 however these apparently random numbers make sense when split into two groups 9 6 4 3 2 3 5 clearly top line is decreasing bottom line increasing and by respectively decreasing and increasing amounts whether stravinsky worked them out like this we shall probably never know but way two different rhythmic orders interfere with each other to produced apparent chaos is a typically notion nichols r

usher in spring rounds in which a slow and laborious theme gradually rises to a dissonant fortissimo a ghastly caricature of episode s main tune click on more images for notes brass and percussion predominate as ritual of rival tribes begins a tune emerges on tenor and bass tubas leading after much repetition to entry of sage s procession music then comes to a virtual halt bleached free of colour hill hill p 70 as sage blesses earth dance of earth then begins bringing part i to a close in a series of phrases of utmost vigour which are abruptly terminated in what hill describes as a blunt brutal amputation hill pp 72 73 part ii sacrifice thumb upright sketches of maria piltz performing sacrificial dance part ii has a greater cohesion than its predecessor hill describes music as following an arc stretching from beginning of introduction to conclusion of final dance woodwind and muted trumpets are prominent throughout introduction which ends with a number of rising cadences on strings and flutes transition into mystic circles is almost imperceptible main theme of section has been prefigured in introduction a loud repeated chord which berger likens to a call to order announces moment for choosing sacrificial victim glorification of chosen one is brief and violent in evocation of ancestors that follows short phrases are interspersed with drum rolls ritual action of ancestors begins quietly but slowly builds to a series of climaxes before subsiding suddenly into quiet phrases that began episode final transition introduces sacrificial dance this is written as a more disciplined ritual than extravagant dance that ended part i though it contains some wild moments with large percussion section of orchestra given full voice stravinsky had difficulties with this section especially with final bars that conclude work abrupt ending displeased several critics one of whom wrote that music suddenly falls over on its side stravinsky himself referred to final chord disparagingly as a noise but in his various attempts to amend or rewrite section was unable to produce a more acceptable solution influence and adaptations music historian donald jay grout has written sacre is undoubtedly most famous composition of early 20th century it had effect of an explosion that so scattered elements of musical language that they could never again be put together as before academic and critic jan echoing bernstein calls it one of 20th century s most influential compositions providing endless stimulation for performers and listeners according to kelly 1913 premiere might be considered most important single moment in history of 20th century music and its repercussions continue to reverberate in 21st century kelly p 258 ross has described rite as a prophetic work presaging second avant garde era in classical composition music of body rather than of mind in which m would follow patterns of speech rhythms would match energy of dance sonorities would have hardness of life as it is really lived ross p 76 among 20th century composers most influenced by rite is stravinsky s near contemporary edgard varese who had attended 1913 premiere varese according to ross was particularly drawn to cruel harmonies and stimulating rhythms of rite which he employed to full effect in his concert work ameriques 1921 scored for a massive orchestra with added sound effects including a lion s roar and a wailing siren ross p 137 aaron copland to whom stravinsky was a particular inspiration in former s student days considered rite a masterpiece that had created decade of displaced accent and chord copland adopted stravinsky s technique of composing in small sections which he then shuffled and rearranged rather than working through from beginning to end ross cites music of copland s ballet billy kid as coming directly from spring rounds section of rite ross p 275 for olivier messiaen rite was of special significance he constantly analysed and expounded on work which gave him an enduring model for rhythmic drive and assembly of material stravinsky was skeptical to overly intellectual analysis of work man has found reasons for every note and that clarinet line in page 3 is inverted counterpoint of horn in page 19 i never thought about that he allegedly replied to michel legrand when asked about pierre boulez s take on matter michel legrand i despise contemporary music el pais 9 november 2016 after premiere writer leon vallas opined that stravinsky had written music 30 years ahead of its time suitable to be heard in 1940 coincidentally it was in that year that walt disney released fantasia an animated feature film using music from rite and other classical compositions conducted by stokowski rite segment of film depicted earth s prehistory with creation of life leading to extinction of dinosaurs as finale among those impressed by film was gunther schuller later a composer conductor and jazz scholar rite of spring sequence he says overwhelmed him and determined his future career in music i hope stravinsky appreciated that hundreds perhaps thousands of musicians were turned onto rite of spring through fantasia musicians who might otherwise never have heard work or at least not until many years later in later life stravinsky claimed distaste for adaptation though as ross remarks he said nothing critical at time according to ross composer paul hindemith observed that igor appears to love it ross pp 297 98 recordings before first gramophone disc recordings of rite were issued in 1929 stravinsky had helped to produce a pianola version of work for london branch of aeolian company catalogue of music for pianola pianola piano aeolian company ltd london july 1924 p 88 he also created a much more comprehensive arrangement for pleyela manufactured by french piano company pleyel with whom he signed two contracts in april and may 1921 under which many of his early works were reproduced on this medium white

1929 stravinsky and monteux vied with each other to conduct first orchestral gramophone recording of rite while stravinsky led l orchestre des concerts in a recording for columbia label at same time monteux was recording it for hmv label stokowski s version followed in 1930 stravinsky made two more recordings in 1940 and 1960 hill pp 118 19 according to critic edward greenfield stravinsky was not technically a great conductor but greenfield says in 1960 recording with columbia symphony orchestra composer inspired a performance with extraordinary thrust and resilience in conversations with robert craft stravinsky reviewed several recordings of rite made in 1960s he thought herbert von karajan s 1963 recording with berlin philharmonic was good but performance is too polished a pet savage rather than a real one stravinsky thought that pierre boulez with orchestre national de france 1963 was less good than i had hoped very bad tempi and some tasteless alterations he praised a 1962 recording by moscow state symphony orchestra for making music sound russian which is just right but stravinsky s concluding judgement was that none of these three performances was worth preserving stravinsky and craft 1982 pp 88 89 as of 2013 there were well over 100 different recordings of rite commercially available and many more held in library sound archives it has become one of most recorded of all 20th century musical works editions first published score was four hand piano arrangement edition russe de musique dated 1913 publication of full orchestral score was prevented by outbreak of war in august 1914 after revival of work in 1920 stravinsky who had not heard music for seven years made numerous revisions to score which was finally published in 1921 edition russe de musique rv 197 large and pocket scores in 1922 ansermet who was preparing to perform work in berlin sent to stravinsky a list of errors he had found in published score in 1926 as part of his preparation for that year s performance with concertgebouw orchestra stravinsky rewrote evocation of ancestors section and made substantial changes to sacrificial dance extent of these revisions together with ansermet s recommendations convinced stravinsky that a new edition was necessary and this appeared in large and pocket form in 1929 it did not however incorporate all of ansermet s amendments and confusingly bore date and rv code of 1921 edition making new edition hard to identify stravinsky continued to revise work and in 1943 rewrote sacrificial dance in 1948 boosey hawkes issued a corrected version of 1929 score b h although stravinsky s substantial 1943 amendment of sacrificial dance was not incorporated into new version and remained unperformed to composer s disappointment he considered it much easier to play and superior in balance and sonority to earlier versions a less musical motive for revisions and corrected editions was copyright law composer had left galaxy music corporation agents for editions russe de la musique original publisher for associated music publishers at time and orchestras would be reluctant to pay a second rental charge from two publishers to match full work and revised sacrificial dance moreover revised dance could only be published in america 1948 score provided copyright protection to work in america where it had
