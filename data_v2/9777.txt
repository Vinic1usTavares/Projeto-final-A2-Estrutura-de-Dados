on some levels but both episodes suffer from same problem they re simply not very funny or meaningful which i d argue is even more problematic for inner circle given its position in season he ultimately gave episode a c tv squad writer joel keller wrote that while episode did have its funny moments overall you can just feel that show has changed in a very fundamental way alan sepinwall of hitfix criticized writers for still not finding deangelo s character out commenting that fact that writers so clearly had no idea what to do with ferrell doesn t fill me with confidence for whatever guest stars turn up in final episodes nor do i feel especially great right now about idea of an outside character coming in as permanent new regional manager ign reviewer cindy white praised writing for deangelo s character saying that ferrell is much better carrying show on his own than being second banana to carell it seemed like he was having more fun with role in this episode she ultimately gave episode a 7 0 10 new yorks phoebe reilly wrote that while it was nice to see staff responding to someone new it didn t feel like enough to make an audience antsy to come back after a long summer
