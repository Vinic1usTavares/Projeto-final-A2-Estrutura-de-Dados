a way to bring back clones who still exist as two feathers before departing on their separate ways syaoran and sakura confess their mutually strong close and pure romantic love for each other as they hope to meet again production tsubasa reservoir chronicle began with an inspiration of four member team clamp to link their works set in a realistic world with their works set in different fantasy worlds prior to beginning work on tsubasa reservoir chronicle clamp had created manga cardcaptor sakura from which two main characters are taken clamp decided to draw tsubasa reservoir chronicle by using a style first conceived by osamu tezuka named father of manga and often credited as father of anime known as osamu tezuka s star system in this system characters with same name and design are used in different settings drawing mostly from vast character pool of its own works and occasionally from others works unlike characters under star system three months prior to release of tsubasa reservoir chronicle young magazine began serializing clamp s xxxholic a manga whose two main characters kimihiro watanuki and yuko ichihara are two of same characters used in tsubasa reservoir chronicle both series run in parallel like many of their other works each member of clamp had a role different from their other projects instead of retaining set roles for tsubasa reservoir chronicle mokona drew main characters whereas tsubaki nekoi and satsuki igarashi drew side characters and backgrounds nanase ohkawa was sole person in charge of storyline other members of clamp were not told in advance how plot would unfold word tsubasa was used so that title would be easy to read however believing tsubasa only would be too short they added words chronicle and reservoir from nekoi s notes a special interview with ohkawa and kiichiro sugawara clamp s editor from weekly shonen magazines editorial department took place after story of tsubasa reservoir chronicle had progressed past arc from oto country ohkawa has stated that group is very conscious of fact that tsubasa reservoir chronicle is title in shonen magazine with youngest readership and that it is their very first foray into shonen demographic thus members of clamp ensure that they employ a drawing style and dialogue appropriate for young male audiences manga incorporates that makes reading japanese easier to aid in this effort group holds conferences with sugawara where they discuss plot ohkawa stated during interview that only time story significantly changed was during country of jade arc it went from a horror story with vampires to a detective mystery following story in piffle country clamp aimed to make series darker and more complex resulting in it receiving elements previously seen in other of their series shura country s story was written to introduce idea that a dead person cannot be revived even if somebody travels back to past and changes history this theme would be further explored later in story members of clamp had some difficulty adjusting from their typical style after deciding to publish with weekly shonen magazine because their typical thinner lines did not give desired impact ohkawa expressed group s desire to make their lines thicker and to use simpler layouts similar to other stories already present in shonen magazine she stated that they used their original artistic style to attract initial readers and then slowly transitioned to a new style sometime around when story arc focused on country of oto took place their art style had gradually been changing again at this point they were thinking of returning to their original style they were still adjusting to a weekly schedule many of their previous works were on a monthly schedule sugawara expressed concerns about strain on artists of concurrently doing a weekly issue of tsubasa reservoir chronicle linked with xxxholic but in end he whole heartedly approved in accordance with ohkawa s desire for each to have a well organized story clamp avoids putting references between two stories too frequently main idea was connecting these two series was to have protagonists from two different manga with different personalities and designs however during ending they would be stated to share same existence and had to go on different paths as tsubasa is connected with xxxholic characters designs are also meant to be similar like xxxholic artwork is sometimes influenced by ukiyo e art style which leads to characters have longer limbs when asked if another series influenced tsubasa in concept of parallel worlds ohkawa replied that she was not a fan of sci fi series and pointed that all worlds shown in series were other works from tsubasa at same time she wanted to segregate tsubasa from previous works she also explained that while some characters are same their traits and personalities were modified due to different backstories when thinking about including character goods with volume releases sugawara came up with atypical idea of releasing a deluxe and normal edition of manga after contemplating inconsistency of novels getting both a soft cover and hard cover release but manga only received one version because it was a new concept group experienced several mishaps such as accidentally placing a vertically flipped illustration on first deluxe edition group also decided to use another atypical practice of keeping catchphrases that appeared in magazine identical to ones that appear on of deluxe editions themes tsubasa explores fragility of human relationships through sakura losing all of her memories involving her love interest syaoran despite this tragedy syaoran manages to become friends with other characters across his journey furthermore sakura once again develops feelings for syaoran who at same time starts falling for her again development of characters relationship demonstrates how while modern society depends on already existing one a severed one can be reformed if people have will at same time syaoran has to say goodbye to people he met as a result of having to continue travelling despite also losing these new founds friends these actions will help syaoran grow into a young man another theme in series is use of identical people as a result of characters travelling to parallel worlds where they find alternative versions of people they met before despite sharing same physical appearances these identical versions have been through different experiences earning their own identities syaoran also has his own doppelganger commonly referred as other syaoran who at same time shares same identity as protagonist from xxxholic kimihiro watanuki across series these character are developed and choose their own paths to earn their own identities media manga thumb right cover of first volume of world chronicle written and illustrated by clamp tsubasa reservoir chronicle was serialized in japan in kodansha s weekly shonen magazine

it was a nominee for american anime awards in 2007 but was one of last series announced due to an error made by people in charge tsubasa reservoir chronicle was fairly well received by reviewers who described it as a treat for clamp fans due to large number of crossover characters in series initial fan response to tsubasa reservoir chronicle was that it was cardcaptor sakura for guys fans speculated that series would conclude one of clamp s unfinished series x or that it would be a sequel to cardcaptor sakura that focused on character syaoran li critics described series as being marked by several plot twists with about com writer katherine luther labelling it as perhaps of twists that we have seen in anime and manga in quite some time for earlier half of series mikhail from anime news network described series as settling into a predictable pattern that melissa harper also from anime news network described as somewhat slow and frankly a bit boring however michael aronson from manga life found series appealing and accessible to readers who have not read other clamp series and he hoped it would remain this accessible for following volumes he found that relation between tsubasa reservoir chronicle and xxxholic would persuade readers to also read latter series mania entertainment s megan lavey found introduction to be a pretty simple love story while liking characters personalities she liked how series was connected with xxxholic and hoped that both series would continue crossing over in a general overview of manga julie gray from comic book bin gave positive remarks to characters complex personalities and how plot has been developed throughout its first ten volumes she recommended that people should buy series active anime s blake found that change of settings was well done and he noted how some story arcs could go from dramatic to charming from volume 15 onwards clamp unleashed a series of mind blowing plot twists that had been foreshadowed frequently throughout series these twists have been described by anime news network as stunning but confusingly executed due to sheer number of storylines coming together other critics praised pacing as letting story progress at its own natural momentum keeping reader from being bored by any one literary genre plot twists and ever changing relationships between manga s main characters were praised few manga creators could pull off this sort of outrageous storytelling stunt active anime writer holly ellingwood called plot twists as most shocking set of events in tsubasa reservoir chronicles to date finding that despite such twists more secrets were brought to readers to persuade them to read following volumes ellingwood also reviewed following volumes and found last plot revelations intriguing she enjoyed that a strong connection is revealed between characters from tsubasa and xxxholic critics have described artwork as keeping up standards expected of clamp with its high level of detail though perhaps too much detail especially during action sequences artstyle is stylish and dynamic characterized by a large number of sweeping lines curlicues that look unlike anything else in genre that help bring action scenes to life for exciting experiences ed sizemore from comics worth reading highlighted fact that each dimension that protagonists visit is characterized by its very own look and feel so that no two worlds are even remotely similar however amount of detail and lack of contrast while beautiful often render scenes incomprehensible to point where reader is left guessing who is attacking critics have praised del rey s inclusion of english translation notes that aid in understanding plot especially due to its crossover nature lavey found translation a good read liking how some japanese words were not translated and instead explained in notes anime critics have described anime adaptation as having a very slow pace but having a beautiful musical score carl kimlinger from anime news network faulted director koichi mashimo for downshifting plot s energy and as having too many flashbacks too many slow pans over inexpressive eyes that create an end product that is tediously formulaic active anime s christopher seaman had mixed feelings finding romantic themes mature and magical themes appealing to younger audiences he concluded that teens would get most out of series he recommended series in general praising its plot and its themes dvdtalk s todd douglass jr ranked anime dvd box as highly recommended he liked how despite borrowing elements from other series it was entirely self contained douglas pointed out that following its second season anime kept entertaining viewers and felt they would not find a reason to dislike it douglas enjoyed anime s storytelling he liked its characters but found it sometimes dragging due to its episodic nature kimlinger praised musical score as being beautiful as yuki kajiura s work has always been chris beveridge from mania entertainment made similar comments praising series score and animation while commenting on series accessibility he said that people unrelated with clamp s works would like tsubasa in contrast to other people who would get out of series its episodic nature was praised by luther who commented how main plot was connected to each of story arcs english cast for anime has been labelled as done and very solid ign s jeffrey harris felt christopher sabat was its best actor harris called anime a nice looking and at times elegant looking show pointing to traits of main characters he criticized lack of extras in dvds releases reviewing anime s and films ign writer n s davidson said tsubasa film would be appealing to viewers of series despite its short length he liked how both films storylines interacted allowing parts of plot of tsubasa to be explained in xxxholic film and he found artistic similarities between two films carlo santos was more critical of film but still called it good art in a tv asahi poll tsubasa reservoir chronicle was ranked as fifty ninth most popular anime in japan it ranked ninth in animages anime grand prix anime popularity poll from 2005 while it was also listed as a honorable mention in ign s top ten anime of 2007 feature although tsubasa ovas were not first original animation dvds oads ovas published with manga volumes its release helped to popularize term chris beveridge from mania entertainment considered ovas to have better quality than tv series mainly because they were developed by production i g instead of bee train and because they have a darker storyline in a further review beveridge found fascinating events occurring in ovas due to number of revelations changed way people viewed series character designs were felt to be more similar to manga s ones than tv series while animation has been considered a notch above that of standard television themes were noted to be more mature both brutally and mentally although number of changes presented throughout them has been praised another series of ovas that would conclude storyline built in last episode from spring thunder chronicles has been requested by
