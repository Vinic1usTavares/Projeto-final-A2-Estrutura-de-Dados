bridgeoporus is a fungal genus in family polyporaceae a monotypic genus it contains single polypore species bridgeoporus nobilissimus first described to science in 1949 commonly known both as noble polypore and fuzzy this fungus produces large fruit bodies or conks that have been found to weigh up to upper surface of fruit body has a fuzzy or fibrous texture that often supports growth of algae bryophytes or vascular plants this species is found in pacific northwest region of north america where it grows on large at least 1 m diameter specimens of noble fir abies procera pacific silver fir abies amabilis or western hemlock tsuga heterophylla bridgeoporus nobilissimus causes a brown rot in its tree hosts genetic analysis shows that fungus is more prevalent than fruit body distribution indicates taxonomy bridgeoporus nobilissimus was named for william bridge cooke who originally described species as oxyporus nobilissimus in 1949 fungus was discovered in clackamas county oregon in 1943 by brothers ali and fred sandoz foresters called species fomes referring to collectors and fuzzy surface texture of conk several collections were made in oregon and washington in subsequent years a large specimen was collected in lewis county washington in 1946 that weighed about and measured by cooke learned of fungus in 1948 while visiting daniel elliot who kept one of large fruit bodies that he and alexander h smith had previously collected in mount rainier national park this fruit body served as type collection species of genus oxyporus cause white rot in their host trees cooke placed fungus in this genus by despite not knowing definitively what type of rot it caused he considered it to be closely related to oxyporus in 1955 polypore specialist josiah lincoln lowe transferred o nobilissimus to fomes before concept of this genus was narrowed in 1996 new genus bridgeoporus was circumscribed by harold tom volk and joseph ammirati to accommodate this species in order to rectify incompatibilities with placements in fomes and oxyporus in particular genus oxyporus features true cystidia arising from subhymenium supportive hyphae underlying hymenium whereas b nobilissimus has pseudocystidia sterile structures arising deep in subhymenium and protruding into hymenium phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial small subunit rdna sequences suggests that b nobilissimus which belongs in hymenochaetoid clade is closely related to genera oxyporus and hymenochaetoid clade includes wood decaying species previously classified variously in families polyporaceae and description thumb right closeup of fuzzy conk surface bridgeoporus nobilissimus has perennial imbricate sessile fruit bodies that measure by by from 1966 to 1990 this species was designated largest pore fungus in guinness book of world records three fruit body shapes are associated with fungus depending largely on location of fruiting on host tree hoof shaped and shelf like conks are located on sides of hosts short oblong topped conks with tapering pore surfaces occur on main roots of host and centrally conical conks are found on tops of stumps cap surface of young fruit bodies are covered with a dense mat of white mycelial fibers up to several millimeters long that in age darken in color and often become stuck together at their tips although surface is typically brown or darker it may appear green due to epiphytic associations with algae such as or species bryophytes or sometimes vascular plants grow on upper surface of conk texture of fruit body is fibrous it is rubbery and tough when fresh but becomes hard and brittle when it is dry pores on underside of fruit body are round approximately 2 per mm tubes comprising pores becomes layering over each other with each successive year of growth there is a 2 3 mm thick layer of sterile tissue between pore layers and mature tube layers are 2 7 mm long microscopically b nobilissimus is characterized by hyphae with a septum pseudocystidia originating from trama closely appressed hyphae in bundles fascicles on upper surface of fruit body spore bearing cells basidia are 12 18 by 4 10 um in size pear shaped and four spored roughly ovoid basidiospores are 5 5 6 5 by 3 5 4 5 um hyaline smooth and have thin walls habitat and distribution fruit bodies also called conks of bridgeoporus are found singly or sometimes in overlapping layers on old trees diameter at breast height of noble fir abies procera and more rarely pacific silver fir abies amabilis or western hemlock tsuga heterophylla it has also been recorded growing on a snag of redwood other tree species often found in b nobilissimus habitats include douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii western redcedar and western hemlock common shrubs at these sites include salal gaultheria sitka alder alnus sinuata rhododendron rhododendron and alaska blueberry vaccinium use of molecular genetic techniques has demonstrated that fungus also lives in douglas fir western hemlock and western redcedar although its fruit bodies have not been seen on these hosts fungus has been found in cascade range in washington and oregon coast range on olympic peninsula in washington and in redwood national park in northern california specimens have been found at elevations of because fungus feeds on both dead and living wood it is both parasitic and saprophytic b nobilissimus fruit bodies do not occur on fallen logs or other forms of dead wood lacking roots or some connection to a root system conks have been found growing on still living roots of an upturned tree while a once living conk died within several years after host tree was uprooted by a fallen tree conservation threats to bridgeoporus nobilissimus include extirpation of known and unknown habitats by logging fire or other disturbances and forestry practices that lead to loss of large diameter abies procera and abies amabilis trees and large diameter stumps and snags in managed forests due to scarcity of its mature tree hosts b nobilissimus was listed in 1995 as an endangered species by oregon natural heritage program making it first of fungi to be listed as endangered by any private or public agency in united states it is sole fungus in category a of survey and management guidelines for fungi under northwest forest plan meaning pre disturbance surveys and site management are needed before developing areas known to harbor fungus there were 13 known sites with fungus before 1998 extensive surveying in pacific northwest increased this number to 103 sites by 2006 although it is infrequently observed fungus is more abundant than fruit body appearance indicates using genetic markers to detect fungus mycelium in hosts researchers found that b nobilissimus was present at low to moderate levels and widespread in forest stands containing at least a single visible fruit body it was detected in trees of all sizes and in species not previously thought to harbor fungus b nobilissimus may require decades of mycelial growth in its host before fruit body production is initiated fungus has not been successfully grown in vitro despite several attempts see
