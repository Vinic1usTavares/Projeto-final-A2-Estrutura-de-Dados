parks and recreation rock show first season finale of parks and recreation was written by norm hiscock and directed by series co founder michael schur schur said he felt rock show marked a change in tone for series and struck a better balance between personal and professional stories than any of other episodes from season schur said we treated that whole six episode season like a pilot if you go back and watch those episodes now you can see us making changes sixth episode is different in tone than first and we made some character tweaks like every show ever does amy poehler said she believed rock show would end what she described as inevitable comparisons between parks and recreation and office which is also produced by parks creators schur and greg daniels poehler said i think it was something we had to work through in beginning and i m kind of hoping we re on other side of that and people will start to judge show on its own for what it is and realize it s just a completely different world in a similar style schur made his directorial debut with rock show and had only one day of preparation before directing episode while preparing to direct episode schur was asked to make an appearance on office as mose schrute cousin of dwight schrute and a popular minor character in fifth season finale episode company picnic schur regretfully declined because he needed time to work on rock show leading office episode writers paul lieberstein and jennifer celotta to create character rolf dwight s friend played by james urbaniak as an alternative andy s bandmates during rock show scene were played by mark rivers drums andrew burlinson guitar and alan yang bass all four actors performed their own instruments live during filming originally they planned to pre record songs and pantomime them for episode but after practicing a few times around extras they decided to shoot it live band performed each song twice and schur said he tried to shoot and direct it as if it were a music video yang is a writer with parks and recreation and wrote previous first season episode boys club rivers is a composer who has worked on sketch comedy show human giant which starred parks star aziz ansari rivers wrote songs performed in rock show which pratt said took him only about fifteen minutes hiscock wrote lyrics for pit in initial outline for episode and they were handed to rivers who then fleshed them out songs were designed to resemble music of american rock band hootie blowfish only song not written by rivers was ann a romantic ballad andy played for ann which was written by pratt himself ann first appeared in boys club like most episodes of parks and recreation a great deal of scenes in rock show were improvised by actors paul schneider made up his own dialogue during scene in which he and poehler sit next to pit and he talks about it as if it is already a park poehler s laughter at his jokes in this scene is her genuine reaction pratt also improvised much of his own dialogue including his rationale to ann for why he lied about his leg casts i really really like it when you serve me food pratt also changed reaction his character had to mark falling into pit script originally called for andy to be serious and concerned but pratt changed it so his character thought fall was funny pratt also improvised songs he sang during an early scene in episode in which andy makes up songs about random items in ann s living room out of boredom from wearing casts for so long one of songs he sings is about a lamp and included lyrics i wish you were a lamp that would light up when you get touched pratt thought of song because he had recently gotten such a lamp as a gift from a friend during a scene when andy describes his style of music april responds that she completely understands him although other characters seemingly do not that line was improvised by aubrey plaza and later helped inspire writing staff to place april and andy characters into a romantic relationship schur said of this at time it was this little nothing throwaway thing but when we watched it we thought there might be something there scene with mark making a pass at ann at rock show and ann s angry reaction to attempt were a last minute addition to episode although mark and ann would develop a romantic relationship in second season parks and recreation writers had not decided what would happen between developing romantic plotlines between leslie and mark or leslie and ann at time rock show aired in original pilot script mark helped leslie solely because he was attracted to ann and felt that green lighting leslie s project would give him an excuse to spend more time with her shooting version was retooled to make leslie less pathetic and mark less unlikable by having him won over by leslie s determination to fight against odds immediately after rock show was originally broadcast nbc set up an official website for scarecrow boat andy s band featured in episode site at com included ringtones band posters songs for download and photos george gernway was played by ron perkins husband of parks and recreation casting director nancy perkins aubrey plaza conceived idea of her character dating a gay man who she occasionally makes out with her gay boyfriend would become a major part of april s character in second season scenes about mark s efforts to have a speed bump lowered were inspired by scott albright a california city planner who works as a consultant on show albright said it would only be realistic for a city planner to lower a speed bump if a large number of residents complained about it hospital scenes in rock show were filmed on location in an actual california hospital cultural references andy describes style of his band s music as a mix between matchbox twenty and fray george says his favorite rock band is everly brothers a country influenced rock band from 1950s and 60s andy finds ann s lost ipod a portable music player by apple inc inside his leg cast after it is removed when andy starts watching television while ann rushes off to help mark at end of episode he is watching reality series real housewives of atlanta scene between mark and leslie at pit was mirrored in second season finale freddy spaghetti which aired in may 2010 and was mark s final appearance as a regular cast member during that scene two overlook what was once pit but was now a filled in lot and mark gives her construction plans for a park before kissing her goodbye on cheek and leaving schur said of scene it s great because leslie and mark it was such a disastrous moment last time at pit and he didn t really respect her and a lot s happened in a year goor said of using that setting i liked symmetry of having it play a critical and opposite role in this finale last year they sat on bench and kissed and it seemed like they might be getting back together this year they sat on bench and mark kissed leslie goodbye during one scene andy goes through a list of previous names his band has had pratt said about half band names featured in episode came directly from script but after he made up one on spot directors encouraged him to keep improvising pratt said he went through about 200 fake band names during take various names of andy s rock band include a d and d bags andy andy andy dwyer experience death of a

claiming it to be best episode of series up to that point scene in which leslie rejects mark s kiss in pit was considered by some reviewers to be a critical turning point both for show and for

real character alan sepinwall of star ledger said after six episodes he felt rock show was episode where parks and recreation found right tone for series and leslie knope character sepinwall said all characters were very likable jokes seemed natural and awkwardness of show was turned down enough to work properly hollywood reporter writer tim goodman said while first five episodes of season had been disappointing rock show marked an improvement in which characters were more defined their quirks and rhythms understood matt fowler of ign said he did not find episode especially funny but that it did a good job of fleshing out characters he said chris pratt was especially funny and that his band s song pit was stuck in his head after episode a v club writer keith phipps who had mixed feelings about parks and recreation throughout season said rock show was very funny and restored his faith in potential of series phipps said he believed show would become very popular in second

around and especially liked leslie s blind date with elderly man and chris pratt especially his listing of all his previous band names medina said parks and recreation is only six episodes in and it s already better than i anticipated it has its own tone a talented cast and a plot that s advancing toward something at least as fast as governmental red tape will allow it to richard lawson of gawker said episode was best of season and that he liked wistful pacing and poehler s performance lawson said anyone who dismissed this show after its first sorta underwhelming episode made a mistake show has only gotten tighter and sharper culminating in last night s funny sad finale time television reviewer james poniewozik said episode was best yet for developing poehler into a more multi less risible character he also said supporting staff played flawlessly off each other in rock show scene and thinks there is huge potential in dynamic between leslie and her undermining mother not all reviews of episode were positive maureen ryan of chicago tribune said leslie knope character was unappealing in rock show and throughout first season which she said surpassed friends spin off joey as
