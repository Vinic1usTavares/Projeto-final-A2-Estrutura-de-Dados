weiner that lane pryce s time was at an end about lane s forced retirement harris stated in beginning he doesn t know that s reason he s being called into office once it comes up he thinks he can bluff his way out of it and then he goes through all of these emotions from anger to denial to depression to acceptance it was all written in there script was very specific about different turns he would take harris continued about his character s subsequent suicide when matt told me jaguar idea i laughed my ass off when he said car doesn t start i just laughed for about five minutes nothing goes right for lane sadness that i feel is that it s been such an amazing experience pete s vincent kartheiser don s jon hamm and roger s john slattery shocked and chaotic reactions to lane s corpse were actors genuine reactions according to harris weiner called decision to write off lane pryce a terrible thing to have to deal with he added you want to make sure that it s worth it that they re going out with a bang and you re not sacrificing someone who s a great actor and a great musician in orchestra but also i feel like there have to be stakes this year was filled with foreboding of violence and death and connection of that early summer between riots which resulted in death police killing innocent people and richard speck murders and guy on texas tower charles whitman randomness and nihilism that was born from that was something that permeated story lane s story i thought was about someone who has undervalued themselves and that was his only way out he thought reception critical reception episode received critical acclaim alan sepinwall of hitfix wrote about palpable painful sense of dread throughout this episode stating though lane s tax trouble seemed to come out of nowhere a few weeks ago all of his behavior and don s felt very true to form and not like characters acting in a way designed to create a specific end point lane was doomed but by his own actions and foibles as much as by any plot engineering to get that noose around his neck guardians paul mcinnes felt series was recovering its poise on its way to season finale stating after dallying with melodrama pete and beth dawes harry and hari kinsey show has moved back towards darker more sophisticated narratives of cause and unexpected consequence this week lane may have taken his own life but don also got his mojo back and two were directly related verne gay of newsday compared characters of lane pryce and don draper stating both have secret lives protected by carefully constructed facades for both facade is everything and lane s would simply fall away like a line of dominoes when confronted with consequences of his lie a lie after all made in service of his son ratings commissions and
