operation grapple was name of four series of british nuclear weapons tests of early atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs carried out in 1957 and 1958 at malden island and kiritimati christmas island in pacific ocean as part of british hydrogen bomb programme nine nuclear explosions were initiated culminating in united kingdom becoming third recognised possessor of thermonuclear weapons and restoration of nuclear special relationship with united states with 1958 us uk mutual defence agreement during second world war britain had a nuclear weapons project codenamed tube alloys which was merged with american manhattan project in august 1943 many of britain s top scientists participated in british contribution to manhattan project after war fearing that britain would lose its great power status british government resumed atomic bomb development effort now codenamed high explosive research successful test of an atomic bomb in operation hurricane in october 1952 represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement but britain was still several years behind united states in nuclear weapons technology in july 1954 cabinet decided to develop hydrogen bomb united kingdom atomic energy authority atomic weapons research establishment at aldermaston produced three designs orange herald a large boosted fission weapon green bamboo an interim thermonuclear design and green granite a true thermonuclear weapon first test series consisted of three tests in may and june 1957 in first grapple 1 a version of green granite known as short granite was dropped from a vickers valiant bomber flown by wing commander kenneth hubbard bomb s yield was estimated at far below its designed capability despite its failure test was hailed as a successful thermonuclear explosion and government did not confirm or deny reports that uk had become a third thermonuclear power second test was grapple 2 of orange herald its yield made it technically a megaton weapon it was largest ever achieved by a single stage device grapple 3 tested purple granite a short granite with some fixes its yield was a very disappointing a second test series was required this consisted of a single test known as grapple x in november 1957 this time yield of exceeded expectations this was a true hydrogen bomb but most of yield came from nuclear fission rather than nuclear fusion in a third series with a single test known as grapple y in april 1958 another design was tested with an explosive yield of about it remains largest british nuclear weapon ever tested design of grapple y was notably successful because much of its yield came from its thermonuclear reaction instead of fission of a heavy uranium 238 tamper making it a true hydrogen bomb and because its yield had been closely predicted indicating that its designers understood what they were doing a final series of four tests in august and september 1958 known as grapple z tested techniques for boosting and making bombs immune to predetonation caused by nearby nuclear explosions two of these tests were detonations from balloons another was a blind radar test drop a moratorium on testing came into effect in october 1958 and britain never resumed atmospheric testing background during early part of second world war britain had a nuclear weapons project codenamed tube alloys at quebec conference in august 1943 prime minister of united kingdom winston churchill and president of united states franklin roosevelt signed quebec agreement which merged tube alloys with american manhattan project to create a combined british american and canadian project september 1944 hyde park agreement extended both commercial and military cooperation into post war period many of britain s top scientists participated in british contribution to manhattan project british government had trusted that america would continue to share nuclear technology which it considered to be a joint discovery on 16 november 1945 truman and attlee signed a new agreement that replaced quebec agreement s requirement for mutual consent before using nuclear weapons with one for prior consultation and there was to be full and effective cooperation in field of atomic energy but this was only in field of basic scientific research united states atomic energy act of 1946 mcmahon act ended technical cooperation revelation of a canadian spy ring that included british physicist alan nunn may while bill was being prepared caused united states congress to add death penalty for sharing restricted data with foreign nations efforts to rebuild nuclear special relationship with united states over following decade were dogged by repeated spy scandals including arrest of klaus fuchs in 1950 and defection of guy burgess and donald maclean in 1951 fearing a resurgence of american isolationism and britain losing its great power status british government restarted its own development effort now codenamed high explosive research successful test of an atomic bomb in operation hurricane in october 1952 represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement britain became world s third nuclear power reaffirming country s status as a great power but hopes that united states would be sufficiently impressed to restore special relationship were soon dashed in november 1952 united states conducted ivy mike first successful test of a true thermonuclear device or hydrogen bomb britain was therefore still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology defence policy committee chaired by churchill and consisting of senior cabinet members considered political and strategic implications in june 1954 and concluded that we must maintain and strengthen our position as a world power so that her majesty s government can exercise a powerful influence in counsels of world in july 1954 cabinet agreed to proceed with development of thermonuclear weapons united kingdom atomic energy authority atomic weapons establishment at aldermaston in berkshire was directed by william penney with william cook as his deputy scientists at aldermaston did not know how to build a hydrogen bomb but produced three designs orange herald a large boosted fission weapon in which fission yield was increased boosted though addition of lithium 6 deuteride green bamboo an interim thermonuclear design in which fusion occurred in layers of lithium 6 deuteride that alternated with layers of uranium 235 and green granite a true thermonuclear design in which thermonuclear fuel was separate and majority of yield came from thermonuclear burning british bomb designers used terms tom and dick for bomb s primary and secondary stages respectively tom would be a fission bomb it would produce radiation to implode dick implicit in creation of a hydrogen bomb was that it would be tested eden who replaced churchill as prime minister after latter s retirement on 5 april 1955 gave a radio broadcast in which he declared you cannot prove a bomb until it has exploded nobody can know whether it is effective or not until it has been tested location testing of boosted designs was carried out in operation mosaic tests in monte bello islands in may and june 1956 this was a sensitive matter there was an agreement with australia that no thermonuclear testing would be carried out there australian minister for supply howard beale responding to rumours reported in newspapers asserted that federal government has no intention of allowing any hydrogen bomb tests to take place in australia nor has it any intention of allowing any experiments connected with hydrogen bomb tests to take place here since tests were connected with hydrogen bomb development this prompted eden to cable prime minister of australia robert menzies detailing nature and purpose of tests he promised that yield of second larger test would not exceed two and a half times that of operation hurricane test which was menzies cabled his approval of tests on 20 june 1955 in event yield of second test was which was larger than limit on tests in australia thumb left survey ship another test site was therefore required for safety and security reasons in light of lucky dragon incident in which crew of a japanese fishing boat were exposed to radioactive fallout from american castle bravo nuclear test a large site remote from population centres was required various islands in south pacific and southern oceans were considered along with antarctica admiralty suggested antipodes islands which are about southeast of new zealand in may 1955 minister for defence selwyn lloyd concluded that kermadec islands which lie about northeast of new zealand would be suitable they were part of new zealand so eden wrote to prime minister of new zealand sidney holland to ask for permission to use islands holland refused fearing an adverse public reaction in upcoming 1957 general election in new zealand despite reassurances and pressure from british government holland remained firm search for a location continued with malden island and mckean island being considered these were uninhabited islands claimed by both britain and united states former island became frontrunner three avro shackletons from no 240 squadron were sent to conduct an aerial reconnaissance from canton island it too was claimed by both united states and britain and was jointly administered so americans had to be informed holland agreed to send survey ship to conduct a maritime survey christmas island was chosen as a base it too was claimed by both britain and united states lying just north of equator it was a tropical island largely covered in grass scrub and coconut plantations temperatures are high averaging during day and at night and humidity is very high usually around 98 per cent it lay from tahiti from honolulu from san francisco and from sydney its remoteness would dominate logistic preparations for operation grapple it had no indigenous population but about 260 gilbertese civilians lived on island in a village near port london they came from gilbert and ellice islands and worked coconut plantations to produce copra while most only stayed for a year or two some had been on island for a decade or more south pacific air lines spal had been granted permission by united states and british governments to operate a flying boat service from christmas island patrick dean asked british ambassador to united states sir roger makins to sound out us government about terminating contract makins reported in march 1956 that admiral arthur w radford chairman of joint chiefs of staff was willing to help so long as dormant american claim to island was not prejudiced lease on island facilities including airfield and port had been granted to spal with a clause in contract that said it could be terminated if there was a military necessity to do so americans proposed that british tell spal that they were establishing an airbase on island and that united states would support this so long as spal was paid fair compensation an official letter was sent to president of spal on 1 may 1956 withdrawing permit to operate from christmas island regretting any inconvenience and offering to consider compensation preparations thumb right royal engineers assemble huts on christmas island test series was given secret codename operation grapple rear admiral kaye edden commandant of joint services staff college was approached to be task force commander tfc but he pointed out that test series would primarily be a royal air force raf responsibility and that it would be more appropriate to have an raf officer in charge air commodore wilfrid oulton was appointed task force commander on 6 february 1956 with acting rank of air vice marshal from 1 march 1956 he secured group captain richard gething as his chief of staff group captain cecil ginger weir was appointed air task group commander raf units assigned to grapple included two english electric canberra bomber squadrons nos 76 and 100 two shackleton squadrons nos 206 and 240 vickers valiant bombers of no 49 squadron a flight of search and rescue westland whirlwind helicopters of no 22 squadron and no 1325 flight with three dakota transport planes all would come under command of no 160 wing cook would be scientific director oulton held first meeting of grapple executive committee on new oxford street in london on 21 february 1956 with pressure mounting at home and abroad for a moratorium on testing 1 april 1957 was set as target date an advance party arrived on christmas island in an raf shackleton on 19 june 1956 royal fleet auxiliary rfa fort followed on 23 june and became a temporary headquarters ship it was ultimately joined by four more fort constantine and role of headquarters ship was assumed by landing ship tank lst hms messina which arrived on 7 december 1956 she was fitted out with special radio equipment to contact united kingdom she carried large refrigerators on her tank deck for storage of fresh and frozen produce and could supply of potable water per day thumb left a light aircraft carrier was headquarters ship for britain s atom hydrogen tests on christmas island light aircraft carrier was operation control ship and flagship of commodore peter gretton overall naval task group commander she embarked three grumman tbf avenger attack aircraft and four whirlwind helicopters along with two raf whirlwinds from no 22 squadron damage caused by a storm in north atlantic necessitated repairs in kingston jamaica by time they were complete there was insufficient time to sail around cape horn so she traversed panama canal passing through narrowest locks with just inches to spare hms narvik would reprise role of control ship it had in hurricane but it was also required for mosaic and had very little time to return to chatham dockyard for a refit before heading out to christmas island for grapple in addition there were frigates and and royal new zealand navy frigates and raf and royal engineers improved airfield to enable it to operate large heavily loaded aircraft and port and facilities would be improved to enable christmas island to operate as a base by 1 december 1956 it was estimated that of stores would be required for construction effort alone a dredge to clear harbour was towed from australia base development included improvements to road system and establishing an electricity supply fresh water distillation plant sewerage system and cold storage population of island would peak at 3 000 army task group was commanded by colonel j e s jack stone colonel john woollett was garrison commander construction force was built around 38 corps engineer regiment with 48 59 and 61 field squadrons and 63 field park squadron and 12 and 73 independent field squadrons part of 25 engineer regiment also deployed they were augmented by two construction troops from republic of fiji military forces with work on plantations halted for duration of operation grapple gilbertese civilians were also employed on construction works and unloading barges thumb right view from a raf handley page hastings transport flying over christmas island in august 1956 troopship ss devonshire sailed to central pacific from east asia at singapore she embarked 55 field squadron which came from korea having been left behind there when rest of 28 engineer regiment had returned to england after supporting 1st commonwealth division in korean war it also embarked royal marines landing craft mechanized lcm crews from poole heavy engineering plant and equipment was loaded on ss reginald kerr an lst converted to civilian use devonshire docked in fiji where it took on some sappers who had flown ahead and an raf medical team devonshire reached christmas island on 24 december followed by reginald kerr with woollett on board by end of december 1956 there nearly 4 000 personnel on christmas island including two women from women s voluntary services first project which was finished in october was to rebuild main runway at airport to handle valiants this involved levelling a surface to extend it to long and wide some of access roads were built and of scrub were cleared existing buildings were refurbished and new ones erected to provided of building space twelve storage tanks were provided for petrol diesel and aviation fuel along with pumping stations main camp consisted of over 700 tents and marquees along with of accommodation airbase was ready to accommodate valiants and their crews by march 1957 port was managed by 51 port detachment no 504 postal unit which had a detachment at hickam air force base a united states air force usaf base in american territory of hawaii handled receipt and despatch of mail while no 2 special air formation signal troop provided communications support royal army service corps provided a butchery a bakery and a laundry they also operated dukws amphibious trucks which worked alongside lcms thumb left hms messina headquarters and communications ship for operation christmas island was main base area around malden island to south was to be site for bomber dropped tests and penrhyn island farther south was used as a technical monitoring site and as a weather station a usaf special weapons monitoring team was based here and airstrip was improved to allow its supporting douglas c 124 globemaster ii to use it task force received generous support from united states army navy and usaf raf aircraft were allowed to overfly united states even when carrying radioactive or explosive materials thereby obviating need for for more northerly journey over canada raf ground crews were accommodated at hickham and travis air force base in california and a regular aerial courier service operated from hickham to christmas island warrior had repairs made at pearl harbor and us army base at fort derussy gave woollett use of its facilities having decided on a location and date there still remained matter of what would be tested john whose weapons electronics group at aldermaston had to produce bomb assembly wanted to know configuration of green granite cook ruled that it would use a red beard tom and would fit inside a blue danube casing for air dropping design was frozen in april 1956 there were two versions of orange herald large and small they had similar cores but large version contained more explosive both designs were frozen in july green bamboo design was also nominally frozen but tinkering with it continued on 3 september john corner suggested that green granite could be made smaller by moving tom and dick closer together this design became known as short granite thumb right royal engineers construct airfield runway by january 1957 with tests just months away a tentative schedule had emerged short granite would be fired first green bamboo would follow if short granite was unsuccessful but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise orange herald small would be fired next because short granite was too large to fit into a missile or guided bomb this would occur whether or not short granite was a success finally green granite would be tested in december 1956 cook had proposed another design known as green granite ii this was smaller than green granite i and could fit into a yellow sun casing that could be used by blue steel guided missile then under development but it could not be made ready to reach christmas island before 26 june 1957 and extending operation grapple would cost another ps1 5 million about 60 gilbertese civilians were relocated to fanning island in january 1957 on copra ship and another 40 on following month by mid march 44 gilbertese men 29 women and 56 children remained by end of april 31 of men and all women and children had been taken to fanning island by raf hastings civilians would remain there for next three months before returning to christmas island during later test series gilbertese civilians remained on island marshalled in areas like military personnel grapple series first trial series consisted of three shots all bombs were dropped and detonated over malden island and exploded high in atmosphere rather than being detonated on ground in order to reduce production of nuclear fallout british scientists were aware that americans had been able to reduce fallout by obtaining most of bomb yield from fusion instead of fission but they did not yet know how to do this amid growing public concern about dangers of fallout particularly from strontium 90 entering food chain a committee chaired by sir harold was asked to look into matter another in united states chaired by also investigated they reported simultaneously on 12 june 1956 while differing on many points they agreed that levels of strontium 90 were not yet sufficiently high to be of concern thumb left grapple 2 test on 31 may 1957 of orange herald as reported by universal international newsreel at an altitude of fireball would not touch ground thereby minimising fallout bombs would be detonated with a clockwork timer rather than a barometric switch this meant that they had to be dropped from grapple was britain s second airdrop of a nuclear bomb after operation buffalo test at maralinga on 11 october 1956 and first of a thermonuclear weapon united states had not attempted this until operation redwing cherokee test on 21 may 1956 and bomb had landed from target aldermaston wanted bomb within of target and oulton felt that a good bomber crew could achieve that a exclusion zone was established covering area between 3 5deg north and 7 5deg south and and west which was patrolled by shackletons no 49 squadron had eight valiants but only four deployed xd818 piloted by wing commander kenneth hubbard squadron commander xd822 piloted by squadron leader l d dave roberts xd823 piloted by squadron leader arthur steele and xd824 piloted by squadron leader barney millett other four valiants remained at raf wittering where they were used as courier aircraft for bomb components last components for short granite were delivered by valiant courier on 10 may 1957 three days late owing to severe head winds between san francisco and honolulu a full scale rehearsal was held on 11 may and on 14 may it was decided to conduct grapple 1 test following day eight official observers two each from australia canada new zealand and united states were flown from honolulu to christmas island in a handley page hastings then to malden island in a dakota from whence a dukw took them out to hms alert spectator ship all but a small party were evacuated from malden by hms warrior narvik and messina by 19 00 on 14 may rest were picked up by a helicopter from warrior at 07 45 on 15 may oulton and cook arrived on malden by dakota at 08 25 where they were met by a helicopter and taken to narvik grapple 1 mission was flown by hubbard in xd818 with millett and xd824 as grandstand observation aircraft two bombers took off from christmas island at 09 00 bomb was dropped from off shore of malden island at 10 38 local time on 15 may 1957 hubbard missed target by bomb s yield was estimated at far below its designed capability penney cancelled green granite test and substituted a new weapon codenamed purple granite this was identical to short granite but with some minor modification to its dick additional uranium 235 was added and outer layer was replaced with aluminium despite its failure test was hailed as a successful thermonuclear explosion and government did not confirm or deny reports that uk had become a third thermonuclear power when documents on series began to be declassified in 1990s tests were denounced as a hoax intended to deceive americans into resuming nuclear cooperation but reports would not have fooled americans observers who helped to analyse samples from radioactive cloud upright 1 3 thumb right vickers valiant b1 xd818 at raf museum cosford next test was grapple 2 of orange herald small for this test two fijian official observers were added a detachment of 39 fijian navy ratings who had been on board pukaki and was transferred to hms warrior this time there were also media representatives present on hms alert including chapman pincher and william connor orange herald bomb components arrived in three separate loads on 13 may assembling them took two weeks bomb was dropped by xd822 piloted by roberts xd823 piloted by steele acted as grandstand aircraft this bomb was dropped at 10 44 local time on 31 may after bomb was released roberts made standard 60deg banked turn to get away but his accelerometer failed and aircraft went into a high speed stall this was potentially disastrous but through skilful flying roberts was able to recover from stall and use mechanical accelerometer to complete manoeuvre yield was largest ever achieved by a single stage device this made it technically a megaton weapon but it was close to corner s estimate for an unboosted yield there were doubts that lithium 6 deuteride had contributed at all this was chalked up to taylor instability which limited compression of light elements in core bomb was hailed as a hydrogen bomb and truth that it was actually a large fission bomb was kept secret by british government until end of cold war third and final shot of series was grapple 3 test of purple granite this was dropped on 19 june by a valiant xd823 piloted by steele with millett and xd824 as grandstand aircraft yield was a very disappointing even less than short granite changes had not worked we haven t got it right cook told a flabbergasted oulton we shall have to do it all again providing we can do so before ban comes into force so that means as soon as possible grapple x next test series consisted of a single trial known as grapple x to save time and money and as hms warrior alert and narvik were unavailable it was decided to drop bomb off southern tip of christmas island rather than off malden island this was just from airfield where 3 000 men were based this required another major construction effort to improve facilities on christmas island and some of those that had been constructed on malden island had to now be duplicated on christmas island works included 26 blast proof shelters a control room and tented accommodation to provide some means of chasing away intruders destroyer was allotted hmnzs rotoiti and pukaki reprised their role as weather ships a cargo ship ss was chartered to bring and stores to christmas island monitoring equipment was set up on malden island and fanning island and observation posts on penrhyn island and jarvis island were re established oulton noticed that thumb left destroyer while some ships and units such as no 49 squadron returned to uk most personnel had to remain on christmas island minister of supply gave assurances that no personnel would have to remain on island for more than a year unless absolutely necessary in which case home leave would be given to maintain morale units were given periodic briefings on importance of their work junior officers took a keen interest in welfare of men and their families at home since they were not permitted to bring them to island an efficient mail system was maintained to allow them to keep in contact quality of army rations was better than at any other british base men were given one day a week off work and sports such as soccer cricket tennis volleyball sailing fishing and water skiing were organised leave was provided that could be taken in fiji hawaii or gilbert islands to relieve monotony some army personnel ashore exchanged places with some navy personnel afloat a christmas island broadcasting service was established with nightly radio programs scientists at aldermaston had not yet mastered design of thermonuclear weapons knowing that much of yield of american and soviet bombs came from fission in uranium 238 tamper they had focused on what they called lithium uranium cycle whereby neutrons from fission of uranium would trigger fusion which would produce more neutrons to induce fission in tamper however this is not most important reaction corner and his theoretical physicists at aldermaston argued that green granite could be made to work by increasing compression and reducing taylor instability first step would be achieved with an improved tom red beard tom was given an improved high explosive supercharge a composite uranium 235 and plutonium core and a beryllium tamper thereby increasing its yield to dick was greatly simplified instead of 14 layers in short granite it would have just three this was called round a a five layer version was also mooted which was called round b a third round round c was produced which was a diagnostic round it had same three layers as round a but an inert layer instead of lithium deuteride grapple x would test round a components of rounds a and c were delivered to christmas island on 24 27 and 29 october on inspection a fault was found in round a tom and fissile core was replaced with one from round c thumb right an avro shackleton this time there was no media presence and only two foreign observers rear admiral patrick from us navy and brigadier general john w white from usaf as final preparations were being made for test on 8 november oulton was advised at 01 00 that a shackleton had sighted ss effie an old victory ship now flying liberian flag in exclusion zone eager to minimise publicity before this test british government had delayed sending out notice to mariners which had only been issued three weeks before this failed to take into account size of pacific ocean effie had left its last port of call before it had been issued shackleton kept effie under observation while trying to contact her and cossack was sent to intercept by 06 00 all was in readiness for test but there was no news of effie finally at 06 15 word was received from shackleton that crew had woken up and effie had turned about and was now headed due south out of exclusion zone at a report from shackleton at 07 25 indicated that effie was now sailing in company with cossack by this time valiants had started their engines they took off at 07 35 and were on way when cossack reported that effie had cleared area bomb was dropped from valiant xd824 piloted by millett at 08 47 on 8 november 1957 flight lieutenant r bates flew grandstand valiant this time yield of exceeded expectations predicted yield had only been but it was still below safety limit this was real hydrogen bomb britain wanted but it used a relatively large quantity of expensive highly enriched uranium due to higher than expected yield of explosion there was some damage to buildings fuel storage tanks and helicopters on island grapple y physicists at aldermaston had plenty of ideas about how to follow up grapple x possibilities were discussed in september 1957 one was to tinker with width of shells in dick to find an optimal configuration if they were too thick they would slow neutrons generated by fusion reaction if they were too thin they would give rise to taylor instability another was to do away with shells entirely and use a mixture of uranium 235 uranium 238 and deuterium ken allen had an idea which samuel curran supported of a three layer dick that used lithium deuteride that was less enriched in lithium 6 and therefore had more lithium 7 but more of it reducing amount of uranium 235 in centre of core this proposal was one adopted in october and it became known as dickens because it used ken s dick device would otherwise be similar to round a but with a larger radiation case safety limit was again set to keith roberts calculated that yield could reach and suggested that this could be reduced by modifying tamper but cook opposed this fearing that it might cause test to fail because of possibility of a moratorium on testing plans for test codenamed grapple y were restricted to prime minister who gave verbal approval and a handful of officials new zealand national party lost 1957 election and walter nash became prime minister his new zealand labour party had endorsed a call by british labour party for a moratorium on nuclear testing but he felt obligated to honour commitments made by his predecessors to support british nuclear testing programme however hmnzs rotoiti was unavailable as it was joining far east strategic reserve its place would be taken by destroyer air vice marshal john grandy succeeded oulton as task force commander and air commodore jack became air task force commander bomb was dropped off christmas at 10 05 local time on 28 april 1958 by a valiant piloted by squadron leader bob bates it had an explosive yield of about and remains largest british nuclear weapon ever tested design of grapple y was notably successful because much of its yield came from its thermonuclear reaction instead of fission of a heavy uranium 238 tamper making it a true hydrogen bomb and because its yield had been closely predicted indicating that its designers understood what they were doing grapple z series on 22 august 1958 us president dwight d eisenhower announced a one year moratorium on nuclear testing effective 31 october 1958 if soviet union and united kingdom also agreed to suspend testing britain had already indicated that it would do so and soviet union agreed on 30 august this did not mean an immediate end to testing on contrary all three rushed to perform as much testing as possible before deadline british scientists needed to gather as much data as possible to allow them to design production nuclear weapons as prospect of increased american cooperation grew after october 1957 they knew that quality and quantity of what americans would share would depend on what they had to offer a new british test series known as grapple z commenced on 22 august it explored new technologies such as use of external neutron initiators which had first been tried out with orange herald core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride permitted a smaller lighter tom for two stage devices it would be biggest and most complex british test series thumb left east point balloon anchor on christmas island bombs were hoisted by balloons from here of particular concern was radiation damage known as ri effect keith roberts and bryan taylor at aldermaston had discovered that flash of radiation from detonation of an atomic bomb could affect a nearby bomb this opened up possibility of a missile warhead being disabled by another launched for this purpose plutonium cores were especially vulnerable as they were already prone to predetonation this had potential to render britain s nuclear deterrent ineffective this discovery was given highest level of secrecy and aldermaston would spend much of next few years working on problem to build a primary immune to this effect would require techniques that aldermaston had not yet mastered number of tests in series was assumed to be four for planning purposes but as late as may prime minister had only approved two shots tentatively scheduled for 15 august and 1 september 1958 four valiants xd818 xd822 xd824 and xd827 deployed to christmas island last of which arrived on 31 july first shot was a test of pendant a fission bomb boosted with solid lithium hydride intended as a primary for a thermonuclear bomb rather than being dropped from a bomber this bomb was suspended from a string of four vertically stacked barrage balloons this was chosen over an air drop because bomb assembly could not be fitted into a casing but it introduced a host of problems a balloon shot had been tried only once before by british during operation antler at maralinga in october 1957 william saxby from aldermaston was placed in charge of balloon crews who commenced training at raf in bedfordshire in january 1958 inflating balloons required 1 200 cylinders of hydrogen gas and there were no reserves if another balloon test was required then empty cylinders would have to be returned to united kingdom for refilling and then shipped out again an important consideration was how they could be shot down if they broke loose of their moorings with a live hydrogen bomb cargo ship ss arrived at christmas island on 20 july but firing harness was lost at san francisco international airport on 1 august and a replacement had to be flown out pendant fissile core arrived by air on 12 august and weapon was assembled with its external neutron initiator unit on 22 august 1958 it was lifted in air and it detonated at 09 00 yield was assessed at next shot was of flagpole an unboosted version of orange herald known as indigo herald it was air dropped by valiant xd822 flown by squadron leader bill bailey with xd818 flown by flight lieutenant tiff o connor as grandstand aircraft on 2 september 1958 this was first live drop of a british nuclear weapon using blind radar technique bailey managed to put bomb from target it detonated at at 08 24 with a yield of about third shot was of an unusual three stage design with two nuclear fission components followed by a thermonuclear stage that was supposedly immune to exposure from another bomb despite its not using boosting americans had indicated an interest in it macmillan noted in his diary success of blind bombing in flagpole led to grandy deciding to use blind radar technique again hubbard was less sure in 52 practice drops with blind radar average error had been as opposed to with visual bombing problem for aircrew was that they would be dropping a live hydrogen bomb generally considered a dangerous thing to do with no means of verifying that their instruments were correct air chief marshal sir harry broadhurst head of bomber command wished o connor luck his xd827 would make drop with squadron leader tony caillard in xd827 grandstand aircraft aircraft took off at 07 15 on 11 september 1958 once in air though a fault developed in ground radar transmitter grandy then authorised a visual drop it was later confirmed that it was from target it was detonated at at 08 49 with a yield of about very close to predicted yield of final test in grapple z series was of burgee at 09 00 on 23 september 1958 this was another balloon borne test burgee was an atomic bomb boosted with gaseous tritium created by a generator codenamed daffodil it had a yield of about aldermaston weapon makers had now demonstrated all of technologies that were needed to produce a megaton hydrogen bomb that weighed no more than and was immune to premature detonation caused by nearby nuclear explosions international moratorium commenced on 31 october 1958 and britain never resumed atmospheric testing aftermath cooperation with united states thumb right us president dwight d eisenhower and british prime minister harold macmillan meet for talks in bermuda in march 1957 partly to repair anglo american relations after disastrous suez crisis of previous year british timing was good soviet union s launch of sputnik 1 world s first artificial satellite on 4 october 1957 came as a tremendous shock to american public who had trusted that american technological superiority ensured their invulnerability now suddenly there was incontrovertible proof that in some areas at least soviet union was actually ahead in widespread calls for action in response to sputnik crisis officials in united states and britain seized an opportunity to mend relationship with britain that had been damaged by 1956 suez crisis at suggestion of harold caccia british ambassador to united states macmillan wrote to eisenhower on 10 october urging that two countries pool their resources to meet challenge to do this mcmahon act s restrictions on nuclear cooperation needed to be relaxed british information security or lack thereof no longer seemed so important now that soviet union was apparently ahead and united kingdom had independently developed hydrogen bomb trenchant opposition from joint committee on atomic energy that had derailed previous attempts was absent amendments to atomic energy act of 1954 passed congress on 30 june 1958 and were signed into law by eisenhower on 2 july 1958 1958 us uk mutual defence agreement was signed on 3 july and was approved by congress on 30 july macmillan called this great prize anglo american special relationship proved mutually beneficial although it was never one of equals united states was far larger than britain both militarily and economically britain soon became dependent on united states for its nuclear weapons as it lacked resources to produce a range of designs british decided to adapt mark 28 as a british weapon as a cheaper alternative to doing their own development which became red snow other weapons were supplied through project e under which weapons in american custody were supplied for use of raf and british army nuclear material was also acquired from united states under mutual defence agreement 5 4 tonnes of uk produced plutonium was sent to us in return for of tritium and 7 5 tonnes of highly enriched uranium between 1960 and 1979 replacing production of british uranium enrichment facility at capenhurst in cheshire although much of highly enriched uranium was used not for weapons but as fuel for growing uk fleet of nuclear submarines british ultimately acquired entire weapons systems with uk polaris programme and trident nuclear programme using american missiles with british nuclear warheads health effects in 2005 a massey university study that was contracted and paid for by a veterans organization in new zealand examined some 50 sailors who observed tests from ships it was found in one battery of tests that they were indistinguishable from control group which is interpreted as indicating that dna repair mechanisms in veterans are not deficient however in another test done by same massey university team for chromosome translocations within peripheral blood lymphocytes author of study r e rowland suggested that a statistically higher rate of this non germline abnormality was found various veterans organisations then filed a class action lawsuit against uk ministry of defence following publication of study with many media outlets reporting on it at time effects of radioactive fallout from grapple tests were researched by a 2010 british government study that concluded fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect surrounding nature ministry of defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all and that studies had shown little or no health effects an analysis of illnesses in veterans of grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than control group but control group had lower rates of illness than population as a whole while veterans had rates that were about same neither of these results has a clear explanation analysis of data in lancet and bmj in 1993 two british veterans of operation grapple ken mcginley a veteran of five of tests and edward egan a veteran of grapple y sued for ps100 000 damages over multiple health problems which they attributed to their involvement in tests they took their claim to european court of human rights which rejected it in a 5 4 split decision on 9 june 1998 an appeal to court to re open case was declined in january 2000 a group of 1 011 british ex servicemen were denied permission to sue uk ministry of defence by supreme court in march 2012 on grounds that too much time had elapsed since they became aware of their medical conditions under terms of limitation act 1980 in january 2015 prime minister of fiji frank announced that fijian government would provide fiji 9 855 us 4 788 compensation payments to 24 surviving fijian servicemen who participated in operation grapple operation dominic in addition to british tests during operation grapple united states used christmas island for nuclear testing in operation dominic in 1962 twenty four nuclear bombs were detonated near christmas island as part of this test series in 1979 gilbert islands phoenix islands and line islands which included christmas
