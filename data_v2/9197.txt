wessagusset colony sometimes called weston colony or weymouth colony was a short lived english trading colony in new england located in weymouth massachusetts it was settled in august 1622 by between fifty and sixty colonists who were ill prepared for colonial life colony was settled without adequate provisions and was dissolved in late march 1623 after harming relations with local indians surviving colonists joined plymouth colony or returned to england it was second settlement in massachusetts predating massachusetts bay colony by six years chartier craig s march 2011 an investigation into weston s colony at weymouth massachusetts plymouth archaeological rediscovery project parp http www com historian charles francis adams jr referred to colony as ill conceived ill executed ill fated it is best remembered for battle there between plymouth troops led by myles standish and an indian force led by pecksuot this battle scarred relations between plymouth colonists and indians and was fictionalized two centuries later in henry wadsworth longfellow s 1858 poem courtship of miles standish in september 1623 a second colony was created on abandoned site at wessagusset led by governor general robert gorges this colony was rechristened as weymouth and was also unsuccessful and governor gorges returned to england following year despite that some settlers remained in village and it was absorbed into massachusetts bay colony in 1630 origin colony was coordinated by thomas weston a london merchant and ironmonger he was associated with plymouth council for new england which had funded short lived popham colony in maine 15 years earlier during period when pilgrims were in netherlands weston helped to arrange their passage to new world with help from merchant adventurers historian charles francis adams jr glowingly called him a sixteenth century adventurer in mold of john smith and walter raleigh adding that his brain teemed with schemes for deriving sudden gain from settlement of new continent in later years plymouth governor william bradford called him a bitter enemy unto plymouth upon all occasions turning a profit was primary purpose of weston s new colony rather than religious reasons of pilgrims who established plymouth and this dictated how colony would be assembled weston believed that families were a detriment to a well run plantation so he selected able bodied men only but not men experienced in colonial life in total there were several advance scouts and 50 or 60 other colonists quoting with annotations from edward winslow s good news from new england final complement also included one surgeon and one lawyer party was outfitted with enough supplies to last winter first wessagusset colony an advance team of 60 settlers arrived at plymouth colony in may 1622 they had voyaged to new world on board sparrow an english fishing vessel which was sailing to coast of maine team traveled final down new england coast in a shallop with three members of sparrow s crew these colonists stayed only briefly in plymouth before scouting coast in their shallop to find a site for their colony after finding one they negotiated for land with chief and returned to plymouth sending shallop back to sparrow and awaiting remainder of colonists thumb left flag of weymouth depicting its founding in 1622 as wessagusset main body of colonists set off from london in april 1622 aboard charity and swan richard greene thomas weston s brother in law was initial leader of group group arrived in plymouth in late june and moved into their settlement following month by end of september colony was established swan was moored in weymouth fore river and charity returned to england relations were initially cordial between two colonies and men of wessagusset assisted plymouth with their harvest but people of plymouth accused them of stealing quoting with annotations from edward winslow s good news from new england indians soon complained to plymouth that wessagusset colonists were stealing their corn but plymouth had no authority over new colony and could only send them a rebuke wessagusset was consuming food too quickly because of disorder of colony as reported by plymouth s governor bradford and it became apparent that they would run out before end of winter in addition plymouth was also low on supplies due to spending additional time during growing season building fortifications rather than growing crops to prevent hunger for both colonies plymouth and wessagusset colonists organized a joint trading mission to indians with goods brought by wessagusset colonists that trading mission was somewhat successful and two colonies split proceeds in november greene died and john sanders was made governor of colony by january colonists continued to trade with indians for food but at a severe disadvantage this drove up barter price of corn and they were forced to trade their clothes and other needed supplies some colonists entered a form of servitude building canoes and performing other labors for indians in exchange for food and ten colonists died indians caught one wessagusset man stealing so other wessagusset colonists hanged him in their view as a show of good faith however sources disagree whether man hanged was culprit or an older possibly dying man legend that wessagusset colonists hanged an innocent man was later popularized by a satirical depiction of this event in samuel butler s 1660s poem in february sanders petitioned plymouth for a joint attack on indians but governor bradford refused much of story of first wessagusset colony is detailed in a 1662 account by company member phineas pratt killings at wessagusset thumb right miles standish circa 1630 tensions continued to build throughout winter between settlers and indians and there was at least one instance where an indian was caught stealing from plymouth near end of winter indians near wessagusset moved some of their huts to a swamp near colony and colonists felt that they were under siege one colonist at wessagusset saw these signs and other indications of hostility and fled to plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack pursued by indians during his flight he arrived at plymouth on march 24 and met with governor bradford and town councilmen it is unclear whether this colonist s report was tipping point or whether plymouth had already decided to mount a pre emptive attack edward winslow had saved life of wampanoag chief massasoit and massasoit now warned him of a conspiracy among several tribes against wessagusset and plymouth threatening tribes were led by massachusetts but also included nauset and agawam tribes from as far away as martha s vineyard quoting with annotations from edward winslow s good news from new england plymouth colony sent a small force under miles standish to wessagusset and they arrived on march 26 standish called all of wessagusset colonists into stockade for defense following day several indians were at wessagusset including chief pecksuot historical sources give different accounts of killings but four of indians were in same room as standish and several of his men one source from 1880s suggests that it was indians who arranged to be alone with standish in order to attack him others sources state that standish had invited them into situation on peaceful pretenses regardless standish gave order to strike quickly killing chief pecksuot with his own knife several other indians in village were attacked next and only one escaped to raise alarm as many as five colonists were also killed in brief battle one indian s head was cut off and displayed in plymouth as a warning to others which was a common practice in europe at time quoting with annotations from edward winslow s good news from new england in 1858 henry wadsworth longfellow included a fictionalized depiction of killings in his poem courtship of miles standish in his version indians are depicted as begging for weapons to use against other tribes and standish responds by offering them bibles indians begin to boast and taunt him so standish attacks first aftermath following brief conflict standish offered to leave several soldiers to defend colony but colonists declined instead they divided some returning to england in swan including john sanders others remaining behind to join plymouth colony by spring of 1623 village was empty and colony was dissolved thomas weston arrived in maine several months later seeking to join his colony only to discover that it was already failed some of his former settlers apparently had gone north to maine and were living on house island in casco bay in a home built by explorer capt christopher levett who had been granted land to found an english colony george cleeve of casco bay 1630 1667 with collateral documents james phinney baxter printed for gorges society portland me 1885 levett s settlement also failed and fate of weston s men is uncertain due to fighting at wessagusset plymouth s trade with indians was devastated for years local tribes which had previously been favorable to plymouth began to forge bonds with other tribes in defense against colonists historians differ on whether conflict could have been avoided or colony saved some historians see preemptive strike as a necessary one saving lives of hundreds while others see it as a sad misunderstanding historian charles francis adams summarizes wessagusset experience as ill conceived ill executed ill fated second wessagusset colony plymouth council for new england gave robert gorges a patent for a settlement covering northeast of boston bay he was an english captain and son of sir ferdinando gorges gorges was named as governor general of new colony to be assisted by capt francis west recently appointed admiral to new england and capt christopher levett an english explorer slated to act as fledgling colony s chief judicial officer this settlement was intended to be a spiritual and civic capital of council s new england colonies gorges was commissioned as governor general with authority over plymouth and presumably future colonies his government was also to consist of a leadership council of which plymouth s governor bradford would be a member weston had brought only working men whereas gorges brought entire families who would form a permanent settlement he also brought two anglican clergymen who would oversee spiritual health of region gorges arrived in massachusetts in september 1623 only four months after weston s colony collapsed instead of founding his colony at location described in patent he chose abandoned settlement at wessagusset it was rechristened weymouth after weymouth dorset town where expedition began over following weeks he visited plymouth and ordered arrest of thomas weston who had arrived in that colony in swan this was his only official act as governor general weston was charged with neglect of his colony and with selling weapons to indians which were supposed to have been used for defense of colony weston denied first charge but confessed to second after consideration gorges released him on his word and he eventually settled as a politician in virginia and maryland after wintering in weymouth gorges abandoned his new colony in spring of 1624 due to financial difficulties most of his settlers returned to england but some remained as colonists in weymouth plymouth or virginia and william settled in boston remaining weymouth settlers were supported by plymouth until they were made part of massachusetts bay colony in 1630 massachusetts bay governor john winthrop visited settlement in 1632 in time location of original settlement was lost to history and development location of
