magnavox odyssey known as brown box during development is first commercial home video game console it was developed by a small team led by ralph h baer at sanders associates and released by magnavox in united states in september 1972 and overseas following year odyssey consists of a white black and brown box which connects to a television set and two rectangular controllers attached by wires it is capable of displaying three square dots on screen in monochrome black and white with differing behavior for dots depending on game played and with no sound capabilities players place plastic overlays on screen to create visuals and one or two players for each game control their dots with three knobs and one button on controller in accordance with rules given for game odyssey console came packaged with dice paper money and other board game paraphernalia to go along with games and a peripheral controller first video game light gun was sold separately idea for a video game console was thought up by baer in august 1966 and over next three years he along with bill harrison and bill rusch created seven successive prototype consoles seventh known as brown box was shown to several manufacturers before magnavox agreed to produce it in january 1971 after releasing console in september 1972 through their dealerships magnavox sold between 69 000 and 100 000 units by end of year and 350 000 by time console was discontinued in 1975 console spawned odyssey series of dedicated consoles as well as 1978 magnavox odyssey2 one of 28 games made for system a ping pong game was an inspiration for atari s successful pong arcade game in turn driving sales of console baer s patents for system and games including what was termed by a judge as pioneering patent of video game art formed basis of a series of lawsuits spanning 20 years earning sanders and magnavox over us 100 million release of odyssey marked end of early history of video games and rise of commercial video game industry along with start of first generation of video game consoles design thumb right an odyssey controller odyssey consists of a black white and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers primary console box connects to television set through an included which allows player to switch television input between odyssey and regular television input cable and presents itself like a television channel controllers which are designed to sit on a flat surface contain one button marked reset on top of controller and three knobs one on right side of controller and two on left with one extending from other reset button does not reset game but instead is used by different games to reset individual elements such as making a player s dot visible after it is turned off during a game system can be powered by six c batteries which were included an optional ac power supply was sold separately odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen internally odyssey architecture is composed of digital computing parts circuitry is implemented in diode transistor logic using discrete transistors and diodes rather than newly emerging transistor transistor logic integrated circuits due to cost concerns games themselves do not use rom cartridges like later consoles but instead use game cards composed of printed circuit boards that plug into console these cards modify internal circuitry like a set of switches or jumpers causing odyssey to display different components and react to inputs differently multiple games use same cards with different instructions given to player to change style of game link file magnavox color screen overlays jpg thumb left plastic television overlays odyssey is capable of displaying three square dots and a vertical line on screen two of dots are controlled by two players and third by system itself main console has two dials one of which moves vertical line across screen and one which adjusts speed of computer controlled dot different games direct player to adjust dials to different positions for example to change center line of a tennis game into side wall of a handball game games include plastic overlays which stick to television via static cling to create visuals for game different games that use same game card can have different overlays which can change a game with same controls from for example a mountain ski path to a movement based simon says game in addition to overlays odyssey came with dice poker chips score sheets play money and game boards much like a traditional board game one peripheral controller was released for odyssey first video game light gun named shooting gallery rifle shaped device registered a hit when pointed at a light source such as a dot on television screen four shooting based games were included with light gun development thumb right brown box prototype in 1951 while working for military contractor electronics engineer ralph h baer was assigned to build a television set while doing so baer claims he had idea to build something into a television set that owner could control rather than only hooking it up to a remote television station baer did not pursue idea but it returned to him in august 1966 while waiting for a bus baer then head of equipment design division at military contractor sanders associates came up with concept of using a television to play games and next morning wrote up a four page proposal for a us 20 game box that would plug into a television screen and play games on it while commercial video game industry did not yet exist at that point very first electronic computer games had been developed at start of 1950s and by 1966 several early mainframe games had been developed for mainframe computers which were typically only found in large academic or research institutions in proposal baer began by referring to project using military terminology but by time he finished it he was referring to it as channel lp short for let s play proposed device would transmit a signal that television set could tune into as if it were a television channel and baer described several games that could be played on it as channel lp had little to do with typical military contracts sanders worked on rather than bring idea to his bosses baer instead commandeered an empty room and assigned one of his technicians bob tremblay to work on it with him by december 1966 an initial prototype later christened tv game 1 was completed which could display and move a vertical line on a television screen baer demonstrated prototype to sanders director of research and development herbert campman who hesitantly agreed to fund it for us 2 000 of labor and us 500 for materials making it an official project thumb left magnavox odyssey cartridge no 6 baer spent next few months designing further prototypes and in february 1967 assigned technician bill harrison to begin building project harrison spent next few months in between other projects building out successive modifications to prototype baer meanwhile collaborated with engineer bill rusch on design of console including developing basis of many games for system first game was developed by may a two player game where players repeatedly press a button in competition to fill or empty a bucket of water and by june multiple games were completed for what was then a second prototype box these included a game where players controlled dots chasing each other and a light gun shooter game with a plastic rifle baer demonstrated new prototype to campman who enjoyed shooting game increased funding and recommended baer demonstrate project to senior management baer demonstrated console to board who were largely uninterested though a couple of members were enthusiastic nevertheless ceo royden sanders authorized project to be continued with aim of selling or licensing console as a commercial product by august 1967 baer and harrison had completed a third prototype machine but had found that to even come near to baer s initial aim of a us 20 or 25 console would require so much to be excluded that resulting console would not be very enjoyable baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for system to make up for this he formally added bill rusch who had helped him come up with initial games for console to project though pair found rusch difficult to work with he soon proved his value to team by coming up with a way to display three spots on screen at once rather than previous two and proposing development of a ping pong game by november team now on their fourth prototype machine had a ping pong game a chasing game a light gun game and three types of controllers joysticks for chase game a rifle for light gun game and a three dial controller for ping pong game campman felt that system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it they had decided to aim for selling rights to produce console as sanders was not in business of making and selling commercial electronics thumb right odyssey was packaged with board game accessories like dice and play money as well as game cards team first approached cable television industry and prototype attracted attention of teleprompter corporation who had seen it during a visit after a few months of talks cash flow problems forced teleprompter to back out in april 1968 same economic downturn that caused teleprompter s problems caused financial difficulties at sanders as well which put project on hold after fifth prototype was developed while simultaneously undergoing large scale layoffs it was picked up again in september this time without rusch and went through two more iterations resulting in january 1969 in seventh prototype known as brown box due to wood grain stickers on casing with system now largely complete baer and harrison were unsure who to approach to sell it until a sanders patent attorney recommended contacting television manufacturers baer demonstrated system to several companies who all expressed enthusiasm only rca was willing to purchase device however and an agreement could not be reached soon afterwards though rca executive bill enders left rca for magnavox and convinced them to look at console again three creators of brown box again demonstrated device to magnavox in july 1969 they received a tepid reaction from most of executives but vice president of marketing gerry martin was in favor and magnavox agreed to produce console after a long period of negotiations two companies finally signed an agreement in january 1971 thumb left odyssey consisted of 10 daughter cards that were connected to motherboard and game cards only rewired circuit for different game modes magnavox designed exterior of machine and re engineered some internals with some consultation from baer and harrison they removed ability to display color used only three dial controller and changed system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified console s circuitry when plugged into console at time color televisions were still seen as a luxury item and ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with fcc testing and regulations internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns these concerns were no longer valid by 1971 but magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of machine prior to planned production start date magnavox named console first as skill o vision while testing and then released it as odyssey rifle game was turned into a separately sold add on game shooting gallery and magnavox added paper money playing cards and poker chips to console to go along with plastic overlays for games that enhanced primitive visuals new additions helped raise price of console to us 99 99 baer was upset with board game additions which he felt were pointless add ons that would go unused by players magnavox announced system s launch date of september 1972 and demonstrated it for months prior to magnavox dealerships and media reception thumb right magnavox odyssey at 2010 festival du jeu video magnavox began advertising odyssey in mid september 1972 including an appearance on game show what s my line on october 16 1972 as neither pong nor term video game existed company described console as new electronic game of future and closed circuit electronic playground after ordering 50 000 units before release magnavox increased its production capabilities and built a larger inventory as market testing found an enthusiastic response to console odyssey was sold only through magnavox dealers company hoped that as first such product consumers would visit its stores device retailed for us 99 99 or us 50 when purchased with a magnavox television there are conflicting reports between baer and magnavox employees as to whether magnavox produced 120 000 or 140 000 consoles in 1972 additionally odyssey product manager bob fritsche recalled selling 69 000 units that year while baer recalled sales being closer to 100 000 baer stated that he felt low initial sales were due to high price us 100 in 1972 is and because of magnavox restricting sales to its dealerships and implying that device only worked with magnavox televisions other sources have stated that dealers misled customers to sell more televisions though advertisements explicitly stated that it worked with any set customers unfamiliar with new device may have misunderstood odyssey s interoperability magnavox assistant product planner don emry said that sales were in line with original projections if not with production run according to baer after initial holiday season magnavox considered dropping console but modest continuing demand following year convinced them to manufacture an additional 27 000 units for 1973 holiday season selling 20 000 of them console was also released in 12 other countries australia belgium france germany greece israel italy soviet union spain switzerland united kingdom and venezuela with different games in late 1973 magnavox ran a large advertising campaign for all of its 1974 products including sponsoring frank sinatra s november television special ol blue eyes is back commercials during special and advertisements for it showed odyssey and other magnavox products company sold 129 000 odyssey units in 1974 or 150 000 according to baer magnavox discontinued console after 1975 according to baer it sold 350 000 units in total worldwide though statements by fritsche indicate it may have been higher light gun peripheral sold 20 000 units legacy thumb right ralph baer being given national medal of technology in february 2006 as odyssey was discontinued magnavox released first successive dedicated consoles consoles that could only play games built into system in odyssey series odyssey 100 and odyssey 200 as part of first generation of video game consoles odyssey 100 was only capable of playing ping pong and hockey games from original odyssey eleven dedicated odyssey consoles were produced before a true follow up console in 1978 magnavox odyssey2 while it showed potential of video game consoles and marked end of early history of video games and beginning of commercial video game industry odyssey is not generally considered a major commercial success magnavox produced no more games for console after 1973 and rejected baer s proposals for an add on that would add sound to games a putting controller and associated golf game and console variants that would have been cheaper or supported up to four players while a few clone systems were produced in limited quantities and multiple dedicated systems generally focused on ping pong game variants were created by several companies no other true home video consoles were produced until 1976 fairchild semiconductor channel f in 2004 ralph baer was awarded national medal of technology for his groundbreaking and pioneering creation development and commercialization of interactive video games which spawned related uses applications and mega industries in both entertainment and education realms in june 2013 museum of modern art moma added magnavox odyssey to its permanent collection of video games moma s paul galloway described console as a masterpiece of engineering and industrial design and stated that it was hard to overstate importance of ralph baer s place in birth of industry brown box prototype and tv game 1 prototype are located at smithsonian institution s national museum of american history in washington d c lawsuits thumb right patent drawing for magnavox odyssey in may 1972 nutting associates chief engineer nolan bushnell designer of first commercial arcade video game computer space saw a demonstration of odyssey at a dealership inspired when he quit nutting to start his own company atari he assigned allan alcorn to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise though he did not tell alcorn that it was for training nor that idea was based on odyssey table tennis game alcorn soon developed pong which bushnell recognized as a potential hit and it became company s first game pong was very successful and in turn helped drive sales of odyssey baer once noted that customers bought console because of table tennis in turn because of pong and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card in 1974 however magnavox sued atari along with several competitors including nutting allied leisure bally midway and williams electronics for infringing on baer s patents for video games played on a television screen baer has stated that lawsuits were not filed right away because magnavox and sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue suits root of conflict was a pair of patents by baer one which described how odyssey showed player controlled objects or dots on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with system and an earlier one that went into detail about how odyssey used that system to have two dots collide with each other and have one bounce off specifically using a game of ping pong as an example judge ruled that baer s more general patent for odyssey constituted pioneering patent of video game art and held defendants games as infringing patents atari settled early on in court case with magnavox and in return were granted a license in exchange for us 1 5 million and access granted to magnavox to all technology produced by atari from june 1976 to june 1977 while other defendants paid higher penalties over next twenty years sanders and magnavox sued several other companies over issue focusing on paddle and ball type games like pong and table tennis that were more clearly related to ping pong game patent final lawsuits ended in mid 1990s defendants included coleco mattel seeburg and activision sanders and magnavox won or settled every lawsuit many of defendants unsuccessfully attempted to claim that patents only applied to specific hardware implementations that baer had used or that they were invalidated by prior computer or electronic games in 1985 nintendo sued and tried to invalidate baer s patents claiming as prior art 1958 tennis for two game built by william higinbotham court however ruled that oscilloscope based game did not use video signals and therefore did not qualify as a video game and ruled again in favor of magnavox and sanders magnavox won more than us 100 million in various patent lawsuits and settlements involving odyssey related patents in addition they had a large number of licensees of patents with over one hundred already by mid 1970s list of games a total of 28 games distributed on 11 different game cards were released for magnavox odyssey 13 games were included with console a set of 12 in america and a different set of 10 in other countries with 6 others available for purchase either individually for us 5 49 or in
