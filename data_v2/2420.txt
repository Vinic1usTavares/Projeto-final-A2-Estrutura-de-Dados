promote christian missions among slavic peoples its first archbishop byzantine methodius persuaded pope john viii to sanction use of old church slavonic in liturgy methodius had been consecrated archbishop of pannonia by pope adrian ii at request of kocel slavic ruler of pannonia in east francia in 870 methodius s appointment was sharply opposed by bavarian prelates especially archbishop of salzburg and bishop of passau because missionaries from their dioceses had already been active for decades in territory designated to methodius including pannonia and moravia methodius was soon captured and imprisoned he was only released in 873 on pope john viii s order he settled in moravia which emerged as a leading power in central europe during next decade in reign of svatopluk however most clerics who had come from east francia were hostile to archbishop who introduced byzantine customs and promoted use of vernacular in liturgy they accused methodius of heresy but he convinced pope of orthodoxy of his views pope also strengthened s position declaring that all clerics in moravia including newly consecrated bishop of nitra were to be obedient to methodius in 880 methodius died on 6 april 885 wiching bishop of nitra who had always been hostile to archbishop expelled his disciples from moravia no new archbishop was appointed and wiching who remained only prelate with a see in moravia settled in east francia in early 890s church hierarchy was only restored in moravia when legates of pope john ix consecrated an archbishop and three bishops around 899 however magyars occupied

collapsed after franks launched military campaigns against western territories of khaganate in 790s at a synod that charlemagne s son pepin held in 796 bishops made decisions on several aspects of missionary work in newly conquered pannonia they ruled that local christians who had been baptised correctly in name of trinity should not be rebaptised in contrast with those who had not received baptism properly thumb right alt three realms and neighboring regions carolingian empire after its partition in accordance with treaty of verdun 843 charlemagne divided newly conquered territory along river drava between bishopric of salzburg and patriarchate of aquileia in 796 or 797 with salzburg receiving lands to north of river see of salzburg became an archbishopric in 798 with five suffragan bishoprics including diocese of passau missionaries from salzburg were especially active among slavs in carantania clerics dispatched by bishops of passau worked primarily in moravia adalram who was archbishop of salzburg between 821 and 836 consecrated a church for pribina on his estate at a place over danube called nitrava according to conversio bagoariorum et carantanorum a report written around 870 about missionary activities of clerics from salzburg historians date this event between 828 and 832 but pribina was only baptised in carolingian empire after mojmir i of moravia expelled him from his homeland around 833 pribina settled in pannonia where he received extensive domains in late 830s he cooperated closely with archbishop of salzburg who consecrated churches for him in ptuj pecs and other settlements in pannonia between 850 and 859 de records that bishop of passau baptised all moravians in 831 however 21 years later prelates in east francia still considered moravian christianity coarse life of methodius mentions that many christian teachers or missionaries came to moravia from among italians greeks and germans who taught local christians in various ways life of constantine philosopher emphasizes that german missionaries forbade neither offering of sacrifices according to ancient custom nor shameful marriages mojmir i s successor rastislav of moravia rastislav s nephew svatopluk and pribina s son and successor kocel approached holy see to ask for a teacher in early 860s according to letter gloria in excelsis deo of dubious authenticity which was recorded in life of methodius and is attributed to pope adrian ii even if report of slavic princes request is reliable they did not receive an answer rastislav sent his envoys to byzantine emperor michael iii asking him to send missionaries to educate local priests in moravia rastislav s actions show that he wanted to reduce influence of clergy from salzburg and passau in his realm thumb left alt a bearded man who holds model of a church is surrounded by six bearded men constantine and methodius would be saints cyril and methodius and their disciples emperor michael iii dispatched two experienced diplomats and missionaries constantine and methodius sons of a military officer from thessaloniki to rastislav s court brothers and their retinue arrived in moravia in 863 and 864 constantine translated religious texts first gospel of st john to slavic using an alphabet he had invented for this purpose use of vernacular enabled missionaries to accelerate education of local priests however it contradicted acceptance of latin greek and hebrew as sacred languages which was dominant view in western europe three or four years after their arrival constantine and methodius left moravia to achieve consecration of their pupils because they did not know which bishop could ordain priests in rastislav s realm during journey they spent some time in pannonia within jurisdiction of archbishops of salzburg and taught slavic letters to local ruler kocel and fifty new students from pannonia they went to venice where bishops priests and monks gathered against constantine like ravens against a falcon condemning use of slavic liturgy but constantine defended his case especially referring to paul apostle s first epistle to corinthians he stated that uneducated slavs could not understand basic concepts of christianity if it were presented in a foreign language to them after learning of brothers activities pope nicholas i summoned them to rome he either wanted to prevent them from returning to byzantine empire because of his conflict with photius patriarch of constantinople or had decided to take advantage of brothers missionary activities to hinder expansion of salzburg see by time constantine and methodius arrived in rome in early 867 pope nicholas had died but his successor pope adrian ii sanctioned use of books that constantine had translated to slavic maddalena betti proposes that pope regarded slavic as a medium of instruction limiting its use to missionary activities on pope s orders some pupils of constantine and methodius were ordained priests or constantine died in rome on 14 february 869 urging his brother on his deathbed not to abandon mission among slavs kocel sent his envoys to rome asking pope adrian ii to send methodius to pannonia in letter gloria in excelsis deo addressed to rastislav svatopluk and kocel pope informed three slavic rulers that he made methodius papal legate to continue mission in their realms pope also sanctioned use of slavic liturgy methodius arrived in pannonia in summer or autumn of 869 history methodius bishop of st andronicus s see thumb right alt a long nosed bald man pope adrian ii who consecrated methodius bishop in response to kocel s demand methodius returned to rome where he was consecrated to bishopric of pannonia to seat of saint andronicus an apostle of seventy in early 870 most historians identify saint andronicus s seat with sirmium near modern sremska mitrovica in serbia but no primary sources associate sirmium with apostle if methodius s see was identical with sirmium his appointment shows that pope wanted to strengthen his authority in western regions of balkan peninsula because sirmium had been center of church in diocese of illyricum in roman empire in early 870s papal correspondence referred to methodius as bishop or archbishop a bishop dispatched by apostolic see or archbishop of pannonia apostolic legate without specifying his see methodius was made archbishop but no suffragan bishops were consecrated to serve under him this was not unprecedented saint boniface had been made archbishop of germania province in a similar way in 732 methodius s promotion to bishopric in rome was recorded in slavic sources including his life and encomium to cyril and methodius but it was not mentioned in pope adrian s documents historian maddalena betti says that absence of roman sources implies that negotiations over methodius s appointment between holy see and kocel were conducted confidentially because pope did not want to come into conflict with louis german king of east francia who was making attempts to assert his authority over neighboring slavic rulers although pope granted kocel s request no papal envoys accompanied methodius back to pannonia methodius s appointment jeopardized interests of salzburg see ignoring its jurisdiction in domains of kocel to defend salzburg s position clergymen from archdiocese compiled conversio bagoariorum et carantanorum which emphasized role of missionaries from salzburg in conversion of bavaria carantania and pannonia around 870 document refers to methodius as a certain greek without mentioning his appointment to bishopric before 14 may 870 svatopluk captured his uncle rastislav and handed him over to franks rastislav was sentenced to prison in regensburg and franks occupied his realm life of methodius describes a debate between methodius with all bishops bishops accused him of working illicitly in their territory methodius refuted allegation stating that he had been authorized by pope to work in a territory that bishops had illegally seized from holy see bishops banished methodius to swabia and imprisoned him taking advantage of a rebellion svatopluk expelled frankish troops from moravia in 871 pope john viii who succeeded adrian ii on 14 december 872 soon started to search for methodius after learning of methodius s trial pope dispatched his legate paul bishop of ancona to east francia demanding methodius s release in his letters addressed to louis german and three bavarian prelates pope condemned archbishop of salzburg for methodius s expulsion and bishop of passau for his capture before trial suggesting that methodius had been active in territories claimed by two prelates pope imposed an interdict on their dioceses prohibiting celebration of mass as long as method was held in captivity pope john also sent letters to svatopluk kocel and mutimir of serbia in letters pope mentions methodius s bishopric as diocese of pannonia and declared that three slavic rulers realms were included in method s diocese according to maddalena betti designation has little bearing on actual geographical context of diocese pope only wanted to emphasize right of holy see against bavarian prelates in territory methodius was released in may 873 he went to moravia because pope john viii had asked svatopluk to defend his interests around same time pope instructed methodius to read epistle and gospel in latin or greek before repeating it in vernacular but otherwise supported use of slavic in liturgy svatopluk and his subjects received methodius and entrusted to him all churches and clergy in all towns according to life of methodius during next years as it was emphasized in life of methodius moravians began to grow and multiply and pagans to believe in true god and province of moravia began to expand much more into all lands and to defeat its enemies successfully expansion of svatopluk s realm contributed to growth of methodius s ecclesiastic province for instance methodius s hagiography mentioned a very powerful pagan prince who settled on vistula and began mocking christians and doing evil but svatopluk invaded his country and forced him to be baptised most clerics in svatopluk s realm especially those who had come from bavaria remained hostile to methodius holy see was also informed of their disobedience of archbishop they accused methodius of heresy because he did not use filioque and from son phrase when reciting nicene creed bavarian clerics persuaded svatopluk to question methodius s orthodoxy on svatopluk s request pope john viii summoned methodius to rome to answer charges archdiocese of moravia methodius quickly convinced pope of orthodoxy of his views in early 880 in june 880 pope john viii informed svatopluk of validation of methodius s orthodoxy in an apostolic letter known as pope also reaffirmed methodius s position as archbishop and determined territory of his archbishopric associating it with svatopluk s realm john viii explicitly declared that all priests deacons or clergy of whatever order whether they be slavs or any people whatsoever who reside within borders of svatopluk s realm should be subject and obedient in all things to methodius he also ordered that masses were to be officiated in latin for svatopluk if he requested it but otherwise confirmed limited use of slavonic for liturgical purposes in letter pope did not mention diocese of pannonia instead referred to methodius as archbishop of sancta ecclesia holy church of maraba change in terminology suggests that holy see set up a territorially defined archbishopric in moravia or maraba on this occasion according to a widely accepted scholarly theory in contrast with this view historian imre boba says that terminology did not change new title only reflects vernacular maraba form of name of methodius s see sirmium there is no direct evidence that sirmium was ever named maraba pope john viii consecrated a swabian monk wiching bishop of nitra ordering that he be obedient to methodius in a letter written about 20 years later dietmar i archbishop of salzburg and his suffragans declared that pope john had ordained wiching bishop at svatopluk s request sending new bishop to a newly baptized people whom svatopluk had defeated in war and converted from paganism to christianity pope john viii also urged svatopluk to send another useful priest or deacon with methodius s consent to rome to be consecrated as bishop to another church in which svatopluk discern that episcopal care is needed latter text shows that holy see acknowledged svatopluk s right to determine ecclesiastic administration of his realm granting him a special privilege unprecedented in other christian monarchies outside carolingian empire confirmation of methodius s position by pope did not put an end to his conflicts with german clerics wiching even tried to forge documents to convince svatopluk that pope had made him archbishop and forbidden use of vernacular in liturgy at methodius s request pope john viii issued a new apostolic letter to moravia reconfirming his previous decisions methodius visited constantinople in 881 after his return in 882 he dedicated himself to translation of bible however his conflict with wiching continued and methodius excommunicated his disobedient suffragan methodius died on 6 april 885 however but only after he had nominated his moravian disciple gorazd as his successor collapse wiching left for rome shortly before or just after methodius s death he convinced pope stephen v that methodius had disregarded pope john viii s orders persuading pope to send a new epistle to svatopluk in his letter quia te stephen v prohibited slavonic liturgy endorsed inclusion of filioque phrase in creed and expressed his disapproval of fasting on saturdays which was customary practise in byzantine church soon after returning to moravia wiching tried to persuade gorazd clement and methodius s other leading disciples to accept pope s orders since they refused to obey wiching captured and imprisoned them and later before arrival of a papal legate expelled them from moravia with svatopluk s approval naum and some other disciples were sold to jewish slave traders who bought them to venice however wiching was never made archbishop after he came into conflict with svatopluk and fled to east francia between 891 and 893 church in moravia was left without a bishop svatopluk died in 894 and his empire started to disintegrate especially after magyars settled in carpathian basin around 895 svatopluk s son mojmir ii of moravia approached pope john ix in 898 or 899 asking him to restore church hierarchy in moravia pope agreed and sent his three legates to moravia who consecrated an archbishop and three suffragan bishops neither four prelates names nor their sees were recorded bavarian prelates archbishop dietmar of salzburg and his suffragans protested
