thumb upright 1 35 rado graph as numbered by and in mathematical field of graph theory rado graph erdos renyi graph or random graph is a countably infinite graph that can be constructed with probability one by choosing independently at random for each pair of its vertices whether to connect vertices by an edge names of this graph honor richard rado paul erdos and alfred renyi mathematicians who studied it in early 1960s it appears even earlier in work of rado graph can also be constructed non randomly by membership relation of hereditarily finite sets by applying bit predicate to binary representations of natural numbers or as an infinite paley graph that has edges connecting pairs of prime numbers congruent to 1 mod 4 that are quadratic residues modulo each other every finite or countably infinite graph is an induced subgraph of rado graph and can be found as an induced subgraph by a greedy algorithm that builds up subgraph one vertex at a time rado graph is uniquely defined among countable graphs by an extension property that guarantees correctness of this algorithm no matter which vertices have already been chosen to form part of induced subgraph and no matter what pattern of adjacencies is needed to extend subgraph by one more vertex there will always exist another vertex with that pattern of adjacencies that greedy algorithm can choose rado graph is highly symmetric any isomorphism of its induced subgraphs can be extended to a symmetry of whole graph first order logic sentences that are true of rado graph are also true of almost all random finite graphs and sentences that are false for rado graph are also false for almost all finite graphs in model theory rado graph forms an example of a saturated model of an o categorical and complete theory history rado graph was first constructed by in two ways with vertices either hereditarily finite sets or natural numbers strictly speaking ackermann described a directed graph and rado graph is corresponding undirected graph given by forgetting directions on edges constructed rado graph as random graph on a countable number of points they proved that it has infinitely many automorphisms and their argument also shows that it is unique though they did not mention this explicitly rediscovered rado graph as a universal graph and gave an explicit construction of it with vertex set natural numbers rado s construction is essentially equivalent to one of ackermann s constructions constructions binary numbers and constructed rado graph using bit predicate as follows they identified vertices of graph with natural numbers 0 1 2 an edge connects vertices x and y in graph where x y whenever xth bit of binary representation of y is nonzero thus for instance neighbors of vertex 0 consist of all odd numbered vertices because numbers whose 0th bit is nonzero are exactly odd numbers vertex 1 has one smaller neighbor vertex 0 as 1 is odd and vertex 0 is connected to all odd vertices larger neighbors of vertex 1 are all vertices with numbers congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 4 because those are exactly numbers with a nonzero bit at index 1 random graph rado graph arises almost surely in erdos renyi model of a random graph on countably many vertices specifically one may form an infinite graph by choosing independently and with probability 1 2 for each pair of vertices whether to connect two vertices by an edge with probability 1 resulting graph is isomorphic to rado graph this construction also works if any fixed probability p not equal to 0 or 1 is used in place of 1 2 see fact 1 and its proof this result shown by justifies definite article in common alternative name random graph for rado graph repeatedly drawing a finite graph from erdos renyi model will in general lead to different graphs however when applied to a countably infinite graph model almost always produces same infinite graph for any graph generated randomly in this way complement graph can be obtained at same time by reversing all choices including an edge when first graph did not include same edge and vice versa this construction of complement graph is an instance of same process of choosing randomly and independently whether to include each edge so it also with probability 1 generates rado graph therefore rado graph is a self complementary graph proposition 5 other constructions in one of ackermann s original 1937 constructions vertices of rado graph are indexed by hereditarily finite sets and there is an edge between two vertices exactly when one of corresponding finite sets is a member of other a similar construction can be based on skolem s paradox fact that there exists a countable model for first order theory of sets one can construct rado graph from such a model by creating a vertex for each set with an edge connecting each pair of sets where one set in pair is a member of other theorem 2 rado graph may also be formed by a construction resembling that for paley graphs taking as vertices of a graph all prime numbers that are congruent to 1 modulo 4 and connecting two vertices by an edge whenever one of two numbers is a quadratic residue modulo other by quadratic reciprocity and restriction of vertices to primes congruent to 1 mod 4 this is a symmetric relation so it defines an undirected graph which turns out to be isomorphic to rado graph another construction of rado graph shows that it is an infinite circulant graph with integers as its vertices and with an edge between each two integers whose distance absolute value of their difference belongs to a particular set s to construct rado graph in this way s may be chosen randomly or by choosing indicator function of s to be concatenation of all finite binary sequences section 1 2 rado graph can also be constructed as block intersection graph of an infinite block design in which number of points and size of each block are countably infinite properties extension thumb upright 1 35 extension property of rado graph for every two disjoint finite sets of vertices u and v there exists another vertex x connected to everything in u and to nothing in v rado graph satisfies following extension property for every two disjoint finite sets of vertices u and v there exists a vertex x outside both sets that is connected to all vertices in u but has no neighbors in v for instance with binary number definition of rado graph let then nonzero bits in binary representation of x cause it to be adjacent to everything in u however x has no nonzero bits in its binary representation corresponding to vertices in v and x is so large that xth bit of every element of v is zero thus x is not adjacent to any vertex in v essentially same construction described in set theoretic terms rather than using binary numbers is given as theorem 2 of with random graph definition of rado graph each vertex outside union of u and v has probability 1 2 u v of fulfilling extension property independently of other vertices because there are infinitely many vertices to choose from each with same finite probability of success probability is one that there exists a vertex that fulfils extension property with paley graph definition for any sets u and v by chinese remainder theorem numbers that are quadratic residues modulo every prime in u and modulo every prime in v form a periodic sequence so by dirichlet s theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions this number theoretic graph has extension property induced subgraphs extension property can be used to build up isomorphic copies of any finite or countably infinite graph g within rado graph as induced subgraphs to do so order vertices of g and add vertices in same order to a partial copy of g within rado graph at each step next vertex in g will be adjacent to some set u of vertices in g that are earlier in ordering of vertices and non adjacent to remaining set v of earlier vertices in g by extension property rado graph will also have a vertex x that is adjacent to all vertices in partial copy that correspond to members of u and non adjacent to all vertices in partial copy that correspond to members of v adding x to partial copy of g produces a larger partial copy with one more vertex proposition 6 this method forms basis for a proof by induction with 0 vertex subgraph as its base case that every finite or countably infinite graph is an induced subgraph of rado graph uniqueness rado graph is up to graph isomorphism only countable graph with extension property for example let g and h be two countable graphs with extension property let gi and hi be isomorphic finite induced subgraphs of g and h respectively and let gi and hi be first vertices in an enumeration of vertices of g and h respectively that do not belong to gi and hi then by applying extension property twice one can find isomorphic induced subgraphs gi 1 and hi 1 that include gi and hi together with all vertices of previous subgraphs by repeating this process one may build up a sequence of isomorphisms between induced subgraphs that eventually includes every vertex in g and h thus by back and forth method g and h must be isomorphic because graphs constructed by random graph construction binary number construction and paley graph construction are all countable graphs with extension property this argument shows that they are all isomorphic to each other fact 2 symmetry applying back and forth construction to any two isomorphic finite subgraphs of rado graph extends their isomorphism to an automorphism of entire rado graph fact that every isomorphism of finite subgraphs extends to an automorphism of whole graph is expressed by saying that rado graph is in particular there is an automorphism taking any ordered pair of adjacent vertices to any other such ordered pair so rado graph is a symmetric graph automorphism group of rado graph is a simple group whose number of elements is cardinality of continuum every subgroup of this group whose index is less than cardinality of continuum can be sandwiched between pointwise stabilizer and stabilizer of a finite set of vertices section 1 8 automorphism group construction of rado graph as an infinite circulant graph shows that its symmetry group includes automorphisms that generate a transitive infinite cyclic group difference set of this construction set of distances in integers between adjacent vertices can be constrained to include difference 1 without affecting correctness of this construction from which it follows that rado graph contains an infinite hamiltonian path whose symmetries are a subgroup of symmetries of whole graph robustness against finite changes if a graph g is formed from rado graph by deleting any finite number of edges or vertices or adding a finite number of edges change does not affect extension property of graph for any pair of sets u and v it is still possible to find a vertex in modified graph that is adjacent to everything in u and nonadjacent to everything in v by adding modified parts of g to v and applying extension property in unmodified rado graph therefore any finite modification of this type results in a graph that is isomorphic to rado graph section 1 3 partition for any partition of vertices of rado graph into two sets a and b or more generally for any partition into finitely many subsets at least one of subgraphs induced by one of partition sets is isomorphic to whole rado graph gives following short proof if none of parts induces a subgraph isomorphic to rado graph they all fail to have extension property and one can find pairs of sets ui and vi that cannot be extended within each subgraph but then union of sets ui and union of sets vi would form a set that could not be extended in whole graph contradicting rado graph s extension property this property of being isomorphic to one of induced subgraphs of any partition is held by only three countably infinite undirected graphs rado graph complete graph and empty graph and investigate infinite directed graphs with same partition property all are formed by choosing orientations for edges of complete graph or rado graph a related result concerns edge partitions instead of vertex partitions for every partition of edges of rado graph into finitely many sets there is a subgraph isomorphic to whole rado graph that uses at most two of colors however there may not necessarily exist an isomorphic subgraph that uses only one color of edges model theory and 0 1 laws used rado graph to prove a zero one law for first order statements in logic of graphs when a logical statement of this type is true or false for rado graph it is also true or false respectively for almost all finite graphs first order properties first order language of graphs is collection of well formed sentences in mathematical logic formed from variables representing vertices of graphs universal and existential quantifiers logical connectives and predicates for equality and adjacency of vertices for instance condition that a graph does not have any isolated vertices may be expressed by sentence where symbol indicates adjacency relation between two vertices section 1 2 what is a first order theory pp 15 17 this sentence is true for some graphs and false for others a graph is said to model written if is true of vertices and adjacency relation of see e g p 184 extension property of rado graph may be expressed by a collection of first order sentences stating that for every choice of vertices in a set and vertices in a set all distinct there exists a vertex adjacent to everything in and nonadjacent to everything in section 1 3 extension statements and rooted graphs pp 17 18 for instance can be written as completeness proved that sentences together with additional sentences stating that adjacency relation is symmetric and that is that a graph modeling these sentences is undirected and has no self loops are axioms of a complete theory this means that for each first order sentence exactly one of and its negation can be proven from these axioms because rado graph models extension axioms it models all sentences in this theory theorem 2 4 2 p 50 in logic a theory that has only one model up to isomorphism with a given infinite cardinality is called categorical fact that rado graph is unique countable graph with extension property implies that it is also unique countable model for its theory this uniqueness property of rado graph can be expressed by saying that theory of rado graph is o categorical los and vaught proved in 1954 that when a theory is categorical for some infinite cardinal and in addition has no finite models then theory must be complete p 147 therefore s theorem that theory of rado graph is complete follows from uniqueness of rado graph by los vaught test theorem 2 2 6 p 42 finite graphs and computational complexity as proved first order sentences from extension axioms and modeled by rado graph are exactly sentences true for almost all random finite graphs this means that if one chooses an vertex graph uniformly at random among all graphs on labeled vertices then probability that such a sentence will be true for chosen graph approaches one in limit as approaches infinity symmetrically sentences that are not modeled by rado graph are false for almost all random finite graphs it follows that every first order sentence is either almost always true or almost always false for random finite graphs and these two possibilities can be distinguished by determining whether rado graph models sentence fagin s proof uses compactness theorem theorem 2 4 4 pp 51 52 based on this equivalence theory of sentences modeled by rado graph has been called theory of random graph or almost sure theory of graphs because of this 0 1 law it is possible to test whether any particular first order sentence is modeled by rado graph in a finite amount of time by choosing a large enough value of and counting number of vertex graphs that model sentence however here large enough is at least exponential in size of sentence for instance extension axiom implies existence of a vertex clique but a clique of that size exists with high probability only in random graphs of size exponential in it is unlikely that determining whether rado graph models a given sentence can be done more quickly than exponential time as problem is complete saturated model from model theoretic point of view rado graph is an example of a saturated model this is just a logical formulation of property that rado graph contains all finite graphs as induced subgraphs in this context a type is a set of variables together with a collection of constraints on values of some or all of predicates determined by those variables a complete type is a type that constrains all of predicates determined by its variables in theory of graphs variables represent vertices and predicates are adjacencies between vertices so a complete type specifies whether an edge is present or absent between every pair of vertices represented by given variables that is a complete type specifies subgraph that a particular set of vertex variables induces a saturated model is a model that realizes all of types that have a number of variables at most equal to cardinality of model rado graph has induced subgraphs of all finite or countably infinite types so it is saturated related concepts although rado graph is universal for induced subgraphs it is not universal for isometric embeddings of graphs where an isometric embedding is a graph isomorphism which preserves distance rado graph has diameter two and so any graph with larger diameter does not embed isometrically into it has described a family of universal graphs for isometric embedding one for each possible finite graph diameter graph in his family with diameter two is rado graph henson graphs are countable graphs one for each positive integer that do not contain an vertex clique and are universal for clique free graphs they can be constructed as induced subgraphs of rado graph rado graph henson graphs and their complements disjoint unions of countably infinite cliques and their complements and infinite disjoint unions of isomorphic finite cliques and their complements are only possible countably infinite homogeneous graphs universality property of rado graph can be extended to edge colored graphs that is graphs in which edges have been assigned to different color classes but without usual edge coloring requirement that each color class form a matching for any finite or countably infinite number of colors kh there exists a unique countably infinite kh edge colored graph such that every partial isomorphism of a kh edge colored finite graph can be extended to a full isomorphism with this notation rado graph is just g1 investigates automorphism groups of this more general family of graphs it follows from classical model theory considerations of constructing a saturated model that under continuum hypothesis ch there is a universal graph with continuum many vertices of course under ch continuum is equal to first uncountable cardinal uses forcing to investigate universal graphs with many vertices and shows that even in absence of ch there may exist a universal graph of size he also investigates analogous questions for higher cardinalities notes references category individual graphs category random graphs category infinite graphs
