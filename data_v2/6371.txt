corollary to adoption germanicus was wed to his second cousin agrippina elder following year in ad 13 his father was appointed commander of forces on rhine from where he led three campaigns into

its condolences for death of augustus augustus had died in august and tiberius became emperor making germanicus heir to empire tacitus annals i 3 at direction of tiberius germanicus was dispatched to asia to reorganize provinces and assert imperial authority there provinces were in such disarray that attention of a member of leading family was deemed necessary however after two years in east germanicus came at odds with governor of syria gnaeus calpurnius piso during their feud germanicus fell ill and died in october ad 19 drusus married around ad 29 she was daughter of marcus aemilius lepidus his second cousin tacitus reports that during their marriage she had pursued her husband with ceaseless accusations in 36 she was charged with adultery with a slave and committed suicide since there was no question about her guilt tacitus annals vi 40 his mother agrippina believed her husband was murdered to promote drusus younger as heir and feared that birth of his twin sons would give him motive to displace her own sons however her fears were unfounded with nero being elevated by tiberius in ad 20 nero received toga virilis toga of manhood was promised office of quaestor five years in advance and was wed to drusus younger s daughter julia following death of germanicus drusus younger was tiberius new heir he received a second consulship in ad 21 and tribunicia potestas

iv 2 according to tacitus and cassius dio younger drusus and sejanus began bickering and entered a feud during which drusus became ill and died of seemingly natural causes on 14 september 23 cassius dio roman history lviii annals iv 8 ancient sources say cause of death was poison whereas modern authors such as barbara levick suggest that it was may have been due to illness career thumb right detail from great cameo of france depicting livia left drusus center and agrippina elder right death of younger drusus left no immediate threat to sejanus ultimately his death elevated drusus and nero to position of heirs drusus received toga virilis and was promised rank of quaestor five years before legal age just as his brother nero had been given in effect this formed factions around them and their mother agrippina on one side and sejanus on other it is impossible to know full extent of sejanus power at this point but it has been noted that sejanus was not allowed to marry livilla drusus younger s widow and was thus denied entry into imperial family in senate sejanus encountered little opposition from senators but tiberius expressed displeasure in senate in ad 24 at public prayers which had been offered for nero and his brother drusus health in 28 senate voted that altars to clementia mercy and amicitia friendship be raised at that time clementia was considered a virtue of ruling class for only powerful could give clemency altar of amicitia was flanked by statues of sejanus and tiberius tacitus annals iv 74 by this time his association with tiberius was such that there were even those in roman society who erected statues in his honor and gave prayers and sacrifices in his honor cassius dio roman history lviii 2 like members of imperial family sejanus birthday was to be honored according to author and historian alston sejanus association with tiberius must have at least indicated to people that he would be further elevated downfall very next year saw a direct attack on agrippina and nero tiberius sent a letter to senate in which he accused agrippina and nero of misconduct but was unable to convict them of any attempt at rebellion attitude of former and sexual activity of latter were primary accusations against them agrippina was popular with people as was family of germanicus and people surrounded senate house carrying likenesses of two in protest of letter senate refused to come to a resolution on matter until it received plain direction from emperor to do so tacitus annals v 3 4 tiberius found it necessary to repeat his charges and when he did senate no longer delayed and fate of agrippina and nero was sealed nero was declared an enemy of state removed to island of pontia and was killed or encouraged to kill himself in 31 after his wife amelia betrayed him for sejanus drusus was dismissed by tiberius it wasn t long before he was accused by cassius severus of plotting against tiberius he was imprisoned and confined to a dungeon on palatine in 30 he starved to death in prison in 33 after having been reduced to chewing stuffing of his bed postmortem sejanus remained powerful until his sudden downfall and summary execution in october ad 31 just after death of nero exact reasons for this remain unclear after realizing his error in trusting sejanus tiberius considered releasing drusus but decided that he had been imprisoned for too long to be released senate was shocked reading account of his imprisonment from his diary deaths of germanicus oldest sons elevated his third son gaius caesar caligula to successor and he
