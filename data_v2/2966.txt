red necked grebe podiceps grisegena is a migratory aquatic bird found in temperate regions of northern hemisphere its wintering habitat is largely restricted to calm waters just beyond waves around ocean coasts although some birds may winter on large lakes grebes prefer shallow bodies of fresh water such as lakes marshes or fish ponds as breeding sites red necked grebe is a nondescript dusky grey bird in winter during breeding season it acquires distinctive red neck plumage black cap and contrasting pale grey face from which its name was derived it also has an elaborate courtship display and a variety of loud mating calls once paired it builds a nest from water plants on top of floating vegetation in a shallow lake or bog like all grebes red necked is a good swimmer a particularly swift diver and responds to danger by diving rather than flying feet are positioned far back on body near tail which makes bird ungainly on land it dives for fish or picks insects off vegetation it also swallows its own feathers possibly to protect digestive system conservation status of its two subspecies p g grisegena found in europe and western asia and larger p g holboelii formerly holboell grebe in north america and eastern siberia is evaluated as least concern and global population is stable or growing taxonomy red necked grebe was described by french polymath georges louis leclerc comte de buffon in 1781 in his histoire naturelle des oiseaux bird was also illustrated in a hand coloured plate engraved by francois nicolas martinet in planches enluminees d histoire naturelle which was produced under supervision of edme louis daubenton to accompany buffon s text neither plate caption nor buffon s description included a scientific name but in 1783 dutch naturalist pieter boddaert coined binomial name colymbus grisegena in his catalogue of planches enluminees type locality was subsequently designated as france red necked grebe is now placed in genus podiceps that was erected by english naturalist john latham in 1787 genus name podiceps comes from latin vent or anus and pes foot and is a reference to placement of a grebe s legs towards rear of its body ogilvie rose 2002 98 species name grisegena is from latin griseus grey and gena cheek and refers to face pattern of breeding adult ogilvie rose 2002 102 grebes are small to medium large water birds with lobed rather than webbed toes there are several genera of which most widespread is podiceps with nine species one recently extinct red necked grebe s closest relative is fish eating great crested grebe of europe and western asia ogilvie rose 2002 8 9 it is possible that red necked grebe originally evolved in north america and later spread to europe where a change of diet to include more insects helped to reduce competition with its larger cousin johnsgard pa 1987 130 135 fossils of species dating to middle pleistocene have been found in italy red necked grebe has two subspecies nominate subspecies p g grisegena in europe and western asia and p g holboelii holboell s grebe named for danish explorer of greenlandic birds carl peter in north america and eastern siberia east asian birds have slightly smaller bills than american form although differences are too small to merit separation as a third subspecies ogilvie rose 2002 57 60 description red necked grebe is a medium large grebe smaller than great crested grebe of eurasia and western and clark s grebes of north america snow perrin 1998 17 2000 29 adult of nominate european subspecies is long with a average wingspan snow perrin 1998 20 22 and weighs in breeding plumage it has a black cap that extends below eye very pale grey cheeks and throat a rusty red neck dark grey back and flanks and white underparts eyes are dark brown and long pointed bill is black with a yellow base mullarney et al 18 thumb left upright adult of american subspecies with chicks winter plumage of red necked grebe is duskier than that of other grebes its dark grey cap is less defined and merges into grey face and a pale crescent that curves around rear of face contrasts with rest of head front of neck is whitish or light grey hind neck is darker grey and yellow of bill is less obvious than in summer although red necked grebe is unmistakable in breeding plumage it is less distinctive in winter and can be confused with similar species it is larger than slavonian horned grebe with a relatively larger bill and a grey rather than white face it is closer in size to eurasian great crested grebe but that species is longer necked has a more contrasting head pattern and always shows white above eye sexes are similar in appearance although male averages heavier than female chicks have a striped head and breast and older juveniles have a striped face diffuse blackish cap pale red neck and extensive yellow on bill subspecies p g holboelii is larger than nominate race at length with a wingspan and a weight of ogilvie rose 2002 92 plumages are same as those of nominate race although adult s bill is more extensively yellow difference in size between sexes is greater than for this subspecies that for p g grisegena red necked grebe flies with its long neck extended and its large feet trailing behind body which gives it a stretched out appearance fjeldsa 2004 140 relatively small wings are grey with white secondaries and beat very rapidly its small wing area means that grebe is unable to take off from land fjeldsa 2004 31 and needs a lengthy run across water to gain speed needed for take off johnsgard 1987 26 36 like all grebes red necked is an expert swimmer it uses its feet for propulsion underwater and steers by rotating its legs since its tail is too short for this purpose fjeldsa 2004 10 this is one of most vocal grebes during breeding season but like its relatives it is mainly silent for rest of year it has a loud wailing or howling display call given by a single bird or a pair in duet by night or during day and often from cover long sequences of up to 60 consecutive notes may be delivered during singing encounters between rival territorial birds a great variety of quacking clucking hissing rattling and purring calls are also given with much individual variation distribution and habitat thumb a breeding adult of nominate subspecies breeding takes place in shallow freshwater lakes bays of larger lakes marshes and other inland bodies of water often less than in extent and less than deep red necked grebe shows a preference for waters in forested areas or further north in shrub tundra and favours sites with abundant emergent vegetation such as reedbeds best breeding habitat is fish ponds which have an abundance of food in addition to meeting other requirements american subspecies is less tied to a high aquatic plant density and sometimes breeds on quite open lakes all populations are migratory and winter mainly at sea usually in estuaries and bays but often well offshore where fish are within diving reach near shallow banks or islands preferred passage and wintering habitat is water less than deep with a sand or gravel bottom scattered rocks and patches of seaweed during winter birds typically feed alone and rarely aggregate into flocks but on migration concentrations of over 2000 individuals may occur at favoured staging sites migration is usually at night but may occur during day especially when over water this is particularly noticeable in autumn on great lakes when up to 18 000 birds may pass whitefish point on lake superior these are thought to be canadian breeders heading for atlantic ocean to winter this easterly route is longer than that to pacific but avoids rockies breeding range of red necked grebe overlaps with that of slavonian grebe although latter species tends to be displaced from sites suited to both red necked grebe prefers an inland temperate climate and is less successful near coasts and in subarctic and warm temperate zones it is usually a lowland bird breeding below although has nested at up to in turkey nominate subspecies breeds from southern sweden and denmark through central and eastern europe east to western siberia and winters mainly in north and baltic seas with smaller numbers in adriatic black sea caspian sea mediterranean and on inland lakes harrison 1988 217 p g holboelii breeds in north america in alaska western and central canada and northern us east to minnesota in asia it nests in eastern siberia from kamchatka south to hokkaido and west to mongolia asian birds winter at sea from japan to east china sea and american breeders winter in pacific mainly from southern alaska to british columbia with smaller numbers south to california and in atlantic from newfoundland and labrador to florida some birds remain on great lakes if they are sufficiently ice free this species occurs as a rare winter vagrant in afghanistan pakistan and parts of northern and western india behaviour breeding and survival thumb egg collection museum wiesbaden germany red necked grebes usually nest as isolated pairs with more than between neighbouring nests although semi colonial nesting may occur in suitable sites where up to 20 pairs each defend a linear territory semi colonial breeding is more likely to occur in prime locations such as large floating mats of vegetation with no connection to shoreline such sites safe from most predators and large enough to provide some wind and wave protection have grebes nesting much closer than shoreline breeders down to pairs nesting in these colonies produce larger clutches of eggs which hatch earlier in season and result in larger broods territory is defended with various threat displays including wing spreading and bill thrusting pairs breeding in colonies are more aggressive less likely to leave nest unguarded and show a greater tendency to move out of sight of colony when not incubating breeding is often in loose association with gulls or other colonial water birds thumb left breeding areas must have emergent vegetation monogamous pair forms in april or may on migration or at breeding water and a highly vocal courtship ritual commences elaborate breeding performance includes head shaking a head lowered cat display parallel rushes in an upright position and mutual presentations of green weeds and culminates in a penguin dance in which pair members raise whole body upright breast to breast like all grebes red necked grebe nests near water into which it can escape since position of legs far back on body prevents fast movement on land it often breeds further within reed beds than other grebes nest is a floating platform of plant matter anchored to submerged or emergent vegetation in water deep and with bulk of nest below water line egg laying mainly takes place from mid april to may in europe and somewhat later from mid may to june in north america parents may leave nest for significant periods of time during night possibly to evade nocturnal predators it is unclear whether this is for self protection or to protect eggs by diverting attention from nest clutch does not appear to suffer from this temporary abandonment whatever reason right thumb chicks on a parent s back red necked grebe lays four or five range one to nine dull white or pale blue eggs which average in breadth in length and weigh about of which 10 is shell parents take turns to incubate eggs for 21 33 days until precocial downy chicks hatch they immediately climb onto parent s back where they spend most of their time until they are 10 17 days old ogilvie rose 2002 94 young may be fed by parents for up to 54 days after fledging and can fly at 50 70 days parents do not interfere with feeding of their chicks when they are still being carried later they care for younger chicks for longer and are aggressive with older offspring this post fledging survival of all chicks and encourages their independence brood may be split so that each parent feeds only some of chicks this spreads feeding demand equally between parents lott 1991 74 76 146 after breeding adults moult their wing feathers and are temporarily flightless migration commences once flight feathers have regrown red necked grebe is normally single brooded although second broods and re nesting after a clutch has been lost may extend nesting into july or august eggs may be destroyed and chicks killed by a range of predators including raccoon in north america and carrion crow in europe pike may take swimming chicks on average for each adult 0 65 young birds are still alive by their fourth month although mortality rate for adult is unknown red necked grebes attempt to evade birds of prey by diving when feeding dives average less than 30 seconds although escape dives are more prolonged feeding thumb chicks are fed by parents for several weeks on breeding grounds red necked grebe feeds mainly on invertebrates including adult and larval aquatic insects such as water beetles and dragonfly larvae crayfish and molluscs fish such as smelt may be important locally or seasonally especially for american subspecies and crustaceans can constitute up to 20 of grebe s diet birds breeding at coast often make foraging flights to inland lakes or offshore areas to feed aquatic prey is obtained by diving or by swimming on surface with head submerged and terrestrial insects and their larvae are picked off vegetation a line slanting downward from eye to tip of opened lower mandible may be used for sighting on prey before diving or when swimming under water grebe probably opens its bill and looks down eye line toward its target european breeders which have to compete with larger great crested grebe for fish eat a greater proportion of invertebrates than longer billed american subspecies although both races eat mainly fish in winter birds of nominate subspecies from northernmost breeding populations in finland and russia beyond range of great crested grebe have a longer and more slender bill than those further south reflecting a greater proportion of fish in diet where their main competitor is absent if food is scarce parents may desert unhatched eggs or allow smallest chicks to starve although latter strategy appears not to be particularly efficient in protecting older chicks like other grebes red necked grebe ingests large quantities of its own feathers which remain in bird s stomach feathers are not only swallowed by adults mainly during self preening but are often fed to young sometimes within a day of hatching these feathers soon decompose into a felt like amorphous mass johnsgard 1987 37 53 function of feathers in stomach is unknown although it has been suggested that they help to protect lower digestive tract from bones and other hard indigestible material status thumb adult and chicks red necked grebe has a large range estimated at 1 10 million square kilometres 0 4 3 8 million square miles and a global population of 150 000 370 000 individuals with p g about twice as numerous as nominate race ogilvie rose 2002 96 population trend has not been quantified but it is not believed to meet thresholds for population decline criterion declining more than 30 in ten years or three generations of iucn red list for these reasons species is evaluated as least concern red necked grebe is one of species to which agreement on conservation of african eurasian migratory waterbirds aewa applies parties to agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies which are describes in a detailed action plan plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation management of human activities research education and implementation red necked grebe was hunted by humans in northern europe in mesolithic and paleolithic periods but there is no evidence that there is any significant level of hunting at present time in north america there are potential threats from pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and pesticides such as ddt which cause reduced reproductive success due to egg sterility and eggshell thinning breeding areas may be threatened by modification and degradation of lakes and by human disturbance from water based recreational activities there is no evidence to suggest that these threats could result in a significant risk to overall population more than 70 of north american red necked grebes breed in canada where population is stable or increasing notes references root terry louise 1988 atlas of wintering north american birds an analysis of
