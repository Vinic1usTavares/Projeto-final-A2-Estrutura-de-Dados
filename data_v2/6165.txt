during an interview with rolling stone madonna was asked by interviewer austin scaggs as to why theme of song was meaningful to her she replied saying song just fit right in with my own personal zeitgeist of standing up to male authorities whether it s pope or catholic church or my father and his conservative patriarchal ways for papa don t preach there were so many opinions that s why i thought it was so great is she for as they say in knocked up is she against abortion composition papa don t preach is a dance pop song with instrumentation from acoustic electric and rhythm guitars keyboards and string arrangements it is set in common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 116 beats per minute song is written in key of f minor combination of key and tempo produces a disjuncture between pop and classical rhythms underlined by instrumentation during introduction song begins with a distinctly style as fast tempo and classical style chord progression anticipates lyrics to follow

madonna s vocal range spans from f3 to c5 and has a different sound from her previous work more mature centered and with a lower range lyrics show madonna s interest in her roman catholic upbringing as song theme is about a girl who tells her father that she is pregnant and refuses to have an abortion or give up baby for adoption despite what her friends are telling her to do it is constructed in a verse chorus form with a bridge before third and final chorus at beginning she addresses her father directly asking him to talk to her as an adult you should know by now that i m not a baby transition to chorus employs a more dramatic voice with a higher range ending nearly in cries as she sings word please leading to chorus madonna switches to a pleading voice singing song s main hook in a high tone during bridge song features a spanish inspired rhythm one of earliest examples of influence that hispanic music had on madonna s musical style critical response thumb upright madonna

village voice felt that she madonna doesn t speak for ordinary teenaged stiff any more than reagan speaks for union members adding that while content of papa don t preach isn t unequivocal and wouldn t make song bad by definition if it were ambiguity is a cop out rather than an open door which is bad sal cinquemani from slant magazine said that with songs like papa don t preach madonna made transition from pop tart to consummate artist joining ranks of 80s icons like michael jackson and prince david browne from entertainment weekly in a review of her first compilation album immaculate collection commented that in theory a 30 ish urban sophisticate singing in voice of a pregnant teen ought to sound ridiculous but added that with help of collaborators like stephen bray and patrick

author of madonna as postmodern myth compared her look in video as a combination of marilyn monroe jean seberg and kim novak he added that it was hard for him to believe that madonna did not know that she was going to cause a huge controversy with video with such a song and video she was throwing in america s face image of a country ravaged by abortion debate which is far from being resolved lynda hart one of authors of acting out feminist performances felt that video alternated between two competing representations of madonna charging coercion both sides make video as an invitation to a certain way of life in process denying it stylistic invocation of a rhetoric of self authorization at 1987 mtv video music awards papa don t preach video won best female video award and was nominated

popularity increased in united states so did criticism and support it received from groups concerned with pregnancy and abortion in july 1986 shortly after release of video for papa don t preach madonna commented on controversy surrounding song to music critic stephen holden from new york times papa don t preach is a message song that everyone is going to take wrong way immediately they re going to say i am advising every young girl to go out and get pregnant when i first heard song i thought it was silly but then i thought wait a minute this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life she has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness to me it s a celebration of life it says i love you father and i love this man and this child that is growing inside me of course who knows how it will end but at least it starts off positive people who criticized song s message included ellen goodman a national syndicated columnist who called video a commercial for teenage pregnancy feminist lawyer gloria allred spokeswoman of national organization for women now angrily called for madonna to make a public statement or another record supporting opposite point of view alfred moran executive director of planned parenthood of new york city also criticized song fearing that it would undermine efforts to promote birth control among adolescents and that it would encourage teenage pregnancy recalling how his agency s clinics were filled in 1985 with girls wearing clothes that were an imitation of madonna s style moran said that song s message is that getting pregnant is cool and having baby is right thing and a good thing and don t listen to your parents school anybody who tells you otherwise don t preach to me papa reality is that what madonna is suggesting to teenagers is a path to permanent poverty in contrast groups opposed to abortion saw papa don t preach as a positive pro life song susan carpenter mcmillan president of california chapter of feminists for life in us said that abortion is readily available on every street corner for young women now what madonna is telling them is hey there s an alternative tipper gore a founder of parents music resource center pmrc who a year earlier denounced madonna for sexual lyrical content of her single dress you up and had led a campaign against explicit content in music commended madonna for speaking candidly about such a serious subject and important social issue when speaking of song gore said song speaks to a serious subject with a sense of urgency and sensitivity in both lyrics and madonna s rendition it also speaks to fact that there s got to be more support and more communication in families about this problem and anything that fosters that i applaud song s writer brian elliot commented about debate i just wanted to make this girl in song a sympathetic character as a father myself i d want to be accessible to my children s problems madonna avoided controversy and did not comment on song s use as a pro life statement her publicist liz rosenberg said that she madonna is singing a song not taking a stand adding that her philosophy is people can think what they want to think danny aiello having appeared in video as titular papa recorded papa wants best for you later that year an answer song written by artie schroeck
