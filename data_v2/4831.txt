based on italian poem divine comedy by dante alighieri pictured first hinted at in early december 1999 devil may cry started out as earliest incarnation of resident evil 4 initially developed for playstation 2 game was directed by hideki kamiya after producer shinji mikami requested him to create a new entry in resident evil series around turn of millennium regular series writer noboru sugimura created a scenario for title based on kamiya s idea to make a very cool and stylized action game story was based on unraveling mystery surrounding body of protagonist tony an invincible man with skills and an intellect exceeding that of normal people his superhuman abilities explained with biotechnology as kamiya felt playable character did not look brave and heroic enough in battles from a fixed angle he decided to drop prerendered backgrounds from previous resident evil installments and instead opted for a dynamic camera system this new direction required team to make a trip to europe where they spent eleven days in united kingdom and spain photographing things like gothic statues bricks and stone pavements for use in textures though developers tried to make coolness theme fit into world of resident evil mikami felt it strayed too far from series survival horror roots and gradually convinced all of staff members to make game independent from it kamiya eventually rewrote story to be set in a world full of demons taking it from italian epic poem divine comedy by dante alighieri he changed hero s name to dante title character from buichi terasawa s manga series cobra served as basis for dante s personality kamiya based his idea of dante on what he perceived as stylish wearing a long coat to make character showy and a non smoker as kamiya saw that as cool character wears red because in japan it is a traditional color for a heroic figure kamiya has also stated he perceives dante as a character that you would want to go out drinking with someone who was not a show off but would instead pull some ridiculous mischievous joke to endear people to him he added that this aspect was intended to make character feel familiar to audiences cast of characters remained largely identical to that in sugimura s scenario although appearances of hero s mother and father were written out of story game s new title was revealed as devil may cry in november 2000 game was developed by team little devils a group of staff members within capcom production studio 4 some of major gameplay elements were partially inspired by a bug found in onimusha warlords during a test
