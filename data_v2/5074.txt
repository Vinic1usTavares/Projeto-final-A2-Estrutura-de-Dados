development before crisis was created as part of compilation of final fantasy vii a multimedia series based in and on world and characters of vii while film final fantasy vii advent children was originally to be only product of compilation production team agreed that one title was not enough to explore world of final fantasy vii in full so more titles were decided upon including dirge of cerberus final fantasy vii and crisis core before crisis was originally conceived by tetsuya nomura one of creative minds behind final fantasy vii and compilation his initial idea was simply for a mobile action role playing game using mobile network during pre production it was decided to set it within world of final fantasy vii hajime tabata joined at this point he approached tabata who had only recently joined company s mobile games division and asked if division could create a mobile game focused on turks nomura would end up designing game s characters production began in 2002 it was worked on by a core team of 18 people staff from original game took supervisory roles game s title was thought up by tabata and would go on to establish a system of letter based abbreviations used by staff for titles in compilation to help solidify their goal staff created a timeline for world of final fantasy vii since there was little definite information concerning events prior to final fantasy vii they had a relative amount of creative freedom including creating an early more violent incarnation of rebel group avalanche although before crisis is second title created for series it was first to be released because advent children was delayed during post production before crisis was first original video game developed by square enix exclusively for mobile phones originally released on ntt docomo s foma mobile devices and first action role playing game exclusive to platform company s first major mobile title also in collaboration with ntt docomo was a remake of original final fantasy using lessons learned from development of final fantasy port team worked hard to make before crisis a uniquely mobile experience with gameplay features built to exploit mobile functions such as camera and network capacity camera function used to generate materia was based on a simple image recognition that specifies materia generated based on picture s general color one of challenges during development was to keep framerate smooth during moments of high action especially as no two mobiles would have identical components in addition to these problems were issues with integrating multiplayer functions balancing gameplay for different creating a comfortable button layout and adjusting amount of content they could include for mobiles while maintaining desired product quality to promote game madhouse created a promotional animation featuring some of main characters original version s beta test started in august 2004 it was released on september 24 following an announcement at tokyo game show in 2006 game was released for two additional japanese mobile carriers it was respectively released for softbank mobile and ezweb on january 30 and april 5 2007 new logos were created for each release in 2010 tabata voiced an interest in fully remaking before crisis for nintendo 3ds revamping narrative delivery and incorporating ability for a substantial number of players to enter missions this suggestion was positively received by nomura and yoshinori kitase but at time tabata was busy developing final fantasy type 0 then agito xiii and 3rd birthday deployment for softbank version ended in june 2015 all versions of game ended with square enix s old mobile services were shut down in 2018 music composer for before crisis was takeharu ishimoto who would go on to compose music for crisis core originally joining company as a music arranger he was one of many staff who participated in a competition set up by game developers to find a composer for before crisis his task was to create a piece of music that was related to world of final fantasy vii but still distinctive it was one of ishimoto s first jobs as main composer for a title music of before crisis was commercially released along with music from original video animation last order final fantasy vii in an album titled before crisis final fantasy vii last order final fantasy vii original soundtrack majority of tracks of album were composed by ishimoto apart from a few reorchestrated themes from vii music of which was written by regular final fantasy composer nobuo uematsu localization game s release in west was announced at 2006 electronic entertainment expo two years after its release in japan at announcement localization was said to be coming along nicely stated reason for delay between original and projected western release was that mobile phones in west were not yet advanced enough for game one of things planned for western release was to bring entire experience over as quickly as possible with plans for one to three chapters released each month and fine tuning to be done using planned two year gap between original and western releases it formed part of a push by company into western mobile game market despite these announcements no further progress has been made and before crisis was never released in west official reason for this as stated by head of mobile operations keiji fujita was that mobile phones in west were too low spec for before crisis which could only run on high end phones in japan making a port impossible another possible reason suggested by fujita was ito s move from square enix to capcom in 2008 leaving no one to manage any future localization and porting efforts reception japanese website itmedia reviewed beta version in september 2004 reviewer enjoyed experience overall and found communication with other players easy but found a few faults with game that they hoped would be resolved later and generally found female characters less effective in battle during its first day of operation game registered 200 000 users making it best selling mobile game up until that time and was accessed 1 6 million times according to ito by 2006 game was still highly popular in japan previews and features concerning game have generally been positive animefringe commented that visuals seemed remarkable good and praised game for choosing to reverse good and bad guy roles by making turks protagonists and avalanche antagonists cara lee haslam of rpgamer previewed game at e3 2006 and stated that graphics are really great especially for a cell phone game although she also noted that animation isn t best gamespot s bethany massimilla also previewed game at e3 calling it perfectly digestible in delivery with its use of episodic storytelling that comes in small bursts in between action periods she also stated that game had well defined and detailed character portraits and lean lanky character models running around city and mako reactor which had a simple layout but still looked nice massimilla praised smooth animations and felt that controls were easy to learn and were responsive additionally she thought demo phone s vibrating function set off when player receives a call from tseng was a subtle detail levi buchanan of ign was generally positive praising dark art style and finding short mission based structure ideal for mobile gameplay 1up com listed game as one of five classic japanese mobile games unlikely to come to north america outside its immediate reception before crisis had an effect on other projects within final fantasy series after positive reception of madhouse s animated commercial they were chosen by square enix to animate last order high popularity of before crisis in japan led indirectly to creation of type 0 part of fabula nova crystallis final fantasy subseries and then a title for mobiles references external links official website category role playing video games
