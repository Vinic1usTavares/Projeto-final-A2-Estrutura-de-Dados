of letters 1796 letters written during a short residence in sweden norway and denmark 1796 is a personal travel narrative by eighteenth century british feminist writer mary wollstonecraft twenty five letters cover a wide range of topics from sociological reflections on scandinavia and its peoples to philosophical questions regarding identity published by wollstonecraft s career long publisher joseph johnson it was last work issued during her lifetime wollstonecraft undertook her tour of sweden norway and denmark in order to retrieve a stolen treasure ship for her lover gilbert imlay believing that journey would restore their strained relationship she eagerly set off however over course of three months she spent in scandinavia she realized that imlay had no intention of renewing relationship letters which constitute text drawn from her journal and from missives she sent to imlay reflect her anger and melancholy over his repeated betrayals letters written in sweden norway and denmark is therefore both a travel narrative and an autobiographical memoir using rhetoric of sublime wollstonecraft explores relationship between self and society in text she values subjective experience particularly in relation to nature champions liberation and education of women and illustrates detrimental effects of commerce on society letters written in sweden norway and denmark was wollstonecraft s most popular book in 1790s it sold well and was reviewed favorably by most critics wollstonecraft s future husband philosopher william godwin wrote if ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author this appears to me to be book godwin 95 it influenced romantic poets such as william wordsworth and samuel taylor coleridge who drew on its themes and its aesthetic while book initially inspired readers to travel to scandinavia it failed to retain its popularity after publication of godwin s memoirs of author of a vindication of rights of woman in 1798

in 1790 at age of thirty one wollstonecraft made a dramatic entrance onto public stage with a vindication of rights of men a work that helped propel british pamphlet war over french revolution two years later she published what has become her most famous work a vindication of rights of woman anxious to see revolution firsthand she moved to france for about two years but returned in 1795 after revolutionary violence increased and lover she met there american adventurer gilbert imlay abandoned her and their illegitimate daughter fanny imlay shortly after her return to britain wollstonecraft attempted suicide in may imlay however managed to save her one month after her attempted suicide wollstonecraft agreed to undertake long and treacherous journey to scandinavia in order to resolve imlay s business difficulties not only was her journey to scandinavia fraught with peril she was a woman travelling alone during a time of war it was also laced with sorrow and anger while wollstonecraft initially believed that trip might resurrect their relationship she eventually recognized that it was doomed particularly after imlay failed to meet her in hamburg jacobus 64 68 holmes

recreates wollstonecraft s mental state while she was in scandinavia and has been described as a suicide note addressed to imlay although he is never referred to by name in published text swaab 19 it is last work by wollstonecraft published within her lifetime she died in childbirth just one year later scandinavian journey and imlay s business interests although wollstonecraft appears as only a tourist in letters written in sweden norway and denmark during her travels she was actually conducting delicate business negotiations on behalf of imlay for almost two hundred years it was unclear why she had travelled to scandinavia but in 1980s historian per nystrom uncovered documents in local swedish and norwegian archives that shed light on purpose of her trip he revealed that wollstonecraft was searching for a ship and cargo that had been stolen from imlay imlay had authorized her to conduct his business dealings referring to her in legal documents as mrs mary imlay my best friend and wife although two were not married nystrom 18 thumb 300px left alt map showing wollstonecraft s route through denmark sweden norway and german states wollstonecraft s route intricate details of imlay s business dealings are laid out clearly by nystrom on 1794 peder ellefsen who belonged to a rich and influential norwegian family bought a ship called liberty from agents of imlay in le havre france it would later become clear that ellefsen never owned ship but rather engaged in a pro forma sale on behalf of imlay he renamed ship maria and margaretha presumably after mary and her maid marguerite and had danish consulate in le havre certify it so that ship could pass through british blockade of france imlay was a blockade runner carrying silver and gold bourbon plate ship sailed from france under a danish flag and arrived at copenhagen on 1794 although ellefsen supposedly ordered ship to continue on to gothenburg it never reached its destination imlay engaged in several fruitless attempts to locate ship and its valuable cargo and then dispatched wollstonecraft to negotiate an agreement with ellefsen who had subsequently been arrested for stealing ship and its contents wollstonecraft s success or failure in negotiations is unknown as is ultimate fate of ship and its treasure nystrom 22ff to engage in these negotiations wollstonecraft travelled first to gothenburg where she remained for two weeks leaving fanny and her nurse marguerite behind she embarked for stromstad sweden where she took a short detour to visit fortress of and then proceeded to larvik norway from there she travelled to tonsberg norway where she spent three weeks she also visited risor and kristiania now oslo and returned by way of stromstad and gothenburg where she picked up fanny and

style letters written in sweden norway and denmark consists of twenty five letters that address an extensive range of contentious political topics such as prison reform land rights and divorce laws as well as less controversial subjects such as gardening salt works and sublime vistas wollstonecraft s political commentary extends ideas she had presented in an historical and moral view of french revolution 1794 her discussion of prison reform for example is informed by her own experiences in revolutionary france and those of her friends many of whom were jailed holmes 26 swaab 22 23 while at first glance letters written in sweden norway and denmark appears to be a travel narrative it is actually a generic hybrid nature of this hybridity however is not altogether agreed upon by scholars some emphasize wollstonecraft s fusion of travelogue with autobiography or memoir a word used by wollstonecraft in book s advertisement myers 166 swaab 16 while others see it as a travelogue cum epistolary novel swaab 17 text which reveals wollstonecraft s thought processes flows seamlessly from autobiographical reflections to musings on nature to political theories however it is unified by two threads first is wollstonecraft s argument regarding nature and progress of society second is her increasing melancholy myers 166 170 181 holmes 19 poovey 92 swaab 25 although wollstonecraft aims to write as a philosopher image of suffering woman dominates book kelly 178 myers 171 travel narrative art of thinking one half of generic hybridity of letters written in sweden norway and denmark is epistolary travel narrative myers 169 70 wollstonecraft s conception of this genre was shaped by eighteenth century empirical and moral travel narratives particularly oliver goldsmith s traveller or a prospect of society 1764 laurence sterne s a sentimental journey through france and italy 1768 samuel johnson s a journey to western islands of scotland 1775 james boswell s journal of a tour to

white shirt with a collar that encompasses neck maurice quentin de la tour rousseau 1753 after reviewing twenty four travel books for joseph johnson s periodical analytical review wollstonecraft was well versed in genre this extensive reading solidified her ideas of what constituted a good travel book in one review she maintained that travel writers should have some decided point in view a grand object of pursuit to concentrate their thoughts and connect their reflections and that their books should not be detached observations which no running interest or prevailing bent in mind of writer rounds into a whole qtd in swaab 15 see also swaab 14 myers 166 kelly 177 her reviews praised detailed and engaging descriptions of people and places musings on history and an insatiable curiosity in traveller swaab 14 see also holmes 32 art of travel is only a branch of art of thinking wollstonecraft wrote qtd in swaab 15 her journey and her comments on it are therefore not only sentimental but also philosophical she uses two modes to continue critique of roles afforded women and progress of civilization that she had outlined in a vindication of rights of men 1790 a vindication of rights of woman 1792 and an historical and moral view of french revolution kelly 178 79 after overturning conventions of political and historical writing wollstonecraft brought what scholar gary kelly calls revolutionary feminism to yet another genre that had typically been considered purview of male writers transforming travel narrative s blend of objective facts and individual impressions into a rationale for autobiographical revelation myers 181 as one editor of letters written in sweden norway and denmark writes book is nothing less than a revolution in literary genres its sublimity expressed through scenes of intense feeling made a new wildness and richness of emotional rhetoric desirable in travel literature one scholar has called wollstonecraft complete passionate traveler parks 33 her desire to delve into and fully experience each moment in time was fostered by works of jean jacques rousseau particularly his reveries of a solitary walker 1782 sapiro 286 87 jacobus 64 todd 368 favret 104 several of rousseau s themes appear in letters written in sweden norway and denmark such as search for source of human happiness stoic rejection of material goods ecstatic embrace of nature and essential role of sentiment in understanding favret 104 106 however while rousseau ultimately rejects society wollstonecraft celebrates both domesticity and industrial progress letter in one of most influential interpretations of letters written in sweden norway and denmark mary favret has argued that wollstonecraft s letters must not only be viewed as personal correspondence but also as business correspondence a genre that would have been ideologically ambiguous for her according to favret wollstonecraft attempts to reclaim impersonal genre of business letter and imbue it with personal meaning one way she does this is through extensive use of imaginative writing that forces reader to become a participant in events narrated favret points out that wollstonecraft s letters written in sweden norway and denmark is quite different from despondent and plaintive love letters she actually sent to imlay travel narrative much more closely resembles personal journal in which she recorded her thoughts regarding people she encountered and places she visited while her letters to imlay contain long passages focused almost exclusively on herself letters written in sweden norway and denmark offers social commentary and sympathizes with victims of disaster and injustice to imlay wollstonecraft represents herself as laid low by doubts but to world she depicts herself as overcoming all of these fears she ruminates on them and transforms them into basis of a letter akin to open political letter popular during last quarter of eighteenth century using her personal experience as foundation for a discussion of national political reform favret 96 98 101 2 autobiography heavily influenced by rousseau s frank and revealing confessions 1782 wollstonecraft lays bare her soul in letters written in sweden norway and denmark detailing not only her physical but also her psychological journey myers 176 poovey 89 kelly 187 her personal disclosures like those of other female autobiographers are presented as unpremeditated self revelations and often appear to be circuitous for a study of female autobiography see patricia meyer spacks imagining a self cambridge harvard university press 1976 and felicity a nussbaum autobiographical subject gender and ideology in eighteenth century england baltimore johns hopkins university press 1989 however as wollstonecraft scholar mitzi myers has made clear wollstonecraft manages to use this style of writing to articulate a stable and comprehensible self for reader increasingly confident in her ability as a writer she controls narrative and its effect on readers to a degree not matched in her other works she transforms individual sorrows of her trip such as dissolution of her relationship with imlay into stuff of gripping literature poovey 85 todd 368 sublimity thumb right alt painting of a raging waterfall surrounded by lush green trees and brown rocks waterfall by joseph anton koch 1796 wollstonecraft relies extensively on language of sublime in letters written in sweden norway and denmark she draws on and redefines edmund burke s central terms in a philosophical enquiry into origin of our ideas of sublime and beautiful 1757 burke privileges sublime which he associates with masculinity terror awe and strength over beautiful which he associates with femininity passivity delicacy and weakness while wollstonecraft ties sublime to sterility and beautiful to fertility for her beautiful is connected to maternal this aesthetic shift is evident for example in many passages focusing on affectionate tie between wollstonecraft and little fanny her daughter she thus claims feminine category of beautiful for most virtuous and useful of women mothers moskal 264 see also 277 78 wollstonecraft also revises conventional negative associations between sublime and death thoughts of death prompted by a waterfall for example lead her to contemplate rebirth and immortality as well reaching cascade or rather cataract roaring of which had a long time announced its vicinity my soul was hurried by falls into a new train of reflections impetuous dashing of rebounding torrent from

emotions this sublime object excited were pleasurable and viewing it my soul rose with renewed dignity above its cares grasping at immortality it seemed as impossible to stop current of my thoughts as of always varying still same torrent before me i stretched out my hand to eternity bounding over dark speck of life to come wollstonecraft holmes penguin 152 53 like her other manipulations of language of sublime this passage is also heavily inflected by gender as one scholar puts it because wollstonecraft is a woman and is therefore bound by legal and social restrictions placed on her sex in eighteenth century she can only envisage autonomy of any form after death moore 149 50 themes reason feeling and imagination thumb right alt painting of a man standing with his back to viewer he is

friedrich wanderer above sea of fog 1818 kunsthalle hamburg often categorized as a rationalist philosopher wollstonecraft demonstrates her commitment to and appreciation of feeling in letters written in sweden norway and denmark she argues that subjective experiences such as transcendent emotions prompted by sublime and beautiful possess a value equal to objective truths discovered through reason poovey 83 84 myers 167 in wollstonecraft s earlier works reason was paramount because it allowed access to universal truths in letters written in sweden norway and denmark however reason serves as a tool for reflection mediating between sensual experiences of world and an abstract notion of truth not necessarily universal truth maturation is not only acquisition of reason view wollstonecraft had adopted in original stories from real life 1788 but also an understanding of when and how to trust one s emotions poovey 85 86 see also myers 180 wollstonecraft s theories regarding reason emotion and imagination are closely tied together some scholars contend that wollstonecraft uses imagination to liberate self especially feminine self it allows her to envision roles for women outside traditional bounds of eighteenth century thought and offers her a way to articulate those new ideas myers 180 poovey 106 in contrast others view wollstonecraft s emphasis on power of imagination as detrimental imprisoning her in an individualized bourgeois desire which can never truly embrace sociality poovey 106 see also kaplan 239 favret has argued that wollstonecraft uses imagination to reconcile masculine understanding and female sensibility readers must imaginatively work while reading their efforts will save them from descending into sentimentality as well as from being lured into commercial speculation even more importantly readers become invested in story of narrator wollstonecraft s language demands that they participate in plot they rescue writer from villain they accompany her on her flight from sorrow with readers cooperation writer reverses standard epistolary plot here heroine liberates herself by rejecting her correspondent and by embracing world outside of domestic circle favret 112 in giving imagination power to reshape society a power suggested through numerous allusions to shakespeare s tempest wollstonecraft reveals that she has become a romantic favret 96 109 118 individual and society throughout letters written in sweden norway and denmark wollstonecraft ponders relationship between society and individual while her earlier works largely focus on society s failings and responsibilities in this work she turns inward explicitly arguing for value of personal experience todd 367 in advertisement for work also published as a preface she explains her role as hero of text in writing these desultory letters i found i could not avoid being continually first person little hero of each tale i tried to correct this fault if it be one for they were designed for publication but in proportion as i arranged my thoughts my letter i found became stiff and affected i therefore determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained as i perceived that i could not give a just description of what i saw but by relating effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings whilst impression was still fresh wollstonecraft holmes penguin 63 throughout book wollstonecraft ties her own psychic journey and maturation to progress of civilizations nations like individuals she maintains have as wollstonecraft scholar mary poovey describes it a collective understanding that evolves organically ripening gradually to fruition poovey 85 see also kelly 187 88 myers 166 however wollstonecraft still views civilization s tragedies as of concern than individual or fictional tragedies suggesting that for her sympathy is at core of social relations moskal 283 i have then considered myself as a particle broken off from grand mass of mankind i was alone till some involuntary sympathetic emotion like attraction of adhesion made me feel that i was still a part of a mighty whole from which i could not sever myself not perhaps for reflection has been carried very far by snapping thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as cruel experience of life stops or poisons current of heart wollstonecraft holmes penguin 69 70 nature wollstonecraft dedicates significant portions of letters written in sweden norway and denmark to descriptions of nature and her emotional responses to it one of her most effective tactics is to associate a set of thoughts and feelings with a specific natural formation such as waterfall passage quoted above nature wollstonecraft assumes is a common reference point between readers and herself therefore her letters should generate a sense of social sympathy with them poovey 88 kelly 189 90 many of letters contain these miniature romantic which illustrate wollstonecraft s ideas

a fate is thine thumb right alt left looking portrait of a woman wearing a blue dress trimmed with fur queen caroline of denmark by jens juel 1770s all of wollstonecraft s writings including letters written in sweden norway and denmark address concerns of women in eighteenth century society as in previous works she discusses concrete issues such as childcare and relationships with servants but unlike her more polemical books such as thoughts on education of daughters 1787 or rights of woman this text emphasizes her emotional reactions to nature and maternity yet she does not depart from her interest in promoting women s education and rights in letter 19 most explicitly feminist letter wollstonecraft anticipates readers criticisms still harping on same subject you will exclaim how can i

realization that she has always been forced to experience world as a woman it is defining feature of her sense of self poovey 89 jacobus 74 throughout letters written in sweden norway and denmark wollstonecraft comments on precarious position women occupy in society she defends and sympathizes with queen caroline of denmark for example who had been accused of licentiousness for her extra marital affair during her marriage to insane christian vii wollstonecraft herself had had unorthodox love affairs and an illegitimate child wollstonecraft describes this royal who was also a progressive social reformer as a woman of courage who tried to revolutionize her country before it was prepared jacobus 75 todd 368 swaab 25 26 such examples fuel wollstonecraft s increasing despair and melancholy at one point she laments fate of her daughter you know that as a female i am particularly attached to her i feel more than a mother s fondness and anxiety when i reflect on dependent and oppressed state of her sex i dread lest she should be forced to sacrifice her heart to her principles or principles to her heart with trembling hand i shall cultivate sensibility and cherish delicacy of sentiment lest whilst i lend fresh blushes to rose i sharpen thorns that will wound breast i would fain guard i dread to unfold her mind lest it should render her unfit for world she is to inhabit hapless woman what a fate is thine wollstonecraft holmes penguin 97 wollstonecraft s anger and frustration over secondary status afforded women compels her to define herself in antithesis to conventional images of femininity in first letter she proudly announces at supper my host told me bluntly that i was a woman of observation for i asked him men s questions emphasis wollstonecraft s wollstonecraft holmes penguin 68 see also myers 174 wollstonecraft casts female imagination as productive counterpoint to destructive masculine commerce a feat she achieves primarily through her use of genre of letter while rights of woman argued that women should be useful and productive importing language of market into home letters written in sweden norway and denmark adopts values of domestic space for larger social and political world favret 120 see also 96 127 commercialism although wollstonecraft spends much of letters written in sweden norway and denmark musing on nature and its connection to self a great deal of text is actually about debasing effects of commerce on culture she argues for example that damage done to hamburg and france by mercenaries and an increasingly commercial culture is far greater than damage caused by violence of french revolution writing that sword has been merciful compared with depredations made on human life by contractors and by swarm of locusts who have on pestilence they spread abroad wollstonecraft holmes penguin 195 see also todd 369 kelly 179 181 wollstonecraft believed that commerce mind and fostered a selfish disposition in its practitioners jacobus 67 poovey 93 myers 177 commerce should be she thought regulated by ideas of justice and fairness and directed toward ideals of independence and benevolence jones 53 wollstonecraft had become disenchanted with imlay not only because of his dismissive attitude towards her but also because of his greed throughout letters written in sweden norway and denmark she attaches criticisms of commerce to anonymous lover who has betrayed her a man ceases to love humanity and then individuals as he advances in chase after wealth as one clashes with his interest other with his pleasures to business as it is termed every thing must give way nay is sacrificed and all endearing charities of citizen husband father brother become empty names wollstonecraft holmes penguin 193 throughout text she contrasts constructive creative imagination with destructive commerce by associating commercialism with anonymous lover in text wollstonecraft was also directly censuring imlay who she believed cared more for his business speculations than for her and their child favret revolution and progress wollstonecraft spends several large sections of letters written in sweden norway and denmark speculating about possibilities of social and political revolution and outlining a trajectory for progress of civilization in comparing norway with britain and france for example she argues that norwegians are more progressive because they have a free press embrace religious toleration distribute their land fairly and have a politically active populace however her description of norway s golden age wollstonecraft holmes penguin 66 becomes less after she discovers that country has no universities or scientists taylor 169 70 in many ways norwegian society embodied british radical ideal of a small producer society its wealth sufficiently dispersed to ensure rough equality similar to what wollstonecraft had outlined in a vindication of rights of men 1790 after careful consideration of how to improve social and political problems in places she visited wollstonecraft came to conclusion that social progress must occur at a measured and natural rate she argues that each country has to find its own way to improve that democratic revolution cannot be foisted upon a people furniss 79 she believed that lower classes and yeomen were most promising potential source of revolutionary social transformation kelly 186 see also 181 implicit in her assessment however was a bourgeois condescension she viewed lower classes as a group separate from herself at one point describing their behavior as picturesque wollstonecraft holmes penguin 184 reception and legacy wollstonecraft was prompted to publish letters written in sweden norway and denmark

swaab 27 william godwin wollstonecraft s future husband wrote in his memoirs of author of a vindication of rights of woman that reading letters written in sweden norway and denmark caused him to fall in love with wollstonecraft if ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author this appears to me to be book she speaks of her sorrows in a way that fills us with melancholy and dissolves us in tenderness at same time that she displays a genius which commands all our admiration affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human and gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all romance of unbounded attachment connecting work to wollstonecraft s first novel mary a fiction 1788 he celebrates its sensibility and eroticizes condition of feminine sorrow for godwin work was an epistolary romance not a work of political commentary after wollstonecraft s death in 1797 godwin published her original letters to imlay destroying originals in process he deleted all references to contemporary political events and her business negotiations emphasizing romantic connection between two sets of letters favret contends that godwin wanted public to see wollstonecraft s affair as a sentimental romance akin to that between charlotte and werther in goethe s sorrows of young werther 1774 jacobus 65 todd 449 favret 130 31 for a woman a one year

period she adored god not as one whose interposing power is ever silently at work on grand theatre of human affairs causing eventual good to spring from present evil and permitting nothing but for wise and benevolent purposes but merely as first great cause and vital spring of existence letters written in sweden norway and denmark retreated from wollstonecraft s earlier focus on god as judge to god as mere creator shocking some conservative readers who were not prepared to accept anything akin to deism worried more about wollstonecraft s promotion of sensibility fellow feminist and author mary hays criticized book s swaab 21 27 a professor of moral philosophy thomas brown published a poetic response to book wanderer in norway 1816 rather than rejoicing in freedom that wollstonecraft argued connection between nature and emotion offered however brown represented her work as a failure and wollstonecraft as a tragic victim he read book as a cautionary tale whereas wollstonecraft had intended it as a description of possibilities of social and personal reform holmes 42 swaab 27 as favret argues almost all of responses to letters written in sweden norway and denmark placed narrator mary in position of a sentimental heroine while text itself with its fusion of sensibility and politics actually does much to challenge that image favret 128 after publication of godwin s memoirs which revealed and endorsed wollstonecraft s love affairs and illegitimate child her works were scorned by majority of public nevertheless book was to arouse a passion for travel among cultivated people in europe intrepid nineteenth century british female travel writers such as isabella bird and mary kingsley still read it and were inspired by wollstonecraft s pioneering efforts holmes 41
