of production of liman s previous film swingers liman decided to develop a film adaptation of novel after more than two years of securing rights to book from warner bros and a further year of screenplay development with screenwriter tony gilroy film went through two years of production bourne identity dvd commentary featuring doug liman 2003 universal pictures acquired film rights to ludlum s books in hopes of starting a new film franchise william blake herron was brought in to rewrite script in 1999 of particular inspiration were liman s father arthur liman s memoirs regarding his involvement in investigation of iran contra affair many aspects of alexander conklin character were based on his father s recollections of oliver north liman admitted that he jettisoned much of content of novel beyond central premise in order to modernize material and to conform it to his own beliefs regarding united states foreign policy however liman was careful not to cram his political views down audience s throat there were initial concerns regarding film s possible obsolescence and overall reception in aftermath of september 11 attacks but these concerns proved groundless casting liman approached a wide range of actors for role of bourne including brad pitt who turned it down to star in spy game as well as russell crowe arnold schwarzenegger tom cruise and sylvester stallone before he eventually cast damon liman found that damon understood and appreciated that though bourne identity would have its share of action focus was primarily on character and plot damon who had never played such a physically demanding role insisted on performing many of stunts himself with stunt choreographer nick powell he underwent three months of extensive training in stunt work use of weapons boxing and eskrima he eventually performed a significant number of film s stunts himself including hand to hand combat and climbing safe house walls near film s conclusion filming filming began october 31 2000 from onset of filming difficulties with studio slowed film s development and caused a rift between director and universal pictures as executives were unhappy with film s pacing emphasis on small scale action sequences and general relationship between themselves and liman who was suspicious of direct studio involvement a number of reshoots and rewrites late in development plus scheduling problems delayed film from its original release target date of september 2001 to june 2002 and took it 8 000 000 over budget from initial budget of 60 million screenwriter tony gilroy faxed elements of screenplay rewrites almost throughout entire duration of filming a particular point of contention with regard to original gilroy script were scenes set in farmhouse near film s conclusion liman and matt damon fought to keep scenes in film after they were excised in a third act rewrite that was insisted upon by studio liman and damon argued that though scenes were low key they were integral to audience s understanding of bourne character and film s central themes farmhouse sequence consequently went through many rewrites from its original incarnation before its inclusion in final product other issues included studio s desire to substitute montreal or prague for paris in order to lower costs liman s insistence on use of a french speaking film crew and poor test audience reactions to film s paris finale latter required a late return to location in order to shoot a new more action oriented conclusion to paris story arc in addition to paris filming took place in prague imperia rome mykonos and zurich several scenes set in zurich were also filmed in prague damon described production as a struggle citing early conflicts that he and liman had with studio but denied that it was an overtly difficult process stating when i hear people saying that production was a nightmare it s like a nightmare shooting s always hard but we finished liman s directorial method was often hands on many times he operated camera himself in order to create what he believed was a more intimate relationship between himself material and actors he felt that this connection was lost if he simply observed recording on a monitor this was a mindset he developed from his background as a small scale indie film maker birth of bourne identity dvd making of documentary 2003 acclaimed car chase sequence was filmed primarily by second unit under director alexander witt unit shot in various locations around paris while liman was filming main story arc elsewhere in city finished footage was eventually edited together to create illusion of a coherent journey liman confessed that anyone who really knows paris will find it illogical since few of locations used in car chase actually connect to each other liman took only a few of shots himself his most notable chase sequence shots were those of matt damon and franka potente while inside car

sequences describing them as kinetic fair and intelligent every payoff packaged with a moment s contemplation crucial to creation of tension and that movie could be understood as a clever subversion of genre charles taylor of salon com acclaimed film as entertaining handsome and gripping bourne identity is something of an anomaly among big budget summer blockbusters a thriller with some brains and feeling behind it more attuned to story and character than to spectacle and praised liman for giving film a tough mindedness that never gives way into cynicism or hopelessness ed gonzalez of slant magazine also noted doug liman s restrained approach to material as well as matt damon and franka potente s strong chemistry but ultimately concluded film was smart but not smart enough j hoberman of
