innings and 24 runs in second he passed fifty on just one occasion that season scoring 319 runs at an average of 16 78 and bowled 69 balls without taking a wicket nevertheless he played in university

cambridge victory over army and he scored a second against surrey remaining not out for 116 in a total of 359 bowling much more regularly his maiden wickets in first class cricket came in a performance of four wickets for 45 against yorkshire including wicket of len hutton yardley topped cambridge batting averages and played an effective innings of 90 in university match this display

stage but at end of august he made his debut for yorkshire first eleven appearing in county championship match against derbyshire he scored 12 in his only innings and took a wicket he played in a

but only took one wicket no official tests were played on tour but yardley played in representative matches which took place scoring 96 in first game but his highest score in four other innings was 31 honours continued to come yardley s way in 1938 season he was chosen to captain cambridge in his final season in team although his side did not win a match yardley enjoyed some personal success among his fifties were innings of 67 against touring australian team and 61 in university match he was included in different representative sides he was selected in a test trial playing for rest and played

in his last 10 innings blue dots indicate innings in which he finished not out by this stage yorkshire regarded yardley as heir to brian sellers as captain and england test selectors also began to prepare him to assume england captaincy at end of 1938 season yardley was chosen to tour south africa with mcc as vice captain to wally hammond gibson p 175 he made a good start to tour scoring centuries in his first two innings both surpassing his previous highest score wisden noted that he made a good impression on spectators in these early matches in his fourth match he captained mcc in hammond s absence for first time when len hutton was injured in a tour match and missed first test made his debut but scored just seven runs in a total of 422 and did not bat in second innings hutton returned for second match and successes of other batsmen meant that yardley was not required in other tests on tour however he scored a third century when he captained mcc against border having built up a reputation as one of best amateur cricketers in england yardley played three early season matches for mcc but he was selected for neither gentlemen nor for england that year he played his first full season for yorkshire scoring centuries against cambridge warwickshire and sussex in total he scored 1 086 runs at an average of 27 84 and took 17 wickets war brought first class cricket to an end

with just one century for yorkshire against nottinghamshire with ball he was used less frequently than before war and took only nine wickets he was not selected for any test matches but appeared for england in a test trial and scored 39 and 11 he also played twice for mcc and represented gentlemen against players making 29 and a duck in a heavy defeat for amateurs critics regarded his season as unsuccessful but he was chosen as vice captain to hammond on tour to australia that winter continuing his pre war role it was intended that yardley would appear lower down in batting order batting with a substantial total accumulated by previous batsmen however frailties of england batting meant he often appeared in a crisis and had to rebuild several innings bill bowes yorkshire and england bowler who covered tour as a journalist was impressed by yardley s approach noting that he did not back away from fast bowlers who frequently bowled bouncers at him in fact yardley played cricket with a determination we had never seen in yorkshire or in his days at university bowes p 186 he made greatest impression as a bowler surprising commentators with his effectiveness he did not bowl in first six matches but in his first over of tour dismissed arthur morris who had already scored a century from that point he was used effectively to break up partnerships in tests he removed donald bradman in three successive innings while in third test he took two wickets including bradman in two deliveries bowes believed natural length of yardley s bowling was perfect for australian pitches he was not skilful enough to alter length at which he bowled so his bowling in other conditions was less effective australian reporter clif cary wrote it was always amusing to watch englishmen when yardley took a wicket first time they seemed fairly amused but when he was regularly breaking partnerships their enthusiasm knew no bounds and it is said that in melbourne after he had obtained bradman s wicket for third time yardley blushed profusely when one excited team mate slapped him on back and shouted well bowled spofforth in tests yardley s only scores over fifty his first in test cricket came in third test where he scored 61 and 53 not out in england s first innings he helped his side to recover from a batting collapse surviving for two hours his second innings lasted 89 minutes and helped england to avoid defeat for first time in series in same match yardley bowled more overs than he had done previously on whole tour following injuries to bill voce and bill edrich two of england s main bowlers bowling leg theory with a fielders concentrated on leg side yardley managed to move ball off seam he dismissed bradman twice in match having figures of three for 67 in second innings and taking five wickets in match this was first time that an england player had scored fifty runs in both innings and taken five wickets in a test swanton pp 158 59 yardley also had substantial bowling workload in fourth test delivering 31 overs in australia s first innings to take three for 101 when hammond did not play in final test yardley became captain doing so courageously according to wisden which also pointed out that yardley used field placing more effectively than hammond in series yardley scored 252 runs at an average of 32 50 his ten wickets at an average of 37 20 placed him first in series bowling averages he played in drawn test on short tour to new zealand which followed opening batting scoring 22 and taking a wicket england captain thumb upright 1 2 yardley receiving massage in 1947 before a match against south africa yardley enjoyed his most successful season with bat in 1947 season scoring 1 906 runs at an average of 44 32 with five centuries his bowling took eleven wickets following hammond s retirement immediately after 1946 47 tour yardley captained england against south africa throughout season in first test he made his highest test score england were unexpectedly made to follow on in face of a large south african total when yardley came to crease in second innings england looked likely to be defeated at 170 for four still 155 runs behind tourists yardley scored 99 being caught in slips just before reaching his century but his batting had helped to save game and earned praise from wisden for batting soundly he eventually became first test captain to be dismissed for 99 in a test innings yardley and denis compton added 237 which was a record partnership for fifth wicket in england and remains in august 2010 england s best fifth wicket stand against south africa yardley s only other score over fifty in series came in drawn fifth test when he scored 59 however he scored 41 in just over an hour in helpful conditions for fast bowlers in third test and 36 on a difficult pitch in fourth test yardley scored 273 runs at an average of 39 00 in series in contrast to his efforts in australia he bowled just six overs in series without taking a wicket england won second third and fourth tests to win series helped by a negative approach from tourists yardley captained gentlemen against players for first time at lord s and scarborough and captained rest against middlesex county champions his batting and captaincy in season earned him selection as one of wisden s cricketers of year playing invincibles following brian sellers resignation yardley was appointed yorkshire captain at start of 1948 season woodhouse p 377 with his england commitments and other absences he only played in 12 county championship matches he had not toured west indies with mcc in 1947 48 when gubby allen captained side however yardley resumed his leadership of england when australia captained by bradman toured country without losing a match yardley led mcc in an early match against tourists and captained england in a test trial but only played three other games all for yorkshire before first test with a top score of 46 in first test england were bowled out for 165 after yardley won toss and batted in difficult conditions wisden did not blame yardley for collapse as england did not bat well he then set defensive fields to keep down australia s scoring rate taking a wicket himself with his fourth ball as part of figures of two for 32 australian batsmen found it difficult to score quickly against negative tactics but still established a lead of 344 yardley batted an hour in second innings to score 22 but australia recorded an eight wicket win before second test yardley played for yorkshire against australians and although unsuccessful with bat took two for nine with ball his first wickets of season for his county england adopted an aggressive strategy in second test but could not avoid a second defeat yardley frequently changed his bowlers to unsettle australians in their first innings and took two for 35 himself as england briefly held advantage bowes p 189 however lower order batsmen mounted a recovery yardley being criticised for his reluctance to bowl doug wright england captain then arrested a batting collapse by adding 87 with denis compton scoring 44 himself but australia led by 135 on first innings yardley took two wickets in two balls in australia s second innings narrowly missing a hat trick when keith miller only just got his bat down on ball to avoid being bowled and had figures of two for 36 but australia scored 460 for seven and bowled england out for 186 in between tests yardley scored his only century of season but his contributions to third test were minimal he scored 22 and bowled four wicketless overs however home side fought back in match for which len hutton was dropped england scored 363 and bowled out australia for 221 they scored 174 for three before declaring but rain intervened to prevent yardley pushing for a win england maintained their newly confident approach being on top for most of fourth test bowes pp 190 91 yardley s men scored 496 and achieved a first innings lead of 38 yardley contributing two wickets england increased their lead by 365 before yardley declared he kept team batting for five minutes on last day allowing him to use heavy roller to quicken break up of pitch australia had to score 404 in 345 minutes a target considered unlikely as such a large total had never been made to win a test match in addition pitch was difficult to bat on by now and spinners could turn ball sharply however england made several errors godfrey evans england wicket keeper had a bad day and missed some stumping chances three catches were dropped by fielders and england s only specialist spinner jim laker bowled poorly consequently yardley was forced to use denis compton s bowling compton was not a specialist bowler and although he caused problems for batsmen bill bowes believed selectors were mistaken in expecting him to be as effective as a front line spinner bowes p 191 yardley seemed unsure of best course of action as bradman and arthur morris added 301 runs for second wicket he resorted to using very occasional leg spin of hutton who was hit for 30 runs in four overs although yardley himself dropped a catch from hutton s bowling pitch conditions were unfavourable for faster bowlers but ineffectiveness of spinners forced yardley to take new ball gibson pp 188 89 australia won by seven wickets spectators were unhappy with inadequate english bowling and absence of a suitable bowler to exploit pitch on last day bowes later criticised yardley for allowing australia to score quickly enough to win he believed that yardley used hutton s bowling to encourage tourists to take risks against lesser bowling to keep up with required rate of scoring but he miscalculated in using such bowling for too long bowes pp 191 92 wisden also stated that england should have won match around this time and particularly after fourth test defeat critics suggested that walter robins one of selectors should captain england to bring a more attacking approach to job however robins age counted against him selectors were satisfied with yardley s captaincy in what were difficult circumstances and retained him for final test gibson p 139 in that match he failed twice with bat scoring 7 and 9 as england were humiliated bowled out for 52 and 188 to lose by an innings england lost series 4 0 yardley managed 150 runs at an average of 16 66 not passing fifty in a single innings however he once again topped england bowling averages taking nine wickets at an average of 22 66 bowes believed that pressure of captaincy had affected yardley s batting bowes also cast doubt on yardley s future stating that other commitments may have prevented his continuing to play cricket much longer bowes p 194 yardley s only other representative appearance in 1948 was as captain of gentlemen against players at lords where he scored 61 in whole season he scored 1 061 runs at an average of 29 47 and 14 wickets at an average of 35 14 he took just five wickets outside of tests captain of yorkshire yardley was unavailable to captain mcc tour of south africa in winter of 1948 49 which was led by george mann mann did well enough to retain position for two tests in 1949 season freddie brown captained other two and yardley did not play for england that year gibson pp 166 175 in all first class matches that season he scored 1 612 runs at an average of 37 48 and took 22 wickets at an average of 33 86 he did not score a century in county championship but passed three figures for yorkshire against new zealand touring team and for north against south in a festival match his only representative game outside of festival matches was for gentlemen against players at lord s mann was appointed captain for game that season yorkshire shared county championship with middlesex only time yorkshire won competition during yardley s leadership yardley s batting form dipped in 1950 season he scored 1 082 runs at an average of 24 59 final time he reached four figures in a season with ball he took 19 wickets at an average of 32 10 yorkshire finished third in county championship behind joint winners lancashire and surrey it took seven matches for yardley to reach fifty runs in an innings but he hit centuries against surrey somerset and scotland in second half of season west indies toured england and yardley resumed england captaincy he also captained mcc against tourists and england against rest in a test trial however neither yardley nor mann two likeliest candidates were able to accept captaincy of mcc side in australia that winter selectors spent much of season assessing other players although yardley represented gentlemen against players side was led by brown who scored a century and was appointed captain of touring side brown also assumed captaincy of england for final test against west indies and yardley was left out of team gibson pp 180 81 in three tests he played yardley scored 108 runs at an average of 18 00 with a top score of 41 he won first test but lost next two west indies first test wins in england final test was also lost by brown following this series yardley did not play any more tests although his name was mentioned as a potential captain in 1953 before hutton was appointed as england s first professional captain of twentieth century at time yardley was still considered best amateur candidate gibson pp 175 76 in 20 tests yardley scored 812 runs at an average of 25 37 and four fifties with ball he took 21 wickets at an average of 33 66 on fourteen occasions he was captain he won four times lost seven and drew three yorkshire finished second in county championship to warwickshire in 1951 season and second to surrey in 1952 season however in following season yorkshire dropped to equal twelfth their worst ever finish at that time in following two seasons team were again runners up surrey winning on both occasions yardley scored more than 850 runs in each season but only managed two more centuries these were 183 not out against hampshire in 1951 highest innings of his career and an unbeaten score of exactly 100 against gloucestershire in his final season his batting average was generally between 24 and 31 except in 1953 when in matches in england he averaged 36 53 yardley used himself as a bowler more often in 1951 and 1952 delivering more overs than any other time in his career in latter year he took 32 and 43 wickets respectively in each season his highest two season totals and taking five wickets in an innings on three occasions having only done so twice before however he bowled less often during his final three seasons with a subsequent drop in his tally of wickets his only representative cricket apart from annual matches at scarborough festival for gentlemen against players and occasionally for t n pearce s xi was gentlemen v players match at lord s in 1954 judgements were mixed on yardley s performance as yorkshire s captain his record would have been considered good at any other county but not by standards set by previous yorkshire sides critics felt that yorkshire should have won championship with players available contemporaries believed him to be best captain in country tactically taking reasonable chances without too many risks and judging players strengths and weakness trevor bailey who played against him for essex and under him for england wrote that he thought him an outstanding tactician and an expert on wicket behaviour he was unquestionably one of best captains i have ever played with or against it has been said that he was too nice to lead yorkshire but i cannot think of anybody i have preferred playing under bailey p 141 alan gibson believed that unlike some county captains yardley was worth his place in side on cricketing ability however he seemed unable to extract best from his players jim kilburn noted that he used orthodox tactics even when a different approach was called for while other critics believed that he was shocked by attitude of some difficult players in side neither yardley nor hutton his senior professional were disciplinarians in dressing room and kept apart from others both were frequently absent playing in representative matches this may have inflamed situation leading to accusations that some players were out of control yardley disliked confrontation and ray illingworth who played under him described him as too nice to stand up to his players but bob appleyard another of his former players gives yardley credit for recognising his potential and encouraging him to become a spinner and believes that he and hutton made a formidable pair of tacticians chalke and hodgson pp 33 127 generally he was popular with his players between 1951 and 1954 yardley served as a test selector serving as chairman in 1952 at time when hutton was chosen as england captain gibson p 184 following 1955 season aged 40 and increasingly bothered by lumbago yardley retired from team he ended his first class career with 18 173 runs at an average of 31 17 and 279 wickets at an average of 30 48 wisden later described him as finest yorkshire amateur since f s jackson style and technique yardley had a good technique for batting swanton p 159 he possessed a fluent attractive style and his height allowed him to reach ball and drive more comfortably than most his best shots were on leg side using his strong wrists to turn ball away when it was aimed towards his legs yardley performed best when his side was in difficulty and he could play attacking or defensive innings depending on situation chalke and hodgson p 127 he bowled intelligently leading to greater rewards than his gentle style led opponents to expect but remained a reluctant bowler who was surprised by his own success he was a good fielder in positions close to batsmen career after cricket yardley worked as a wine merchant outside cricket after his retirement from playing he worked as a cricket journalist and served as an expert summariser on test match special from 1956 until 1969 as well as in 1973 according to david frith only time he was moved to express severe disapproval was when brian close was dismissed after a poor shot in fourth test in 1961 at old trafford this was part of a final day england collapse that handed australia match and a 2 1 series win after hosts had been on course for victory and series lead trevor bailey who was a colleague in commentary box for later part of yardley s time with test match special wrote i always considered norman yardley to be an ideal summariser accurate informative and very sensible and able to explain not only what happened but also reasons why his knowledge about pitches tactics and technicalities of game was exceptional articulate expert and possessing considerable charge sic i thought his interpretation of events on field and his post session summaries were sound balanced and never less than fair bailey pp 223 224 he served on yorkshire cricket committee woodhouse p 378 and from 1981 he was yorkshire president however he became involved in controversy surrounding geoffrey boycott to whom committee had decided not to give a new contract yardley resigned early in 1984 after a vote of no confidence dismayed by attitude of boycott s supporters anthony woodhouse wrote in his history of yorkshire he conducted affairs in a fair and unbiased manner alas he should never have been burdened with politics of yorkshire cricket in 1980s he died at lodge moor sheffield on 3 october 1989 following a stroke
