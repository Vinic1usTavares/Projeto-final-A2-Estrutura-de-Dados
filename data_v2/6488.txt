play hordern p 138 writing about miller in his autobiography hordern stated it was one of most exhilarating and funny experiences i have had in theatre hordern pp 138 139 miller recruited frank middlemass to play fool croall p 64 but contrary to tradition miller made character an intimate of lear s as opposed to a servant something which shakespearean purists found difficult to accept hordern p 139 miller decided to further defy convention by concentrating on relationships between characters rather than adding detail to scenery and costume he was eager not to use lavish sets and lighting for fear of detracting from characterisations and sentimentality of storyline as such sets were bleak and costumes more so it was a style that was also used when play was televised by bbc later that decade when king lear played at old vic in 1970 reviews were mixed j w lambert thought that grey sets and hordern s grizzled costume were how shakespeare would have intended them to be

going on to say hordern s timing of silences from which snatches of demented wisdom emerge is masterly and illuminates subterranean processes of his derangement writing for times later that year theatre critic irving wardle described hordern s lear as a sharp peremptory pedant more a law giver than a soldier and as justice is an old man s profession still in prime of his life quote from irving wardle in november 1969 hordern p 140 hordern played lear once more that decade in 1975 which was televised by bbc for their series play of month willis p 127 jumpers playwright tom stoppard

george moore a bumbling old philosophy professor who is employed at a modern university and who throughout play is in constant debate with himself over his moral values hordern though thinking play was brilliant disliked script on initial read through as he did not understand its complex situations and strange dialogue his co star would be diana rigg who played moore s wife dotty and entire piece was to be directed by peter wood hordern p 133 jumpers was scheduled to appear at national theatre at start of 1972 but encountered problems when theatre s director laurence olivier called play unintelligible before walking out during first read through in disgust despite this rehearsals went ahead which cast found difficult play featured many scenes a complicated script and relied heavily on opening scene a sceptical speech about existence of god which lasted 13 minutes in his autobiography hordern commented each day my fists would sink into my cardigan pockets as i tried to make sense of it all hordern p 134 in a meeting shortly before opening night olivier complained to stoppard that play was overlong and in some parts laborious stoppard agreed to reduce epilogue by half decision angered hordern as it meant extra stress of learning a new script at short notice he vented his frustrations on wood who agreed to leave his character alone and instead to cut many of other scenes final dress rehearsal also experienced disruption when revolving stage broke down and had to be fixed half way through problems had ceased by opening performance following evening it was a night which hordern called unbelievable one of highlights of my career hordern p 135 actress maureen lipman who was in audience on opening night said that her husband playwright jack rosenthal had laughed so hard he thought he was going to be seriously ill quote from maureen lipman hordern p 135 critic michael billington writing in guardian gave a mixed review once or twice one of stoppard s brightly coloured balls falls to ground partly because michael hordern s moral philosopher substitutes academic mannerism for apprehension of argument but this is not to deny that hordern s simian habit of scratching his left with right hand or leaning over his desk as if he is doing intellectual press ups is very funny to watch or that he is brilliant at displaying cuckolded curiosity author quoting michael billington in guardian hordern p 135 harold hobson drama critic thought that failing to enjoy play was not actually a criminal offence but it is a sad evidence of illiteracy author quoting harold hobson hordern p 135 jumpers won evening standard s best play award which much to hordern s amusement was presented by philosopher a j ayer stripwell and voice work between 1973 and 1981 hordern appeared on radio for bbc as jeeves in series what ho jeeves alongside richard briers as bertie wooster what ho jeeves part 1 jeeves exerts old cerebellum bbc accessed 12 february 2016 in 1974 hordern narrated several other one off programmes for broadcaster including honest broker last tsar and tell king sky is falling in 1975 hordern played judge in howard barker s play stripwell at royal court theatre hordern described character as a man wracked by guilt full of self doubt and pessimism hordern p 143 it was a role which actor found to be too close to his own personality for comfort his time in play was marred by personal problems he and eve had briefly separated and actor was forced to rent a small flat in sloane square from actor michael wilding after being banished from family home hordern and eve soon reconciled but it was a time which he was keen to forget including play critics were complimentary of his performance with one writing ambiguities are therefore viewed half affectionately and half contemptuously and this comes over well in michael hordern s portrayal of bumbling sometimes endearing ineffectiveness as skilful and accomplished a performance as one would expect from this actor later in 1975 hordern narrated barry lyndon stanley kubrick s filmed adaptation of william makepeace thackeray s novel luck of barry lyndon barry lyndon 1975 british film

drama it s a bit like difference between roast beef and meringue both delicious in their way but there is nothing more satisfying than a thousand people sharing their laughter with you quote from

opposite alan rickman and zoe wanamaker hordern was oldest member of company and found it difficult to adjust to behaviour and attitudes of some of younger and less experienced actors he found it different from 1950s non intimate characterless and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors hordern p 144 writing in his 1993 autobiography hordern wrote being at stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn t often come into harbour you are at sea for long periods and away from rest of your service and if captain of your ship is a good one then ship is happy if not then commission you serve is very unhappy because you are a long way from land

his autobiography acting my life said he thought hordern interpreted role in a grand rather old fashioned way holm p 381 writing in his autobiography in 1993 hordern said he found part of gandalf to be a bit of a slog hordern p 183 hordern and jonathan miller reprised their collaboration in 1982 with a final performance of king lear again televised by bbc actor considered this version to be his best and attributed its success to fact he was getting older and therefore able to better understand character hordern p 140 author joseph pearce writing in 2008 claimed that hordern played king straight up with no gloss pearce p 240 and made a reliable and workmanlike lear who is forceful when he should be forceful compassionate when he should be compassionate and sorrowful when he should be
