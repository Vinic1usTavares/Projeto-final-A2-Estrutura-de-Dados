takahashi alt an image of hiroyuki takahashi during a 2005 interview golden sun games were created by takahashi brothers consisting of hiroyuki takahashi and shugo takahashi and produced by camelot software planning according to co creator shugo takahashi series was conceived as a way for nintendo to compete against sony s playstation console which dominated role playing game market at time as a handheld title golden sun was originally planned as a single game but due to both hardware limitations of putting entire game on a single game boy advance cartridge and developers own desire for what they wanted to do with game it was expanded to become two successive games golden sun and golden sun lost age takahashi brothers had previously designed shining force iii where story involved playing through perspectives of both good side and bad side of characters thinking that it was an effective way of conveying full story of a fictional game world they incorporated elements of this storytelling methodology into two game setup of golden sun series having player control good guys in golden sun and members of antagonistic party in lost age history originally camelot planned to create a single title instead of a series and in extremely early stages of their project they had created a game design document for one golden sun game to be on nintendo 64 console when it became apparent n64 was to be superseded by gamecube camelot shifted their focus to making a game on handheld game boy advance golden sun games generally have longer development cycles than their peer games on similar consoles due to series complex gameplay mechanisms and storylines golden sun first game in series underwent a development cycle of between twelve and eighteen months by camelot software planning which is considered a long period of time for development of a handheld video game and was described as a testament to positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game it was shown in early playable form at nintendo spaceworld expo in japan on august 2000 north american previewers received game a few weeks before release and ign noted that experience of developing shining force for sega helped camelot develop a gripping rpg for handheld lost age was first revealed to japan in early 2002 with magazine famitsu being first publication to review game lost age was highly anticipated it topped ign s list of game boy advance most wanted games for 2003 north american version of game was playable at electronic entertainment expo 2002 and ign noted that opening of game did away with slow opening sequence of golden sun introducing characters in between action gamespot previewed a localized copy of lost age in february 2003 and noted that game built on its predecessor s graphics engine with environments in game featuring rich detail with little touches such as birds that fly off as you approach golden sun dark dawn was first revealed and introduced at nintendo e3 2009 conference by nintendo of america president reggie fils aime as a series that went dark six years ago but has since been revisited and polished up for nintendo ds game received a larger development team than previous installments giving team luxuries such as visiting unesco world heritage sites for inspiration in an interview with nintendo gamer in june 2012 series producer hiroyuki takahashi spoke about possibility of a fourth golden sun game a big reason for us making rpgs comes from requests from all people who have enjoyed our rpgs in past perhaps if there are enough nintendo users asking for another game in golden sun series then this will naturally lead to development of such a game music series original music was composed by motoi sakuraba and his score for first game in his series was his first attempt at composing music for game boy advance new technology offered by console encouraged sakuraba to attempt new styles resulting in subtle rock influences in series music collection of orchestral pieces that sakuraba contributed to series include an overworld theme several battle themes that play during fight sequences and a variety of individual themes for games various towns and other locales sakuraba returned to score both lost age and dark dawn with latter released on a new platform with updated hardware according to sakuraba sound design for dark dawn was different and he preferred music in first two games he has also expressed a desire for an official soundtrack release of series music sakuraba also contributed songs to two games in super smash bros franchise among which two were adapted from his works in lost age and dark dawn in other media elements from golden sun games have made appearances in other media isaac main protagonist of original golden sun game is an unlockable assist trophy character in nintendo fighting game super smash bros brawl when he is summoned during battle by an assist trophy item isaac uses psynergy to conjure a large hand three times in succession to shove player s opponents off stage should enemies attempt to evade isaac will turn in sync to attack a selected opponent in addition a medley of music from lost age was selected to be on brawl s soundtrack game s sequel super smash bros for nintendo 3ds and wii u did not feature isaac but lost age medley was featured along with world map theme from dark dawn however super smash bros ultimate marks isaac s return to series as an assist trophy where he now is able to use more advanced tactics in battle and can now be fought and a costume inspired by him for mii was developed game also features characters from all 3 titles as spirits including adult isaac from dark dawn characters from first golden sun game also appear in a self published manga titled golden sun 4 koma gag battle drawn by various artists and published by it was released four months after first game came out and is not officially sanctioned by camelot as a result manga was only released in japan reception sales figures for golden sun series have decreased with each new installment original game sold 740 000 copies in united states and 338 000 in japan while lost age sold 437 000 and 249 000 units in united states and japan respectively by end of 2012 two years after its release dark dawn only sold 80 000 units in japan series was met with many positive reviews reviewers praised series vibrant graphics high quality sound and varied refined rpg gameplay with particular optimism on djinn based gameplay system and battle aspect despite fact that original two games were limited to 32 bit cartridge gamepro raved that golden sun was a huge fantastic creative and wickedly fun rpg that doesn t seem to care that it s just on a gba while they praised that lost age s eye popping magic effects are beautiful even by console standards ign meanwhile praised plot s intricate structure saying that it has been so tightly integrated into every ounce of adventure such a rich and deep plot that it s almost easy to get lost if you re not paying attention 1up praised dark dawn as being a huge step forward in terms of pacing and graphics compared to previous games critics complained that combat system lacked smart combat if an enemy is killed before other party members attack it those members switch to defense instead of intelligently attacking remaining enemies they also took issue to long opening sequences in both games that alienated new players and confused them by swamping them with new characters in addition some faulted golden sun for still relying on traditional wander around get into a random battle win battle wander around random battle etc theme evident in many role playing games 1up faulted camelot for being unwilling to trim its fat and noted that all three games in series tend to ramble on anytime dialogue boxes start to show up its heroes and villains have an uncanny knack for saying incredibly simple things with about three or four times words they actually need to convey those ideas game informer noted that difficulty of dark dawn was greatly dumbed down compared to previous installments and complained that characters level up at blazing speeds while djinn make even longest boss battles a cakewalk in 2001 golden sun won nintendo power award for best game boy advance game of year golden sun was ranked 94 and lost age was ranked 78 on ign s readers choice top 100 games ever in 2007 golden sun was named 24th best game boy advance game of all time in ign s feature reflecting on game boy advance s long lifespan and its
