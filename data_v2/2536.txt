meidob volcanic field is a holocene volcanic field in darfur sudan it is one of several volcanic fields in africa whose origin is explained with activity of mantle plumes and their interaction with crustal structures meidob lies at southern margin of sahara volcanic field is formed by overlapping lava flows which cover an area of and emanate from about 700 vents mainly scoria cones lava domes fallout and pyroclastic flow deposits are also common among vents is malha crater which presently contains a small lake volcanic field has erupted rocks ranging from basanite to trachyte and rises from a tectonic uplift known as darfur dome volcanic activity in meidob began 6 8 million years ago and continued into holocene with most recent eruptions dated to 4 900 520 years ago there are no geothermal manifestations at meidob but legends of local people imply that they witnessed volcanic eruptions in field name term meidob is derived from a nubian language where means slave it is also a misspelling of midob such as in meidob people which is actually midob people midob people live in meidob hills area geography and geomorphology meidob volcanic field lies in northern darfur and is part of northern sudan towns of bir harra ein and malha are near volcanic field while el is south southwest from it meidob volcanic field is one among several volcanic fields in northern africa such as al haruj cameroon line jebel marra and tibesti some of which are considered to be part of a northeast trending volcanic province meidob is a volcanic field which covers an area of in east west direction field consists of cones and lava flows which form a thick pile in middle of field in form of a plateau central area lies at higher elevations than peripheral parts of volcanic field and its maximum elevation is it features fallout and pyroclastic flow deposits in addition to cones and lava flows ignimbrites occur in some places lava flows are between several metres to several tens of metres thick and reach lengths of more than less eroded lava flows have surface features typical of aa lava and pahoehoe lava other lava flows constitute so called mesa flows such as jebel and jebel which are characterized by oval or circular shapes and steep flanks field has about 700 vents such as lava domes maars mesas tuff rings and most commonly scoria cones scoria cones are typically about high and wide at their base many lava flows originate in a scoria cone thumb southwestern corner of meidob volcanic field dark spot right of centre is lake in malha crater about thirty maars and craters are found in field including malha crater malha is a crater about deep and wide it has been excavated into basement rock beneath volcanic field and is itself surrounded by a rim less than high malha contains a salty lake in middle and several springs fed by an aquifer and in northeast side of malha crater a lava flow of jebel lava field has invaded crater depression there are other deep and wide craters in field besides malha hydrology southwestern and northern side of meidob volcanic field drain into wadi harra and subsequently into wadi magrur which flows northeastward when it carries water in present day most of wadis draining meidob northeastward such as wadi umm end in inland deltas in past wet periods they reached wadi magrur in turn wadi magrur discharged into wadi howar leading to development of wetlands geology mantle plumes and rifting processes are responsible for volcanism in northern africa in case of darfur dome volcanic fields such as jebel marra meidob and tagabo hills most likely explanation is a mantle plume location of volcanism triggered by this plume would be controlled more by tectonic stress field than by slow movement of african plate explaining why volcanism began between jebel marra and meidob and then continued in these two fields which are at opposite sides of dome alternatively an origin as an triple junction has also been proposed but it has been contested on because of a lack of evidence supporting it other proposals include presence of laccoliths volcanism elsewhere in northeast africa has also been attributed to red sea rift and afar hotspot local jebel marra and meidob lie on an uplifted basement known as darfur dome which consists of various igneous and metamorphic rocks of precambrian age neoproterozoic and paleozoic mesozoic sandstones including nubian sandstones these rocks in meidob are concealed beneath recent volcanic rocks but eruptions in field have carried large blocks of basement rock to surface and sediments are exposed in craters such as malha crater meidob volcanic field and jebel marra with their holocene eruptions are younger than jebel kussa and tagabo hills which are of oligocene pleistocene and miocene age respectively erosion has exposed their features oldest volcanic activity in region has been dated to 36 million years ago at jebel kussa tectonic lineaments control both position of vents and that of dry valleys in field there are both northeast southwest east west and northwest southeast trends in order of decreasing importance these lineaments have been active at different times indicating changes in regional tectonic stress field composition meidob volcanic field has erupted basalt basanite hawaiite as well as mugearite phonolite and trachyte forming an alkaline suite of volcanic rocks various types of xenoliths are present in eruption products while phenocrysts include amphibole augite biotite magnetite nepheline olivine pyroxene and sanidine total volume of erupted rocks is about which was erupted at rates of basalt and basanite lava flows make up most of erupted material pyroclastics and lava flows of and trachytic composition form mesa flows and are concentrated in central part of field more differentiated rocks are prevalent in more recent rocks basanite is a product of mantle melts which may involve a lithospheric component fractionation processes in deep magma chambers and assimilation of crustal materials have been used to explain genesis of differentiated magmas from precursor with additional processes generating basaltic and magmas climate and vegetation average yearly temperatures at malha range between meidob volcanic field lies at southern margin of sahara to sahel with precipitation at malha amounting to mostly during summer months during early holocene between 6 000 and 12 000 years ago precipitation was considerably higher and orographic precipitation in meidob area may have supplied water to their surroundings lava fields are mostly barren with vegetation of meidob volcanic field consisting of grasses and scrubs woodland grows along course of wadis and sometimes within craters eruption history oldest volcanic rocks in meidob volcanic field have been dated by potassium argon dating yielding ages of 6 8 0 2 and 6 5 0 2 million years ago jebel vent has yielded ages of 1 3 0 4 to 0 6 0 2 million years ago volcanism at first took form of lava emissions later during pliocene to holocene it was dominated by pyroclastics and lavas field has been active during holocene with thermoluminescence and tephrochronology dating giving ages of 14 600 6 600 12 200 3 300 10 100 1 400 at malha crater 8 000 1 600 7 200 720 4 150 1 450 bce possibly 3 050 bce and 3 000 bce and 4 900 520 years ago for eruptions one of these recent eruptions had an intensity similar to a plinian eruption and a volcanic explosivity index of 4 has been assigned to some eruptions there are no fumaroles in field while hot springs may or may not exist but legends of midob recall that many generations ago fire erupted from malha crater and that water levels within its lake underwent changes accompanied by sounds these legends may reflect recent volcanic activity non volcanic history apart from volcanism aeolian processes and water erosion were active in meidob producing widespread sedimentary covers especially at margins of field a number of wadis extend radially away from centre of meidob volcanic field and carry water during flash floods transporting sediment and floating pumice winds transport sediments onto old lava flows and volcanic landforms but owing to its youth many landforms of midob volcanic field are little eroded during early and middle holocene a number of craters contained lakes some of these have left sediments and were populated by ostracods living in freshwater formation of these lakes began about 12 100 years before present at malha 8 290 before present at malha to episodes of partial or complete dry up occurred first about 7 000 years before present and second 2 300 2 200 years before present today only malha crater still contains a body of water human use meidob volcanic field was likely used as a source of obsidian and fur people obtained salt from malha crater this crater is an oasis and was also a source of water for midob people
