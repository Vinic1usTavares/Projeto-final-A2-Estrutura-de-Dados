madonna s sixth concert tour re invention world tour which was highest grossing tour of 2004 earning 125 million tour was chronicled in documentary i m going to tell you a secret which led to madonna s first live album of same name background and development during early 1990s madonna had focused on a number of provocative releases like erotic pictorial book sex sadomasochist inspired album erotica and erotic thriller body of evidence all of which she deduced was due to a lot of rage and anger within herself however by beginning of new millennium madonna was living a calmer more introspective and wholesome life with her husband guy ritchie their son rocco and madonna s daughter lourdes from a previous relationship according to biographer j randy taraborrelli presence of ritchie in madonna s life had a calming effect on singer making her more matured and easing her temper concentrating on her music career madonna was busy throughout 2001 on her drowned world tour on september 11 2001 suicide bombers hijacked two jet airliners and crashed into world trade center resulting in death of nearly 3 000 people event had a profound effect on american society with cultural mood being bleakness and paranoia people including madonna started asking questions about their culture and american dream which had been a long lasting ideal for many when madonna started working on her ninth studio album american life she wanted answers to her queries and an appropriate response to 9 11 disaster and ensuing iraq war of 2003 she believed that ensuing months with war would lead to a politically charged atmosphere throughout country and wanted to express that in record like her 2000 studio album music madonna enlisted help of french dj and producer mirwais ahmadzai always interested in adapting herself and her music to contemporary compositions madonna was inspired by new massive attack and lemon jelly albums we set out to put two worlds of acoustic and electronic music together said madonna adding it is another step on but i ve never wanted to repeat myself i don t ever want to repeat myself or make same record twice american life became madonna s final studio album with maverick records and marked end of an eleven year recording history with label in an interview with vh1 titled madonna speaks singer discussed her 20 years in music industry and revealed her motivations behind american life about material things being unimportant i have lots of material things and i ve had lots of beliefs about things and what s important and i look back at 20 years behind me and i realized that a lot of things that i d valued weren t important she concluded discussing her thoughts on conception of album she told q magazine that through her 20 years of being in entertainment industry she would have a correct opinion on fame and fortune and its perils which would be base of album writing and inspiration thumb madonna performing promotional single nobody knows me during re invention world tour in 2004 alt image of a blonde woman she is wearing a yellow sparkling corset with black shorts and black knee high boots she has her left arm pointing forward she s standing in front of a blue backdrop when madonna started writing songs on album she was inspired by different situations like having guitar lessons and getting an idea or sometimes ahmadzai would send over a rough demo to her without basic chord progression songs on american life and their lyrics were developed like that explaining her writing process madonna told q magazine that music has to jar my brain in terms of lyrics sometimes i write free verse i have a journal and i note down ideas i get from newspapers and books madonna also remembered ahmadzai s downbeat existentialism regarding condition of society around them and long discussions they had into night which ultimately reflected into songwriting as anxiety they felt in their heart american life was deemed by some as a concept album featuring political themes based around united states with madonna explaining that she felt like america has changed over years and that a lot of our values seem to be materially oriented and so superficial and we all seem to be obsessed with fame just for sake of fame no matter what sell your soul to devil if that s what it takes and we re also completely obsessed with way we look madonna recalled that even she had been through such trials and those musings came out in writing of first three songs title track hollywood and i m so stupid john norris from mtv described them as a trilogy and an indicator of madonna s reassessment of her life while discussing things she wishes to put behind her madonna partly agreed saying that tracks are extensions of one another and portray her desire of giving importance to less noteworthy things and how she could come out of that illusion madonna discussed materialistic themes of record and her personal encounters which have led to composition with mtv saying who better to say those things don t matter than somebody who s experienced them people may say how can you say they don t matter how can you say that money won t bring you happiness if you don t have a lot of money how can you say that fame and fortune are not a guarantee for happiness and joy and fulfillment in your life you have to have that experience to know cause you have all those things i ve had all those things and i ve had nothing but chaos around me so i m just sharing what i know with world cause i do think that we ve become completely consumed with being rich and famous our society has and i just want to tell people take it from me i have all those things and none of them ever brought me one minute of happiness glamorous world of hollywood also reflected in her writing especially in second track of same name describing it as a metaphor madonna said that in hollywood you can lose your memory and your vision of future you can lose everything because you can lose yourself beginning of album cleared away what was not important for her so madonna could concentrate on things that did matter so in contrast to first three tracks later songs on american life also deal with issues close to singer s heart like talking about her relationship with her parents on track mother and father when madonna was five her mother died of breast cancer and track was a way of letting go of sadness and moving on according to lucy o brien author of madonna like an icon another concept of american life was about nothingness this was evident in titles of songs like nobody knows me usage of no in love profusion as well as nothing fails usage of negative tone led madonna to be sarcastic on people s assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love but nothing fails along with tracks intervention and x static process became centerpiece of album as a triptych of love songs for ritchie beginning as a humble track that musician producer guy sigsworth wrote for his wife nothing fails also has lyrics by singer jem archer who was asked to collaborate with sigsworth and madonna during first collaborative sessions of american life track is followed by folk inspired intervention and x static process both being reflective and emotional her reflective mood continued with last track easy ride which was inspired by imagery of a full circle and symbolized life for singer recording and mixing album was mostly composed and entirely produced by madonna and ahmadzai both had previously collaborated on madonna s studio album music 2000 recording sessions for american life started in late 2001 then was put on hold as madonna filmed swept away in malta and starred in west end play up for grabs she returned to olympic recording studios and sarm west studios in late 2002 and finished off sessions in london and los angeles in early 2003 for instrumentation featured in some of songs ahmadzai played guitars and stuart price played piano tom hannen and simon changer both of them worked as assistant engineer during recording thumb left olympic recording studios in london was one of locations where american life was recorded unlike music madonna had enlisted ahmadzai also as a songwriter on american life hence what transpired was madonna s wholesale adaptation of producers style and sound he explained that there are some influences from his work but madonna mostly wanted a minimalist structure for album this was beneficial for him since he did not like working with a lot of people and hence it became a close collaboration since electronic music was already popular ahmadzai felt that it was necessary to go back to its underground roots and focus on songwriting rather than technical aspects of recording and mixing describing it as modified songwriting he said that although concept might sound simple at first even rough but when you pay attention there is a lot of technology underneath this approach was an imperative for american life recorded at three different studios using ahmadzai s own gear along with studio s ssl mixing consoles album s recording process was often laborious but was sparse in musical arrangements of songs about musical composition ahmadzai told to remix magazine that they tried to under produce many tracks to make them sound rougher than average international pop production we wanted to do something totally modern and futuristic but not very apparent you have to be very minimalist and choose every sound very carefully some tracks were composed in big studio that can be very dangerous because you can lose perspective but all initial directions of tracks were made in my home studio american life is suffused with ahmadzai s characteristic production techniques like stuttering instruments and vocals oscillating loop tones recalling 1950s sonar pulses morphing vocals consisting of grunts and squeals and treatments that make music freeze in between rhythms producer hoped that using stuttering would become a rage in future world of recording he believed that people think it is not natural to skip and stutter music but he used it to create a new groove with help of pro tools he froze audio at any point he wanted to change rhythm of tracks madonna discussed recording of title track stating that ahmadzai had encouraged her to rap spontaneously about all materialistic objects that she herself had been using and doing they had an instrumental breakdown in american life where producer encouraged madonna to add a rap about her everyday life because i was always drinking soy in studio and i drive my mini cooper to studio i was just like ok let me just talk about things that i like so i went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first but i got out all my thoughts and then i wrote everything down that i said and then i perfected timing of it so it was totally spontaneous she added thumb 300px a nord lead synthesizer was initially used for recording hollywood but ahmadzai faced problems with it for hollywood he used a drum kit and percussion from an e mu emulator and also added extra drum sounds to give song an old disco vibe wanting to have a loud bass synth sound ahmadzai used a nord lead synthesizer with lot of filtering manipulations but he faced problems with it so he used a yamaha mixer he did not want hollywood to sound like music being played at nightclubs so he recorded madonna s vocals with heavy compression in her headphones two machines were used for vocal editing in hollywood madonna preferred antares auto tune plug in while ahmadzai chose an ams pitch shifter madonna wanted auto tune because she wanted hollywood to have a more dance like feel to it although ahmadzai was against it track i m so stupid had gentle vocals then singing was frozen using a roland vp 9000 when madonna sings vocals freeze and process sounds natural but in reality is not when it came to adding beats he experimented by programming drums in logic pro and changing timing of beats producer combines different samples of songs from his own collections and keeps on trying until something new is developed mixing for tracks was done by mark spike stent at westlake recording studios at west hollywood california while tim young did mastering of songs at metropolis studios in london michael colombier did string arrangement with geoff foster acting as strings engineer conducting at air studios music and lyrics slant magazines sal cinquemani stated that madonna couldn t possibly have intended to make a pop album american life is a folk album in purest definition of term and it s reflected right in title greg kot from chicago tribune called record an electro folk album with electronic beats and synthetic priya elan of nme described album as folktronica american life title track is first song on record starting with madonna s multi tracked voice questioning am i gonna be a star should i change my name lyrics then develop into what rikky rooksby of complete guide to music of madonna states as a complaint about modern day life lyrics accompany a punchy octave synth figure synchronized with a drum and bass beat after three minutes of song madonna performs a rap naming people who were working for her second track and single hollywood is introduced with sounds of tweeting birds before an acoustic guitar starts with a four chord sequence that has been compared to songs by band red hot chili peppers texture grows with addition of drums and synths until after a minute instrumental is pulled out leaving just madonna s vocals and acoustic guitar accompaniment where she alludes to beatles norwegian wood during final sequence madonna raps as is featured in first song with repeated phrase push button lyrically like first track it discusses american culture and greed focusing on hollywood california as a place of stars and illusory dreams next track i m so stupid features an introduction with a two chord electric guitar which leads to a minor drum beat with guitar later changing to a three chord composition throughout is generally minor but at 2 15 mark different pitched synths change and towards end synths become less prominent as guitars become main focus lyrically song expresses disillusionment with madonna singing i used to live in a fuzzy dream and it was just greed also proclaiming that once she was stupider than stupid before stating everybody s stupid towards end of song fourth track love profusion starts with another acoustic guitar introduction with rhythm being produced by a bass drum with synth strings added later in song vocally line i got you under my skin is repeated while a male voice acts as backing for track as final words feel good are performed with no backing instrumental nobody knows me is fifth track featuring vocoder treated vocals song is accompanied by synths and a heavy drum part title is repeated throughout song as she references social disease which is also repeated a recurring theme of american life is acoustic guitar introduction to songs and is yet again featured in sixth track nothing fails guitar is accompanied by a light drum section and low pitched vocals from madonna song also features a cello in first part and a church choir in second part lyrically song discusses a lover who is one and how their meeting was not just chance a reference to tree of life is made during song as madonna states i m not religious but she wishes to pray acoustic guitars introduces seventh track intervention it starts with a three chord minor sequence which changes to a four chord one during chorus section and a bass section starts at end of track lyrically song is an optimistic track about how a relationship will last as madonna says road looks lonely but that s just satan s game x static process eighth track starts once again with acoustic guitars and throughout there are vocal harmony lines in addition to an organ part lyrically like title track it questions modern life as madonna sings jesus christ will you look at me don t know who i m supposed to be mother and father is album s ninth track with a drum and bass beat paired with an electric guitar present in instrumental lyrically song reflects on madonna s childhood including her mother s death and her father s reaction and effect on their relationship tenth track is die another day theme to james bond film of same name which featured dominating string and synth parts eleventh and final track on album easy ride is a heavily string oriented song it addresses madonna s feelings towards old age wanting to live forever and coming full circle to a point in her life where she could be comfortable artwork and release by 2003 madonna suggested that she was in a revolutionary mood which led to journalistic discussions that another image makeover would take place for her still recovering from commercial disappointment of swept away madonna changed her image completely to resemble that of a fighter with inspirations from pictures of argentinian guerrilla leader che guevara french design team m m paris michael amzalag and mathias augustyniak were responsible for artwork of american life duo are best known for their collaborations with musicians and madonna hired duo after discussing concept for just six

that goes for whole album current moment i feel a revolutionary state of mind author santiago fouz hernandez wrote in his book madonna s drowned worlds new approaches to her subcultural transformations that inclusion of guevara as an inspiration for cover was one of many instances of madonna incorporating hispanic identity and latino subculture in her work album cover was also compared to an infamous 1970s photo of kidnapped newspaper heiress patty hearst cover also had military styled stenciled lettering title american life is written in blood red color and has a punk rock style inside cd booklet she wielded an uzi submachine gun her body in various martial art poses spelling out her name by late 2003 she had wiped out military image completely and followed with another subtle toned down image of that of a writer and philanthropist in an interview with larry king in october 2002 she said that she wanted to give album a hebrew name madonna then considered ein sof which means endlessness as a possible title for album however as months went on and album became more of a meditation on difficulty of leading a spiritual life in glamour industry title was changed to hollywood with madonna saying that it was a reflection of my state of mind and a view of world right now still she was not satisfied with name and finalized on american life american life is madonna s

chronicled tour was released in 2005 critical reception american life received mixed reviews from music critics holding a score of 60 100 on music review website metacritic based on 17 professional reviews billboards michael paoletta noted lyrical differences from past albums such as ray of light positively saying american life relies less on spiritual introspection and more on woman in mirror confrontation entertainment weeklys ken tucker generally responded well saying that at its best album offers blunt questing and decisive music but weakest point was madonna sounding like a girl who s grown content with her husband and kids and ability to hire help to do her bidding dimitri of vibe magazine gave a positive review for american life saying that madonna stayed still in album and commenting that this may be first time madonna hasn t pushed herself to explore new ground but at least she s chosen a good place to rest sal cinquemani from slant magazine gave album a mixed review stating that american life is not a masterpiece compared to her 1992 studio album erotica it s frequently self indulgent misguided unpleasant difficult to listen to silly and humorless but it s also consistent uncompromising and unapologetic cinquemani opined ending with deduction that american life stood for last time madonna made music without primary objective of making a hit giving album three out of five stars ben ratliff from rolling stone summarized that messages on album are dour but complimented madonna for talking about then current situation of nation johny davis from nme gave album a rating of seven out of ten saying that technically album sounds good but overall it felt like an unnecessary sequel to madonna s previous endeavors like ray of light and music allmusic s stephen thomas erlewine stated that american life is better for what it promises than what it delivers and that it is better in theory than practice kelefa sanneh from blender awarded album three stars out of five just as disjointed as music and much more severe without a compelling back story her songs seem diminished dorian lynskey from q magazine also rated it three out of five stating nothing fails album s centerpiece is as good a showstopper as live to tell but it s no wonder that a record about feeling confused ends up sounding confused jon pareles from new york times felt that madonna tried to be honest with concept of american dream in album but ended up producing songs akin to folkie psychobabble of songwriters like jewel james from spin compared album s introspective themes to her previous albums ray of light and music and also noted madonna spends much of american life bemoaning emptiness of celebrity culture alexis petridis of guardian responded well to parts of record saying american lifes best tracks make a mockery of virtually all other current pop music however his conclusive point in review was that there was not enough of good songs village voices jessica winter called madonna s voice redundant and commented that she american dream only to pitch woo at her english husband and articulate a vague yet fiery frustration with her outrageously privileged station in world ed howard from stylus magazine gave album a negative review calling album about madonna instead of american culture explaining it s madonna who surprisingly has simply run out of things to say bbc s ian young also gave a negative review saying that tunes are bland and weak lyrics are uninspired and self absorbed and semi ibiza backing music is bare and recycled and we are convinced that she has lost it american life also achieved award nominations in 2004 american life was nominated at 46th grammy awards in two categories best short form music video and best dance recording both for song die another day it was also nominated for best video from a film at 2003 mtv video music awards at hungarian music awards of 2004 and 2005 album was nominated both times in
