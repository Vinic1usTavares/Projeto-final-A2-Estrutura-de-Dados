digital media theorist peter lunenfeld described cameron as one of those people for whom art was life and life was art and thus an understanding of her life is needed to appreciate her work cameron s occult beliefs strongly affected her artworks according to priscilla frank writing for huffington post cameron s artwork merges crowley s occult with surrealism and symbolism of french poets yielding dark yet whimsical depictions buzzing with otherworldly power art curator philippe vergne described her work as being on edge of surrealism and psychedelia embodying an aspect of modernity that deeply doubts and defies cartesian logic at a moment in history when these values have shown their own limitations lunenfeld compared cameron s black and white pen and ink drawings to those of english artist aubrey beardsley noting that she was capable of a ferocious paradoxical line work simultaneously precise and seductively unrestrained that functions as both figurative depiction and unabashed emotional talisman he believed that both passion and craft could be seen in her draughtsmanship but that it also displayed a guilelessness that is hard to relate to in our post post ironic moment he

alejandro jodorowsky cameron s biographer spencer kansa was of opinion that cameron exhibited parallels with australian artist and occultist rosaleen norton both in terms of her physical appearance and similarities between their artistic styles harrington also saw similarities in work of cameron and artists leonora carrington and leonor fini on website of cameron parsons foundation michael duncan expressed view that cameron s work rivals that of fellow surrealists like carrington fini remedios and colquhoun while also appearing prescient of works by later artists kiki smith amy cutler karen and hernan bas in later years cameron would often be erroneously labelled a beat artist because she inhabited many of same social circles as prominent beat poets and writers rejecting this label
