on this as she motors off at end of book continuing her tour of america but despite officer s warning still devoted to memory of spy who loved her characters and themes continuation bond author raymond benson sees vivienne michel as best realised female characterisation undertaken by fleming partly because story is told in first person narrative academic jeremy black notes that michel is closest fleming gets to kitchen sink realism in bond canon she has been a victim of life in past but is wilful and tough too other characters in novel are given less attention and vivienne s second lover kurt is a caricature of a cruel german who forces her to have an abortion before finishing their affair according to black two thugs sluggsy and horror are comic book villains with comic book names their characters are not given same status as other villains in bond stories but are second rate professional killers which makes them more believable in story as with casino royale question of morality between bond and villains is brought up again by bond but also by police officer involved benson argues that this runs counter to another theme in novel which had also appeared in a number of other bond books including goldfinger concept of bond as saint george against dragon in this black agrees who sees spy who loved me as being an account of vulnerable under challenge of manipulative nature of individuals and of possibility of being trapped by evil background thumb right 200px goldeneye where fleming wrote all bond novels including spy who loved me spy who loved me was written in jamaica at fleming s goldeneye estate in january and february 1961 and was shortest manuscript fleming had produced for a novel being only 113 pages long fleming found book easiest for him to write and apologised to his editor at jonathan cape for ease spy who loved me has been described by fleming biographer andrew lycett as fleming s most sleazy and violent story ever which may have been indicative of his state of mind at time fleming borrowed from his surroundings as he had done with all his writing up to that point to include places he had seen one such location was a motel in adirondacks in upstate new york which fleming would drive past on way to ivar bryce s black hollow farm this became dreamy pines motel similarly he took incidents from his own life and used them in novel vivienne michel s seduction in a box in royalty kinema windsor mirrors fleming s loss of virginity in same establishment a colleague at sunday times robert harling gave his name to a printer in

artist richard chopping once again undertook cover art and raised his fee from 200 guineas he had charged for thunderball to 250 guineas artwork included a commando knife which was borrowed from fleming s editor michael howard at jonathan cape spy who loved me was published in us by viking books on 11 april 1962 with 211 pages and costing 3 95 reception to novel was so bad that fleming wrote to michael howard at jonathan cape to explain why he wrote book i had become increasingly surprised to find my thrillers which were designed for an adult audience being read in schools and that young people were making a hero out of james bond so it crossed my mind to write a cautionary tale about bond to put record straight in minds particularly of younger readers experiment has obviously gone very much awry fleming subsequently requested that there should be no reprints or paperback version of book and for british market no paperback version appeared until after fleming s death because of heightened sexual writing in novel it was banned in a number of countries in us story was also published in stag magazine with title changed to motel nymph reviews broadly critics did not welcome fleming s experiment with bond formula academic christoph linder points out that spy who loved me received worst reception of all bond books daily telegraph for example wrote oh dear oh dear oh dear and to think of books mr fleming once wrote while glasgow herald thought fleming was finished his ability to invent a plot has deserted him almost entirely and he has had to substitute for a fast moving story sorry misadventures of an upper class tramp told in dreary detail writing in observer maurice richardson described tale as a new and regrettable if not altogether unreadable variation going on to hope that this doesn t spell total eclipse of bond in a blaze of richardson ended his piece by berating fleming asking why can t this cunning author write up a bit instead of down critic for times was not dismissive of bond who they describe as less a person than a cult who is ruthlessly fashionably efficient in both love and war rather critic dismisses experiment writing that novel lacks mr fleming s usual careful construction and must be written off as a disappointment john fletcher thought that it was as if mickey spillane had tried to gatecrash his way into romantic novelists association philip stead writing in times literary supplement considered novel to be a morbid version of that of beauty and beast review noted that once bond arrives on scene to find michel threatened by two thugs he solves problem in his usual way a great quantity of ammunition is expended zip fastener is kept busy and customary sexual consummation is associated with kill stead also considered that with words of police captain mr fleming seems to have summarized in this character s remarks some of recent strictures on james bond s activities vernon scannell as critic for listener considered spy who loved me to be as silly as it is unpleasant what aggrieved him most however was that worst thing about it is that it really is so unremittingly so grindingly boring critic for time lamented fact that unaccountably lacking in spy who loved me are high stake gambling scene meal ordering scene torture scene battleship grey bentley and blades club critic also bemoaned fact that among shocks and disappointments 1962 still has in store is discovery that cruel handsome scarred face of james bond does not turn up until more than halfway through ian fleming s latest book anthony boucher meanwhile wrote that author has reached an unprecedented low not all reviews were negative esther howard wrote in spectator surprisingly ian fleming s new book is a romantic one and except for some early sex in england rather well done this only just as nasty as is needed to show how absolutely thrilling it is for narrator to be rescued from both death and worse than by a he man like james bond
