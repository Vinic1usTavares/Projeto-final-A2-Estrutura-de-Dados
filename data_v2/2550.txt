received game holds an aggregate score of 91 out of 100 on metacritic based on ten reviews combination of puzzles and gameplay drew praise from critics who indicated that game builds upon qualities found in dark forces user control of game was praised especially control of lightsaber game was compared positively with doom a significant game in first person shooter genre gameplay did not escape criticism however with tom chick of ign criticising layout of levels levels can be awfully linear throwing you up against some frustrating brick walls where you don t know where to go or what you re supposed to do next there are some bald key hunts artificial intelligence of hostile npcs received mixed reactions gamespot s ron dulin praised ai saying that they help suspension of disbelief chi kong lui of gamecritics com however gave opposite view enemy artificial intelligence is still pretty mindless and blasting them doesn t require much skill jedi knights graphics received mixed reviews critics stated non 3d accelerated version of game looks poor game revolution s calvin hubble argued that game only really looks good if played on a system with a powerful 3d card other graphical aspects received praise character animations were considered more detailed than similar games graphical presentation of levels received specific praise from ign no other first person shooter has come close to jedi knights dizzying sense of scale and its vast levels full motion video sequences between levels received both praise and criticism next generation reviewed pc version of game rating it five stars out of five and stated that game has little to no faults one could nitpick about overacting or rushed look of menu interface but in end jedi knight is to first person shooters what sliced bread is to wheat products use of john williams soundtrack from star wars films was met with praise though one reviewer believed that music is overused in star wars video games sound effects were also lauded and seen as providing a good atmosphere for game in particular lightsaber sound and its implementation addition of a multiplayer mode to jedi knight was met positively but questions arose to why there are so few multiplayer maps and why single player maps cannot be used in multiplayer mode tom chick of ign believes this was corrected with release of mysteries of sith editors of computer games strategy plus named jedi knight best first person action game of 1997 jedi knight won computer gaming worlds 1997 game of year award editors wrote as did diablo year before jedi rose above crowd
