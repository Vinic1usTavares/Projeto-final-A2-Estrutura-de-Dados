kenner company and also in greeting cards by elena they starred in two syndicated television specials from a canadian animation studio atkinson film arts of ottawa care bears in land without feelings 1983 and care bears battle freeze machine 1984 after specials toronto s nelvana studio produced first care bears movie in less than eight months it was distributed in united states by samuel goldwyn company an independent outfit and grossed us 22 9 million at north american box office largest amount for a non disney animated film at time this success guaranteed production of a second film which was in consideration by may 1985 as with original production took place at nelvana s facilities and taiwan s wang film productions canadian studio also hired south korean personnel to handle inking and painting this time over one hundred nelvana animators worked on film over a seven month period that lasted until february 1986 company itself received credit for story development american greetings and kenner commissioned nelvana to make sequel on contract television syndicator lbs communications a co financier of first one became producer and presenter care bears movie ii was nelvana

first film did not return at one point samuel goldwyn company was about to release a new generation but lost distribution rights after turning down demands from producers eventually nelvana went into negotiations with columbia pictures which acquired worldwide theatrical rights in early 1986 this led founder samuel goldwyn jr to remark fact that columbia is distributing care bears sequel is typical of greed of big studios someone else has to go in and prove something works then a studio will charge in by contrast goldwyn acquired rights to original film after major u s studios passed on it they did not see financial potential in a movie aimed strictly for children allusions thumb to help save christy true heart bear maxine miller turns to film s audience and tells them if you have ever cared do it now critics found this scene similar to one in j m barrie s peter pan alt a boy dressed in red looks down at a girl with a crystal glow a yellow bear stands up with her hands outstretched some of her partners are holding hands and chanting according to richard freedman of newhouse news service this must be first version of faust myth in which not only does faust or faustina christy here manage to weasel out of pact with devil but succeeds in regenerating him as well elliot krieger of rhode island s providence journal also took note of such a theme headlining his review faust goes to summer camp in regards to continuity issues a reviewer in scarecrow movie guide observed a montage showing care bears and their cousins growing up together from infancy to full care bear maturation nullifying everything that happened in first movie mike mclane of florida s gainesville sun gave a few suggestions of storyline s possible religious subtext he compared great wishing star to god bears beautiful cloud kingdom of care a lot to heaven and dark heart to satan he also hinted that bears protected humankind like angels did charles solomon pointed out that film s climax in which bears help revive christy borrows flagrantly from peter pan scarecrow contributor took note of this aspect writing there s an excruciating scene where care bears turn to audience and plead for help in form of excessive and focused caring in his critique hal lipper called it tinker bell principle whereupon audience must come together to save a dying character in vincent canby s opinion great wishing star looks like tinker bell if she were a star shaped beanbag music as with original film patricia cullen composed score for care bears movie ii soundtrack album was released in

home at time of production they shared their experiences of working on soundtrack paul attanasio of washington post gave a mixed response to film s music songs are dopey he said but score which is mostly seven kinds of sprightly has its occasional moments vincent canby wrote in his review there are unseen loudspeakers that pour out a nonstop hit parade of songs to be interred by including i

through vhs market on november 21 1990 under title little bears of fairy star otogi no hoshi no ko subtitled and dubbed versions have been released reception critical response film received mostly negative reviews in part because of their theory that care bears movie ii a new generation was part of franchise s marketing scheme at time of release this led new york times vincent canby to begin his review by proclaiming product merchandising marches on another reviewer claimed to have seen almost every collectible within film s first twenty minutes film was produced to serve as franchise introduction of care bear cubs and care bear cousin cubs who also had their own line of toys from kenner plushes measuring 11 in height consisted of bedtime cub cheer cub funshine cub and share cub line of care bear cousin cubs included li l bright heart raccoon li l proud heart cat and li l swift heart rabbit kenner announced introduction of cubs in 1985 shortly before film opened and showcased them at american international toy fair in february 1986 in motion picture guide 1987 annual jay robert nash wrote that its title refers to new featured characters who more than coincidentally have ended up on toy shelves of stores everywhere a critic from omaha world herald however found it misleading and complained that cubs are not a new generation at all several critics considered film a prequel to original omaha world herald reviewer edward jones of virginia s free lance star charles solomon of los angeles times and bill cosford of miami herald according to michael h price of fort worth star telegram care bears movie ii is what film industry calls a tracing origin of care bear family and relatives of other species in his animated movie guide animation expert jerry beck gave care bears movie ii a half star 1 2 out of four and offered this consensus john stanley expressed his views likewise in his 1988 film guide revenge of creature features care bears movie ii is a sort of pre sequel that i suspect requires its audiences to have some prior knowledge of care bears vincent canby said in his new york times review very young kids may love this but anybody over age of 4 might find it too spooky hal lipper of st petersburg times remarked that it is an enormously engaging cartoon quite a feat when you consider saccharine psychobabble passing for dialogue miami herald s bill cosford gave it two and a half stars out of four same rating he had applied to its predecessor edward jones commented that animation can t compare with best of disney take a look at sleeping beauty and you ll see difference likewise italian critic paolo complained this is an ugly sequel with awkward animation and not even small fry will find it fun charles solomon said new care bears film is even more sloppily made and hawks its goods even more shamelessly film makers seem more concerned with showcasing toys than providing entertainment shared profits obviously count for more than shared feelings if someone started selling hate bears there undoubtedly would be a film about them gene siskel awarded film zero stars out of four along with thumbs down on at movies siskel ebert tv show having not been introduced yet while leonard maltin gave it a bomb rating in his movie guide and added your kids deserve better entertainment than this treacly stuff about kingdom of caring prefab animation from era of toy merchandising tie ins gale group publication s golden movie retriever gave it one bone out of four in its 1992 edition but revised it to two later on in 2001 los angeles based hastings bad cinema society picked a new generation as one of 100 worst movies of 20th century even suffering through a barney video would be preferable to sitting through this said
