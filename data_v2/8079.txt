cologne two abbeys were linked and thus under purview of diocese of where stavelot lay this occurred despite several previous imperial bulls reinforcing position that two abbeys should be subject to a single abbot for example undated 950 villers bull from otto i king of romans granted to abbot odilon under which he grants to religious community of monasteries of stavelot and malmedy free ability to choose an abbot charged with sole right of administration of two monasteries page 8 more recently to time emperor henry iv had confirmed this in trier in 1065 declaring that two monasteries must submit to authority of a single abbot page 10 monks from stavelot processed to malmedy with crosier and relics of st remaclus to remind rebellious monks of traditional ordering of abbeys that saint had instituted relics and crosier were also transported to an imperial diet of henry iv in goslar in 1066 they processed again this time to aachen and they processed to bitburg and bamberg following year that their prayers were not answered apparently led monks to despair that relics were becoming impotent or that monks were being punished by their patron in 1067 and 1068 abbot thierry even went to rome to appeal to pope alexander ii this impasse lasted for a further three years until henry held court at liege during easter in 1071 with great ceremony monks processed with remaclus s relics to meet with his legendary fellow bishop st lambert joined en route by relics of st symmetrus numerous miracles convinced emperor to recognise union of two abbeys and reiterate superiority of stavelot forcing anno eventually to capitulate a procession back to stavelot paused en route to celebrate mass on banks of meuse finally monks processed with remaclus s relics to abbey at malmedy to symbolise

county of luxembourg to take under their protection abbot his church and all goods they possess and to assure their tenure page 14 this protection was reiterated in 1384 by wenceslaus king of romans

library in 1816 by pope pius vii including malmedy bible and two from about 1300 malmedy illuminations show a particular closeness with metalwork styles abbot wibald ruled 1130 58 was an important imperial minister and diplomat and was regarded as one of greatest patrons of mosan art in its best period although much of evidence for this is circumstantial some of his surviving letters discuss works which may be identifiable with existing pieces and an g who some have identified with a shadowy figure to whom many masterpieces are attributed several important commissions were certainly placed by wibald with mosan workshops of goldsmiths and metalworkers and other works later connected with stavelot are also presumed to have been commissioned by him works mostly enamels of very high
