in may 1940 despite belgium s surrender congo remained in conflict on allied side administered by belgian government in exile and provided much needed raw materials most notably gold and uranium to britain and united states congolese troops of force publique fought alongside british forces in east african campaign and a congolese medical unit served in madagascar and in burma campaign congolese formations also acted as garrisons in egypt nigeria and palestine increasing demands placed on congolese population by colonial authorities during war however provoked strikes riots and other forms of resistance particularly from indigenous congolese these were repressed often violently by belgian colonial authorities congo s comparative prosperity during conflict led to a wave of post war immigration from belgium bringing white population to 100 000 by 1950 as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout 1950s role played by congolese uranium during hostilities caused country to be of interest to soviet union during cold war background thumb colonial officials including governor general pierre ryckmans in leopoldville in 1938 following world war i belgium possessed two colonies in africa belgian congo which it had controlled since its annexation of congo free state in 1908 and ruanda urundi a former german colony that had been mandated to belgium in 1924 by league of nations belgian colonial military numbered 18 000 soldiers making it one of largest standing colonial armies in africa at time congo underwent an economic boom in 1920s and mines plantations and transportation networks were greatly developed great depression led to a collapse of commodity prices undermining colony s export based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment only industry that expanded during time period was centered around cotton production belgian government followed a policy of neutrality during interwar years nazi germany invaded belgium on 10 may 1940 which after 18 days of fighting surrendered and was occupied by german forces king leopold iii who had surrendered to germans was kept a prisoner for rest of war just before fall of belgium its government including minister of colonies albert de fled first to bordeaux in france then to london where it formed an official belgian government in exile in october 1940 governor general of congo pierre ryckmans decided on day of belgian army s surrender that colony would remain loyal to allies in stark contrast to french colonies that later pledged allegiance to pro german vichy government congo was therefore administered from london by belgian government in exile during war despite this assurance disruption broke out in city of stanleyville now kisangani in eastern congo among white population panicking about future of colony and threat of an italian invasion economic contribution thumb left upright a belgian pilot in british royal air force 1942 his spitfire aircraft was funded by contributions from congo and took its name from congolese town of that name soon after arrival of belgian government in exile in london negotiations began between belgians and british about role which congo would play in allied war effort british were determined that congo should not fall into axis hands and planned to invade and occupy colony if belgians did not come to an arrangement this was particularly because after fall of dutch and british colonies in far east to japan allies were desperate for raw materials like rubber which congo could produce in abundance eventually two parties came to an arrangement in which all british demands were accepted including a 30 percent devaluation of congolese franc with official agreement and congolese declaration of support for allies economy of congo and in particular its production of important raw materials was placed at disposal of belgium s allies particularly britain and united states thumb sheets of copper from katanga province s mines congo had become increasingly centralised economically during great depression of 1930s as belgian government encouraged production there of cotton which had value on international market greatest economic demands on congo were related to raw materials between 1938 and 1944 number of workers employed in mines of union miniere du haut katanga umhk rose from 25 000 to 49 000 to cope with increased demand colonial administration enacted ultimately successful policies aimed at increasing size of congo s labour force number of wage labourers in colony grew from 480 000 in 1938 to 800 000 in 1945 in order to increase production for war effort colonial authorities increased hours and speed at which workers both european and african were expected to work this led to increasing labour unrest across colony discontent among white population was also increased by raising of a 40 percent war tax high taxes and price controls were enforced from 1941 limiting amount of profit that could be made and curbing profiteering vast majority of congolese produced raw resources were exported to other allied countries by 1942 entire colony s output of copper palm oil and industrial diamonds were being exported to united kingdom while almost all colony s lumber was sent to south africa exports to united states also rose from 600 000 in early 1940 to 2 700 000 by 1942 tax revenue from belgian congo enabled belgian government in exile and free belgian forces to fund themselves unlike most other states in exile which operated through subsidies and donations from sympathetic governments it also meant that belgian gold reserves which had been moved to london in 1940 were not needed to fund war effort and therefore were still available at end of war uranium congo possessed major uranium deposits and was one of few sources of material available to allies uranium extracted from disused shinkolobwe uranium mine owned by umhk in katanga in southern congo was instrumental in development of an atomic bomb during allied manhattan project director of umhk edgar sengier secretly dispatched half of its uranium stock to new york in 1940 in september 1942 he sold it to united states army sengier himself moved to new york from where he directed umhk s operations for rest of war u s government sent soldiers from army corps of engineers to shinkolobwe in 1942 to restore mine and improve its transport links by renovating local aerodromes and port facilities in 1944 americans acquired a further of uranium ore from newly reopened mine military involvement thumb

constituted bulk of free belgian forces numbering some 40 000 men like other colonial armies of time force publique was racially segregated it was led by 280 white officers and ncos but otherwise comprised indigenous black africans force publique had never received more modern equipment supplied to belgian armed forces before war and so had to use outdated weapons and equipment like stokes mortar and saint chamond 70 mm howitzer east african campaign thumb 300px force publique soldiers leaving congo to participate in east african campaign in abyssinia left three brigades of force publique were sent to abyssinia alongside british forces to fight italians in june 1940 this was done in spite of government in exile s reservations to demonstrate its allegiance to allied cause and in retaliation for deployment of italian bombers in bases on channel coast within occupied belgium belgian 1st colonial brigade operated in galla area in south west sector in may 1941 around 8 000 men of force publique under major general auguste edouard gilliaert successfully cut off retreat of general pietro gazzera s italians at saio in ethiopian highlands after marching over from their bases in western congo troops suffered from malaria and other tropical diseases but successfully defeated italians in a number of engagements gilliaert subsequently accepted surrender of gazzera and 7 000 italian troops over course of campaign in abyssinia force publique received surrender of nine italian generals 370 high ranking officers and 15 000 italian colonial troops before end of 1941 congolese forces in abyssinia suffered about 500 fatalities after allied victory in abyssinia force publique moved to british colony of nigeria which was being used as a staging ground for a planned invasion of vichy controlled dahomey which did not occur was also garrisoned by 13 000 congolese troops then a part of force publique went to egypt and british mandatory palestine and was redesignated 1st belgian congo brigade group during 1943 and 1944 medical support a medical unit from congo 10th belgian congo casualty clearing station was formed in 1943 and served alongside british forces during invasion of madagascar and in far east during burma campaign unit which had a small body of force publique troops for local defense of station included 350 black and 20 white personnel and continued to serve with british until 1945 life in belgian congo thumb congolese worker housing c 1943 at start of war population of congo numbered approximately 12 million black people and 30 000 whites colonial government segregated population along racial lines and there was very little mixing between colours white population was highly urbanized and in leopoldville capital lived in a quarter of city separated from black majority all blacks in city had to adhere to a curfew demands of colonial administration fell hardest on rural residents which were conscripted for road construction projects and rubber harvesting conditions were harsh for labourers and in some cases were conflated in congolese collective memory with earlier atrocities committed by congo free state in relation to its rubber collection system during war belgian government in exile directed propaganda at allied states that created a positive image of its colony in an attempt to legitimise its rule in new york city belgian information center released numerous publications which asserted that belgians had rescued congolese from terrible conditions and improved life in territory education was overwhelmingly controlled by protestant and catholic missions which were also responsible for providing limited medical and welfare support to rural congolese food remained during war with only sales of tires and automobiles restricted by government one of consequences of congo s economic mobilisation during war particularly for black population was significant urbanisation just 9 of indigenous population lived in cities in 1938 by 1950 figure stood at close to 20 colonial authorities arrested enemy aliens in congo and confiscated their property in 1940 unrest strikes thumb katangese miner demands made by colonial government on congolese workers during war provoked strikes and riots from workforce whites in colony were allowed to form trade unions for first time during war and their demands for better pay and working conditions were often emulated by black workers in october 1941 white workers in colony unsuccessfully attempted a general strike across colony in december 1941 black mine workers at various sites in katanga province including jadotville and elisabethville went on strike demanding that their pay be increased from 1 50 francs to 2 francs to compensate for rising living costs strike started on 3 december and by next day 1 400 workers had downed tools all umhk sites were affected by 9 december strike was also fuelled by other grievances against colonial order and segregation from start colonial authorities attempted to persuade strikers to disperse and go back to work when they refused they were fired on in jadotville 15 strikers were shot dead by military in elisabethville strikers including their leader leonard mpoyi were invited to negotiations at town s stadium where they were offered various concessions including a 30 pay rise thumb a painting of elisabethville massacre by

then ordered his soldiers to fire on other strikers in stadium between 60 and 70 strikers were killed during protest although official estimate was around 30 transcription of proceedings of council of ministers of government in exile 18 december 1941 reproduced in miners returned to work on 10 december numerous smaller strikes occurred in congo later in war though not on same scale as in 1941 in 1944 strikes broke out in katanga and kasai provoked by conscription of workers for mines and deteriorating working conditions in 1945 riots and strikes occurred among black dockworkers in port city of matadi luluabourg mutiny colonial government in congo depended on its military to maintain civil order and above all it depended on loyalty of native troops who made up bulk of force publique black non commissioned officers led by first sergeant major mukalabushi a veteran of east african campaign at luluabourg in central congolese province of kasai in february 1944 trigger for this was a plan to vaccinate troops who had served at front though soldiers were also unhappy about demands placed on them and their treatment by their white officers mutineers broke into base s armoury on morning of 20 february and pillaged white quarter of town town s inhabitants fled and a belgian officer and two white civilians were killed mutineers attacked visible signs of colonial authorities and proclaimed their desire for independence mutineers then dispersed to their home villages pillaging on way they failed to spread insurrection to neighbouring garrisons two mutineers including mukalabushi were executed for their part in insurrection legacy as a result of congo s comparative prosperity during conflict post war period saw a wave of immigration to country from belgium by 1950 100 000 whites were living in congo nevertheless war highlighted precarious nature of colonial administration leading governor ryckmans to remark that days of colonialism are over in 1946 in years after war colonial government underwent extensive reform black people were granted significantly more rights and freedoms leading to growth of a so called evolue evolved class despite this belgian policy of conscripted labour of 60 days a year from each native congolese remained in effect until congolese independence whereas similar labour levies were abolished in british and french possessions after war several black members of force publique who were veterans of war served in prominent roles in army after congolese independence including louis bobozo eugene and norbert following industrial unrest trade unions for black workers were instituted in 1946 though they lacked power and influence workers at umhk continued to demand higher wages and strikes were common in colony for next decade nevertheless both wages and living conditions improved significantly in years after war war began a second wave of industrialisation that lasted right up to congolese independence in 1960 1941 elisabethville massacre is a recurrent theme in congolese art and folklore and was later incorporated into popular congolese anti colonial narrative historiographic discussion of congo s role in world war ii is generally limited to mentions of uranium extracted from shinkolobwe importance of congolese uranium during war caused soviet union to become interested in territory it was subsequently an area of soviet interest during cold war war also led to a re orientation of congo s trade away from belgium and towards united states united kingdom and united kingdom s colonies commemoration in 1943 a three sided pyramid was erected in belgian congo to commemorate actions of congolese in ethiopia each face of pyramid was inscribed with name of each major location of fighting and saio many locations
