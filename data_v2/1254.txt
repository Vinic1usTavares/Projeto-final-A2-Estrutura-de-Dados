township scranton and moosic watershed of stream has an area of part of it is designated as a high quality coldwater fishery and a migratory fishery other part is a warmwater fishery and a migratory fishery stream has one named tributary which is known as mountain lake run stafford meadow brook has a very high level of water quality for much of its length and part of it meets criteria for an exceptional value designation stream begins on pocono plateau and flows through moosic mountains in a mountainous watershed its channel has been substantially altered in its lower reaches numerous wetlands and reservoirs are present in watershed of stafford meadow brook reservoirs such as lake scranton and williams bridge reservoir are used as a water supply major roads in watershed include interstate 81 interstate 380 pennsylvania route 307 and others in early 1900s main industries in watershed included coal mining and agriculture however iron ore has also been mined in watershed in past and a sawmill was once present on stream several railroads historically operated in watershed and a number of bridges were built over stream in 20th century montage mountain ski resort is in watershed course stafford meadow brook begins near birchwood estates in roaring brook township it flows west southwest for several tenths of a mile before turning northwest for a few miles it flows in a broad valley alongside pennsylvania route 307 crossing it three times and receiving five unnamed tributaries three from left and two from right stream eventually passes through williams bridge reservoir as its valley becomes narrower on northern side of reservoir it flows north northwest for a few tenths of a mile before entering lake scranton and briefly passes through scranton before reentering roaring brook township from southern end of lake stream flows southwest for a few miles receiving one unnamed tributary from left and another from right it then reenters scranton and continues flowing southwest receiving one more unnamed tributary from left it then briefly turns south before passing through district number fifty nine reservoir and turning northwest after several tenths of a mile it enters moosic and then turns northeast for more than a mile reentering scranton and flowing alongside interstate 81 stream eventually receives mountain lake run its only named tributary and turns northwest for several tenths of a mile crossing us route 11 and reaching its confluence with lackawanna river stafford meadow brook joins lackawanna river upriver of its mouth

perennial stream stafford meadow brook begins on pocono plateau it is a mountain stream that flows moosic mountains in gap at points it also flows through a gorge or through dense brush mountains in watershed include coon hill and scrub oak mountain topography of watershed is mountainous with high steep hills that have been rounded by glaciation stream s valley is narrow it is one of larger tributaries of lackawanna river it is a second order stream channel of stafford meadow brook is sinuous it flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale with some coal occurring in its lower reaches umbral or red shale formation is present in stream s valley and contains iron ore iron ore deposits along stream are embedded in fireclay and soft clay shale below ore is a layer of buff and greenish sandy shale below this in turn is a compact gray sandstone a coal outcropping belonging to roaring brook basin is also in stream s vicinity between one of stafford meadow brook s reservoirs and southern scranton watershed of stream is glacially deformed at a saddle in this reach stream was once able to flow through rocky glen into spring brook during high flow conditions there is an inner ridge between gorge of stafford meadow brook and that or roaring brook stafford meadow brook flows through numerous culverts in southern scranton some stone retaining walls and culverts in this section are more than 100 years old there area also areas with gabion baskets wing walls and concrete bridge piers near elm street in scranton stream flows through a ravine with a depth of in this ravine stream flows through remains of an open channel from pittston avenue downstream to its mouth it flows through an open box culvert built in 1960 for flood control purposes there is also one pipe with a diameter of in scranton stream has an open concrete channel in some places channel is long and is part of a flood control project by pennsylvania department of environmental protection other components of project include a debris basin and a basin this project alleviates flooding from near us route 11 downstream to near south washington avenue in some reaches stream is entirely

stafford meadow brook has been studied a number of times in 1980 pennsylvania fish and boat commission collected data on stream in 2003 it was studied by popp in 1940s scranton spring brook water company owned 93 percent of upper of watershed pennsylvania gas water company owned most of upper three quarters of watershed until 1996 ownership of land passed to theta land company a few years later some sections of land are undergoing timbering biology from its headwaters downstream to downstream most crossing of scranton moosic line drainage basin of stafford meadow brook is designated as a high quality coldwater fishery and a migratory fishery from that point downstream to its mouth stream is classified as a warmwater fishery and a migratory fishery a large section of stream from its headwaters to lower pennsylvania route 307 bridge meets criteria for an exceptional value designation wild trout naturally reproduce in stream at least as far upstream as river mile 6 82 and as far downstream as its mouth stream was stocked with 500 adult and rainbow trout in 1894 1895 in 1984 pennsylvania fish commission speculated that there were native brook trout in part of stream numerous

trees were planted in watershed of stafford meadow brook between 1912 and 1928 in early 2000s lackawanna river watershed conservation plan recommended creating a 1000 foot riparian buffer around stafford meadow brook corridor in lacks a riparian buffer in parts of scranton however there are large hemlock stands along stream above lake scranton wetlands along stream provide an important habitat for wildlife and plant life beavers have also constructed ponds along some reaches of stream bears have also historically been observed in area modified hilsenhoff biotic index value of stafford meadow brook is 3 82 modified ept index value is 14 and total taxa richness is 33 recreation one part of stafford meadow brook is in vicinity of montage mountain ski resort and a multi sport stadium in early 2000s lackawanna river watershed conservation plan recommended that roaring brook township and city of scranton include protection of stafford meadow brook in their zoning plans it also recommended construction of a trail along stream this trail could link with lackawanna river heritage trail additionally there is a walking trail around lake scranton this trail is long see also
