manufacturing process is an action minigame and a departure from main game s economic simulation gameplay cities have a chocolate shop where player can sell his or her stock and a market where ingredients can be purchased factories manufacturing chocolates produce a set amount of product every turn as long as required ingredients are in stock during story mode quests are given by non player characters these typically involve producing a particular volume and type of chocolate and delivering it to another non player character who is either traveling or can be found at a set location quest rewards take form of a high price for chocolates or a new recipe some encounters with characters give player an opportunity to gamble a large amount of money on a dice roll market owners can be bartered with though this carries risk of them becoming irritated and raising prices rather than lowering them when producing a particular chocolate for first time a minigame is played where ingredients are fired from a cannon to fill circular trays which revolve around cannon ingredients and quantities needed vary depending on recipe each time a circle is filled with correct ingredients it is removed and an empty circle put in its place trays spin faster as more circles are filled if too many ingredients are wasted by misfiring cannon production is brought to a halt and mini game must be attempted again mini game ends when timer runs out number of completed circles is equal to number of chocolates produced by that factory every week mini game cannot be played unless player owns correct ingredients and it can be replayed if player wishes to try to improve efficiency of factory development tucson arizona based big splash games was formed in late 2005 by three veterans of videogame industry jon blossom stephen lewis and michael wyman they came together to produce a prototype video game for casual market they worked on this for a few months when they were not working they still held jobs within industry to support themselves this prototype was pitched to a few publishers in order to gain feedback playfirst though not interested in prototype issued team a request for proposal for an economic simulation game hoping that big splash could produce another proposal next morning big splash co founder stephen lewis remembered that he had been told that some people in particular women have an almost religious connection with chocolate taking this idea he quickly wrote a proposal and forwarded it to his two partners after brainstorming idea team decided that it satisfied playfirst s request for proposal forwarded a copy of idea and received word from publisher that they had hit nail on head chocolatier was designed to appeal to women aged between 35 and 55 a different market compared to games previously developed by trio in order to immerse themselves in subject matter during development big splash s staff tasted as many variety of chocolates as they could find and took berger chocolate maker factory tour where they witnessed full bean to bar process factory mini game was developed in order to give players a break from economic side of game which involves buying low and selling high it took approximately same time to produce mini game as it did to create rest of game which drained developer s resources though stephen lewis believed this was right decision journalists were sent chocolatier branded chocolate bars and golden tickets which allowed them to download game for free in order to promote game s release game s sequel chocolatier 2
