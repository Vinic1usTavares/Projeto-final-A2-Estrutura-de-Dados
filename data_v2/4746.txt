geastrum triplex is an inedible fungus found in detritus and leaf litter of hardwood forests around world it is commonly known as collared earthstar saucered earthstar or triple earthstar and less commonly by alternative species name geastrum indicum it is largest member of genus geastrum or earthstar fungi and expanded mature specimens can reach a tip to tip length of up to immature fruit bodies are spherical somewhat resembling puffballs with pointed beaks and are partially or completely buried in ground as fungus matures outer layer of tissue exoperidium splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards lifting and exposing spherical inner spore sac spore sac contains gleba a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white and firm but ages to become brown and powdery often a layer of exoperidium splits around perimeter of spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer atop spore sac is a small pointed beak peristome which has a small hole from which spores may be released species is widespread and can be found in asia australasia europe and both north and south america fungus has a history of use in traditional medicines of native north america and china fruit bodies have been analyzed chemically to determine their lipid content and various chemical derivatives of fungal sterol ergosterol have been identified taxonomy and classification thumb 150px left german botanist franz wilhelm junghuhn alt grainy black and white photograph showing face and torso of an about 50 year old bearded man looking into camera he is wearing a jacket and collared shirt that appears to be buttoned only at top species was first described scientifically by german botanist franz wilhelm junghuhn as geaster triplex in 1840 earlier genus name geaster introduced by italian botanist pier antonio micheli in 1727 in nova plantarum genera is considered an variant of geastrum junghuhn who was living in indonesia and extensively surveyed its fungal flora discovered type specimen on mount on island java at an elevation between today type specimen is kept at national herbarium of netherlands in leiden morphological feature used by junghuhn to differentiate g triplex from other similar earthstars was collar like structure of inner layer of exoperidium american mycologist curtis gates lloyd would later erroneously suggest that species was a giant form of geastrum saccatum several authors have regarded geastrum indicum as correct name for g triplex this is because g indicum a species described by johann friedrich in 1832 as indicum and then moved to geastrum by stephan in 1959 may be same species as geastrum triplex if it is in fact same species first published name i e g indicum has nomenclatorial priority according to rules of international code of botanical nomenclature more recently several authors argue that g indicum should be rejected as a nomen dubium and g triplex maintained as correct name for species stellan sunhede s 1989 monograph of european species of geastrum follows v j stanek s concept for infrageneric below level of genus placement of geastrum and places g triplex with species that do not incorporate and encrust forest debris section g triplex is further categorized in subsection laevistomata which includes species with a fibrillose peristome that is made of parallel thin thread like filaments within subsection laevistomata it is in stirps triplex due to its delimited with a distinct restricting edge or irregularly torn peristome specific epithet triplex means threefold and refers to three layered peridium geastrum triplex has acquired several vernacular names including collared earthstar saucered earthstar and triple earthstar description like all mushrooms fruit body of geastrum triplex is visible part of a larger organism hidden from sight are masses of nearly invisible fungal threads called mycelium which form active feeding and growing structures of fungus fruit body created when environmental conditions such as temperature moisture and nutrient availability are optimal is designed to produce and disseminate spores geastrum triplex has largest fruit body of earthstar mushrooms immature fruit body is typically in diameter and up to broad roody gives a larger value here up to 11 5 cm after rays have spread out it is composed of a roughly spherical to egg shaped structure endoperidium topped by an opening ostiole covered by fragments of tissue that form a small pointed beak a peristome endoperidium is typically lacking any sort of stem it is sessile grayish brown to wood brown when young but light yellow brown in dried unopened specimens outer tissue layer exoperidium develops splits which radiate from apex and form between four and eight rays that separate from endoperidium latter s thin and papery envelope surrounds a mass of spores and fertile tissue known as gleba central part of gleba contains a pseudocolumella a columella not attached to stalk that is typically cylindrical or club shaped and extends up from base because of variability in columella persistence size structure and shape within genus its value for identification is limited exoperidium s rays are long and up to 4 mm 3 16 in thick outer surface of rays lower surface after expansion and unopened specimens have a rough texture in several geastrum species dirt and debris adhere to underside this is not case in g triplex inner fleshy layers upper surface of these rays are near wood brown in color when dried and have a layer of surface tissue that cracks into patches there is a great deal of variation however to extent in which upper surface tissue of rays crack this tissue layer may also remain closely attached as a sheet over unsegmented part of outer wall with part adhering to rays variously cracked and sometimes finally peeling off in places in g triplex bases of rays usually break around perimeter of endoperidium to form a platform or receptacle in which endoperidium rests however not all specimens form this receptacle leading to possible confusion with other geastrum species curtis gates lloyd claimed that in tropical regions with an abundance of high temperatures and humidity fungus expands rapidly which is more conducive to fleshy layer breaking away to form a receptacle in more temperate areas this effect would not be as pronounced and usually does not occur at all endoperidium is in diameter by high sessile and a dull grayish brown peristome is made of radially arranged fibrils that clump together at apex in groups of unequal length to form an opening that appears jagged or torn circular area bordering peristome is a paler color spores are thought to be dispersed by wind sucking them out when it blows over hole or when falling raindrops hit flexible endoperidium creating a puff of air that forces spores through ostiole microscopic characteristics thumb left basidiospores are spherical 3 5 4 5 um in diameter and covered with warts alt about two dozen round objects that are brownish and translucent and covered with small bumps what appear to be gradation lines of a ruler run horizontally through middle of image spore sac contains gleba which is composed of a pseudocolumella unbranched threads capillitium spore bearing cells basidia and spores themselves all of these microscopic elements have certain characteristic features that help distinguish g triplex from other superficially similar earthstars spores are spherical and 3 5 4 5 um in diameter they are covered with short narrow abruptly terminating projections of a translucent hyaline substance which turn a pale cinnamon brown in potassium hydroxide and a dark dull brown nearly sepia when stained with iodine capillitium is made of what appears to be encrusted cylindrical filaments 3 6 um in diameter of a color varying from hyaline to dull yellowish brown in potassium hydroxide and yellowish in iodine its walls are thickened to point where interior lumen appears as only a line either two or four spores are attached to basidia and sterigmata extensions of basidia that attach spores are long up to 20 um geastrum triplex does not have cystidia similar species geastrum triplex may be confused with g saccatum or g as rays do not always crack around perimeter to form a bowl under spore case however it is larger than either of these species combination of characteristics which distinguish g triplex from other earthstars include lack of debris adhering to outer surfaces saucer like base in which spore case is seated relatively large size fibrillose peristome and paler area surrounding peristome separating it from rest of endoperidium unlike some other geastrum species rays of g triplex are not hygroscopic they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity habitat and distribution thumb right stages of fruit body emergence alt six star shaped fungi arranged in a semicircle on ground bottom fungus is partially buried and rays of its star are not yet fully opened moving counterclockwise around semicircle rays are more opened and in top two example are curved downwards so as to raise level of circular sac above level of ground geastrum triplex is a saprobic fungus it derives nutrients from decomposing organic matter fruit bodies are usually found growing singly or more commonly in groups in hardwood forests where much humus has accumulated in mexico they have been collected in tropical deciduous forest fruit bodies are often found around well rotted tree stumps they are initially almost buried in loose duff but emerge during maturity as downward curling of rays exposes spore sac old fruit bodies are persistent and may survive winter to be found following spring or summer a dutch study reported a propensity for g triplex to grow on soil made calcium rich from washed out chalk of crushed shells on bicycling paths it is described as common in north america and europe one author states it is commonly found under beech trees geastrum triplex has a widespread distribution and has been collected in asia china korea iran and turkey australia europe belgium czech republic sweden and canary islands and africa congo south africa in north america its range extends north to canada and south to mexico including whole continental united states and hawaii in central and south america fungus has been reported from panama trinidad and tobago argentina brazil and chile uses edibility although fruit bodies of geastrum triplex are nonpoisonous they are tough and fibrous and of no alimentary interest mycologist david arora says that they are reputed to be edible when immature when gleba is still white and firm but adds that they are rarely found in this form in traditional medicine earthstars were used medicinally by native american indians blackfoot called them ka ka meaning fallen stars and according to legend they were an indication of supernatural events cherokee put fruit bodies on navels of babies after childbirth until withered umbilical cord fell off both as a prophylactic and a therapeutic measure in traditional chinese medicine g triplex is used to reduce inflammation in respiratory tract and to staunch bleeding and reduce swelling chemistry fruit bodies of geastrum triplex have been chemically analyzed and shown to contain a number of bioactive compounds including fungal sterols such as ergosta 4 6 8 14 22 3 one 5 6 ergosterol and fungus also contains various fatty acids notably
