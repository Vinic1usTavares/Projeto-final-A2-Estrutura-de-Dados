century manor passed from second baron of dunham massey to matthew de bromale according to dean matthew s father is said to have founded de bromale family naming himself after manor and he may have been related to or a follower of de masseys he may have also held manor at some point de held manor until 1370 when alice de bromale married john de davenport and family name was changed early

family of significant landowners in north west of england whose antecedents can be traced back to time of norman conquest orm de davenport lived close to what is now marton and his name derives from norman french port meaning town on trickling stream referring to his home on river dane dean p 15 in 1160 family became responsible for macclesfield forest riley p 6 and in early 13th century vivian davenport became its grand sergeant family s coat of arms includes a man s head with a rope around neck which is said to represent family s power over life and death during this period davenports acquired land throughout area notably at henbury woodford and lastly at bramhall through marriage davenports held manor for around 500 years and it is likely that they built current house after their accession first william davenport was lord of manor from 1478 to 1528 dean p 16 and one of first recorded trustees of macclesfield grammar school dean p 17 it is possible that he was heavily involved in final battle of wars of roses at bosworth and thereby instrumental in gaining crown for henry vii riley p 16 who rewarded him with a pension of 20 marks per year payable for his lifetime riley p 17 according to dean it was during this first william s tenure that bramall may have been vandalised by a man named randle hassall who destroyed all or part of nine houses and stole timber this gives credence to theory that bramall was rebuilt replacing or partially replacing an older building thumb left alt formal portrait of sir william davenport standing he has a long pale face hair combed back

william davenport was knighted by james i and vi at newark where king was staying on his journey from edinburgh to london and later became high sheriff of cheshire and a commissioner of hundred of macclesfield during tenure of fifth william many alterations were made to building including addition of a room above great hall which would later become withdrawing room and a long gallery riley p 22 internal decorations were also updated with additions such as wall paintings and portraits dean p 22 sixth william succeeded his father in 1639 shortly before english civil war broke out dean p 24 he was a royalist though said not to have been a particularly dedicated one many of his tenants became parliamentarian soldiers riley p 25 and over next three years he had numerous visits from parliamentarian soldiers mostly seeking to acquire goods such as horses and weapons for war and using house for quartering soldiers riley p 27 bramall was also host to royalist soldiers who confiscated some of davenport property for use in war dean p 26 william davenport was at one point charged with delinquency and ordered to pay a fine of ps750 equivalent to ps in and soldiers continued to use bramall hall because of its convenience dean p 27 later davenports thumb alt formal portrait of dorothy davenport she wears a dress of plain dark cloth with richly embroidered a ruff

william dean p 28 william seventh s son was eighth william davenport and an inventory of his property made shortly after his death in 1706 shows gallery and gatehouse of bramall were still intact dean p 30 his two eldest sons each inherited estate but both died young and heirless so estate passed to their younger brother warren davenport warren became part of clergy and during his tenure at bramall set up a school close to entrance of estate dean p 33 tenth and final william davenport succeeded his father warren at age of four many changes were made to house during his tenure including dismantling of gatehouse side of courtyard and long gallery latter of which may have been done because of their being considered unsafe dean p 34 william had no sons so estate passed to salusbury pryce humphreys husband of his illegitimate daughter maria humphreys a naval captain had married maria davenport in 1810 and lived at bramall hall long before he succeeded his father in law riley p 28 he became widely respected in stockport area but following his succession to estate in 1829 there were disputes from other members of davenport family who claimed a right to property dean p 39 edmund davenport who claimed ancestry from thomas davenport third son of peter unsuccessfully contested succession in two different courts edmund was eventually imprisoned for failing to pay legal fees dean p 40 humphreys was knighted in 1834 for his services and in 1838 changed his name to davenport in an effort to continue davenport line he moved with maria to cheltenham in 1841 most likely because living at bramall had become expensive or because of health concerns salusbury died there four years later and was buried in leckhampton dean p 43 over next decade house was likely to have been let as maria davenport preferred to live elsewhere her eldest son william davenport davenport married firstly to camilla maria gatt then secondly to diana handley whom he lived with at bramall for four years before estate was passed to him maria moved to london where she lived with her youngest son charles and died in 1866 dean p 44 during william s tenure bramall was regularly visited by members of public and chapel continued to be used for regular services of worship dean p 45 however following his death in 1869 property was let to wakefield christy of co hatting therefore ending direct involvement from davenport family dean p 49 this occurred because william s son john was too young to inherit estate dean p 46 john s whereabouts during christy s seven year tenure is unknown though he was shown as a visitor at bramall in 1871 and in 1874 became first chairman of bramhall school board in 1876 shortly before he returned to house he was listed as living on ack lane in bramhall dean

rest of bramall estate totalling was sold to freeholders company limited a manchester property development firm on 3 august 1877 for ps200 000 about ps in dean p 59 according to speculation sale was motivated by financial issues and a personal distaste of building dean p 58 it remained empty until 1882 when it was purchased by thomas nevill a local industrialist whose wealth came from calico printing for his son charles riley p 29 while living in house charles nevill carried out substantial restoration and remodelling making interior more comfortable while retaining most of building s external features dean pp 64 69 landscape of grounds was redesigned and a new stable was built along with a west and east lodge housing coachman and head gardener respectively dean p p 70 another building known as hall cottage was also built in vicinity and housed family dean pp 70 71 thomas nevill charles nephew and adopted son inherited estate in 1916 but decided to sell it following financial difficulties after first world war in 1923 many items of furniture were auctioned off dean p 79 but there was no interest in purchase of house during that decade rumours arose that bramall would be dismantled and transported to united states this may have been popularised by autobiography of kate douglas wiggin which described author s visit to bramall in 1890 in 1925 house was auctioned with condition that if no purchaser came forward it would be demolished and materials sold off dean p 80 at one point neighbouring local authority stockport county borough council offered to buy estate but nevill rejected their offer as unacceptable dean p 81 auction received no acceptable offers however one of those present john henry davies president of manchester united later offered ps15 000 about ps in for house this was accepted dean p 82 he lived in house until his death in 1927 and his widow amy remained there until 1935 when she sold it to hazel grove and bramhall urban district council for ps14 360 worth about ps in with intention that house and park be open to public dean p 86 under council ownership house was occupied by a caretaker though most of building was open to public house and grounds were used for various functions such as proclamation of george vi succeeding his brother king edward viii to throne dean p 87 at that time house was sparsely furnished as council was unable to afford much furniture dean p 88 one of council s earliest projects was restoration of chapel which had fallen out of use towards end of 19th century dean p 89 it was restored to resemble how it would have been when davenports were last at bramall dean p 90 and a service of consecration was held on 30 october 1938 once work had been completed dean p 92 in 1947 an association called friends of bramall hall was set up primarily to find furnishings for house but also to advertise and assist in upkeep of house and grounds over years many furnishings which had once belonged to house were returned dean p 95 including portraits of occupants estate is now property of stockport metropolitan borough council smbc which acquired it in 1974 following local government

house and park are currently officially known by name bramall both have been spelled as bramhall and other variations over years domesday book used spelling bramale which led charles nevill to prefer bramall a convention maintained by hazel grove and bramhall urban district council when it acquired property and continued by stockport council generally hall is now referred to as bramall hall whilst name of park village and manor are spelt bramhall though there remain some local inconsistencies riley pp 5 6 house thumb left east side of bramall hall alt exterior view of side of a large black and white building with numerous chimneys in foreground are two rows of hedges there has been a settlement at bramhall since saxon times according to alfred burton who wrote about bramhall in late 19th century house has not always been in present location and was originally at crow holt wood this theory was rejected by another historian frederick moorhouse who became convinced in 1909 that crow holt wood was a place where animals would have been taken to be sorted there is no conclusive evidence to support either theory dean p 11 today house is situated at top of two valleys to its south and east sides which two streams run through it is a grade i listed building and oldest parts date from late 14th century with later renovations dating from 16th and 19th centuries it was originally accessed from east side drive followed route of ladybrook stream then uphill towards chapel on south side reaching courtyard on other side main entrance is now on side of courtyard in west dean p 3 because of restructuring of drive in 1888 current layout of house can clearly be seen from west side of building in courtyard service wing is on left great hall is in centre and banqueting hall is on right dean

fireplace situated in middle of floor stockport metropolitan borough council it was probably first built around end of 14th century when davenports became lords of manor towards end of 16th century great hall was substantially rebuilt and withdrawing room was created above it a long gallery was also added as a third storey history of gallery is uncertain it was intact in 1790 but was taken down before 1819 dean p 35 because it was believed to be unsafe a similar gallery was built at little moreton hall and it is still intact causing lower storeys to buckle under weight great hall has a bay window with leaded windows common throughout building dean p 4 william harrison ainsworth wrote about a right of way through great hall in his 1834 novel rookwood he described how a traveller could pass through great hall and be entertained and sometimes refreshed he described bramall as best specimen of its class its class in our opinion is best to be met with in cheshire ainsworth p 31 no evidence exists for any such right of way according to another tale food from buttery hatch was given to poor who congregated outside thumb solar or great chamber of late tudor or early jacobean days

panelled with oak and timbers that ceiling is constructed of are decorated with cross and rose shapes dating from victorian era banqueting hall which leads off lesser hall to west dean p 6 is believed by dean to be oldest part of house its northern wall is possibly oldest part of house not having been renovated like rest of courtyard walls used this room as a billiards room chapel opposite banqueting hall was only place of public worship in bramhall until 19th century dean p 7 its existence was first recorded in 1541 when it was referred to in will of second william davenport it fell into disrepair after its closure between 1869 and 1890 and was restored by hazel grove and bramhall urban district council following its purchase of property in 1935 and religious services began to be held there again on north wall are unglazed windows which face wall of library showing that south wing was once separate from great hall ten commandments are written on west wall underneath

man playing a mandolin above chapel is chapel room also known as queen anne room priest s room dean p 8 and nevill s room it had been two rooms a state bedroom and ante room but was almost totally transformed in late 19th century into one larger room a blocked up door next to fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole but is more likely to have been entrance to first floor of house from an external staircase before wing was restructured probably in late 16th century or early 17th century north of chapel room is paradise room whose name derives from bed hangings which include embroidered images of adam and eve and their fall from paradise as well as use in tudor times of name paradise for a favourite room often a bedchamber this room has panelled walls and a fireplace with a cupboard on right hand side on other side there is a small recess which was described in an 1882 newspaper as a dark passage which is said to lead to some region unknown it is possible that this was a priest s hide adjacent to chapel and chapel room less romantically it may alternatively have been a garderobe or privy this room became associated with sightings of ghosts in 19th century and legends of a secret passage that led from room outside or to chapel arose though no such passages exist dean p 9 thumb left a 19th century interpretation of how withdrawing room might have looked in early 1600s alt a large room with an elaborate textured ceiling walls are oak panelled and there are a number of davenport family portraits there is a fireplace on left and two large bay windows on
