debut mixtape nostalgia ultra which was released on february 18 2011 when asked by quietus if song drew from his personal experiences ocean commented that i don t do cocaine for breakfast a reference to lyrics from song he continued my kitchen is usually pretty clean you know but you have fun with imagery and for me whole concept that everything has to be like nobody gets upset with a director when a director s film isn t about his life people think that with a recording artist that shit has to be like a fucking play by play of their whole life but it s not it s imagery and a little bit of satire when asked if song was an r b track ocean replied that he disliked how that in united states if you re a singer and you re black you re an r b artist period ocean stated that song does contain r b influences though he didn t feel it wasn t entirely one in nature track was released as a digital download on may 31 2011 by def jam recordings composition novacane expresses a story through its

of sorts with influence taken from alternative hip hop group pharcyde caramanica jon march 11 2011 tumblr soul rocker country teenage tartness new york times new york times company retrieved on june 17 2011 breiham tom june 16 2011 pitchfork novacane pitchfork retrieved on june 17 2011 lyrically track explores a narrative in which singer meets a girl attempting to pay her way through dental school by working in porn or at least that s what she told him protagonist meets girl at coachella a musical festival which takes place in indio california ocean serves as protagonist in song in love with a girl so gone on drugs that ocean wanting to be close to her has no choice but to get gone on those same drugs pair get high using dental local anesthetics though ocean serves as an unreliable narrator pitchfork wrote that he was probably still most reliable character in whole song song contains reference to film director stanley kubrick and his 1999 drama eyes wide shut in addition it also makes a comparison of numbness that drugs produce with use of auto tune in music business jebb charlie march 31 2011 frank ocean nostalgia ultra music review no ripcord no ripcord retrieved on june 17 2011 summing up song pitchfork also commented that novacane is a song about personal connection but also about all stupid numb human shit that gets in way of personal connection which means it s probably most honest song about personal connection on radio rappers joe budden tyga and prodigy have all released to novacane reception novacane received highly positive reviews from music critics and has been described as best song on nostalgia ultra pitchfork editor tom made song best new track and commented that song had a stripped back melodic construction with ocean crooning over a synthetic backing that practically fades into nonexistence and that it draws its power from tiny little details like throwaway observations or catches in ocean s voice andrew noz of npr also praised details in ocean s song writing stating in novacane ocean sings about falling for a porn star who wants to be a dentist it s easy to believe that he s more enticed by her dentistry aspirations than her day job new york times critic jon caramanica described song as a story of meeting a cute girl at coachella tripping hard on intoxicants and getting quickly to love that he may or may not remember next day and called song bliss ology writer jt langley noted that though song was massively depressing and that frank makes a foul mouth sound sweeter than your usual r b through his brand of crooning tricky stewart s production adds yet another morose element to provide more macabre side of drugs for love lost genre song was listed as one of best songs of year by several publications new york times placed song amongst best tracks of 2011 ology s jt langley placed song amongst best of year writing frank makes a foul mouth sound sweeter than your usual r b through his brand of crooning and tricky stewart s production adds yet another morose element to provide more macabre side of drugs for love lost genre pitchfork named song 41st best song of year musing that he might be fronting like drakes and post 808s of world but there s too much self effacement happening for ocean not to realize inherent humor in his own drama if ocean really is on that visionary kubrick shit like he claims then novacane could very well be his dr strangelove zimbio placed song at number 2 on their best hip hop songs of year list writing while every track on his mixtape nostalgia ultra warrants a listen it s radio friendly novacane that stands out as his most mature and enjoyable song to date spin named song fifth best of year describing track as a fully evolved drake song where you re slyly immersed in youthful aww shit decadence while simultaneously watching your dreams of recreational stripper booty and complimentary cocaine breakfasts get methodically dismantled promotion thumb right 270px ocean performing at coachella in 2012 according to ocean music video for novacane was a simple process talking about concept of video he stated i was just trying to connect or articulate visually feeling of being numb feeling of wanting to feel something you can t feel a lot of things can cause that numbing but in video it was some sort of topical aesthetic and a little bit of special effects video doesn t last entirety of song which director nabil elderkin stated was for artistic reasons in an interview with pitchfork he reasoned to me videos don t always have to be length of song i like idea of people thinking what was that video is shot as one long take shot in a mostly dark room ocean sits in room smoking an unspecified drug eventually he gets up and begins to smear an unknown substance onto his face random shots of pandas and rain forest imagery are also spliced into video and it ends with ocean being slapped by ghostly image of a woman mtv further summarized video ocean is surrounded by ghostly incarnations of beautiful women tigers and pandas at one point ocean smears what appears to be novocaine or on his solemn looking face supposedly it required several takes to achieve correct angle for slapping moment and spliced images were placed in video because ocean asked director whether or not they can we put some kind of asian rain forest stuff in there billboard wrote that video was minimalist and eerie pitchfork named video amongst best of year ocean embarked on a solo tour through north america and europe to promote both mixtape and his other musical projects set lists to various shows varied though novacane was performed at all shows ocean performed novacane and she with tyler creator at an ofwgkta performance in new york city track was included
