mission brisco also meets professor albert wickwire john astin an eccentric scientist who returns to help many times during series wickwire s ideas and inventions play into brisco s interest in

causing trouble signature show elements show features classic western motifs such as train robberies and gunfighter in combination with atypical elements much of series is devoted to science fiction

technology in pilot episode brisco and professor wickwire modify a rocket to run on train tracks in episode brisco for defense brisco uses a slide projector to show a trial jury fingerprint evidence professor wickwire returns many times in series to assist with technology including tinkering with motorcycles and rescuing heroes with a helium filled zeppelin campbell told starlog magazine it s kind of jules verne meets wild wild west presence of futuristic technology in a victorian era western places series in steampunk genre it is one of few such shows to have aired on prime time television at least one third of show s episodes contain steampunk or weird west elements though technology out of time frequently intrudes into plots of brisco fantastic machines or methods rarely appear again some of these out of time technologies were archaic renderings of those prevalent in 20th century and two film researchers cynthia miller and a bowdoin van riper suggest that followers of show may be puzzled that such inventions so useful in their own lives are not exploited further according to cuse show was purposely set in 1893 exactly 100 years before series premiered in 1993 brisco is meant to be aware of imminent changes in society and technology and actively looks for them writers of show and also character of brisco refer to this concept as coming thing elaborating on this theme campbell said basically this show is about turn of century when old west met industrial era cowboys still chew tobacco and ride range and states are still territories but over horizon is onset of electricity first autos and telephones brisco is in middle of a transition from past to future collision of cowboy characters with puzzling technology and other anachronisms generates humor throughout series writers made it a point to insert scenes mirroring pop culture of 20th century from apparent invention of term ufo in pilot episode to appearance of a sheriff who looks and acts like elvis presley speaking about humor of show campbell said i would say 30 percent of each episode is being played for laughs but it s not a winking at camera airplane type of humor we re funny like indiana jones is funny laughs come primarily from wide variety of ridiculous colorful characters that come in and out of this series cast thumb right upright alt picture of actor bruce campbell bruce campbell portrayed brisco county jr he auditioned five times before being offered role bruce campbell went through five auditions for role of brisco before he was hired in his first audition with casting director campbell spontaneously did a standing flip stunt impressed casting director so much that during each subsequent audition campbell was asked to do flip again in his final audition campbell assured network executives that if hired for role he would work hard to make show a success in an interview campbell said it s every actor s dream to play a cowboy so when this opportunity came up i mean yeah where do i sign he added that working on brisco provided him with acting opportunities he would not have otherwise had cuse said getting campbell was just one of those collisions between an actor and a script that was just perfect i can t imagine brisco having ever existed without him writing in auxiliary magazine luke copping claimed that brisco was campbell s last great role before actor fell into a period of self parody and overt camp that he did not redeem himself from until joining cast of burn notice christian clemenson went to harvard with cuse but still went through normal audition channels to get part of poole clemenson was apprehensive about pursuing one of lead roles in a television show because of long time commitments involved he later said similarities between this show and wild wild west and my character to that show s artemus gordon was an important hook for me it was one of my favorite shows growing up and as soon as i saw that brisco county was based on same kind of material and attitude as that show i called my agent and said i ll do anything i have to do to get this clemenson applied his experiences at ivy league schools to play uptight poole praising clemenson s work on brisco cuse said you can t give him anything he s not capable of doing he adds voice of intelligence and caution to balance our cast julius carry saw great potential in character of bowler he had researched black cowboys for a project in college and used that knowledge in his portrayal of bowler carry said that bowler was similar to real life black deputy u s marshal bass reeves in that reeves always got his man and would often pull off incredible tricks to bring people in carry knew clemenson from time they worked together on western television pilot independence he had no knowledge of campbell but approved of choice for leading man after watching army of darkness he later told starlog i saw that he would be very good with physical stuff and that he could deliver a one liner i knew situation would be good original direction for bowler was to have him constantly oppose brisco but as series progressed writers saw good natured chemistry between actors and decided to make brisco and bowler a team bowler s race was never an issue in show according to cary darling a television critic this attitude is different from serious westerns and may hew more to truth than one might think he said historians have noted that black cowboys were common and that conflicts with white cowboys were rare kelly rutherford s portrayal of dixie cousins with her emphasis on innuendo and subtext has been described as less miss kitty gunsmoke than mae west rutherford said that playing dixie allowed her to fulfill her fantasy of being madeline kahn in blazing saddles when john astin was cast he was best known for his portrayal of gomez addams in addams family cuse said that he and writers enjoyed paying homage to television star of their childhoods for us it was like oh wow we get to meet john astin in guise of employing him on this show production conception and development in 1989 indiana jones and last crusade was released in cinemas it was a commercial success earning its producers us 115 million from domestic screenings action packed story unfolding in a manner reminiscent of saturday matinee movie serials about adventures of an archaeologist was written by jeffrey boam with development and story help from carlton cuse this film was their third collaboration after lethal weapon 2 and 3 according to cuse bob greenblatt an executive at fox broadcasting company engaged him and boam to develop a television series because of indiana jones and last crusade greenblatt wanted a show that had a style similar to indiana jones movies cuse started watching old serials and noticed that many fell into two genres westerns and science fiction this gave boam and cuse idea to combine genres they decided to emulate serials style for example each act within an episode begins with a title usually a pun and ends with a cliffhanger boam and cuse did not intend for series to be historically accurate their aim was to create an action adventure with a modern feel cuse told usa today we re not approaching this show as if we were doing a period piece we see it as a contemporary program our characters just happen to be living in west with 1990s sensibilities indiana jones movies were period pieces too but you never thought of them that way anachronisms and pop culture references were intentionally inserted into series show was intended to be family friendly so violence was minimized in favor of having brisco think his way out of dangerous situations boam said in two hour pilot brisco doesn t even once have to shoot his gun our violence is cartoonish there is no pain and suffering bruce campbell was prominently featured in advertisements billboards and even a trailer shown in movie theaters cuse carlton campbell

dvd disc 1 warner bros entertainment inc when series was being promoted in summer of 1993 fox entertainment chief sandy grushow said that if campbell isn t next big television star i ll eat my desk writing cuse served as show runner and head writer boam who served as executive producer also contributed scripts for show writing staff included john wirth brad kern tom chehak david simkins and john mcnamara they followed cuse s informal instruction that tone of show remain just under over top series would be humorous but not too campy every member of staff participated in breaking down and analyzing stories they conceived worth commented there was a very high percentage of ideas that worked in room and got translated to paper that worked when you put them on film that doesn t always happen cuse described long hours writing show including several overnight sessions each episode of brisco was filmed in seven days so turn around time for scripts was one week mcnamara said that he became a student of tv history while writing for brisco reviewing old episodes of maverick for inspiration on using humor in western genre he said writing team felt television audience was ready for a trans genre form because much of audience grew up with lethal weapon star trek and wild wild west researchers porter and barry porter acknowledge writer s familiarity with mark twain s novel wilson porter and porter describe novel as an ancestor text because characters of brisco and bly both refer to it and say that this type of literary device is used again by cuse in lost one of challenges writers faced was scaling down their ideas to make them feasible for production cuse said that he let such ideas flourish because of his relative inexperience with writing for television series an example given by writers was boam s idea for a full sized pirate ship on wheels writers quickly realized they needed to scale idea down to something production designers could create they settled on putting a full pirate crew on a stagecoach with cannons kern said it was better to shoot past mark and come back to it rather than start below it he elaborated on this saying if you envision 40 foot galleon and go back from that you ll always end up with more than if you start out with a pirate on a horse as series progressed during its broadcast season writers received frequent notes and directives from fox network executives calling for increases and decreases in science fiction comedy and traditional western elements cuse said i think we did a particularly good job of maintaining continuity with all schizophrenic notes we were getting from network however midway through first season writers made a thematic shift from science fiction to more comedy and adventure cuse said we were biting off more than we could chew we were trying to do a comedic action adventure western with tongue in cheek humor genuine drama plus science fiction all these things added too many elements to serve simultaneously by final third of series writers had wrapped up science fiction plot with orb and focused more on traditional western motifs production design adventures of brisco county jr was filmed primarily on warner bros soundstages town and street scenes were staged on western backlot known as laramie street it was one of last western shows to use backlot cuse said that logistics were a problem because so many of hollywood western sets and towns had been torn down by 1990s outdoor scenes were shot on warner bros ranch in valencia california bronson canyon in los angeles and ranch in santa clarita california campbell bruce adventures of brisco county jr complete series dvd booklet warner bros entertainment inc 2006 some of locomotive scenes from brisco were filmed on

quote i was proud of pilot when brisco and bowler were tied up on railroad track and comet had to come walking up and pull rope loose and untie them and get them loose working a tv series for a trainer of horses is very tough because you don t have any time to prepare for next show it was a tough show but i was very proud of horses because they worked well they never held company up and everything seemed to work fine source gordon spencer head wrangler on adventures of brisco county jr comet was portrayed by five horses each with a different talent main horse was copper chosen by veteran wrangler gordon spencer because it was calm and gentle campbell nicknamed horse leadbelly due to its ability to remain calm during action or dialogue scenes another horse boss was used for long range shots chase scenes and elaborate stunts such as leaps through windows ace was called in when crew had to shoot scenes in which horse reared near end of season a horse named comet was trained its name chosen so that horse would get used to hearing it on set true show horse was strip which was adept at doing tricks such as lip movements head nods and hoof stamping according to spencer all those stunts as well as tying knots and opening door and going into rooms and all of that were done by strip for these scenes spencer would stand off camera and use a stick to signal strip campbell had a special pocket sewn into his costume and filled it with grain to reward strip after every take no other horse had more scenes than strip and copper with white colorings on his nose and legs strip s appearance was chosen for brisco s steed copper and other horses were touched up with clown white greasepaint to match strip s markings foley artist casey crabtree provided sounds for horse hoof movements work that was praised by sounds effects industry expert david he said of crabtree s work on brisco her horses sounded so natural and real their hooves sound of their hooves on texture of ground sound of saddle movement bridle jingles it was as good as anything i would want for a feature film and this was episodic television make up on many of briscos episodes was done by veteran artist mel berns jr two props of orb were made one of prop orbs was used for stunts and had retractable rods a second version was manufactured from cast bronze making it heavy you really didn t want to have to handle it campbell said rocket car seen in pilot episode was built by special effects coordinator kam cooney and was a working vehicle with an internal combustion engine and throttle controls some items used in show had been repurposed from older productions and some would later be used in other shows for example steam locomotive seen in pilot episode was same as one used in back to future part iii two of carry s prop guns rifles whose barrels were sawed off in fashion of mare s leg were later reused in science fiction television series firefly music stephen graziano and velton ray bunch composed original music for series composed by randy edelman distinctive theme music gained recognition beyond show s following in mid 1990s nbc sports had commissioned edelman to compose theme music for its nfl coverage at time nbc had often used excerpts from film scores as theme music for its sports broadcasts and had used a portion of edelman s gettysburg score for breeder s cup a portfolio edelman sent nbc included brisco theme and by 1996 it was being used during coverage of olympics nbc used it again as theme for their coverage of 1997 world series edelman said it was original and it seemed to have right spirit it s got a very flowing melody it s triumphant and it has a certain warmth and it has at end of it what all television things like this have a button an ending flourish that works really well if they need to chop it down into a 15 second thing cary darling said that booming theme song was part magnificent seven part aaron copland and as grand and wide

its first and only season after series ended fox retransmitted show on sunday nights at 8 00 pm during july and august 1994 show was later broadcast for a short time in syndication airing on u s cable channel tnt episodes cancellation as season progressed ratings declined greatly hurting show s chances of being renewed writer john mcnamara partially blamed briscos low ratings on its friday 8 00 p m time slot he said not many people watch television at that time so fighting for numbers then was like being stuck on normandy beach grushaw acknowledged high quality of show and vocal support from its small fan base obviously viewers are very passionate about show and when you read some of things they have to say it gives you real pause grushaw told usa today in 1994 by may of that year grushaw said renewing brisco was a 50 50 call at end of its season brisco was one of lowest rated shows of year and fox confirmed its cancellation in june briscos writers were planning for another season before show s cancellation they had not penned ending of first season as a finale for series and had broad ideas for second season which would have featured brisco settling in as sheriff of a small town in his autobiography campbell mused to explain why a tv show is canceled is almost impossible ironically brisco with its off kilter humor wouldn t have been developed on any other network yet appeal of westerns was still rural not side fox s urban bread was buttered on writer and supervising producer brad kern reflected on show s cancellation saying ten years later everybody you talk to they all love show i think that was biggest disappointment about show not coming back we knew we were doing something special told of show s success in tv guide save our shows poll sandy grushow said obviously i m happy and not entirely surprised but added you can t dismiss a season s worth of ratings kim manners director on nearly a third of brisco episodes said working on series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively he told writer joe nazzaro it really woke me up as a director almost spiritually and that directing for brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on x files manners said when they didn t give it a second year i was devastated adding that he wished cuse would have made a feature film based on brisco considering show s short life cuse later commented if show could have survived into a second season i think it could have ended up running for actually a long time some shows just sort of fall through cracks in right away and they kind of stay on air long enough to aggregate an audience i think if circumstances had been different brisco could have had a much longer life cuse carlton 2006 dvd extra adventures of brisco county jr

praised quality of pilot and called brisco his favorite fox show of 1993 he criticized pilot for being padded with outlaws and mysterious orbs diane werts of newsday similarly said that brisco just about hits bulls eye with its sharp wit and thrill a minute action although she noted that pilot was over packed with characters and subplots writing in new york times goodman said writers try everything including some business involving raiders of a lost orb without much of a payoff entertainment weeklys ken tucker enjoyed nervy attempt to do something different with tv western in pilot

very conscious of violence and i think we ve made an effort to avoid violence in pilot and in future episodes halfway through season u s senator byron dorgan singled out brisco as most violent show on

act of violence and found that brisco had 117 violent acts per hour study deemed brisco more violent than film beverly hills cop which was also viewed for study cuse called criticism patently ridiculous noting that only one episode of show was viewed in which a boxing match takes place each punch and jab was counted as an act of violence cuse spoke out against legislation to curb television violence saying that politicians were chasing a false objective he said it was job of a show s producer to control moral content of a television program and parents duty to monitor what
