forever now is third studio album by english rock band psychedelic furs 10 song album including hit single love my way was recorded in spring of 1982 and released on 25 september of that year by columbia cbs a 20th anniversary reissue included six related bonus tracks album represented a turning point in musical maturation of band after a turbulent period of personnel changes in which they shrank from a six man ensemble to a quartet working with furs for first time todd rundgren placed his own sonic imprint upon album as producer and guest musician rundgren also added new types of instrumentation to band s sound including cello and marimba background in year after recording of their second album talk talk talk 1981 psychedelic furs underwent a tumultuous time of change and in words of guitarist john ashton a bit of a dark period in band s history two of original members saxophonist duncan kilburn and guitarist roger morris abruptly and left band s main patrons at cbs records had largely left company by this time and their successful recent producer steve lillywhite was now unavailable to them even drummer vince ely s commitment to band seemed to be in question not only had their large ensemble been unexpectedly reduced to a traditional four piece band but now core members of ashton tim butler and richard butler mostly had to compose new songs without drums using a casio vl 1 synthesizer until they had developed enough music for an album choice of record producer when time came to return to a recording studio band sought out a new record producer lillywhite who had done work for both of their previous albums had other commitments and many in band felt it was time to chart a new course anyway thompson p 89 columbia management first attempted to match band with david bowie who was a high profile furs supporter and who expressed enthusiasm for working with them bowie however also had commitments which would have postponed work for what band felt would be an unacceptably long time thompson p 90 more importantly there was a belief among some band members that this partnership would not yield much of a change according to richard butler media were already making lots of comparisons between our music and his and band did not want to appear too indebted thompson pp 89 90 a last minute offer by lillywhite to fit band into his schedule was politely declined it was ely who first suggested american producer todd rundgren band members gathered for an exploratory visit to his utopia sound studio in upstate new york where rundgren who was already a fan of furs music quickly signed onto project partnership with rundgren an established industry giant known for his work with major label successes like meat loaf s bat out of p 92 was derided by some as inevitable pop sellout but others saw it as a positive development even a major production coup robbins p 447 band members themselves were pleased with rundgren s assistance and have all expressed pride in results and gratitude for experience myers pp 229 230 recording rundgren invited band to move their recording sessions from his commercial space into private studios in his own home on nearby mink hollow road lake hill new york recording was completed there over a six week period in april and may 1982 rundgren enhanced furs sound by adding new elements to their musical arrangements along with his own varied musical contributions rundgren brought in session musicians to augment band gary windo was a renowned saxophonist in jazz world who had in recent years collaborated with major rock acts like ian hunter and nick mason thompson p 102 extra horn work was contributed by donn adams a longtime player with american blues rock band nrbq thompson p 104 a classical cellist ann sheldon was recruited from royal college of music lastly seasoned pop backing vocal team of flo eddie were called in by rundgren to round out many of songs instrumentalists had all been accepted by band willingly even enthusiastically backing vocalists however were another matter myers pp 227 228 flo eddie singers howard kaylan and mark volman arrived at end of recording time when band thought all tracks were finalised when they learned of vocal duo s purpose they weren t really up for it said kaylan two veterans represented establishment w e literally felt like for first time as session guys we were proving ourselves in end however band members warmed to pair and concluded a successful session we did three or four cuts that todd had brought us up to do and we shook hands with everybody kaylan recalled but as they were preparing to leave rundgren asked them to listen to album s planned single after love my way played kaylan and volman excitedly insisted that they be allowed to record some vocals for it we have got to sing on this one kaylan recalls thinking if we don t sing on this one we re not gonna sing on hit this is fucking hit background vocals that flo eddie ultimately contributed ended up being considered one of highlights of their lengthy career rundgren also made musical contributions of his own including marimba on love my way and saxophone on no easy street myers pp 225 226 but his primary goal as producer was helping band focus their potential his more unorthodox methods included an instance of climbing to roof of studio and dropping lit firecrackers near unsuspecting band when we were sort of playing a little sluggishly as tim butler recalled by his various means rundgren motivated players to create and by his well known personal style of power pop inflected wall of sound production he restored band s sonic richness signature furs characteristic described approvingly in rolling stone as thick viscous smear of guitars drums and vocals music forever now fused furs post punk aesthetic with rundgren s power pop engineering to dramatic effect its songwriting style was gothic firmly planted in minor tones i think it was peak of our thompson p 105 remarked tim butler who also called album his favourite of his career much of album had been composed and committed to demo form before band arrived at rundgren s studio but producer felt that first crop of tunes was insufficient he expected a full working album worth of songs to be ready whereas furs believed that their creative process had always flourished best inside a studio thompson p 100 he postponed recording while furs made additional demos british keyboardist and future music producer ed buller helped to create many of demos made before band returned although never an official member of furs buller supplied much needed musical accompaniment at this stage and would go on to collaborate frequently with band over next six years when second batch arrived rundgren made major revisions and even dropped some tracks entirely by necessity then some songs were revised or fully composed in studio one of late coming compositions was sleep comes down which was written during pre album rehearsals song incorporated irregular time changes lilting and sweetly woozy and a surging psychedelic outro and became a fan favourite other prominent tracks on album include overtly political rocker president gas and danger which with its headlong pace and slamming beat was described by critic ken tucker as most ferocious impassioned song furs have ever recorded album s title track has been cited as a foremost example of rundgren s wall of sound technique album also includes one of furs most well known songs love my way although it was critically acclaimed as a brilliant single it turned out to be only a moderate hit peaking at no 44 on us billboard hot 100 and no 42 in uk singles chart song has nonetheless had an enduring afterlife it has appeared in movie soundtracks like wedding singer valley girl thompson p 212 and call me by your name in video games including rock band and grand theft auto vice city and in a wide variety of genre compilation albums ashton specifically accords buller credit as creator of memorable keyboard riff on love my way this was riff that would ultimately be played by rundgren on a marimba in what s been called best use of that instrument in rock music since stones under my thumb rundgren also left his mark on song s vocal line persuading richard butler to forego his usual sarcastic tone and instead sing it straight artwork original uk album release featured psychedelic cover art by english artist barney bubbles aka colin fulcher 1942 1983 who was later recognised as one of key pioneers of modern album cover design thompson p 121 initial uk pressings of album included a free poster of bubbles cover art thompson p 206 when it was released in us in 1982 record label changed artwork to a simpler red tinted design this horrible new wave looking generic cover in ashton s view richard butler says that when he first saw replacement cover he actually burst into tears ostensibly columbia decreed change to increase legibility of band s name and perhaps to mimic design of previous album talk talk talk release forever now was released on 25 september 1982 irvin p 472 single love my way had

calvert formerly of birthday party they toured us in november and december with a holiday break at end thompson p 124 when tour resumed in january windo was unable to make next leg to australia and
