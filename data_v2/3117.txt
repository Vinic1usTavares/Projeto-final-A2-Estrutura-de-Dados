thumb aye aye madagascariensis skeleton at museum of osteology strepsirrhini or strepsirhini is a suborder of primates that includes lemuriform primates which consist of lemurs of madagascar galagos bushbabies and pottos from africa and lorises from india and southeast asia collectively they are referred to as strepsirrhines also belonging to suborder are extinct adapiform primates that thrived during eocene in europe north america and asia but disappeared from most of northern hemisphere as climate cooled adapiforms are sometimes referred to as being lemur like although diversity of both lemurs and adapiforms does not support this comparison strepsirrhines are defined by their wet moist rhinarium tip of snout hence colloquial but inaccurate term wet nosed similar to of dogs and cats they also have a smaller brain than comparably sized simians large olfactory lobes for smell a vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta their eyes contain a reflective layer to improve their night vision and their eye sockets include a ring of bone around eye but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin c whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb a specialized set of teeth in front lower part of mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming many of today s living strepsirrhines are endangered due to habitat destruction hunting for bushmeat and live capture for exotic pet trade both living and extinct strepsirrhines are behaviorally diverse although all are primarily arboreal tree dwelling most living lemuriforms are nocturnal while most adapiforms were diurnal both living and extinct groups primarily fed on fruit leaves and insects etymology taxonomic name strepsirrhini derives from greek strepsis strepsis or a turning inward and rinos rhinos or nose which refers to appearance of sinuous comma shaped nostrils on rhinarium or wet nose name was first used by french naturalist etienne geoffroy saint hilaire in 1812 as a rank comparable to platyrrhini new world monkeys and catarrhini old world monkeys in his description he mentioned les et nostrils terminal and winding when british zoologist reginald innes pocock revived strepsirrhini and defined haplorhini in 1918 he omitted second r from both strepsirhini and haplorhini instead of strepsirrhini and haplorrhini although he did not remove second r from platyrrhini or catarrhini both of which were also named by e geoffroy in 1812 following pocock many researchers continued to spell strepsirrhini with a single r until primatologists paulina jenkins and prue napier pointed out error in 1987 evolutionary history strepsirrhines include extinct adapiforms and lemuriform primates which include lemurs and lorisoids lorises pottos and galagos strepsirrhines diverged from haplorhine primates near beginning of primate radiation between 55 and 90 mya older divergence dates are based on genetic analysis estimates while younger dates are based on scarce fossil record lemuriform primates may have evolved from either cercamoniines or sivaladapids both of which were adapiforms that may have originated in asia they were once thought to have evolved from adapids a more specialized and younger branch of adapiform primarily from europe lemurs rafted from africa to madagascar between 47 and 54 mya whereas lorises split from african galagos around 40 mya and later colonized asia lemuriforms and particularly lemurs of madagascar are often portrayed inappropriately as living fossils or as examples of basal or inferior primates these views have historically hindered understanding of mammalian evolution and evolution of strepsirrhine traits such as their reliance on smell olfaction characteristics of their skeletal anatomy and their brain size which is relatively small in case of lemurs natural selection has driven this isolated population of primates to diversify significantly and fill a rich variety of ecological niches despite their smaller and less complex brains compared to simians unclear origin divergence between strepsirrhines simians and tarsiers likely followed almost immediately after primates first evolved although few fossils of living primate groups lemuriforms tarsiers and simians are known from early to middle eocene evidence from genetics and recent fossil finds both suggest they may have been present during early adaptive radiation origin of earliest primates that simians and tarsiers both evolved from is a mystery both their place of origin and group from which they emerged are uncertain although fossil record demonstrating their initial radiation across northern hemisphere is very detailed fossil record from tropics where primates most likely first developed is very sparse particularly around time that primates and other major clades of eutherian mammals first appeared lacking detailed tropical fossils geneticists and primatologists have used genetic analyses to determine relatedness between primate lineages and amount of time since they diverged using this molecular clock divergence dates for major primate lineages have suggested that primates evolved more than 80 90 mya nearly 40 million years before first examples appear in fossil record thumb right early primates possessed adaptations for arboreal locomotion that enabled maneuvering along fine branches as seen in this slender loris early primates include both nocturnal and diurnal small bodied species and all were arboreal with hands and feet specially adapted for maneuvering on small branches plesiadapiforms from early paleocene are sometimes considered archaic primates because their teeth resembled those of early primates and because they possessed adaptations to living in trees such as a divergent big toe hallux although plesiadapiforms were closely related to primates they may represent a paraphyletic group from which primates may or may not have directly evolved and some genera may have been more closely related to colugos which are thought to be more closely related to primates first true primates euprimates do not appear in fossil record until early eocene 55 mya at which point they radiated across northern hemisphere during a brief period of rapid global warming known as paleocene eocene thermal maximum these first primates included cantius donrussellia and on northern continents as well as more questionable and fragmentary fossil altiatlasius from paleocene africa these earliest fossil primates are often divided into two groups adapiforms and omomyiforms both appeared suddenly in fossil record without transitional forms to indicate ancestry and both groups were rich in diversity and were widespread throughout eocene last branch to develop were adapiforms a diverse and widespread group that thrived during eocene 56 to 34 million years ago mya in europe north america and asia they disappeared from most of northern hemisphere as climate cooled last of adapiforms died out at end of miocene 7 mya adapiform evolution thumb upright right notharctus a type of north american adapiform resembled lemurs but did not give rise to them adapiform primates are extinct strepsirrhines that shared many anatomical similarities with lemurs they are sometimes referred to as lemur like primates although diversity of both lemurs and adapiforms do not support this analogy like living strepsirrhines adapiforms were extremely diverse with at least 30 genera and 80 species known from fossil record as of early 2000s they diversified across laurasia during eocene some reaching north america via a land bridge they were among most common mammals found in fossil beds from that time a few rare species have also been found in northern africa most basal of adapiforms include genera cantius from north america and europe and donrussellia from europe latter bears most ancestral traits so it is often considered a sister group or stem group of other adapiforms adapiforms are often divided into three major groups adapids were most commonly found in europe although oldest specimens from middle eocene china indicate that they most likely evolved in asia and immigrated they died out in europe during grande part of a significant extinction event at end of eocene notharctids which most closely resembled some of madagascar s lemurs come from europe and north america european branch is often referred to as cercamoniines north american branch thrived during eocene but did not survive into oligocene like adapids european branch were also extinct by end of eocene sivaladapids of southern and eastern asia are best known from miocene and only adapiforms to survive past eocene oligocene boundary 34 mya their relationship to other adapiforms remains unclear they had vanished before end of miocene 7 mya relationship between adapiform and lemuriform primates has not been clearly demonstrated so position of adapiforms as a paraphyletic stem group is questionable both molecular clock data and new fossil finds suggest that lemuriform divergence from other primates and subsequent lemur split both predate appearance of adapiforms in early eocene new calibration methods may reconcile discrepancies between molecular clock and fossil record favoring more recent divergence dates fossil record suggests that strepsirrhine adapiforms and haplorhine omomyiforms had been evolving independently before early eocene although their most basal members share enough dental similarities to suggest that they diverged during paleocene 66 55 mya lemuriform evolution lemuriform origins are unclear and debated american paleontologist philip gingerich proposed that lemuriform primates evolved from one of several genera of european adapids based on similarities between front lower teeth of adapids and toothcomb of extant lemuriforms however this view is not strongly supported due to a lack of clear transitional fossils instead lemuriforms may be descended from a very early branch of asian cercamoniines or sivaladapids that migrated to northern africa until discoveries of three 40 million year old fossil lorisoids and in el fayum deposits of egypt between 1997 and 2005 oldest known lemuriforms had come from early miocene 20 mya of kenya and uganda these newer finds demonstrate that lemuriform primates were present during middle eocene in afro arabia and that lemuriform lineage and all other strepsirrhine taxa had diverged before then from tunisia dates to late early or early middle eocene 52 to 46 mya and has been considered a cercamoniine but also may have been a stem lemuriform from algeria date to roughly same time and may be a sister group of together with from late eocene egypt three may qualify as stem lemuriforms from africa molecular clock estimates indicate that lemurs and lorisoids diverged in africa during paleocene approximately 62 mya between 47 and 54 mya lemurs dispersed to madagascar by rafting in isolation lemurs diversified and filled niches often filled by monkeys and apes today in africa lorises and galagos diverged during eocene approximately 40 mya unlike lemurs in madagascar they have had to compete with monkeys and apes as well as other mammals history of classification taxonomy of strepsirrhines is controversial and has a complicated history confused taxonomic terminology and oversimplified anatomical comparisons have created misconceptions about primate and strepsirrhine phylogeny illustrated by media attention surrounding single ida fossil in 2009 thumb right upright suborder strepsirrhini was proposed by e geoffroy in 1812 strepsirrhine primates were first grouped under genus lemur by swedish taxonomist carl linnaeus in 10th edition of systema naturae published in 1758 at time only three species were recognized one of which is no longer recognized as a primate in 1785 dutch naturalist pieter boddaert divided genus lemur into two genera prosimia for lemurs colugos and tarsiers and tardigradus for lorises ten years later e geoffroy and georges cuvier grouped tarsiers and galagos due to similarities in their hindlimb morphology a view supported by german zoologist johann karl wilhelm illiger who placed them in family while placing lemurs and tarsiers in family prosimia prosimii in 1811 use of tarsier galago classification continued for many years until 1898 when dutch zoologist ambrosius demonstrated two different types of placentation formation of a placenta in two groups english comparative anatomist william henry flower created suborder lemuroidea in 1883 to distinguish these primates from simians which were grouped under english biologist st george jackson mivart s suborder anthropoidea according to flower suborder lemuroidea contained families lemuridae lemurs lorises and galagos aye aye and tarsiidae tarsiers lemuroidea was later replaced by illiger s suborder prosimii many years earlier in 1812 e geoffroy first named suborder strepsirrhini in which he included tarsiers this taxonomy went unnoticed until 1918 when pocock compared structure of nose and reinstated use of suborder strepsirrhini while also moving tarsiers and simians into a new suborder haplorhini it was not until 1953 when british anatomist william charles osman hill wrote an entire volume on strepsirrhine anatomy that pocock s taxonomic suggestion became noticed and more widely used since then primate taxonomy has shifted between strepsirrhini haplorhini and prosimii anthropoidea multiple times most of academic literature provides a basic framework for primate taxonomy usually including several potential taxonomic schemes although most experts agree upon phylogeny many disagree about nearly every level of primate classification competing strepsirrhine taxonomic nomenclature 2 infraorders 3

family archaeolemuridae family cheirogaleidae family daubentoniidae family indriidae family lemuridae family lepilemuridae family megaladapidae family palaeopropithecidae infraorder lorisiformes superfamily lorisoidea family lorisidae family galagidae controversies most commonly recurring debate in during 1970s 1980s and early 2000s concerned phylogenetic position of tarsiers compared to both simians and other prosimians tarsiers are most often placed in either suborder haplorhini with simians or in suborder prosimii with strepsirrhines prosimii is one of two traditional primate suborders and is based on evolutionary grades groups united by anatomical traits rather than phylogenetic clades while strepsirrhini haplorrhini taxonomy was based on evolutionary relationships yet both systems persist because prosimii anthropoidea taxonomy is familiar and frequently seen in research literature and textbooks strepsirrhines are traditionally characterized by several ancestral traits not shared with simians particularly rhinarium other include long snouts convoluted maxilloturbinals relatively large olfactory bulbs and smaller brains toothcomb is a synapomorphy shared derived trait seen among lemuriforms although it is frequently and incorrectly used to define strepsirrhine clade strepsirrhine primates are also united in possessing an epitheliochorial placenta unlike tarsiers and simians strepsirrhines are capable of producing their own vitamin c and do not need it supplied in their diet further genetic evidence for relationship between tarsiers and simians as a haplorhine clade is shared possession of three sine markers because of their historically mixed assemblages which included tarsiers and close relatives of primates both prosimii and strepsirrhini have been considered wastebasket taxa for lower primates regardless strepsirrhine and clades are generally accepted and viewed as preferred taxonomic division yet tarsiers still closely resemble both strepsirrhines and simians in different ways and since early split between strepsirrhines tarsiers and simians is ancient and hard to resolve a third taxonomic arrangement with three suborders is sometimes used prosimii tarsiiformes and anthropoidea more often term prosimian is no longer used in official taxonomy but is still used to illustrate behavioral ecology of tarsiers relative to other primates in addition to controversy over tarsiers debate over origins of simians once called strepsirrhine clade into question arguments for an evolutionary link between adapiforms and simians made by paleontologists gingerich elwyn l simons tab rasmussen and others could have potentially excluded adapiforms from strepsirrhini in 1975 gingerich proposed a new suborder to suggest that strepsirrhines are more closely related to simians than tarsiers however no clear relationship between two had been demonstrated by early 2000s idea reemerged briefly in 2009 during media attention surrounding darwinius dubbed ida a cercamoniine from germany that was touted as a missing link between humans and earlier primates simians and adapiforms however cladistic analysis was flawed and phylogenetic inferences and terminology were vague although authors noted that darwinius was not a fossil lemur they did emphasize absence of a toothcomb which adapiforms did not possess infraordinal classification and clade terminology within strepsirrhini two common classifications include either two infraorders adapiformes and lemuriformes or three infraorders adapiformes lemuriformes lorisiformes a less common taxonomy places aye aye daubentoniidae in its own infraorder in some cases plesiadapiforms are included within order primates in which case euprimates is sometimes treated as a suborder with strepsirrhini becoming an infraorder and lemuriformes and others become parvorders regardless of infraordinal taxonomy strepsirrhini is composed of three ranked superfamilies and 14 families seven of which are extinct three of these extinct families included recently extinct giant lemurs of madagascar many of which died out within last 1 000 years following human arrival on island thumb upright right media attention over ida played upon confused terminology and misconceptions about strepsirrhines when strepsirrhini is divided into two infraorders clade containing all toothcombed primates can be called lemuriforms when it is divided into three infraorders term lemuriforms refers only to madagascar s lemurs and toothcombed primates are referred to as either crown strepsirrhines or extant strepsirrhines confusion of this specific terminology with general term strepsirrhine along with oversimplified anatomical comparisons and vague phylogenetic inferences can lead to misconceptions about primate phylogeny and misunderstandings about primates from eocene as seen with media coverage of darwinius because skeletons of adapiforms share strong similarities with those of lemurs and lorises researchers have often referred to them as primitive strepsirrhines lemur ancestors or a sister group to living strepsirrhines they are included in strepsirrhini and are considered basal members of clade although their status as true primates is not questioned questionable relationship between adapiforms and other living and fossil primates leads to multiple classifications within strepsirrhini often adapiforms are placed in their own infraorder due to anatomical differences with lemuriforms and their unclear relationship when shared traits with lemuriforms which may or may not be are emphasized they are sometimes reduced to families within infraorder lemuriformes or superfamily lemuroidea first fossil primate described was adapiform adapis by french naturalist georges cuvier in 1821 who compared it to a hyrax le daman then considered a member of a now obsolete group called pachyderms it was not recognized as a primate until it was reevaluated in early 1870s originally adapiforms were all included under family adapidae which was divided into two or three subfamilies adapinae notharctinae and sometimes all north american adapiforms were lumped under notharctinae while old world forms were usually assigned to adapinae around 1990s two distinct groups of european adapids began to emerge based on differences in postcranial skeleton and teeth one of these two european forms was identified as cercamoniines which were allied with notharctids found mostly in north america while other group falls into traditional classification three major adapiform divisions are now typically regarded as three families within adapiformes notharctidae adapidae and sivaladapidae but other divisions ranging from one to five families are used as well anatomy and physiology grooming apparatus thumb right strepsirrhines have a reflective layer in eye called a tapetum lucidum that helps them see better at night all lemuriforms possess a specialized dental structure called a toothcomb with exception of aye aye in which structure has been modified into two continually growing incisors or canine teeth similar to those of rodents often toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines instead it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms lemuriforms groom orally and also possess a grooming claw on second toe of each foot for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to mouth and tongue it is unclear whether adapiforms possessed grooming claws toothcomb consists of either two or four procumbent lower incisors and procumbent lower canine teeth followed by a canine shaped premolar it is used to comb fur during oral grooming shed hairs that accumulate between teeth of toothcomb are removed by sublingua or under tongue lemuriforms also possess a grooming claw on second digit of each foot for scratching adapiforms did not possess a toothcomb instead their lower incisors varied in orientation from somewhat procumbent to somewhat vertical and lower canines were projected upwards and were often prominent adapiforms may have had a grooming claw but there is little evidence of this eyes like all primates strepsirrhine orbits eye sockets have a postorbital bar a protective ring of bone created by a connection between frontal and zygomatic bones both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind eye referred to as postorbital closure which is only seen in haplorhine primates although eyes of strepsirrhines point forward giving stereoscopic vision orbits do not face fully forward among living strepsirrhines most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind retina of eye called a tapetum lucidum consisting of riboflavin crystals which improves vision in low light but they lack a fovea which improves day vision this differs from tarsiers which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea skull thumb right strepsirrhines are characterized by a typically longer snout and wet nose compared to haplorhine primates strepsirrhine primates have a brain relatively comparable to or slightly larger in size than most mammals compared to simians however they have a relatively small brain to body size ratio strepsirrhines are also traditionally noted for their unfused mandibular symphysis two halves of lower jaw however fusion of mandibular symphysis was common in adapiforms notably notharctus also several extinct giant lemurs exhibited a fused mandibular symphysis ears many nocturnal species have large independently movable ears although there are significant differences in sizes and shapes of ear between species structure of middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between lemurs and lorisoids in lemurs tympanic cavity which surrounds middle ear is expanded this leaves ectotympanic ring which supports eardrum free within auditory bulla this trait is also seen in adapiforms in lorisoids however tympanic cavity is smaller and ectotympanic ring becomes attached to edge of auditory bulla tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces which are not present in lemurs neck arteries both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced internal carotid artery with an enlarged ascending pharyngeal artery ankle bones strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus ankle bones that differentiate them from haplorhines such as a sloping talo fibular facet face where talus bone and fibula meet and a difference in location of position of flexor tendon on talus these differences give strepsirrhines ability to make more complex rotations of ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted or turned inward an adaptation for grasping vertical supports sex characteristics sexual dichromatism different coloration patterns between males and females can be seen in most brown lemur species but otherwise lemurs show very little if any difference in body size or weight between sexes this lack of sexual dimorphism is not characteristic of all strepsirrhines some adapiforms were sexually dimorphic with males bearing a larger sagittal crest a ridge of bone on top of skull to which jaw muscles attach and canine teeth lorisoids exhibit some sexual dimorphism but males are typically no more than 20 percent larger than females rhinarium and olfaction thumb right noses of five prosimian primates a dwarf lemur b greater galago c lesser galago d aye aye and e a through d possess a rhinarium and are strepsirrhines whereas e does not and is a haplorhine strepsirrhines have a long snout that ends in a moist and touch sensitive rhinarium similar to that of dogs and many other mammals rhinarium is surrounded by vibrissae that are also sensitive to touch convoluted maxilloturbinals on inside of their nose filter warm and moisten incoming air while olfactory receptors of main olfactory system lining detect airborne smells olfactory bulbs of lemurs are comparable in size to those of other arboreal mammals surface of rhinarium does not have any olfactory receptors so it is not used for smell in terms of detecting volatile substances instead it has sensitive touch receptors merkel cells rhinarium upper lip and gums are tightly connected by a fold of mucous membrane called philtrum which runs from tip of nose to mouth upper lip is constrained by this connection and has fewer nerves to control movement which leaves it less mobile than upper lips of simians philtrum creates a gap diastema between roots of first two upper incisors strepsirrhine rhinarium can collect relatively non volatile fluid based chemicals traditionally categorized as pheromones and transmit them to vomeronasal organ vno which is located below and in front of nasal cavity above mouth vno is an encased duct like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from air passing through nasal cavity vno is connected to mouth through nasopalatine ducts which communicate via incisive foramen which pass through hard palate at top front of mouth fluids traveling from rhinarium to mouth and then up nasopalatine ducts to vno are detected and information is relayed to accessory olfactory bulb which is relatively large in strepsirrhines from accessory olfactory bulb information is sent to amygdala which handles emotions and then to hypothalamus which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes this neural pathway differs from that used by main olfactory system all lemuriforms have a vno as do tarsiers and some new world monkeys adapiforms exhibit gap between upper incisors which indicates presence of a vno but there is some disagreement over whether or not they possessed a rhinarium reproductive physiology extant strepsirrhines have an epitheliochorial placenta where maternal blood does not come in direct contact with fetal chorion like it does in placenta of haplorhines strepsirrhine uterus has two distinct chambers bicornuate despite having similar gestation periods to comparably sized haplorhines fetal growth rates are generally slower in strepsirrhines which results in newborn offspring that are as little as one third size of haplorhine newborns extant strepsirrhines also have a lower basal metabolic rate which elevates in females during gestation putting greater demands on mother most primates have two mammary glands but number and positions vary between species within strepsirrhines lorises have two pairs while others like ring tailed lemur have one pair on chest pectoral aye aye also has two mammary glands but they are located near groin inguinal in females clitoris is sometimes enlarged and pendulous resembling male penis which can make sex identification difficult for human observers clitoris may also have a bony structure in it similar to baculum penis bone in males most male primates have a baculum but it is typically larger in strepsirrhines and usually forked at tip behavior thumb upright right like other primates infants often cling to their mother s fur approximately three quarters of all extant strepsirrhine species are nocturnal sleeping in nests made from dead leaves or tree hollows during day all of lorisoids from continental africa and asia are nocturnal a circumstance that minimizes their competition with simian primates of region which are diurnal lemurs of madagascar living in absence of simians are more variable in their activity cycles aye aye mouse lemurs woolly lemurs and sportive lemurs are nocturnal while ring tailed lemurs and most of their kin sifakas and are diurnal yet some or all of brown lemurs eulemur are cathemeral which means that they may be active during day or night depending on factors such as temperature and predation many extant strepsirrhines are well adapted for nocturnal activity due to their relatively large eyes large movable ears sensitive tactile hairs strong sense of smell and tapetum lucidum behind retina among adapiforms most are considered diurnal with exception of pronycticebus and from middle eocene europe both of which had large orbits that suggest reproduction in most strepsirrhine species tends to be seasonal particularly in lemurs key factors that affect seasonal reproduction include length of wet season subsequent food availability and maturation time of species like other primates strepsirrhines are relatively slow breeders compared to other mammals their gestation period and interbirth intervals are usually long and young develop slowly just like in haplorhine primates unlike simians some strepsirrhines produce two or three offspring although some produce only a single offspring those that produce multiple offspring tend to build nests for their young these two traits are thought to be plesiomorphic ancestral for primates young are precocial relatively mature and mobile at birth but not as coordinated as ungulates hoofed mammals infant care by mother is relatively prolonged compared to many other mammals and in some cases infants cling to mother s fur with their hands and feet despite their relatively smaller brains compared to other primates lemurs have demonstrated levels of technical intelligence in problem solving that are comparable to those seen in simians however their social intelligence differs often emphasizing within group competition over cooperation which may be due to adaptations for their unpredictable environment although lemurs have not been observed using objects as tools in wild they can be trained to use objects as tools in captivity and demonstrate a basic understanding about functional properties of objects they are using social systems and communication nocturnal strepsirrhines have been traditionally described as solitary although this term is no longer favored by researchers who study them many are considered solitary foragers but many exhibit complex and diverse social organization often overlapping home ranges initiating social contact at night and sharing sleeping sites during day even mating systems are variable as seen in woolly lemurs which live in monogamous breeding pairs because of this social diversity among these solitary but social primates whose level of social interaction is comparable to that of diurnal simians alternative classifications have been proposed to emphasize their gregarious dispersed or solitary nature among extant strepsirrhines only diurnal and cathemeral lemurs have evolved to live in multi male multi female groups comparable to most living simians this social trait seen in two extant lemur families indriidae and lemuridae is thought to have evolved independently group sizes are smaller in social lemurs than in simians and despite similarities community structures differ female dominance which is rare in simians is fairly common in lemurs strepsirrhines spend a considerable amount of time grooming each other allogrooming when lemuriform primates groom they lick fur and then comb it with their toothcomb they also use their grooming claw to scratch places they cannot reach with their mouth like new world monkeys strepsirrhines rely on scent marking for much of their communication this involves smearing secretions from epidermal scent glands on tree branches along with urine and feces in some cases strepsirrhines may anoint themselves with urine urine washing body postures and gestures may be used although long snout non mobile lips and reduced facial restrict use of facial expressions in strepsirrhines short range calls long range calls and alarm calls are also used nocturnal species are more constrained by lack of light so their communication systems differ from those of diurnal species often using long range calls to claim their territory locomotion living strepsirrhines are predominantly arboreal with only ring tailed lemur spending considerable time on ground most species move around quadrupedally on four legs in trees including five genera of smaller nocturnal lemurs galagos indriids sportive lemurs and bamboo lemurs leap from vertical surfaces and indriids are highly specialized for vertical clinging and leaping lorises are slow moving deliberate climbers analyses of extinct adapiforms postcranial skeletons suggest a variety of locomotor behavior european adapids adapis and leptadapis shared adaptations for slow climbing like lorises although they may have been quadrupedal runners like small new world monkeys both notharctus and smilodectes from north america and from europe exhibit limb proportions and joint surfaces comparable to vertical clinging and leaping lemurs but were not as specialized as indriids for vertical clinging suggesting that they ran along branches and did not leap as much notharctids cantius and pronycticebus appear to have been agile arboreal quadrupeds with adaptations comparable to brown lemurs diet primates primarily feed on fruits including seeds leaves including flowers and animal prey arthropods small vertebrates and eggs diets vary markedly between strepsirrhine species like other leaf eating primates some strepsirrhines can digest cellulose and hemicellulose some strepsirrhines such as galagos slender lorises and angwantibos are primarily insectivorous other species such as fork marked lemurs and needle clawed bushbabies specialize on tree gum while indriids sportive lemurs and bamboo lemurs are many strepsirrhines are frugivores fruit eaters and others like ring tailed lemur and mouse lemurs are omnivores eating a mix of fruit leaves and animal matter among adapiforms frugivory seems to have been most common diet particularly for medium sized to large species such as cantius and folivory was also common among medium and large sized adapiforms including smilodectes notharctus adapis and leptadapis sharp cusps on teeth of some of smaller adapiforms such as and donrussellia indicate that they were either partly or primarily insectivorous distribution and habitat now extinct adapiform primates were primarily found across north america asia and europe with a few species in africa they flourished during eocene when those regions were more tropical in nature and they disappeared when climate became cooler and drier today lemuriforms are confined in tropics ranging between 28deg s to 26deg n latitude lorises are found both in equatorial africa and southeast asia while galagos are limited to forests and woodlands of sub saharan africa lemurs are endemic to madagascar although much of their diversity and habitat has been lost due to recent human activity as with nearly all primates strepsirrhines typically reside in tropical rainforests these habitats allow strepsirrhines and other primates to evolve diverse communities of sympatric species in eastern rainforests of madagascar as many as 11 or 12 species share same forests and prior to human arrival some forests had nearly double that diversity several species of lemur are found in drier seasonal forests including spiny forest on southern tip of island although lemur communities in these regions are not as rich conservation thumb right strepsirrhines are threatened by deforestation in tropical regions like all other non human primates strepsirrhines face an elevated risk of extinction due to human activity particularly deforestation in tropical regions much of their habitat has been converted for human use such as agriculture and pasture threats facing strepsirrhine primates fall into three main categories habitat destruction hunting for bushmeat or traditional medicine and live capture for export or local exotic pet trade although hunting is often prohibited laws protecting them are rarely enforced in madagascar local taboos known as fady sometimes help protect lemur species although some are still hunted for traditional medicine in 2012 international union for conservation of nature iucn announced that lemurs were most endangered mammals due largely to elevated illegal logging and hunting following a political crisis in 2009 in southeast asia slow lorises are threatened by exotic pet trade and traditional medicine in addition to habitat destruction both lemurs and slow lorises are protected from commercial international trade under cites appendix i notes references literature cited category primate
