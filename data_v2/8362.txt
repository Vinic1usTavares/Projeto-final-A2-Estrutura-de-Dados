peter matthews born 1978 is an english artist who specialises in creating paintings while immersed in water often floating on or submerged in oceans this timescale of this process can range from several hours to a few days he works with art materials strapped about his person and allows movement of ocean and its waves to paint his pictures for him he has been identified as being part of a long english tradition of maritime art whilst his abstract style has been compared to that of american expressionist jasper johns his creative process has occasionally led him into danger and has resulted in his receiving injuries and even catching diseases matthews work has been exhibited internationally as well as being used to illustrate aspects of scientific research in marine biology background peter mathews was born in 1978 originally from derby he spent much of his youth exploring countryside of derbyshire particularly its forests and rivers matthews ascribes these early hikes to his attraction to solitude in an interview with bbc news he described his feeling of allure to mysterious and omnipresent call of wild as an artist however matthews calls cornwall his ancestral home his maternal grandfather sold fish in leicester says matthews so i like to think it s in my roots on working at sea although he personally rejects description of environmental artist he has also been called an ocean based visual artist and on one occasion even a mystical waterman his work focussed on sea as it is has been identified as part of a long tradition of british artists fascination with maritime which includes artists as turner fishermen at sea and snow storm steam boat off a harbour s mouth and constable seascape study with rain clouds andrew friend a contemporary of matthews also takes an immersive approach to his own seascapes matthews original inspiration for his way of working was a 2007 near death experience this occurred while he was surfing off mexico when sea became increasingly rough and he became separated from his surfboard he was eventually hit by a rogue wave by then he was floundering in ocean with a gut wrenching sense of fear being completely at mercy of ocean he later recalled technique alt a painting called interim by peter matthews made in sea and looking all scratchy left thumb matthews interim 2017 created using oil acrylic pencil and oil bar on canvas illustrates his technique matthews has created his work in earth s oceans cornwall hawaii and taiwan in doing so he can spend long periods ranging from hours to days floating or submerging in ocean he keeps his artistic media either cached in his hat or strapped to his wrists or ankles this includes charcoal and gel pens and surfaces he draws on can range from paper to canvas sheeting pinned to old piece of plywood which acts both as a drawing board and a floatation device working this way it has been said helps matthews try and capture state of suspension people feel while they are bobbing in water this also allows him to explore in his words fluid midpoint between sea and land thought and form matthews often enters water at dawn and may stay immersed until nightfall and effectively lets ocean do work for him sometimes work is left exposed to elements and tides overnight in which piece continues its natural development matthews has described himself as merely being instrument by which sea draw s itself matthews work has itself encountered danger having been buried on a beach by a mudslide never to be found again and on other occasions being swept away or sinking in sea problems matthews personally faces are those of his environment he has suffered numbness hypothermia and as well as receiving dog snake jellyfish and insect bites as a result his working method has been described eccentric to get himself in mindset to create piece entitled with forces of pacific and atlantic oceans matthews constructed a speaker system out of a cd player and a tripod he then played himself recordings of sound of pacific ocean over a period of days floating in atlantic ocean on one occasion matthews submerged himself to ocean bed where he used waterproof ink on canvasses weighted down with rocks whilst when in california he slept in californian desert and painted with one of blackest paints on earth reception matthews has exhibited internationally with sale prices in saatchi gallery reaching thousands of pounds his work has been exhibited in turin dortmund folkestone and laguna beach he has lectured for university audiences at for instance university of california san diego and was artist in residence at scripps institution of oceanography matthews style has been compared in its scratchy abstract nature with work of cy twombly and jasper johns but with a greater degree of stream of consciousness often bordering brilliant and ridiculous other critic s comments have described his work as mind boggling oceanography with native american mythology plus a splash of quirky inventiveness and as being nervously textured university of california san diego has used matthews work as an example of how popular interest in subjects such as marine biology and maritime history can be developed and encouraged references sources external links official website category 1978 births category 21st century english artists
