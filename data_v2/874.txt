an 18th century dutch meermin slave mutiny took place in february 1766 and lasted for three weeks meermin was one of dutch east india company s fleet of slave ships her final voyage was cut short by mutiny of her cargo of malagasy people who had been sold to dutch east india company officials on madagascar to be used as company slaves in its cape colony in southern africa during mutiny half ship s crew and almost 30 malagasy lost their lives meermin set sail from madagascar on 20 january 1766 heading to cape colony two days into trip johann krause ship s chief merchant persuaded captain gerrit muller to release malagasy slaves from their shackles and thus avoid attrition by death and disease in their overcrowded living conditions malagasy were put to working ship and entertaining crew in mid february krause ordered malagasy to clean some madagascan weapons which they used to seize ship in an attempt to regain their freedom krause was among first of crew to be killed and muller was stabbed three times but survived crew negotiated a truce under terms of which malagasy undertook to spare lives of surviving crew members in exchange it was agreed that meermin would return to madagascar where malagasy would be released but gambling on malagasy s ignorance of navigation wounded muller instead ordered his crew to head for coast of southern africa after making landfall at struisbaai in cape colony which malagasy were assured was their homeland 50 70 of them went ashore their intention was to signal to others still on board meermin if it was safe for them to follow but shore party soon found themselves confronted by a militia of farmers formed in response to meermins arrival farmers had understood that as ship was flying no flags it was in distress meermins crew now led by krause s assistant olof leij managed to communicate with militia on shore by means of messages in bottles and persuaded them to light signal fires for which malagasy still on board were waiting on seeing fires malagasy cut ship s anchor cable and allowed ship to drift towards shore after which she ran aground on an offshore sandbank malagasy could then see militia on shore preparing to come to ship s assistance and realised that their situation was hopeless they surrendered and were once again shackled captain muller ship s mate daniel carel gulik and krause s assistant olof leij were tried in dutch east india company s council of justice all three were fired from company while muller and gulik were also stripped of their rank and wages slaves were not tried but two surviving leaders of mutiny named in dutch east india company records as massavana and koesaaij were sent to robben island for observation where massavana died three years later koesaaij survived there for

massavana malagasy had planned for a long time to become masters of ship and their aim was to go back to their own country it may be that malagasy had originally intended to sail ship themselves as
