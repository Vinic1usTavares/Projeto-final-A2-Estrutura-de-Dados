or using victorian literature for television devised concept of series moffat had previously adapted strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde for 2007 series jekyll while gatiss had written dickensian doctor who episode unquiet dead moffat and gatiss both doctor who writers discussed plans for a holmes adaptation during their numerous train journeys to cardiff where doctor who production is based while they were in monte carlo for an awards ceremony producer sue vertue who is married to moffat encouraged moffat and gatiss to develop project themselves before another creative team had same idea sue vertue steven moffat and mark gatiss dvd audio commentary for a study in pink moffat and gatiss invited stephen thompson to write for series in september 2008 thompson steve introduction in gatiss has criticised recent television adaptations of conan doyle stories as too reverential and too slow aiming instead to be as irreverent to canon as 1930s and 1940s films starring basil rathbone and nigel bruce which were mostly set in then contemporary interwar era benedict cumberbatch s sherlock uses modern technology such as texting internet and gps to solve crimes paul mcguigan who directed two episodes of sherlock says that this is in keeping with conan doyle s character pointing out that i n books he would use any device possible and he was always in lab doing experiments it s just a modern day version of it he will use tools that are available to him today in order to find things out update maintains various elements of original stories such as baker street address and holmes adversary moriarty some of these elements are transposed to present day for example martin freeman s watson has returned from military service in afghanistan while discussing fact that original watson was invalided home after serving in second anglo afghan war 1878 80 gatiss realised that i t is same war now i thought same unwinnable war sherlock was announced as a single 60 minute drama production at edinburgh international television festival in august 2008 with broadcast set for mid to late 2009 intention was to produce a series of six 60 minute episodes should pilot prove to be successful first version of pilot reported by guardian to have cost ps800 000 led to rumours within bbc and wider media that sherlock was a potential disaster bbc decided not to transmit pilot requesting a reshoot and a total of three 90 minute episodes original pilot was included on dvd of first series during audio commentary creative team said that bbc were very happy with pilot but asked them to change format critic mark lawson observes that pilot that was on air was substantially expanded and rewritten and completely reimagined in look pace and sound in july 2009 bbc drama department announced plans for three 90 minute episodes to be broadcast in 2010 moffat had previously announced that if a series of sherlock was commissioned gatiss would take over duties of executive producer so that he could concentrate on producing doctor who cast and characters moffat and vertue became interested in casting cumberbatch as title character after watching his performance in 2007 film atonement actor was cast after reading script for creative team unlocking sherlock documentary included on series 1 dvd blu ray release cumberbatch says guardian has a reputation for playing odd brilliant men very well and his holmes is cold slightly cumberbatch said there s a great charge you get from playing him because of volume of words in your head and speed of thought you really have to make your connections incredibly fast he is one step ahead of audience and of anyone around him with normal intellect they can t quite fathom where his leaps are taking him piers wenger head of drama at bbc cymru wales described series rendering of sherlock as a dynamic superhero in a modern world an arrogant genius sleuth driven by a desire to prove himself cleverer than perpetrator and police everyone in fact addressing changing social attitudes and broadcasting regulations cumberbatch s holmes replaced pipe with multiple nicotine patches writers believed that sherlock should not talk like a completely modern person says moffat but were initially intent that he never sounded like he s giving a lecture moffat turned character more victorian in second series capitalising more on cumberbatch s beautiful voice to make it sound like he s giving a lecture in an interview with observer co creator mark gatiss says that they experienced more difficulty finding right actor to play dr john watson than they had for title character producer sue vertue said benedict was only person we actually saw for part of sherlock once benedict was there it was really just making sure we got chemistry for john watson and i think you get it as soon as they come into room you can see that they work together several actors auditioned for part of watson and martin freeman eventually took role steven moffat said that matt smith was first to audition unsuccessfully he was rejected for being too barmy as producers required someone straighter for watson shortly after moffat cast smith as eleventh doctor in doctor who writers said that freeman s casting developed way in which cumberbatch played holmes theme of friendship appealed to both gatiss and moffat moffat steven introduction in gatiss asserted importance of achieving correct tone for character watson is not an idiot although it s true that conan doyle always took piss out of him said gatiss but only an idiot would surround himself with idiots moffat said that freeman is sort of opposite of benedict in everything except amount of talent martin finds a sort of poetry in ordinary man i love fastidious realism of everything he does freeman describes his character as a moral compass for sherlock who does not always consider morality and ethics of his actions rupert graves was cast as di greg lestrade writers referred to character as inspector lestrade during development until gatiss realised that in contemporary england character would have title detective inspector moffat and gatiss pointed out that lestrade does not appear often in stories and is quite inconsistently portrayed in them they decided to go with version that appeared in adventure of six napoleons a man who is frustrated by holmes but admires him and whom holmes considers as best person at scotland yard several candidates took a comedic tack in their auditions but creative team preferred gravitas that graves brought to role his first name is revealed to be greg in hounds of baskerville andrew scott made his first appearance as jim moriarty in great game moffat said we knew what we wanted to do with moriarty from very beginning moriarty is usually a rather dull rather posh villain so we thought someone who was genuinely properly frightening someone who s an absolute psycho moffat and gatiss were originally not going to put a confrontation between moriarty and holmes into these three episodes but after seeing scott s audition they realised that they just had to do a confrontation scene we had to do a version of scene in final problem in which two archenemies meet each other remainder of regular cast includes una stubbs who has known cumberbatch since he was four years old as she had worked with his mother wanda

directed second three episodes were filmed in reverse order of their broadcast thumb left north gower street in london was used for exterior shots of location of holmes baker street residence alt a street with crew members looking towards a cafe and a house gatiss says that they wanted to fetishise modern london in way that period versions fetishise victorian london production was based at hartswood films cardiff production unit hartswood films west which was opened in late 2009 to take advantage of bbc s planned cardiff bay drama village production of first two series was based at upper boat studios where doctor who had been produced cardiff was more economical than in london with some good matches for parts of london some architecture could not be faked so location shooting in english capital was necessary location shots for 221b baker street were filmed at 187 north gower street baker street was impractical because of heavy traffic and number of things labelled sherlock holmes which would need to be disguised executive producer beryl vertue explains how it was important to design entirety of sherlock s flat as a contemporary set yet still convey his eccentricity he would not she says live somewhere too suburban or too modern speedy s sandwich shop below flat used as holmes residence reported a sharp rise in new customers who recognised it from show costumes for pilot were designed by bafta cymru award winning costume designer ray holman cumberbatch wore a ps1 000 belstaff coat in series sarah arthur series costume designer explained how she achieved detective s look holmes wouldn t have any interest in fashion so i went for classic suits with a modern twist narrow leg trousers and a two button slim cut jacket i also went for slim cut shirts and a sweeping coat for all action scenes it looks great against london skyline writers say that they did not want to force modernity onto story there were some creative challenges such as decision to include sign 221b on holmes front door gatiss and moffat reflect that in modern world door would only display number of house and there would be doorbells for each flat full house number is so iconic that they felt unable to change it writers also decided that lead characters would address each other by their first names rather than traditional holmes and watson this was also reflected in title of series director paul mcguigan came up with idea of putting text messages on screen instead of having cut away shots of a hand holding phone thumb martin freeman and benedict cumberbatch filming third series of sherlock august 2013 producers found it difficult to coordinate schedules of principal players and moffat and gatiss for a second series cumberbatch and freeman both worked on 2012 film hobbit an unexpected journey and moffat continued as doctor whos showrunner and head writer in response to time pressure guardian asserted series features reworkings of three of conan doyle s most recognised tales gatiss says that there had been an argument for producing these tales over three years but moffat explained that they rejected deferred pleasure relationship between holmes and watson

appreciation index observer said show was a cross between and i and bourne ultimatum there is also a hint of doctor who about drama hardly surprising since it has been written and created by doctor who writers mark gatiss and steven moffat guardians dan martin said it s early days but first of three 90 minute movies a study in pink is brilliantly promising it has finesse of spooks but is indisputably sherlock holmes deduction sequences are ingenious and plot is classic moffat intricacy tom sutcliffe for independent wrote sherlock is a triumph witty and knowing without ever undercutting flair and dazzle of original it understands that holmes isn t really about plot but about charisma flagrantly unfaithful to original in some respects sherlock is wonderfully loyal to it in every way that matters lead actors were commended critic victoria thorpe said freeman s dependable capable watson unlocks this modern holmes a man who now describes himself as a high functioning sociopath following second series opening episode sarah crompton for telegraph asserts that cumberbatch is utterly credible as a man who lives entirely in his cerebellum with little regard for world outside mak ing sherlock perfect depiction of holmes for our times conan doyle fans were generally appreciative gwilym mumford for guardian suggested that this has to do with fact that moffat and gatiss are enormously knowledgeable about conan doyle s work and their reimagining incorporates big and small screen adaptations of holmes as well as original stories as gatiss puts it everything is canonical sarah crompton for telegraph identifies some of jokes and allusions intended for fans commenting specifically on second series finale reichenbach fall guardians sam wollaston praised show s
