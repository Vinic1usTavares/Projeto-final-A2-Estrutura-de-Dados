sts 125 or hst sm4 hubble space telescope servicing mission 4 was fifth and final space shuttle mission to hubble space telescope hst and last solo flight of space shuttle atlantis launch of space shuttle atlantis occurred on 11 may 2009 at 2 01 pm edt landing occurred on 24 may at 11 39 am edt delos reyes julius 2009 atlantis lands at edwards desert eagle vol 2 no 24 29 may 2009 issue p 1 with mission lasting a total of just under 13 days carried two new instruments to hubble space telescope cosmic origins spectrograph and wide field camera 3 mission also replaced a fine guidance sensor six gyroscopes and two battery unit modules to allow telescope to continue to function at least through 2014 crew also installed new thermal blanket insulating panels to provide improved thermal protection and a soft capture mechanism that would aid in safe de orbiting of telescope by a robotic spacecraft at end of its operational lifespan mission also carried an imax camera with which crew documented progress of mission for 2010 imax film hubble crew of sts 125 included three astronauts who had previous experience servicing hubble scott altman visited hubble in 2002 as commander of sts 109 fourth hubble servicing mission john grunsfeld an astronomer has serviced hubble twice performing a total of five spacewalks on sts 103 in 1999 and sts 109 michael massimino served with both altman and grunsfeld on sts 109 and performed two spacewalks to service telescope nasa managers and engineers declared mission a complete success completion of all major objectives as well as some that were not considered vital upgraded hubble telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years before and made it more powerful upgrades helped hubble to see deeper into universe and farther into past closer to time of big bang sts 125 was only visit to hubble space telescope for atlantis telescope had been previously serviced twice by discovery and once each by columbia and endeavour mission was 30th flight of space shuttle atlantis and also first by atlantis in over 14 years not to visit a space station last one being sts 66 crew thumbnail prince philip of united kingdom visited goddard space flight center in may 2007 and met with crew of sts 125 mission history fifth servicing mission to hubble hst sm4 was originally scheduled to launch in late 2005 or early 2006 on 16 january 2004 then nasa administrator sean o keefe canceled mission as well as any future missions to hubble citing safety constraints imposed by columbia accident investigation board during announcement o keefe stated that it was his decision alone and not a recommendation from any other departments decision was widely criticized by media science community and those in nasa maryland senator barbara mikulski a member of senate subcommittee that oversees nasa s budget publicly accused o keefe of making a decision outside transparency process against wishes of science community and stated she would work to reverse decision in march 2004 representative mark udall introduced a bill to house of representatives that requested an independent panel of experts review o keefe s decision to cancel servicing mission also in march 2004 space telescope science institute stsci director stephen beckwith released results of hubble ultra deep field survey to entire science community which helped show public how important hubble was to science data showed deepest images ever taken by a telescope and revealed approximately 10 000 galaxies some of which most likely dated back to when universe was just five hundred million years old with beckwith when he released data to scientific community was mikulski who said of results i think it s just amazing this is why i will continue to stand up for hubble joining mikulski as an advocate for servicing hubble was nasa s chief scientist physicist john grunsfeld who was present at meeting when o keefe announced cancellation of mission a veteran astronaut of four shuttle missions including two hubble servicing missions grunsfeld had devoted years to hubble and was very disappointed when o keefe canceled mission he briefly considered retiring from nasa but realized if he stayed he could continue to advance physics in other ways instead grunsfeld dedicated himself to finding alternate ways to service telescope possibly by sending a robot into orbit to do job when o keefe announced his resignation as administrator in december 2004 five days after a national academy of sciences committee opposed o keefe s position regarding servicing hubble media and science community saw hope for telescope s servicing mission to be reinstated page 287 o keefe s replacement michael d griffin took just two months after his appointment to announce that he disagreed with o keefe s decision and would consider sending a shuttle to repair hubble page 206 as an engineer griffin had previously worked on hubble s construction and respected discoveries telescope brought to science community he agreed with national academy of sciences that a robotic mission was not feasible and said that in light of return to flight changes made following columbia accident a shuttle mission to repair hubble should be reassessed page 207 after successes of return to flight sts 114 and sts 121 missions and lessons learned and improvements made following those missions managers and engineers worked to formulate a plan that would allow shuttle to service hubble while still adhering to post columbia safety requirements on 31 october 2006 griffin announced that hubble servicing mission was reinstated scheduled for 2008 and announced crew that would fly mission which included grunsfeld senator mikulski expressed her delight at news stating hubble telescope has been greatest telescope since galileo invented first one it has gone to look at places in universe that we didn t know existed before new yorker and dedicated new york mets fan mike massimino brought home plate from shea stadium along on mission he was forced to slightly alter plate to allow it to fit into locker designated for memorabilia massimino presented plate back to mets management upon return and threw out first pitch there plate is now on display at citi field 9 weird things that flew on nasa s space shuttles final shuttle

shuttle processing thumb atlantis and endeavour were launch pad neighbors for last time in preparation for sts 125 thumb atlantis at lc 39a prior to launch after rss was retracted sts 125 was first assigned to discovery with a launch date no earlier than may 2008 this originally moved mission ahead of sts 119 iss assembly flight 15 delays to several shuttle missions resulted in a change in mission ordering and orbiter was changed to atlantis on 8 january 2007 crew of atlantis went to kennedy space center for crew equipment interface test in early july 2008 this allowed sts 125 crew to get familiar with orbiter and hardware they would be using during flight launch delays on 22 august 2008 after a delay following tropical storm fay atlantis was rolled from orbiter processing facility to vehicle assembly building where it was mated to external fuel tank and solid rocket booster stack problems were encountered during mating process and poor weather due to hurricane hanna caused a delay in rollout of atlantis to launch pad which is normally done seven days after rollover sts 125 was further pushed back to october 2008 due to manufacturing delays on external tanks for future space shuttle missions lockheed martin experienced delays during production changes to make new external tanks with all enhancements recommended by columbia accident investigation board making it impossible for them to produce two tanks for sts 125 mission one for atlantis and one for endeavour for an emergency rescue mission if necessary in time for original august launch date first rollout to launch pad 39a occurred on 4 september 2008 on 27 september science instrument command and data handling sic dh unit on hubble space telescope failed because of its importance to telescope nasa postponed launch of sts 125 on 29 september until 2009 so failed unit could be replaced as well atlantis was rolled back to vehicle assembly building on 20 october on 30 october 2008 nasa announced that atlantis would be removed from its solid rocket boosters and external tank stack and sent back to orbiter processing facility to await a targeted launch time at 1 11 pm edt on 12 may 2009 stack was turned over to be used on sts 119 mission instead on 23 march atlantis was mated to its new stack in vehicle assembly building and rolled out to launch pad 39a on 31 march on 24 april 2009 nasa managers issued a request to move sts 125 launch up one day to 11 may at 2 01 pm edt change was made official at flight readiness review on 30 april reason cited for change was to add one more day to launch window from two to three days mission timeline 11 may flight day 1 launch thumb space shuttle atlantis lifts off on sts 125 from kennedy space center following a smooth countdown atlantis launched on time at 2 01 pm edt almost immediately after launch and during ascent flight systems reported problems with a hydrogen tank transducer and a circuit breaker crew was immediately advised to disregard resultant alarms and continue to orbit during post launch news conference nasa managers said initial early review of launch video showed no obvious debris events but a thorough analysis would be performed to ensure orbiter sustained no significant damage during ascent after working through their post launch checklists crew opened payload bay doors deployed ku band antenna and moved into robotic activities portion of day which included a survey of payload bay and crew cabin survey with orbiter s robotic arm during post launch inspection of launch pad 39a a twenty five foot area on north side of flame deflector was found to have damage where some of heat resistant coating came off following launch of sts 124 severe damage was seen at pad where bricks were blasted from walls but nasa officials stated damage from sts 125 launch was not nearly as severe and should not impact launch of sts 127 in june 12 may flight day 2 following morning wake up call crew began work on day s tasks which were centered on inspection of orbiter s heat shield using shuttle robotic arm and orbiter boom sensor system crew went through a detailed inspection of orbiter s thermal protection system tps tile and reinforced carbon carbon rcc surfaces during inspection engineers on ground noticed a small area of tile on forward area of shuttle s right wing that appeared to have suffered some damage during ascent mission managers called up to crew to alert them of find advising altman scooter that one of orbiter s wing leading edge sensors recorded a debris event during ascent around 104 106 seconds following liftoff which may have been cause of damage seen in that area capcom dan burbank advised crew that damage did not initially appear to be serious but assured crew that image analysis team would be reviewing imagery further and engineers on ground would be analyzing it to determine if a focused inspection would be required as part of flight day 2 execute package ground engineers also provided further information on circuit breaker failure seen at launch breaker channel 1 asa 1 is part of shuttle s flight control systems fcs a subsystem of guidance navigation and control gnc systems failure would have no impact to mission due to redundant systems in addition to survey of orbiter s heat shield crew gathered and inspected eva tools and spacesuits that would be used for mission s spacewalks and prepared flight support system fss for berthing with hubble on flight day three 13 may flight day 3 thumb john grunsfeld uses a nikon with telephoto lens at an overhead window on aft flight deck during flight day three activities following crew s post sleep activities they went to work performing rendezvous operations that included burning orbiter s engines to refine approach to hubble telescope following some delays due to communications issues altman and johnson ray j guided orbiter within fifty feet of telescope mcarthur successfully grappled hubble at 17 14 utc and at 18 12 telescope was safely berthed in payload bay of atlantis later in day grunsfeld and feustel drew along with good bueno and massimino mass worked on preparing for next day s spacewalk gathering tools and checking out suits and equipment that would be used during eva at mission management team mmt briefing mmt chairman leroy cain reported that damage assessment team had cleared all of orbiter s tps tiles and blankets and were expected to clear rcc portion of orbiter by flight day four he stated that no focused inspection would be required cain also noted that a debris event was recorded on orbiter s wing leading edge sensors but it was far below force that would indicate a problem and would not impact mission late inspection that is routinely performed prior to re entry would give any additional information but cain stated we re not concerned that it s done any kind of damage that would be any concern to us certainly not critical damage during mission status briefing lead flight director tony ceccacci noted that during camera survey of equipment in payload bay team noticed some fine particulate matter around box containing wide field camera 3 and asked crew to take additional images using a higher resolution camera for ground teams to assess cain later confirmed that dust was not present prior to launch and was most likely particulate shaken loose from thick insulation blankets inside payload bay during launch team advised crew to avoid particulate as much as possible during spacewalks and use caution when working around container to avoid debris but it was not a significant concern 14 may flight day 4 thumb mission specialist john grunsfeld performing his sixth spacewalk is reflected in hubble telescope s coating as he works during mission s first eva following crew s wake up they set to work preparing for mission s first spacewalk grunsfeld and feustel suited up with assistance of their eva counterparts massimino and good and spacewalk officially began when two switched their suits to battery power at 12 52 utc at start of spacewalk feustel provided managers on ground with a visual inspection report on particulate matter seen earlier around wfc3 box reporting to ground team that i don t really see any of those particles it s almost i can see some few particles on front of w sipe little whitish grey looking real small it s low density too after getting their tools and equipment for eva set up grunsfeld and feustel removed old wide field and planetary camera 2 which was installed in 1993 during telescope s first servicing mission and replaced it with new wide field camera 3 wfc3 feustel initially had trouble removing bolts from old camera which after over fifteen years in space required more torque to remove than expected after multiple attempts managers on ground decided to have grunsfeld get a contingency torque limiter from airlock which would allow feustel to apply more force without exceeding a specific point but bolt would still not release concern was that bolt would shear and camera would be unable to be removed should that happen finally managers approved feustel to remove limiter and apply as much force as he safely thought it would take to release bolt which was successful new camera has allowed hubble to take large scale extremely clear and detailed photos over a wider range of colors than old camera did after installation controllers at space telescope operations control center at goddard space flight center sent commands to camera to perform an aliveness test which passed indicating camera was installed correctly next task was to remove and replace telescope s science instrument command and data handling unit or sic dh a computer that sends commands to hubble s science instruments and formats science data for transmission to ground this was item that failed in september 2008 delaying sts 125 while engineers prepared a replacement part for mission and crew trained for new task while failure of sic dh did not disable telescope replacing unit restores redundancies final major task was to install soft capture mechanism scm which includes low impact docking system lids that will allow spacecraft in future to dock with telescope and to safely de orbit telescope at end of its life feustel also installed two of four latch over center kits or locks that make opening and closing hubble s large access doors easier for remaining spacewalks spacewalk officially ended at 20 12 utc for a time of seven hours and twenty minutes it was nineteenth spacewalk devoted to servicing telescope and brought total time in servicing hubble to one hundred thirty six hours thirty minutes due to length of spacewalk and delay in beginning crew was over an hour behind their scheduled timeline for day but worked through post eva activities and evening activities without problems and got to sleep only slightly behind their scheduled time during mission status briefing david leckrone hubble project senior scientist noted he was very relieved that camera was replaced successfully and noted that problems with bolt caused some concern i don t normally reveal my age and i m not going to here but i can tell you i m five years older now than i was when i came to work this morning we can sleep pretty well tonight knowing that s been accomplished 15 may flight day 5

and feustel as they were preparing for eva team on ground informed crew that wfc3 had passed all overnight functional tests indicating it was in good working order while spacewalk preparations were underway altman and mcarthur completed a robotic survey of a small row of heat shield tiles that had not been sufficiently imaged during day two inspection following analysis of survey managers cleared all of tps systems until pre landing inspection mission s second spacewalk officially began at 12 49 utc and pair set to work removing and replacing telescope s three gyroscope rate sensing units rsus each unit contains two gyroscopes that allow telescope to point itself first unit rsu 2 was replaced without problems but when they attempted to replace second unit rsu 3 unit would not align onto guide pins and they could not seat it into equipment bay managers decided to put unit originally intended for rsu 1 bay into rsu 3 bay and it was installed without problems pair then attempted to install second unit into third and final bay but unit again would not seat properly and they were unable to install it instead it was decided that an additional unit carried as a spare would be placed into final bay spare unit was one that was removed during sts 103 mission and had been refurbished on ground installation of all three gyro units was a critical objective of servicing mission as three had failed one was offline due to electrical issues and other two had also been experiencing issues with performance ground controllers at goddard space flight center confirmed that all six gyroscopes and new battery passed preliminary tests problems with seating second rsu set spacewalkers back in timeline by approximately two hours but after altman asked massimino and good how they felt they replied they were doing well and felt fine to continue flight controllers on ground evaluated consumables for two spacesuits and decided that if massimino recharged his suit s oxygen in airlock pair could safely continue with battery installation after moving to battery unit site good and massimino removed one of original battery modules from bay 2 of telescope and replaced it with a new unit batteries provide power to telescope when it passes into earth s shadow and its solar arrays are not exposed to sun spacewalk officially ended at 20 45 utc for a time of seven hours fifty six minutes it was twentieth spacewalk to service hubble bringing total time in eva servicing telescope to one hundred forty four hours and twenty six minutes during mission status briefing tomas gonzalez torres lead eva officer and hubble program manager preston burch both explained that spare rsu would not impact life of telescope as it had been fully refurbished on ground with two of three improvements incorporated in newer models i would say difference in projected longevity of observatory in out years is very small we don t see this is a significant detriment at all to observatory this was a tremendous accomplishment for us burch noted lead flight director tony ceccacci noted that due to length of spacewalk and resulting slip in timeline crew s sleep shift would have to be moved an hour later to allow them to get proper amount of rest and rest of docked timeline would also be shifted forward an hour 16 may flight day 6 thumb grunsfeld and feustel pose for a picture in airlock of atlantis prior to mission s third spacewalk thumb feustel moves costar instrument from hubble to payload bay of atlantis after awakening crew set to work preparing for mission s third spacewalk one that was considered most challenging and uncertain yet had some of highest priority items scheduled tasks were to remove obsolete corrective optics space telescope axial replacement costar originally installed during sts 61 to correct spherical aberration of hubble s mirror and install cosmic origins spectrograph cos and to repair advanced camera for surveys acs acs failed in june 2006 due to an electrical issue and after being restored partially failed again in 2007 due to an electrical short acs was not designed to be serviced or repaired in space so task was considered one of most challenging of mission after running into various snags in first two spacewalks managers on ground were prepared to see unexpected issues arise during complicated repair work spacewalk began at 13 35 utc and grunsfeld and feustel had no problems pair worked through their timeline so efficiently that they were over an hour ahead at one point after removing costar and stowing it in orbiter s payload bay they installed cos and then moved on to acs repair using specially designed tools they removed an access panel replaced camera s four circuit boards and installed a new power supply spacewalk was completed in six hours and thirty six minutes and acs passed initial aliveness tests it was twenty first hubble servicing spacewalk and grunsfeld s seventh eva moving him up to fourth in record book of spacewalking time during previous day s mission status briefing dave leckrone hubble space telescope senior project scientist made a prediction joking that since first two spacewalks which were considered to be straightforward had run into issues most difficult eva to repair acs would be smoothest one of mission i have a prediction we ve always said eva 3 was going to be most difficult and most challenging and i predict it s going to go more smoothly than any other eva on this mission i just think that s some version of murphy s law that s going to lead us in that direction after initial aliveness testing acs was put through its functional tests managers and engineers had noted that repairs were designed for only one of three photo channels wide field channel and that issues with high resolution channel may not be resolved by designed fix during functional testing wide field channel passed but issues were seen with high resolution channel indicating that power issue may be farther upstream in electronic circuits than spacewalk repair addressed additional testing would be performed but hubble program manager preston burch noted that fix was designed to back power high resolution channel through paths connected to wide field channel and while feasible it was a possibility that short circuit damage was in an area not corrected with planned repair even if high resolution channel is unable to be restored it was considered to be less important since bulk of acs science output is undertaken by wide field channel third channel solar blind channel passed overnight functional testing without issues 17 may flight day 7 thumb mike good working in an open panel of hubble during fourth spacewalk of mission thumb good and massimino at work in interior of hubble while repairing space telescope imaging spectrograph thumb mission specialist michael massimino peers into orbiter s aft flight deck window during fourth spacewalk of mission beginning mission s fourth spacewalk at 13 45 utc massimino and good went to work repairing space telescope imaging spectrograph stis spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply as with acs stis was not designed with intention of servicing it while in space and one of major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener capture plate designed to trap screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed while preparing fastener capture plate massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate fastener capture plate handrail had a stripped bolt on bottom preventing it from being released after trying multiple options without success managers on ground advised massimino to use brute force to remove handrail so he could proceed with removal of cover plate procedure was tested at goddard space flight center prior to approving it showing that stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force working inside orbiter feustel walked massimino through procedure slowly advising him to tape handrail with tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose to be aware of reaction force would have as well as to watch for sharp edges on handrail after removal once handrail was removed massimino went to work attaching capture plate but ran into additional problems when battery in one of his power tools failed massimino was instructed to return to orbiter s airlock to retrieve a spare tool and to recharge his suit s oxygen reserves to allow for completion of stis repair rest of stis repair work was completed without any problems but spacewalkers were nearly two hours behind scheduled timeline so managers on ground decided to postpone task of installing a new outer blanket layers nobls onto telescope s outer shell spacewalk originally scheduled to last six hours and thirty minutes ended at 21 47 utc for a time of eight hours and two minutes at time it became sixth longest spacewalk in history it was twenty second spacewalk devoted to servicing hubble telescope and massimino s fourth spacewalk bringing his total eva time to thirty hours forty four minutes during mission status briefing jennifer wiseman chief of exoplanet and stellar astrophysics for goddard space flight center noted that repair of stis was a major victory for both mission and science community as that part of telescope performed unique functions helping scientists understand materials planets are composed of and looking at things like motion of stars around black holes after initial aliveness testing that showed no issues stis was taken into functional testing and issues were seen when telescope put itself into safe mode due to a low thermal limit sensor ground controllers at goddard would restart testing once thermal limit sensor was back in normal sensor range but it is believed component is in good shape 18 may flight day 8 completing fifth of five planned spacewalks grunsfeld and feustel successfully installed second battery removed and replaced fine guidance sensor number three and worked so efficiently that they were over an hour ahead of timeline giving them time to remove degraded insulation panels from three bays of telescope and install three new outer blanket layers nobls beginning spacewalk at 12 20 utc pair first worked on removing an aging battery module and replaced it with a new pack which combined with battery replacement performed during second spacewalk gave telescope all new nickel hydrogen batteries they then moved on to removal and replacement of fine guidance sensor unit number three improving hubble s focus and stability when imaging nasa engineers liken new fgs to being able to keep a laser beam focused on a u s dime coin that is away both new batteries and fgs passed both aliveness and functional testing mission s final eva concluded at 19 22 utc after seven hours and two minutes total time spent during mission in extra vehicular activity was thirty six hours fifty six minutes twenty third and final spacewalk to service hubble brought total time spent in eva working on telescope to one hundred and sixty six hours six minutes lead flight director tony ceccacci noted that final eva was also last planned spacewalk from a shuttle airlock in what was likely his last eva grunsfeld s has accumulated fifty eight hours and thirty minutes spacewalking just two minutes less than jerry l ross who is third on list of spacewalking time completion of all major objectives as well as some that were not considered vital upgraded telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years ago and made it more powerful than ever upgrades will also help hubble to see deeper into universe and farther into past closer to time of big bang hubble s importance to science is not just seen in dramatic images it provides but also in volume of work it has generated an average of fourteen scientific articles are published each week based on data gathered from telescope officially upgrades should extend hubble s life through 2014 but hubble space telescope senior scientist david leckrone noted prior to mission that if all of mission s objectives were successful telescope could easily last longer than that next large telescope scheduled to be launched is james webb space telescope in 2020 which is infrared only so to have hubble which has ultraviolet visible and near infrared capabilities still operational after 2018 would be of great benefit to scientific community 19 may flight day 9 thumb hubble space telescope being lifted out of payload bay of atlantis before being released back into space after awakening at 8 31 utc crew set to work preparing to

standing by ready to perform a spacewalk in event that something went wrong during telescope s deployment after working through checklist to prepare telescope for release managers on ground gave go to altman to release hubble and at 12 57 utc mcarthur successfully released telescope as vehicles flew over africa performing a small separation burn johnson backed orbiter away from telescope and altman called down to managers on ground confirming deployment of hubble commending crew altman said and houston hubble has been released it s safely back on its journey of exploration as we begin steps to conclude ours not everything went as we planned but we planned a way to work around everything and with whole team pulling together we ve been able to do some incredible things and now hubble can continue on its own exploring cosmos and bringing it home to us as we head for home in a few days thank you hubble s new equipment and upgraded systems would be tested for several months prior to resuming operation but if all tests are successful operation of telescope would resume in early september following separation burn crew set to work performing standard late inspection of thermal protection system of orbiter using robotic arm mcarthur altman and johnson worked through procedures to inspect wing leading edge panels reinforced carbon carbon nose cap and heat shield tiles after

2005 while a member of expedition 11 on board international space station crew of atlantis later spoke with reporters from major networks cnn abc nbc cbs and fox before going to sleep while weather in florida continued to look grim for a landing friday managers on ground advised crew that they would proceed with deorbit preparations as planned and see if weather cleared up in morning nasa managers stated that for friday they would focus on a ksc landing for friday not activating any of backup sites but if weather was not favorable for a friday landing edwards air force base could be activated on saturday atlantis has enough consumables to stay in orbit until monday also late on thursday managers officially released endeavour from its stand by state as atlantis was cleared of any damage to its heat shield and was in good shape to return to earth 22 may flight day 12 thumb left close in landing tracking as crew worked through procedures and checklists for entry on friday managers on ground closely examined weather patterns around florida which were less than favorable crew was advised that there were low clouds and thunderstorms both conditions that violated landing criteria so managers waived first opportunity a second opportunity was also not taken as weather had not improved entry flight director norm knight called up edwards air force base shortly after decision to delay to saturday was made which would give crew a total of six saturday landing opportunities three at each location 23 may flight day 13 right thumb space shuttle atlantis lands at edwards air force base after a successful sts 125 mission crew of atlantis had six possible landing opportunities on saturday managers evaluated best three opportunities of day to try bring orbiter home saturday s first landing opportunity at kennedy space center was waived due to poor weather forecasts and observed weather violations for landing criteria after further evaluating weather patterns around florida managers on ground chose to waive second opportunity as well and wait one more day to attempt to get orbiter into florida on sunday weather in california had excellent forecasts so if attempts on sunday to land in florida were not successful shuttle would be able to land at edwards air force base without weather being an issue 24 may flight day 14 landing atlantis crew had two florida return opportunities for day as well as two for a california landing giving managers time to evaluate weather and use california if necessary after choosing to pass on first opportunity for ksc and evaluate second managers on ground decided that weather in florida was too dynamic to risk bringing orbiter in and opted to land at edwards air force base instead de orbit burn was initiated at 14 24 utc a burn of shuttle s engines that brought it out of orbit to begin orbiter s reentry into earth s atmosphere atlantis successfully landed at edwards air force base on runway 22 at 8 39 am pdt after 197 orbits in space and a distance of approximately 5 2 million miles this was last landing at edwards for atlantis after working through checklists to safely power down orbiter crew performed traditional walk around of shuttle and met with employees from nasa speaking briefly to press following walk around altman joked i didn t realize it was going to be so hard to get back to earth we re all thrilled to have mission complete during post landing briefing associate administrator for space sciences ed weiler declared mission a total success and after noting rocky road that it took to get mission completed said he considered mission to be hubble s great american comeback story chapter two post landing thumb a unique view of atlantis perched atop modified boeing 747 during its return ferry

shuttle mission after columbia accident to be launched into a low inclination orbit that did not allow rendezvous with international space station due to inclination and other orbit parameters of hubble atlantis would have been unable to use international space station as a safe haven in event of structural or mechanical failure to preserve nasa s post columbia requirement of having shuttle launch on need lon rescue capability sts 400 was flight designation given to contingency shuttle crew support mission which would have been flown by endeavour in event atlantis became disabled during
