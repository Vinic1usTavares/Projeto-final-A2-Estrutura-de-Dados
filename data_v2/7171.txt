gill sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by eric gill and released by british branch of monotype from 1928 onwards gill sans is based on edward johnston s 1916 underground alphabet corporate font of london underground as a young artist gill had assisted johnston in its early development stages in 1926 douglas cleverdon a young printer publisher opened a bookshop in bristol and gill painted a fascia for shop for him in sans serif capitals in addition gill sketched an alphabet for cleverdon as a guide for him to use for future notices and announcements by this time gill had become a prominent stonemason artist and creator of lettering in his own right and had begun to work on creating typeface designs gill was commissioned to develop his alphabet into a full metal type family by his friend stanley morison an influential monotype executive and historian of printing morison hoped that it could be monotype s competitor to a wave of german sans serif families in a new geometric style which included erbar futura and kabel all being launched to considerable attention in germany during late 1920s gill sans was released in 1928 by monotype initially as a set of titling capitals that was quickly followed by a lower case gill s aim was to blend influences of johnston classic serif typefaces and roman inscriptions to create a design that looked both cleanly modern and classical at same time marketed by monotype as a design of classic simplicity and real beauty it was intended as a display typeface that could be used for posters and advertisements as well as for text of documents that need to be clearly legible at small sizes or from a distance such as book blurbs timetables and price lists designed before setting documents entirely in sans serif text was common its standard weight is noticeably bolder than most modern body text fonts an immediate success year after its release london and north eastern railway lner chose it for all its posters timetables and publicity material british railways chose gill sans as basis for its standard lettering when railway companies were nationalised in 1948 gill sans also soon became used on modernist deliberately simple covers of penguin books and was sold up to very large sizes which were often used in british posters and notices of period gill sans was one of dominant typefaces in british printing in years following its release and remains extremely popular it has been described as british helvetica because of its lasting popularity in british design gill sans has influenced many other typefaces and helped to define a genre of sans serif known as humanist style monotype rapidly expanded original regular or medium weight into a large family of styles which it continues to sell a basic set is included with some microsoft software and mac os characteristics thumb gill sans compared to other sans serifs of period gill sans does not use single storey g or a used by many sans serifs and is less than johnston its structure is influenced by traditional serif fonts such as caslon rather than being strongly based on straight lines and circles as futura is proportions of gill sans stem from monumental roman capitals in upper case and traditional old style serif letters in lower this gives gill sans a very different style of design to geometric sans serifs like futura based on simple squares and circles or realist or grotesque designs like akzidenz grotesk helvetica and univers influenced by nineteenth century lettering styles for example compared to realist sans serifs c and a have a much less folded up structure with wider apertures a and g in roman or regular style are double storey designs rather than single storey forms used in handwriting and blackletter often found in grotesque and especially geometric sans serifs thumb left a drawing and photographed carving by gill of trajan capitals on column of trajan a model for capitals of gill sans and johnson respected by arts and crafts artisans as among best ever drawn many signs and engravings created with an intentionally artistic design in twentieth century in britain are based on them upper case of gill sans is partly modelled on roman capitals like those found on column of trajan with considerable variation in width edward johnston had written that roman capitals have held supreme place among letters for and beauty they are best forms for grandest and most important inscriptions while gill sans is not based on purely geometric principles to extent of geometric sans serifs that had preceded it some aspects of gill sans do have a geometric feel j descends below baseline o is an almost perfect circle and capital m is based on proportions of a square with middle strokes meeting at centre this was not inspired by roman carving but is very similar to johnston e and f are also relatively narrow thumb right distinctive characters of gill sans influence of traditional serif letters is also clear in two storey lower case a and g unlike that of futura and t with its curve to bottom right and slanting cut at top left unlike futura s which is simply formed from two straight lines lower case a also narrows strikingly towards top of its loop a common feature of serif designs but rarer in sans serifs following traditional serif model italic has different letterforms from roman where many sans serifs simply slant letters in what is called an oblique style this is clearest in a which becomes a single storey design similar to handwriting and lower case p which has a calligraphic tail on left reminiscent of italics such as those cut by william caslon in eighteenth century italic e is more restrained with a straight line on underside of bowl where serif fonts normally add a curve like most serif fonts several weights and releases of gill sans use ligatures to allow its expansive letter f to join up with or avoid colliding with following letters basic letter shapes of gill sans do not look consistent across styles or even in metal type era all sizes of same style especially in extra bold and extra condensed widths while ultra bold style is effectively a different design altogether and was originally marketed as such digital period monotype designer dan rhatigan author of an article on gill sans s development after gill s death has commented gill sans grew organically it takes a very approach to type very characteristic of when it was designed and of when it was used at this time idea that sans serif typefaces should form a consistent family with glyph shapes as consistent as possible between all weights and sizes had not fully developed it was quite normal for families to vary as seemed appropriate for their weight until developments such as groundbreaking release of univers in 1957 in light weights slanting cut at top left of regular t is replaced with two separate strokes from bold weight upwards gill sans has an extremely eccentric design of i and j with dots tittles smaller than their parent letter s stroke development thumb an early version of johnston on a london underground metal sign johnston s design was rendered variably on some older signs and this uses a condensed r and four terminal w thumb left gloomy ultra bold sans serifs of figgins foundry gill and johnston sought to create sans serif designs that were modern and not as bold as these gill argued in his essay on typography that such closed up forms were bold less legible than lighter fonts of normal proportions morison commissioned gill to develop gill sans after they had begun to work together often by post since gill lived in wales on gill s serif design perpetua from 1925 onwards they had known each other since about 1913 morison visited cleverdon s bookshop while in bristol in 1927 where he saw and was impressed by gill s fascia and alphabet gill wrote that it was as a consequence of seeing these letters that morison commissioned him to develop a sans serif family in period during and after his closest collaboration with johnston gill had intermittently worked on sans serif letter designs including an almost sans serif capital design in an alphabet for sign painters in 1910s some absolutely legible to last degree simple block letters for army and navy stores in 1925 and some capital letter signs around his home in capel y wales gill had greatly admired johnston s work on their underground project which he later wrote had redeemed whole business of sans serif from its nineteenth century corruption of extreme boldness johnston apparently had not tried to turn alphabet as it was then called that he had designed into a commercial typeface project he had tried to get involved in type design before starting work on johnston sans but without success since industry at time mostly created designs in house morison similarly respected design of underground system one of first and most lasting uses of a standard lettering style as corporate branding gill had designed a set of serif letters for wh smith writing that it conferred upon lettering a sanction civic and commercial as had not been accorded to an alphabet since time of charlemagne thumb right an american metal type specimen sheet of gill title note original 5 7 0 and q in some sizes which were dropped in many later metal type issues and digital versions and a non descending j morison and gill had met with some resistance within monotype while developing perpetua and while morison was an enthusiastic backer of project monotype s engineering manager and type designer frank hinman pierpont was deeply unconvinced commenting that he could see nothing in this design to recommend it and much that is objectionable pierpont was creator of monotype s previous mainstay sans serif a loose family now called monotype grotesque it is a much less sculptured design inspired by german sans serifs morison also intervened to insist that letters j and q be allowed to elegantly descend below baseline something not normal for titling typefaces which were often made to fill up entire area of metal type in early days of its existence it was not always consistently simply called gill sans with other names such as gill sans serif monotype sans serif latter two both used by gill in some of his publications or its order numbers such as series no 231 sometimes used a large amount of material about development of gill sans survives in monotype s archives and in gill s papers while capitals which were prepared first resemble johnston quite closely archives document gill and drawing office team at monotype s works in surrey who developed a final precise design and spacing grappling with challenge of creating a viable humanist sans serif lower case as well as an italic which johnston s design did not have gill s first draft proposed many slanting cuts on ends of ascenders and descenders looking less like johnston than released version did and quite long descenders early art for italic also looked very different with less of a slope again very long descenders and swash capitals final version did not use calligraphic italic g gill preferred in his serif designs perpetua and joanna and considered in draft italic art instead using a standard double storey g thumb alt comparison between gill sans and johnston johnston upper and gill sans lower showing some of most distinctive differences in regular or roman style of gill sans some letters were simplified from johnston with diamond dots becoming round rectangles in later light weight and lower case l becoming a simple line but a became more complex with a curving tail in most versions and sizes in addition design was simply refined in general for example by making horizontals slightly narrower than verticals so that they do not appear unbalanced a standard technique in font design which johnston had not used r with its widely splayed leg is gill s preferred design unlike that of johnston historian james mosley has suggested that this may be inspired by an italian renaissance carving in victoria and albert museum in london particular areas of thought during design process were a several versions and sizes in hot metal era had a straight tail like johnston s or a mildly curving tail and b d p and q where some versions and sizes since same weight would not be identical at every size had stroke ends visible and others did not rhatigan has commented that monotype s archives contain enough material for a book just about b d p and q of gill sans titling capitals of gill sans were first unveiled at a printing conference in 1928 it was also shown in a specimen issued in fleuron magazine edited by morison while initial response was partly appreciative it was still considered dubious by some ultra conservative printers who saw all sans serif type as modern and unsound one called it typographical bolshevism sans serifs were still regarded as vulgar and commercial by purists in this period johnston s pupil hewitt privately commented of them that in johnston i have lost confidence despite all he did for us he has undone too much by forsaking his standard of roman alphabet giving world without safeguard or explanation his block letters which disfigure our modern life his prestige has obscured their vulgarity and commercialism nonetheless gill sans rapidly became popular after its release thumb some of gill s original art for gill sans showing original q punctuation and two gill sans technical production followed monotype s standard method of period characters were drawn on paper in large plan diagrams by experienced drawing office team led and trained by pierpont and fritz both of whom monotype had recruited from german printing industry drawing staff who executed design was disproportionately female and in many cases recruited from local area and nearby reigate art school they worked out many aspects of final drawings including adaptations of letters to different sizes and spacing diagrams were then used as a plan for machining metal punches by pantograph to stamp matrices which would be loaded into a casting machine to cast type it was monotype s standard practice at time to first engrave a limited number of characters and print proofs some of which survive from them to test overall balance of colour and spacing on page before completing remaining characters walter tracy rhatigan and gill s biographer malcolm yorke have all written that drawing office s work in making gill sans successful has not been fully appreciated yorke described gill as tactless in his claims that design was as much as possible mathematically measurable as little reliance as possible should be placed on sensibility of and others concerned in its machine reception thumb gill sans on a 1949 british railways poster gill sans rapidly became very popular its success was aided by monotype s sophisticated marketing led by gill s supporter and sometime lover beatrice warde and due to its practicality and availability for machine composition in a very wide range of sizes and weights despite popularity of gill sans some reviews have been critical robert harling who knew gill wrote in his 1976 anthology examining gill s lettering that density of basic weight made it unsuitable for extended passages of text printing a passage in it as a demonstration regular weight has been used to print body text for some trade printing uses such as guides to countryside walks published by lner william addison dwiggins described it and futura as fine in capitals and bum in lower case while proposing to create a more individualistic competitor metro for linotype around 1929 modern writers including stephen coles and ben archer have criticised it for failing to improve on johnston and for unevenness of colour especially in bolder weights discussed below more generally modern font designer jonathan has criticised johnston and gill s designs for rigidity calling their work products more of machine than hand chilly and austere designs shaped by unbending rules whose occasional moments of whimsy were so out of place as to feel volatile and disquieting gill broached topic of similarity with johnston in a variety of ways in his work and writings writing to johnston in 1933 to apologise for typeface bearing his name and describing johnston s work as being important and seminal however in his essay on typography he proposed that his version was perhaps an improvement and more fool proof than johnston s johnston and gill had drifted apart by beginning of 1920s something gill s groundbreaking biographer fiona maccarthy describes as partly due to anti catholicism of johnston s wife greta frank pick underground electric railways company managing director who commissioned johnston s typeface privately thought gill sans a rather close copy of johnston s work expansion and new styles thumb right compilation image of some of fonts of gill sans family that are mostly intended for display use detail differences are obvious especially single storey a on extra condensed bold following initial success of gill sans monotype rapidly produced a wide variety of other variants in addition monotype sold moulds matrices for gill sans in very large sizes for their type casting equipment popular with advertisers this allowed end users to cast their own type at a very competitive price this made it a popular choice for posters gill s biographer malcolm yorke has described it as essence of clarity for public notices versions of gill sans were created in a wide range of styles such as condensed and shadowed weights several shadowed designs were released including a capitals only regular shadowed design and a light shadowed version with deep relief shadows in metal type era a cameo ruled design that placed white letters in boxes or against a stippled black background was available shadowed weights were intended to be used together with regular printing in different colours to achieve a simple multicolour effect some of decorative versions may predominantly have been designed by monotype office with gill examining critiquing and approving designs sent to him by post long series of extensions and conversions into new formats of one of monotype s most important assets extending long beyond gill s death has left gill sans with a great range of alternative designs and releases a book weight was created in 1993 in between light and regular weight suitable for body text along with a heavy weight gill kayo thumb left gill s drawings of gill kayo its working title sans double elefans is visible at bottom left and his eg signature at bottom right in 1936 gill and monotype released an extremely bold sans serif named gill kayo from ko or knockout implying its aggressive build this has often been branded as gill sans ultra bold though in practice many letters vary considerably from gill sans it is available in regular and condensed widths gill who thought of design as something of a joke proposed naming it double elefans harling reviewed it as dismal and sarcastically commented that typographical historians of 2000ad which isn t after all so very far away will find this odd outburst in mr gill s career and will spend much time in attempting to track down this sad psychological state of his during 1936 forty years later he described it as most horrendous and of these display design was begun in 1932 some of first drawings may have been prepared by gill s son in law denis it made a return to popularity in graphic design of 1970s and 80s when letraset added a condensed weight boldest weights of gill sans including kayo have been particularly criticised for design issues such as eccentric design of dots on i and j and for their extreme boldness gill sans standard weight is as already noted already quite bold by modern standards gill argued in his essay on typography that nineteenth century tendency to make sans serif typefaces attention bold was self defeating since result was compromised legibility in closing paragraph he ruefully noted his contribution to genre there are now about as many different varieties of letters as there are different kinds of fools i myself am responsible for designing five different sorts of sans serif letters each one thicker and fatter than last because each advertisement has to try and shout down its neighbours alternate characters thumb alternate characters in gill sans nova most or all based on those offered in metal type era monotype developed a set of alternate characters for gill sans to cater for differing tastes and national printing styles of different countries these include futura inspired designs of n m r a g t and others a four terminal w in french renaissance style a tighter r a q in nineteenth century style with a tail that looped upwards similar to that on century among others and preferred by lner oblique designs as opposed to standard true italic a more curving true italic e and several alternative numerals in particular in standard designs for gill sans numeral 1 upper case i and lower case l are all a simple vertical line so an alternate 1 with a serif was sold for number heavy situations where this could otherwise cause confusion such as on price lists not all timetables used it for example l n e r preferred simple version some early versions of gill sans also had features later abandoned such as an unusual 7 matching curve of 9 a 5 pushing forwards and a lower case letter height 0 gill was involved in design of these alternates and monotype s archive preserves notes that he rethought geometric alternates with increasing popularity of futura gill sans was not alone in being adapted both erbar and dwiggins metro would undergo what historian paul shaw has called a futura to conform to taste after gill s death monotype created versions for greek and cyrillic alphabets monotype also added additional features not found in metal type notably text figures and small capitals series and styles thumb metal type for gill sans bold mirrored image according to rhatigan and

be more recognisable to children being based on handwriting and are often produced to supplement popular families such as gill sans akzidenz grotesk and bembo monotype also created a version with

digital releases of gill sans fall into several main phases releases before 2005 which includes most bundled system versions of gill sans 2005 pro edition and 2015 nova release which adds many alternate characters and is in part included with windows 10 in general characteristics for common weights designs are similar but there are some changes for example in book weight 2005 release used circular dots but 2015 release uses square designs and 2015 release simplifies some ligatures digital gill sans also gained character sets not present in metal type including text figures and small capitals like all metal type revivals reviving gill sans in digital form raises several decisions of interpretation such as issue of how to compensate for ink spread that would have been seen in print at small sizes more than larger as a result printed gill sans and its digital facsimile may not always match digital release of gill sans like many monotype digitisations has been criticised in particular for excessively tight letter spacing and lack of optical sizes with only one design released that has to be used at any text size it cannot replicate subtlety of design and spacing of metal type for which every size was drawn differently in hot metal era different font sizes varied as is normal for metal type with wider spacing and other detail changes at smaller text sizes other major sans serif families such as futura and akzidenz grotesk are similar in period monotype continued to offer two or three sizes of master but all of this subtlety was lost on transfer to digital to replicate this it is necessary to make manual adjustment to spacing to compensate for size changes such as expanding spacing and increasing weight used at smaller sizes former president john berry commented of gill sans modernised spacing that both regular weight and especially light weight look much better when they re tracked loose in contrast walter tracy wrote in 1986 that he preferred later spacing metal version was spaced i suspect as if it were a serif face gill sans nova 2015 as of 2019 monotype s current digitisation of gill sans is gill sans nova by george ryan gill sans nova adds many additional variants including some of previously inline versions stylistic alternates and an ultra light weight which had been drawn for grazia fonts differ from gill sans mt mt stands for

childhood eric gill was immensely proud of lner s decision to standardise on his font first unveiled in a single uppercase weight in 1928 gill sans achieved national prominence almost immediately when it was chosen following year to become standard typeface by lner railway company soon appearing on every facet of company s identity from metal locomotive nameplates and hand painted station signage to printed restaurant car menus timetables and advertising posters lner promoted their rebranding by offering gill who was fascinated with railway engines a footplate ride on flying scotsman express service he also painted for it a signboard in style of gill sans which survives in collection of st bride library thumb right 1952 jersey holiday events brochure typical of design style of period in 1949 railway executive decided on standard types of signs to be used at all stations lettering was to use gill sans typeface on a background of regional colour gill sans was also used in much of its printed output very often in capitals only settings for signage specially drawn variations were developed by railway executive part of british transport commission for signs in its manual for use of signpainters painting large signs by hand other users included penguin books iconic paperback jacket designs from 1935 and british official mapping agency ordnance survey it was also used by london transport for documents which could not be practically set in johnston paul shaw a historian of printing has described it as a key element of modernist classical style from 1930s to 1950s that promoted clean spare design often with all capitals and centred setting of headings gill sans remains popular although a trend away from it towards grotesque and neo grotesque typefaces took place around 1950s and 1960s under influence of continental and american design typefaces that became popular around this time included original early grotesque sans serifs as well as new and more elegant designs in same style such as helvetica and univers mosley has commented that in 1960 orders unexpectedly revived for old monotype grotesque design it represents even more evocatively than univers fresh revolutionary breeze that began to blow through typography in early sixties he added in 2007 its rather clumsy design seems to have been one of chief attractions to iconoclastic designers tired of prettiness of gill sans as an example of this trend jock kinneir and margaret calvert s corporate rebranding of br as british rail in 1965 introduced helvetica and univers for printed matter and custom but very similar rail alphabet for signage and abandoned classical all caps signage style with which gill sans is often associated kinneir and calvert s road signage redesign used a similar approach linotype and its designer hermann zapf who had begun development on a planned gill sans competitor in 1955 first considered redrawing some letters to make it more like these faces before abandoning design project now named magnus around 1962 3 an additional development which reduced gill sans dominance was arrival of phototypesetting which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and especially in display use hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer massively increased range of typefaces that could cheaply be used dry transfers like letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects their sans serif and stephenson blake s impact exemplified design trends of period by choosing dense industrial designs of period from 1930s to 1950s when he was growing up james mosley would later write monotype classics dominated typographical landscape in britain at any rate they were so ubiquitous that while their excellent quality was undeniable it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against bland good taste that they represented in fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long death of metal type seemed at last to be happening while extremely popular in britain and to a lesser extent in european printing gill sans did not achieve popularity with american printers in hot metal era with most preferring gothic designs like franklin gothic and geometric designs like futura and monotype s own twentieth century gill sans therefore particularly achieved worldwide popularity after close of metal type era and in phototypesetting and digital era when it became a system font on macintosh computers and microsoft office one use of gill s work in united states in this period however was a custom wordmark and logo made by gill for poetry magazine in 1930 based on gill sans its editor harriet monroe had seen gill s work in london thumb bbc logo at bbc broadcasting house belfast bbc adopted typeface as its corporate typeface in 1997 for many but not all purposes including on its logo explaining change designer martin lambie nairn said that by choosing a typeface that has stood test of time we avoid trap of going down a modish route that might look outdated in several years time bbc had an earlier association with gill who created some sculptures on broadcasting house other more recent british organisations using gill sans have included railtrack and initially its successor network rail john lewis and church of england which adopted gill sans as typeface for definitive common worship family of service books published from 2000 notable non british modern businesses using gill sans include united colours of benetton which commissioned a custom variant tommy hilfiger and saab automobile british rock band bloc party has used gill sans in its logo at t used it until 2006 before changing it to clearview after feeling that

with condensed and inline styles it also included a granby elephant weight influenced by gill kayo another similar but more eccentric design was created by johnston s student harold curwen for use of his family company curwen press of plaistow named curwen sans or curwen modern it has many similarities to johnston also and was occasionally used by london transport in work printed by curwen press curwen described it as based on his time studying with johnston in 1900s although it was not cut into metal until 1928 around same time as gill sans was released with a lower case similar to that of kabel a digitisation by k type was released in 2018 several intended gill sans competitors were developed during period of its popularity but ultimately did not see mass release jan tschichold who would later make extensive use of gill sans while designing books for penguin created a similar design for an early phototypesetting machine which was at time little used but also since digitised during 1930s dutch type designer jan van krimpen also a friend of morison s worked on a superfamily named romulus with serif and humanist sans serif companion sans serif with a low x height never progressed beyond test proofs as described above linotype began work in 1955 on a gill sans competitor intended to be named magnus designed by german type designer hermann zapf with input from british linotype manager walter tracy design was ultimately abandoned by 1963 for reasons of lack of manufacturing capacity and changing tastes although it too reached test proofs thumb enamel sign at

little known follower was nen standard lettering a project by dutch standards institute to create a set of standardised lettering for public use in netherlands comprising a sans serif similar to gill

humanist sans serif typefaces which gill sans helped to define saw great attention during 1980s and 1990s especially as a reaction against overwhelming popularity of helvetica and univers in 1960s and 1970s modern sans serif designs inspired by gill often adapt concept by creating a design better proportioned and spaced for body text a wider and more homogeneous range of weights something easier since arrival of computer due to use of multiple master or interpolated font design or more irregular and hand drawn in style jeremy tankard s bliss and volker kuster s today sans are modern variations tankard commented on genre s eclipse that his aim was to create first commercial typeface with an english feel since gill sans rowton sans is inspired by gill but has a nearly upright

gibson and others more loosely syntax by hans eduard meier is similar in some ways released in 1968 and praised by tschichold it was intended to be a more dynamic handwriting influenced sans serif form its italic is however more of an oblique than gill s hypatia sans designed by thomas phinney and released by adobe was intended to be a more characterful humanist sans design many other fonts are influenced by gill sans to some extent font superfamilies a logical extension of humanist sans serif concept is font superfamily a serif font and a matching humanist sans serif with similar
