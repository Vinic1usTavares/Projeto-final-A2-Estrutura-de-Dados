tropical storm etau was deadliest tropical cyclone to impact japan since typhoon tokage in 2004 forming on august 8 2009 from an area of low pressure system gradually intensified into a tropical storm tracking in a curved path around edge of a subtropical ridge etau continued to intensify as it neared japan by august 10 cyclone reached its peak intensity as a weak tropical storm with winds of 75 km h 45 mph 10 minute sustained and a barometric pressure of 992 hpa mbar shortly after etau began to weaken increasing wind shear led to center becoming devoid of convection and system eventually weakened to a tropical depression on august 13 remnants of etau persisted for nearly three days before dissipating early on august 16 although etau did not make landfall outer bands of storm produced torrential rainfall in japan peaking at these rains triggered deadly flooding and mudslides especially in hyogo prefecture twenty eight people were killed by storm and y 7 1 billion us 87 5 million in damage occurred throughout affected region according to fire and disaster management agency a total of 5 602 homes were flooded and 183 were destroyed following storm 600 japanese soldiers were deployed from tokyo to assist in cleanup efforts meteorological history tropical storm etau originated on august 5 out of an area of low pressure associated with disorganized convective activity located about 550 km 280 mi east northeast of guam following day system relocated several dozen kilometers to north convective turning began to appear on satellite imagery and a tropical upper tropospheric trough tutt cell to north provided a northward component to system s movement early on august 7 joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for developing system as deep convection consolidated around low pressure system around 0000 utc on august 8 japan meteorological agency jma designated system as a tropical depression several hours later on august 8 jtwc also declared system a tropical depression classifying it at 10w later that day convection associated with depression became disorganized preventing intensification of system depression generally tracked towards northwest during day in response a subtropical ridge to north by august 9 center of circulation became more defined as convection wrapped around it around 1200 utc jma upgraded depression to a tropical storm and gave it name etau jtwc however did not upgrade system to a tropical storm for several more hours on august 10 jtwc briefly downgraded storm to a tropical depression by this time system had re curved to east around western periphery of subtropical ridge etau also became slightly disorganized as it began to interact with baroclinic zone near japan early on august 11 jma reported that storm winds had peaked at 75 km h 45 mph 10 minute sustained and a barometric pressure of 992 hpa mbar later that day storm once more became slightly disorganized due to increased wind shear however jtwc reported that storm intensified based on satellite intensity estimates and weather radar imagery from japan later on august 11 center of etau became partially devoid of convection with only a narrow band of shower and thunderstorm activity persisting to southeast of center increasing wind shear prevented convection from redeveloping and storm continued to weaken early following day jtwc issued their final advisory on etau as they reported it had weakened to a tropical depression well to east of japan roughly 24 hours later jma also downgraded system to a tropical depression final advisory on etau was issued by jma early on august 14 as it slowly tracked northward preparations impact and aftermath thumb right debris filled street in sayo after flood waters receded in anticipation of wind gusts up to and heavy rains japanese officials evacuated roughly 47 000 residents from western regions along coast as gale warnings were declared by jma officials also feared that flooding from tropical storm etau would mirror that of typhoon morakot in taiwan where at least 14 were killed in country s worst flood in 50 years six flights in country were canceled after a plane was struck by lightning fifteen railway services were also canceled due to heavy rains according to officials in japan nearly 140 000 people were evacuated to shelters in relation to flooding and landslides produced by etau as tropical storm etau brushed japan on august 10 torrential rains fell within its outer bands in a 24 hour span a record of rain fell triggering extensive flooding and landslides initial reports stated that 13 people were killed and 10 others were missing due to storm most of fatalities took place in hyogo prefecture where hundreds of homes were flooded and numerous others were damaged or destroyed by landslides in some areas flood waters reached a depth of one man drowned after driving his car into a flooded street and being overcome by water another person was killed after her home was destroyed by a landslide in okayama prefecture in tokushima two people were listed as missing and two others sustained serious injuries later news reports stated that up to 18 people were missing following further landslides affected region was especially susceptible to landslides due to recent seismic activity with a magnitude 6 4 earthquake taking place on august 10 by august 11 one of missing persons was confirmed to have been killed during storm about 800 people were placed in public shelters and 53 000 homes were left without running water by august 12 a total of 18 people were confirmed to have been killed and nine others were still missing three bridges in tokushima were also washed away days later japanese fire and disaster management agency finalized death toll at 26 with one other missing making etau deadliest tropical cyclone to impact hyogo prefecture japan since typhoon tokage in 2004 throughout several prefectures 5 602 homes were flooded and 183 were destroyed landslides triggered by storm damaged another 2 109 structures most of which were in okayama and hyogo prefectures following severe damages in town of sayo it requested assistance from national government as a result more than 200 troops were deployed to town a post disaster office was also set up by prime minister s office crisis management center an additional 400 troops were deployed to city by august 11 to assist in rescue efforts see also 2009 pacific typhoon season tropical storm 2015 tropical storm 2017 references external links jma
