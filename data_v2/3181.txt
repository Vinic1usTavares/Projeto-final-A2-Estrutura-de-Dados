tropical storm beryl was third tropical storm of 2006 atlantic hurricane season developing from a tropical disturbance on july 18 it tracked generally northward and strengthened to attain peak winds of 60 mph 95 km h under generally favorable conditions after turning to northeast beryl weakened over cooler waters on july 21 it struck island of nantucket and shortly thereafter it became extratropical extratropical remnants continued northeastward through nova scotia and on july 22 it merged with an approaching cold front beryl produced rough seas along northeast united states coastline in massachusetts its impact was limited to light rainfall and gusty winds with no reported damage beryl later produced moderate rainfall and gusty winds across atlantic canada resulting in some localized power outages though little damage no deaths were reported meteorological history a cold front moved off east coast of united states on july 16 and stalled off coast of north carolina it gradually decayed into a surface low pressure trough and developed into two disturbances one was centered 290 miles 490 km south southeast of cape cod and another was located 200 miles 320 km south of cape hatteras north carolina first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm and other area initially remained broad and ill defined however by july 18 system became much better organized with improved banding features and area developed into tropical depression two while located 220 miles 355 km south southeast of cape hatteras right thumb tropical storm beryl off north carolina on july 19 depression moved slowly to north northwest through a break in subtropical ridge and as convective banding features became more prominent system intensified into tropical storm beryl throughout much of its duration storm tracked through an environment with light vertical wind shear and well established upper level outflow shortly after becoming a tropical storm low level circulation of beryl became exposed with limited deep convection though deep convection re developed following morning outflow continued to improve and with warm sea surface temperatures beryl gradually intensified to attain peak winds of 60 mph 95 km h early on july 20 while located about 120 miles 190 km east of nags head north carolina beryl maintained peak winds for about 18 hours as it paralleled mid atlantic and new jersey coasts during which an eye like feature developed in center of convection late on july 20 it began a slow weakening trend after passing over cooler waters steering winds ahead of an approaching mid level trough caused beryl to accelerate northeastward and early on july 21 center of storm crossed island of nantucket convection diminished as it moved through progressively colder waters and shortly after 1200 utc on july 21 beryl became an extratropical cyclone a short distance east of cape cod hours later it made landfall in southwestern nova scotia and on july 22 extratropical remnants of beryl merged with an approaching cold front over newfoundland preparations forecasters initially predicted beryl to brush carolinas as such a tropical
