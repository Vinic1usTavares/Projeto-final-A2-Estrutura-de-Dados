jocelin or jocelyn died 1199 was a twelfth century cistercian monk and cleric who became fourth abbot of melrose before becoming bishop of glasgow scotland he was probably born in 1130s and in his teenage years became a monk of melrose abbey he rose in service of abbot waltheof and by time of short abbacy of waltheof s successor abbot william jocelin had become prior then in 1170 jocelin himself became abbot a position he held for four years jocelin was responsible for promoting cult of emerging saint waltheof and in this had support of enguerrand bishop of glasgow his glasgow connections and political profile were already well established enough that in 1174 jocelin succeeded enguerrand as glasgow s bishop as bishop of glasgow he was a royal official in this capacity he travelled abroad on several occasions and performed marriage ceremony between king william lion and ermengarde de beaumont later their son future king alexander ii among other things he has been credited by modern historians as founder of burgh of glasgow and initiator of glasgow fair for this view and quote see norman f shead jocelin abbot of melrose and bishop of glasgow in innes review vol 54 no 1 spring 2003 p 1 as well as being one of greatest literary patrons in medieval scotland commissioning life of st waltheof life of st kentigern and chronicle of melrose early life jocelin and his family probably came from south east of scotland names of neither his father nor his mother are known but he had two known brothers with names helia and henry and a cousin also called helia names suggest that his family were of french or at least anglo norman origin rather than being a scot or native anglo saxon norman f shead jocelin p 2 there are some indications that his family held land in

and wealthiest scottish monastery in period like that of almost every character from this period jocelin s year of birth is unknown to modern historians it is known that he entered as a novice monk in melrose abbey during abbacy of waltheof ab 1148 1159 and from documentary evidence it seems likely that jocelin entered melrose about 50 years before his death in 1199 as rules of cistercian order prevented entry as a novice before age of 15 it is likely that he was born around year 1134 for this argument and references to relevant primary material see norman f shead jocelin pp 1 2 little is known about jocelin s early life or his early career as a melrose monk he obviously successfully completed his one year year in which a prospective monk was introduced to monasticism and judged fit or unfit for admittance we know that abbot waltheof thought highly of him and granted him many responsibilities after death of abbot waltheof his successor abbot william refused to encourage rumours which had quickly been spreading about waltheof s saintliness abbot william attempted to silence such rumours and shelter his monks from of would be pilgrims however william was unable to get better of waltheof s emerging cult and his actions had alienated him from brethren as a result william resigned abbacy in april 1170 for account of abbot william and cult of waltheof see richard fawcett richard oram melrose abbey stroud 2004 pp 23 24 jocelin was by this stage prior of melrose that is second in command at monastery and thus william s most likely replacement abbot of melrose thumb

where he transferred his enthusiasm to st kentigern a a m duncan sources and uses of chronicle of melrose in simon taylor ed kings clerics and chronicles in scotland 500 1297 dublin 2000 p 150 and commissioned a hagiography of that saint saint most venerated by celts of diocese of glasgow it is no coincidence that jocelin of furness man who wrote life of st waltheof was same man later commissioned to write life of st kentigern this kind of literary patronage started while jocelin was abbot of melrose archie duncan has shown that it was probably jocelin who first commissioned writing of chronicle of melrose duncan argued that jocelin commissioned entries dealing with period between 731 and 1170 putting writing in hands of a monk named who later became bishop of ross ibid pp 149 150 this chronicle is one of few extant chronicles from scotland in this period g w s barrow writing before duncan advanced these arguments noted that down to end of king william s reign chronicle of melrose abbey represents a strongly anglo norman as opposed to a native scottish point of view g w s barrow acts of william i regesta regum scottorum vol ii edinburgh 1971 p 7 it is thus possible that this anti scottish world view reflected that of jocelin s at least before he left abbey after his election to prestigious bishopric of glasgow in 1174 jocelin would continue exerting influence on his home monastery jocelin brought one of his monks from abbey a man called michael who acted as jocelin s chaplain while bishop of glasgow norman f shead jocelin p 16 he did not resign

bishops were rare in great britain and jocelin was only second cistercian to ascend a scottish bishopric jocelin was required to go to france to obtain permission from general chapter of cistercian order at to resign abbacy pope alexander iii had already sanctioned his consecration and gave permission for consecration to occur without forcing jocelin to travel to rome conveniently it was at

widespread persecution of english both in scotland and galloway that is of english and french speaking settlers william and his predecessors had planted around castles and towns of his gaelic speaking

kingdom norman f shead jocelin p 19 as a bishop and an ex abbot various bishoprics and monasteries called him in to mediate disputes as evidenced by his frequent appearance as a witness in dispute

too he witnessed 24 royal charters and 40 non royal charters including charters issued by david earl of huntingdon brother of king william donnchadh earl of carrick and alan fitzwalter high steward of

thus making possible legacy that jocelin would leave to glasgow legacy and death thumb 250px this is a 19th century depiction of some columns in crypt of glasgow cathedral it is one of few structures said to have survived from jocelin s era his years at glasgow left a mark on history that can be compared favourably with any previous or future bishop jocelin commissioned his namesake jocelin of furness same man who had written life of st waltheof to write a life of st kentigern a task all more necessary because after 1159 papacy claimed right to canonise saints norman f shead jocelin pp 12 13 kentigern or mungo as he is popularly known this is a modern anglicisation of his gaelic nickname was saint traditionally associated with see of glasgow and his status therefore reflected on glasgow as a church and cult centre there had already been a cathedral at glasgow before jocelin s episcopate idea that ecclesiastical establishment before jocelin was simply a small church with a larger gaelic or british monastic establishment has been discredited by scholars see for instance g w s barrow david i and glasgow in g w s barrow ed kingdom of scots 2nd edition edinburgh 2003 p 210

norman f shead jocelin p 14 however he left a still greater legacy to city of glasgow at some point between years 1175 and 1178 jocelin obtained from king william a grant of burghal status for settlement of glasgow with a market every thursday grant of a market was first ever official grant of a weekly market to a burgh moreover between 1189 and 1195 king william granted burgh an annual fair a fair still in existence today increasing glasgow s status as an important settlement as well as new revenues for bishop rights entailed by glasgow s new burghal status and market privileges brought new people to settlement one of first of whom was one ranulf de haddington a former of haddington new settlement was laid out probably under influence of burgh of haddington around glasgow
