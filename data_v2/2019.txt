blakeney point designated as blakeney national nature reserve is a national nature reserve situated near to villages of blakeney morston and cley next sea on north coast of norfolk england its main feature is a 6 4 km 4 mi spit of shingle and sand dunes but reserve also includes salt marshes tidal mudflats and reclaimed farmland it has been managed by national trust since 1912 and lies within north norfolk coast site of special scientific interest which is additionally protected through natura 2000 special protection area spa international union for conservation of nature iucn and ramsar listings reserve is part of both an area of outstanding natural beauty aonb and a world biosphere reserve point has been studied for more than a century following pioneering ecological studies by botanist francis wall oliver and a bird ringing programme initiated by ornithologist emma turner area has a long history of human occupation ruins of a medieval monastery and blakeney chapel probably a domestic dwelling are buried in marshes towns sheltered by shingle spit were once important harbours but land reclamation schemes starting in 17th century resulted in silting up of river channels reserve is important for breeding birds especially terns and its location makes it a major site for migrating birds in autumn up to 500 seals may gather at end of spit and its sand and shingle hold a number of specialised invertebrates and plants including edible samphire or sea asparagus many visitors who come to sail or for other outdoor recreations are important to local economy but land based activities jeopardize nesting birds and fragile habitats especially dunes some access restrictions on humans and dogs help to reduce adverse effects and trips to see seals are usually undertaken by boat spit is a dynamic structure gradually moving towards coast and extending to west land is lost to sea as spit rolls forward river glaven can become blocked by advancing shingle and cause flooding

roughly west to east and joins mainland at cley beach before continuing onwards as a coastal ridge to weybourne it is approximately 6 4 km 4 mi long and is composed of a shingle bank which in places is 20 m 65 ft in width and up to 10 m 33 feet high it has been estimated that there are 2 3 million m3 82 million ft3 of shingle in spit bridges 1998 p 39 97 per cent of which is derived from flint

long history of human occupation dating back to palaeolithic and has produced many significant archaeological finds both modern and neanderthal people were present in area between 100 000 and 10 000 years ago before last glaciation and humans returned as ice retreated northwards archaeological record is poor until about 20 000 years ago partly because of very cold conditions that existed then but also because coastline was much further north than at present as ice retreated during mesolithic 10 000 5 000 bce sea level rose filling what is now north sea this brought norfolk coastline much closer to its present line so that many ancient sites are now under sea in an area now known as doggerland retrieved 18 september 2012 robertson et al 2005 pp 9 22 early mesolithic flint tools with

demonstrated by a number of wrecks in haven including a carvel built wooden ship land reclamation schemes especially those by henry calthorpe in 1640 just to west of cley led to silting up of glaven shipping channel and relocation of cley s wharf further enclosure in mid 1820s aggravated problem and also allowed shingle ridge at beach to block former tidal channel to salthouse marshes to east of

population rose to 2 000 pairs by mid century although it subsequently declined to no more than 165 pairs by 2000 perhaps due to predation sandwich terns were a scarce breeder until 1970s but there
