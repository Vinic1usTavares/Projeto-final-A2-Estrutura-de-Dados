history of brasenose college oxford stretches back to 1509 when brasenose college was founded on site of brasenose hall its name is believed to derive from name of a bronze knocker that adorned hall s door college was associated with lancashire and cheshire county origins of its two founders sir richard sutton and bishop of lincoln william smyth a link that was maintained strongly until latter half of nineteenth century first principals navigated brasenose with its catholic sympathisers through reformation and continuing religious reforms most of brasenose favoured royalist side during english civil war although it produced notable generals and clergy on both sides library and chapel were completed in mid seventeenth century despite brasenose suffering continuing financial problems post 1785 period would see an era of prosperity of college under principal william cleaver college began to be populated by gentlemen its income doubling between 1790 and 1810 and academic success considerable efforts to reconstruct brasenose were not completed however until second half of century with addition of new quad between 1886 and 1911 brasenose s financial position remained secure although under tenure of principal edward hartopp cradock brasenose s academic record waned greatly with much of its success focussed on sports where it excelled most notably in cricket and rowing mid century royal commissions were navigated although they were opposed in form their recommendations welcomed including submission of accounts election of charles buller heberden as principal in 1889 led to a reversal in brasenose s academic failures although its sporting performance suffered heberden was first lay principal presiding over an increasingly secular college opening up library to

greatly reduced lord curzon s post war reforms were successfully instituted inter war period was defined by william stallybrass who as fellow and eventual principal until 1948 dominated college life brasenose once again produced top sportsmen cricketers rowers and others this came at cost of falling academic standards and poorly performing finances which would see stallybrass authority challenged he died in a railway accident before he could be forced out however after war sporting achievements waned although there were notable exceptions but academic success did not improve significantly in what was now one of oxford s largest colleges 1970s saw considerable social change in brasenose admission of women beginning in 1974 more post graduate attendees and fewer domestic staff there was also considerable construction work to ensure that undergraduates could be housed for entirety of their degree on main site and on frewin site this task was only completed in 1997 with opening of st cross building and frewin extension law continued to be a strong subject for brasenose following on from stallybrass through principals barry nicholas and herbert hart as was emerging subject of philosophy politics and economics ppe starting with fellowship of vernon bogdanor brasenose s finances were secured and it thus entered twenty first century in a good position as regards financial

knocker in shape of leopard or lion head nose shaped door knocker of which one version now hangs above high table of main hall of brasenose college an alternative theory is that name is a corruption of brewhouse but this is not widely accepted although college did have its own brewhouse up until 1889 this theory is believed to date back only to 1837 crook 2008 p 9 during 1333 disturbances in oxford a group of clerks from brasenose hall left ongoing violence and made their way to stamford lincolnshire brasenose knocker was taken with them as a symbol of continuity and only believed

they spend ps40 improving site within a year buchan 1898 p 12 william smyth has risen quickly through ranks of church albeit as a more able administrator than prelate to become bishop of lincoln in 1496 chancellor of university between 1500 and 1503 and lord president of marches in 1501 assisted by influence of lady margaret beaufort transition between hall and college was not clear cut rather

formal charter of foundation in 1511 1512 altered by a revised code of sutton after smyth s death which was prefaced with words buchan 1898 p 15 in name of holy and undivided trinity father son and

however sutton lowered this to only twelve buchan 1898 p 16 crook 2008 pp 13 14 principal was required to be over thirty a graduate and priest and have support of visitor bishop of lincoln he was entitled to take up ecclesiastic office or duties that did not interfere overly with his job as principal fellows were required to be resident for ten months of each year entrants to college would have been only 11 or 12 years old with an intake both from those whose income was very low alongside those from gentlemanly backgrounds crook 2008 p 14 fellows had a high degree of autonomy but received only board and lodging as reward early history thumb brasenose college shown in a map of 1578 college remained associated with lancashire and cheshire with a particular preference for those from prestbury and founders birthplaces this was also reflected in early benefactors these included donation of john port serjeant at law for two fellowships for natives of chester in 1522 that of william sub dean of york for residents of york lincoln and nottingham in 1538 and for brian higden dean of york who sponsored a fellowship for those in yorkshire and lincolnshire in 1549 buchan 1898 p

humanity and greek take place at his own college buchan 1898 pp 18 19 only in 1572 was a lectureship in greek established at brasenose symptomatic of a conservatism that attached brasenose to a monastic teaching style that was increasingly problematic during reformation by end of sixteenth century however college did boast lectureships public readerships in new disciplines of logic and natural philosophy crook 2008 pp 15 16 by 1547 income of college had increased to almost ps200 yearly with an endowment that placed it squarely in midst of other colleges in size it did however make a

similarly old library now staircase iv room 4 was completed in 1520 1521 was not intended to be permanent but kept a considerable collection of books most attained from benefactors of which most valuable were those donated by henry mason during reign of james i library remained in that location until 1663 crook 2008 p 20 first two principals of college matthew smyth and john hawarden successfully navigated college through reformation period college retained strong catholic tendencies and support for reforms of henry viii and edward viii was minimal chapel s dean thomas hawarden was opposed to reforms and was once called to king s privy council to answer for his actions eventually though continuing reforms were carried through in particular despite an exception for university from act of uniformity in 1549 for services other than mass enforcement of book of common prayer severely limited ability of college to maintain old catholic services whilst outwardly adopting new

careful to protect university s buildings and freedoms upon regaining city following its surrender in 1646 these events and plague that came to oxford in 1643 did not escape brasenose buchan 1898 pp

of puritan sympathies by order of visitors however college held out repeatedly against efforts to expel or remove its fellows and principal most through deliberate inactivity radcliffe was ill and continued to personally oppose handing over control of college to greenwood particularly college archives and treasury fellows also opposing greenwood instead elected thomas yate to replace radcliffe upon his death although owing to visitors choice of greenwood he would not take up his post fully for twelve years over this period thirteen of brasenose s sixteen remaining fellows were expelled but

localised scholarships crook 2008 p 48 in 1679 college received an endowment from sarah seymour duchess of somerset to fund four somerset scholars to be drawn from a free school of manchester she also

to lose its reputation for ignorance it also became wealthier its social ranking improved and it attracted more members accounts were much improved from a deficit of ps444 in 1761 to a surplus of ps476 in 1781 this must have been helped by introduction of arabic numerals rather than roman numerals as late as 1773 radcliffe camera was opened in 1749 assisting college s attempts at self improvement crook 2008 p 103 social barriers were broken down both by reduction in duties of lowest groups and privileges of richest and increasing wealth of entrants to college generally college

first royal commission of 1850 51 into standards at universities of oxford and cambridge claiming that it lacked authority and served an ignorant purpose college believed that if it were to support commission it might at all future times be exposed to of political parties attacks and influences very injurious to peace and to steady performance of its duties it instead petitioned crown to abandon commission citing certain freedoms under bill of rights 1689 however commissioners were granted authority to force cooperation and petition rejected as it turned out college was happy to pursue many of commission s aims restriction of preference for candidates from north west although somerset scholars remained and reduction of living expenses something for which new buildings offering cheaper living and even union with lincoln college were considered but ultimately rejected more problematic were reforms to distribution of power and funding between senior and junior fellows although in 1855 1857 ordinances were put in place giving junior fellows same role in governance as their seniors thus situation began to improve for junior fellows as older fellows were gradually replaced changes

accounts which college submitted reveal an income of ps16 000 of which nearly ps10 000 came from land other property stocks and shares expenditure was around ps13 600 which left brasenose in a secure

institution of civility than an end in itself together with richard lodge it was this spirit that dominated his tenure as principal crook 2008 p 300 academic rigour was reintroduced to college and staff of brasenose were increasingly successful in maintaining discipline crook 2008 p 307 until end of century however number of students achieving blues outnumbered those attaining firsts author john buchan joined in 1895 a man of this new era although his work continued to portray brasenose as its previous muscular stereotype crook 2008 pp 307 309 heberden was also first lay principal although he was personally committed to church purchasing an organ for chapel out of his own personal funds crook 2008 p 311 brasenose was frequently represented as boasting no academic prowess at all

brigadier and received distinguished service order with three bars by 1918 brasenose had just eight undergraduates crook 2008 pp 321 322 inter war period inter war period saw brasenose adapt to changing conditions within university abolition of greek as a compulsory language admission of women to degrees and acceptance of first government funding across university these were spearheaded by chancellor lord curzon appointed in 1907 who wished to avoid another royal commission crook 2008 pp 324 325 there were also attempts to broaden university s intake of students from poorer backgrounds but living costs of ps400 across a three year degree made this difficult curzon was supported by his vice chancellor now brasenose s heberden crook 2008 pp 325 326 within brasenose however he was opposed by brasenose s youngest fellow william swan sonnenschein who in 1917 took surname stallybrass crook 2008 p 326 charles henry sampson principal between 1920 and 1936 did little more than keep ship on an even keel it was stallybrass as vice principal 1914 1936 that defined brasenose between wars crook 2008 p 336 stallybrass was a keen sportsman although like heberden he saw it only as a means to an end albeit a plethora of laudable ends crook 2008 p 328 brasenose had a middling income of ps24 000 a year with a similarly average 180 undergraduates crook 2008 p 338 religious attendance was relaxed and fees for returning to college between 9 and 11pm abolished brasenose s collegiate link with gonville and caius college cambridge was established staircases xiv and xv were created only significant changes to college buildings twenty fellows gradually replaced in stallybrass own image crook 2008 pp 338 339 brasenose went back to head of river in 1928 rising from 22nd in 1922 although oxford s performance in rowing was poor brasenose was central to its few successes against cambridge crook 2008 p 343 it would sink to sixth in 1934 although notable among its members was john gorton future prime minister of australia crook 2008 p 344 success in rowing was matched in rugby and cricket with brasenose producing players such as alexander obolensky and ian smith brasenose rugby only reached its peak after second world war with players such as brian and philip moore baron moore of wolvercote crook 2008 pp 345 346 in cricket geoffrey legge and greville stevens were early players ian peebles gerry chalk and roger kimpton followed them between 1934 and 1938 at least five members of university team came from brasenose crook 2008 pp 346 347 it may have been brasenose s attachment to sport that meant it was slow to phase out pass men crook 2008 pp 348 349 effect on academic success was considerable brasenose slumped in performance except in law where it excelled in 1930s brasenose recorded no more than six firsts in a year a total assisted by seven firsts in 1937 1939 in law out a total of 13 across university crook 2008 p 361 future lord scarman lord of appeal in ordinary was among undergraduates two contemporaries and aspiring students richard holdsworth and michael peacock were killed in second world war crook 2008 p 375 in terms of intake by 1937 there were 201 undergraduates it was a uniform selection that was almost completely middle class like rest of university over 60 of entrants came from independent schools perhaps because of ps250 a year cost of reading towards a degree crook 2008 p 350 it had unlike some other college students from several other nations muhammad aslam khan khattak and abbas from british india among them students were varied

period include charles morgan edward atiyah and william golding crook 2008 pp 358 367 second world war brasenose was a smaller community during war but it kept going once again union with lincoln college was discussed but in other areas temporary merger was more appropriate thus brasenose and christ church fielded single sports teams college hosted military personnel as it had in first world war a nissen hut was even set up in deer park crook 2008 pp 369 370 brasenose sent a flood of undergraduates into forces in particular college s sporting masculine ethos meant many joined royal air force this would contribute significantly to a high death total 123 for allies and 1 for germans more than in first world war although proportionately less many of brasenose s sporting heroes died among survivors were future archbishop of canterbury robert and cricketer pieter van der bijl crook 2008 pp 370 372 immediate post war period once again reform on agenda with in particular passing of education act 1944 effect was dramatic state support through bursaries and central grants was hugely increased proportion of state school entrants increased considerably for first time in over a hundred years there was considerable competition over places stallybrass made vice chancellor of university in 1947 was sceptical about state education it was not quality of students but rather means of state control that worried him annual grants from government were made to university not colleges and might yet replace endowments as brasenose s primary source of income making it dependent on university support and increasing federation of colleges in a university superstructure stallybrass worried over this loss of college autonomy although it was matched with a doubled grant from government and huge sums set aside for capital spending crook 2008 pp 376 377 right of brasenose to choose its own students might be under threat he thought as it happened labour government decided against corporate admission and threats to stallybrass power mostly resided within brasenose crook 2008 p 378 some members of governing body returning in some cases from war wished to realign college with new national spirit principal s considerable role in admissions which stallybrass had used to elevate sportsmen was subject of criticism and accusations of financial under performance and over spending were made a challenge was made directly in bringing of a motion calling for a review of brasenose s financial performance since 1922 however before it could be debated stallybrass was killed having apparently fallen from a train whilst returning to oxford from a university meeting in london although possibility of suicide was considered coroner ruled case one of death by misadventure crook 2008 pp 379 382 hugh last was elected in his place although reluctantly he had been told by his doctor that he was terminally ill but fellows were insistent crook 2008 p 383 second half of twentieth century brasenose s finances entered second half of century in poor shape and considerably worse than period between 1930 and 1931 slipping relative to other colleges from 3rd to 8th but they were improved during last s tenure along with undergraduate admissions college showed a surplus in 1952 1953 and income in 1957 ps104 000 was double what it had been in 1938 pay for fellows was still poor and they were small in number compared to other colleges there was a sizeable entertainment budget however something which combined with long hours may have contributed to short lifespans only in 1987 did a sitting fellow reach retirement age crook 2008 pp 385 386 last resigned as principal in 1956 dying shortly after crook 2008 p 393 turnover was considerable although some fellows stayed on maurice became principal in 1956 and retired in 1960 he was replaced by sir noel hall crook 2008 p 387 hall s tenure was troubled not externally but rather from hall s patchy knowledge of college and staff his selection de mieux was sometimes questioned although he remained well liked however college which had thus far stayed assured found itself in a changing environment crook 2008 pp 387 388 herbert hart however principal between 1973 and 1978 was first to be elected from outside brasenose crook 2008 p 417 lord windlesham made principal in 1989 was first to hold cabinet office crook 2008 p 432 brasenose s reputation for law remained under firstly ron maudsley a tutorial fellow in stallybrass mould and roman and civil law lecturer and tutor barry nicholas then peter birks another roman lawyer and sometime regius professor of civil law at all souls harry lawson first professor of comparative law and sir otto kahn freund an employment law specialist crook 2008 pp 388 389 there was also a growing reputation for english literature staff ian jack and alastair fowler among them other notable staff included robert shackleton tutor in french sometime librarian and senior dean sir ronald syme camden professor of ancient history chair previously held by last with whom he would continue a personal dispute crook 2008 pp 390 392 it would all mean brasenose s fellows in 1970 were dominated by britain s top academic minds however disjunct from academic success that would become one subject to develop after 1970 however was politics philosophy and economics ppe

dyer conjecture and nicholas kurti vice president of royal society crook 2008 pp 394 395 overall although immediate post war staff remained traditional if not overly conservative in nature with a third drawn from brasenose itself late sixties signalled a change on this front then a wave of new face emerged among them laszlo solymar later professor of applied electromagnetism vernon bogdanor professor of government robert evans regius professor of modern history and graham richards oxford s chairman of chemistry crook 2008 p 396 during last s tenure brasenose had a very high number of undergraduates a peak of 104 in 1949 second in university results however were poor two firsts in 1950 placing college 18th it was only near end that things picked up perhaps a result of last s stern manner there were 13 firsts in 1955 however until 1970 they remained poor with only a small increase on pre war years crook 2008 pp 396 398 brasenose sat twenty first in norrington table in 1968 twenty sixth in 1975 and twenty seventh in 1980 it was into this that hart made his reforms to bring students closer to governing body and make them responsible for more of their own care cleaning and washing for example crook 2008 pp 418 420 by 2001 brasenose had climbed tables once again coming in third place in norrington table with 30 firsts there were still sportsmen though a w ramsay future rfu president kenneth spence and pete dawkins among a dwindling set of rugby players colin cowdrey among college s cricketers there were no brasenose men in varsity cricket team between 1972 and 1989 certainly a slide on previous times in rowing decline was even more significant sixteenth among colleges in 1964 twentieth in 1976 it was only in 1990s that rowing would return to success firstly with women and then with men crook 2008 pp 400 402 outside sport a young jeffrey archer successfully invited beatles to brasenose peak of a fundraising campaign for oxfam crook 2008 p 403 in 1960s onwards there was a certain progressiveness in air and first women guests were admitted in 1964 crook 2008 pp 408 409 women members were first admitted to 1974 1975 year crook 2008 pp 403 405 college s first comprehensive schooled student paul barker had arrived in 1955 it was also almost completely secular with exception of chaplain and his deputies chaplain s role itself dominated by pastoral work students themselves concentrated more and more on exams marks improved across university but this left a class gulf between some staff and undergraduates most visible in gentlemanly sports michael palin and robert hewison were among new creative talent since 1950s over 70 of students were state assisted half of undergraduates drawn from state or direct grant schools a figure very close to university average crook 2008 p 411 brasenose merged entrance and scholarship exams in 1961 abolished closed scholarships in decade after and open entrance awards in 1984 crook 2008 p 413 brasenose s traditional link with north west also floundered although it is perhaps surprising that it lasted until 1970s in its place there were more entrants paying higher fees from elsewhere in world crook 2008 p 422 thumb right brasenose s updated mediaeval kitchen part of project q expectation had been since 1920s that undergraduates would spend at least one of their years living in college however post war expectations grew and brasenose began another construction programme to ensure it could house students for longer designs were drawn up by philip powell and hidalgo moya in a then modern style new buildings cost ps76 000 to design housing 32 rooms and forming staircases xvi xvii and xviii architecture which has since come to be thoroughly disliked was praised rather more popular rooms

to house all undergraduates for duration of their course finances had been secured with a late revival and accounts early in twenty first century showed a 6 surplus and a ranking of 13th out of 36th
