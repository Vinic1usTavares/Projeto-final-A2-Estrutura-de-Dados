cerro azul blue hill in spanish sometimes referred to as quizapu is an active stratovolcano in maule region of central chile immediately south of descabezado grande part of south volcanic zone of andes its summit is above sea level and is capped by a summit crater that is wide and opens to north beneath summit volcano features numerous scoria cones and flank vents cerro azul is responsible for several of south america s largest recorded eruptions in 1846 and 1932 in 1846 an effusive eruption formed vent at site of present day quizapu crater on northern flank of cerro azul and sent lava flowing down sides of volcano creating a lava field 8 9 square kilometres 3 3 5 square miles in area phreatic and strombolian volcanism between 1907 and 1932 excavated this crater in 1932 one of largest explosive eruptions of 20th century occurred at quizapu crater and sent of ash into atmosphere volcano s most recent eruption was in 1967 south volcanic zone has a long history of eruptions and poses a threat to surrounding region any volcanic hazard ranging from minor ashfalls to pyroclastic flows could pose a significant risk to humans and wildlife despite its inactivity cerro azul could again produce a major eruption if this were to happen relief efforts would probably be quickly organized teams such as volcano disaster assistance program vdap are prepared to effectively evacuate assist and rescue people threatened by volcanic eruptions geography and geology regional setting volcanism in chilean andes is caused by subduction of nazca and antarctic tectonic plates under south american plate volcanoes in chile occur in central cvz south svz and austral volcanic zones gap that separates central and south volcanic zones is caused by shallow angle subduction in flat slab segment where more buoyant juan fernandez ridge subducts under south american continent stern et al p 147 this buoyant region prevents slab subducting tectonic plate from diving deep into mantle where heat and pressure would destabilize mineral chlorite releasing water that would in turn cause melting and volcanism patagonian volcanic gap which separates south and austral volcanic zones is caused by subduction of chile ridge though it is less clear whether this gap also is due to flat slab subduction it may instead arise because melting of subducting slab there produced felsic igneous rocks instead of volcanoes offshore volcanism also occurs in chile intraplate volcanism generated from easter and juan fernandez hotspots has formed many chilean islands including isla salas y gomez easter island and juan fernandez islands underwater volcanism occurs due to seafloor spreading along chile ridge nearly 100 quaternary pleistocene or holocene age independent volcanoes exist in country in addition to 60 volcanic complexes and caldera systems of 200 historically active volcanoes in andean range 36 are found in chile local setting thumb right alt mountain with appearance of a truncated cone at centre of image is descabezado grande volcano and close to it is pyramidal cerro azul cerro azul is part of south volcanic zone which runs through central and western chile and extends south to argentina this range includes at least nine caldera complexes more than 70 of chile s stratovolcanoes and volcanic fields that have been active in quaternary and hundreds of minor eruptive centres south volcanic zone is most volcanically active region in chile and produces around one eruption per year its largest historical eruption was at quizapu crater located on north side of cerro azul s summit see below and its most active volcanoes are llaima and villarrica stern et al pp 154 156 cerro azul just south of descabezado grande volcano is part of descabezado grande cerro azul eruptive system a volcanic field that comprises its two large namesake volcanic edifices and several smaller vents including 12 holocene calderas both volcanoes lie on top of shield a plateau built of over 100 lava flows that erupted in at least 12 volcanic episodes during quaternary period upper lava layers are dated at 340 000 years as with majority of andean volcanoes cerro azul is a stratovolcano meaning that it consists of layers or strata of volcanic ash and lava flows cone of cerro azul has a total volume of about and is a young feature formed in holocene it is made of agglutinated pyroclasts and some dacite lavas hildreth and drake 1992 p 96 cone has a few volcanic craters majority of its eruptions in recorded history have originated from quizapu crater on northern flank of cerro azul s cone other craters lying on flanks of main cone are caracol snail crater los crater la and crater sin nombre nameless crater all of craters lie between in elevation except quizapu which is up volcano summit of cerro azul is crowned by an asymmetric crater about in diameter pleistocene glacial activity is evident in form of 500 meter 1 640 ft deep struts in volcanoes sides these deep cuts have revealed strata of older rock thumb right alt five major volcanoes range from cerro azul in central chile south through llaima and villarrica to cerro hudson major chilean volcanoes are marked by red triangles on this map quizapu crater quizapu which formed during 1846 eruption is most prominent crater it is also known as cerro del medio middle hill or volcan nuevo new volcano volcanic vent formed during an effusive eruption involving hornblende dacite flows accompanied by tephra and crater was excavated by phreatic and strombolian eruptions between 1907 and 1932 pent up pressure within volcano spawned an enormous plinian eruption in 1932 volume of lava ejected during this single event is roughly equal to that ejected during rest of eruptive history at quizapu since its formation in 1846 although of material was ejected no subsidence was detected from removal of magma hildreth and drake pp 96 98 because of aerodynamic drag a plinian eruption excavates a circular crater as earlier eruptions had already formed an approximately circular caldera plinian eruption was able to proceed efficiently with minimal drag and minimal reshaping of crater hildreth and drake p 108 quizapu crater is almost perfectly circular and rises to a prominence of above surrounding portions of volcano cresting at in elevation quizapu is one of highest known plinian craters radius of crater floor which is current inner vent is around while radius of its rim is crater floor lies at and rim lies above that giving walls an average slope of 34 35 degrees close to angle of repose western wall is cut by two long dacitic lava flows probably remnants of a dome or an eruption crater is surrounded by debris from its 1932 eruption and topped by layers thick of mafic scoria and ash hildreth and drake p 103 climate and vegetation cerro azul is situated in a mediterranean climate zone characterized by hot and dry summers but mild and wet winters temperatures and precipitation are strongly dependent on topography in andes annual average maximum temperatures lie in range while minimum temperatures are below annual precipitation is up to 800 mm 31 5 inches vegetation in andes varies with elevation above 1 600 meters 5 249 ft slopes of mountains are covered by alpine like steppe while below there are zones of nothofagus forest forest forest and number of plant species is likely to exceed 2 000 although no comprehensive study of flora of central chile has been undertaken eruptive history cerro azul has a history of eruptions dating back to at least 1846 known events include effusive eruptions lava flows which created quizapu vent explosive eruptions and phreatic eruptions pyroclastic flows have also been observed as a result of some of these explosive eruptions earliest recorded eruption began on november 26 1846 while volcano s last eruption began on august 9 1967 volcano has produced two of largest eruptions in south america in recorded history in 1846 and 1932 both released of dacitic magma first record of activity 1846 on november 26 1846 cerro azul erupted this was first report of activity at volcano and no trace of fumaroles adjacent vents or pre eruptive activity exists most descriptions of eruption come from backcountry herdsmen one who was camped in a valley approximately east of quizapu heard a great noise and a cloud of ash emanate from mountain in late afternoon no precursor activity was reported and herdsman claimed that there were no earthquakes during late afternoon eruption that night two herdsmen near site heard a continuous roar punctuated by loud bangs and crackling sounds like that of great rockslides lightning and thunder accompanied spectacle they saw many blue flames and were choked by sulfurous gas observers in talca away heard eruption noises and sulfurous odors reached them day after eruption none of reports mention earthquakes or ash fall though crackling and banging sounds could be from block lavas aa hildreth and drake pp 97 98 this first recorded eruption of cerro azul was effusive and formed volcanic vent at quizapu hornblende dacite lava erupted with small masses of tephra which had been shortly before eruption lava flowed over estero barroso valley and westward into rio valley by november 28 volcano appeared at rest and herdsman returned to place of first observation there they found a blocky lava field lava was still hot fuming and crackling with gas and flame fascinated by volcano ignacy domeyko traveled to chile to study field and found its width to be by 1992 field had grown to twice that size hildreth and drake p 98 early 20th century cerro azul was quiet from 1846 to beginning of 20th century after a possible precursor explosive event in 1903 cerro azul once again erupted in 1907 between 1907 and 1914 plumes and clouds of ash frequently rose out of caldera and at least a few of these events were explosive on september 8 1914 an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers about 4 mi into air over 8 minutes by 1916 these eruptions had produced a caldera nearly identical to one in existence today volcano also erupted several times as recorded by vogel in 1913 and 1920 with its activity increasing from 1916 to 1926 during these years eruptions grew more frequent and more violent a major outburst on november 2 1927 started a period of nearly continuous violent eruptions that lasted until 1929 during this period cerro azul sometimes erupted daily sending columns of ash as far as 6 or 7 kilometers about 4 mi into air quizapu crater grew slightly during this eruptive period pre 1932 volcanism was largely phreatic or fumarolic as evidenced by lack of tephra generated by these eruptions photographs from 1912 show vapor plumes containing little ash rising above crater major eruption 1932 by 1932 quizapu had produced many phreatic events and one effusive eruption but no large plinian eruptions this frequency of minor eruptive activity proved to be a precursor for a major eruption on 25 january 1932 observers in malargue saw a large black cloud over summit by 9 april volcano emitted green gas and started to bellow like a bull hildreth and drake p 99 on april 10 cerro azul finally erupted releasing a towering column or plume of white gas after 10 am plume turned black with ash and began to form an umbrella shape ash was carried by wind into puesto el tristan in argentina about away where beginning at 1 pm it rained down for hours at 4 pm coarser sandy material and some pumice lapilli began to fall cerro azul s april 1932 eruption was one of largest of 20th century releasing of lava volcano ejected primarily dacitic tephra accompanied by rhyodacite andesite and minuscule amounts of andesitic and basaltic scoria at least one eruptive period lasted for 18 hours creating an exceptionally uniform deposit eruption columns extending into air were sighted phenocrysts were similar to effusive eruption in 1846 soon after both and descabezado grande volcanoes began erupting sending clouds of ash into argentina eruption had a volcanic explosivity index vei of at least 5 since eruption of 1932 quizapu has been quiet in 1949 and 1967 small ash clouds were reported while in 1980s there were no signs of activity other than fumaroles hildreth and drake p 101 threats and preparedness cerro azul is in south volcanic zone where many volcanoes pose a threat to human life among other active volcanoes of south volcanic zone are mount hudson llaima and villarrica villarrica and llaima together have more than 80 reported episodes of volcanism since 1558 and at least 40 south volcanic zone volcanoes have had holocene age eruptions stern et al p 154 every known type of eruption hawaiian strombolian plinian subplinian phreatic phreatomagmatic and vulcanian has occurred at some point in range cerro azul itself has experienced phreatic strombolian and plinian activity in human history type of eruption tends to correspond with lava composition strombolian eruptions at llaima antuco villarrica and elsewhere have been produced by basaltic to basaltic andesitic activity dacitic to rhyolitic lavas have been linked to subplinian and plinian eruptions such as those at quizapu 1932 and hudson 1991 because of this variability volcanic hazards from cerro azul and surrounding region could come in many different forms historical eruptions typically have produced lahars lava flows and ashfalls lava flows and lahars could wipe out entire cities or towns ashfall produced by explosive eruptions could interfere with air traffic most threatening of all is risk of pyroclastic flows or avalanches which have historically traversed as far as in region thumb right alt glaciers around a black caldera from which steam is rising mount hudson an active volcano in svz shortly after an eruption in 1991 volcano has produced eruptions as powerful as volcanic explosivity index degree six past eruptions of quizapu crater ejected enormous amounts of ash that traveled as far as brazil after 1932 eruption local vegetation was devastated and area remained barren until 1990s though human life was not impacted stern et al p 101 despite extent of its eruptions threat to humans from quizapu is relatively small because of remote location of cerro azul nevertheless size of past eruptions is large enough for scientists to be worried evidence of a potentially deadly threat lies in a lahar at descabezado grande historically lahars have killed thousands in andes there is however a possibility that a large reservoir of rhyodacite magma may exist under azul descabezado complex if this is case all previous eruptions in 1846 1967 were only preliminary leaks from large magma chamber beneath and a large caldera forming eruption may be expected in future hildreth and drake pp 122 123 if cerro azul were to erupt relief efforts could be orchestrated volcanic disaster assistance program vdap formed in response to famous eruption of nevado del ruiz in colombia and responded to 1991 eruption of mount hudson in chile team s stated aim is to reduce eruption caused fatalities and economic losses in developing countries made up of various usgs offices such as cascades volcano observatory cvo that are responsible for monitoring mount st helens team is outfitted with equipment capable of monitoring
