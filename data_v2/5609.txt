when she assisted with r b bennett s successful calgary west campaign governments inability to end or alleviate effects of great depression soon disillusioned her with conventional politics upon hearing that aberhart was beginning to incorporate politics and economics into his weekly gospel radio addresses she began to listen and soon became a convert to his version of social credit early involvement in social credit in 1932 rogers convinced aberhart to hold public meetings on social credit in calgary she subsequently organized neighbourhood study groups on theory in 1933 central council of social credit in calgary which coordinated city s sixty social credit study groups named her women s organizer in which capacity she held mass meetings designed to recruit women to social credit in 1934 she embarked on a sixteen month speaking tour of alberta at same time she organized social credit study groups around province including seventy two in edmonton she concluded her tour by organizing a mass meeting there in spring of 1935 where aberhart spoke before 9 000 people byrne 94 when fissures appeared between aberhart and people who supported more orthodox version of social credit proposed by c h douglas movement s british founder rogers remained loyal to aberhart in assessment of t c byrne her loyalty to aberhart was second only to that of ernest manning aberhart s young protege byrne 94 95 when aberhart decided to run social credit candidates in 1935 provincial election he adopted an unusual system of candidate nomination each constituency would nominate three or four candidates with a committee headed by aberhart deciding which one would actually run elliott 174 six different constituencies nominated rogers as one of their candidates and aberhart decided that she should run in ponoka her opponent from governing united farmers of alberta ufa was former premier john edward brownlee who had resigned previous year in wake of a sex scandal in which he was sued for seduction of a young woman brownlee biographer franklin foster speculates that selection of a female candidate to run against so called sober faced seducer was a deliberate strategic decision by aberhart and noted further that aside from aberhart himself social credit could not have fielded a stronger candidate in ponoka foster 270 member of legislative assembly rogers won riding with 2 295 votes more than 1 400 ahead of brownlee in fact ufa lost every seat it contested and social credit candidates won 56 of alberta s 63 seats aberhart became premier he did not appoint rogers or any other woman to his cabinet and athabasca university historian alvin finkel has suggested that her gender cost her such an appointment female cabinet ministers were not unprecedented in alberta irene parlby was a cabinet minister throughout ufa s time in office and finkel argues given that rogers was recognized as sharp articulate and hard working that she could reasonably have expected a cabinet portfolio finkel 97 despite her loyalty to aberhart rogers became frustrated with his delay in implementing social credit economic reforms he had promised during 1937 social credit backbenchers revolt she sided with insurgents who threatened to bring down government unless it took concrete steps to implement social credit once insurgents reached a settlement with aberhart she returned to her former position of loyalty and sought re election as a social crediter in 1940 election prior to this election social credit s opponents including liberals conservatives and those elements of ufa that had not moved to social credit formed people s league which ran nominally independent candidates one of these candidates percy mckelvey led rogers by 13 votes on first count cooperative commonwealth federation ccf s c a johnson was in a distant third when johnson s votes were redistributed in accordance with alberta s electoral laws at time mckelvey s margin increased to nearly two hundred votes and he was declared victor later life after her defeat rogers and her husband moved to edmonton she disapproved of social credit government s move to right under new premier ernest manning and joined socialist ccf finkel considers this surprising in light of her long time devotion to ideals of social credit role ccf played in her 1940 election defeat and his assessment that she seemed more interested in monetary reform than in general social critique put forward by ccf she served as a member of ccf s edmonton membership and organization committee finkel 79 rogers was elected to board of edmonton public schools in 1959 edmonton election as a candidate of left leaning civic reform association cra she was re elected in 1961 1963 1964 1966 1968 and 1971 when cra dissolved in advance of
