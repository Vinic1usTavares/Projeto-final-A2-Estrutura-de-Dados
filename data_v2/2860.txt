malpuech facial clefting syndrome also called malpuech syndrome or gypsy type facial clefting syndrome is a rare congenital syndrome it is characterized by facial clefting any type of cleft in bones and tissues of face including a cleft lip and palate a caudal appendage a human tail growth deficiency intellectual and developmental disability and abnormalities of renal system kidneys and male genitalia abnormalities of heart and other skeletal malformations may also be present syndrome was initially described by georges malpuech and associates in 1983 it is thought to be genetically related to juberg hayward syndrome malpuech syndrome has also been considered as part of a spectrum of congenital genetic disorders associated with similar facial urogenital and skeletal anomalies termed 3mc syndrome this proposed spectrum includes malpuech michels and mingarelli carnevale osa syndromes mutations in collec11 and masp1 genes are believed to be a cause of these syndromes incidence of malpuech syndrome is unknown pattern of inheritance is autosomal recessive which means a defective mutated gene associated with syndrome is located on an autosome and syndrome occurs when two copies of this defective gene are inherited characteristics malpuech syndrome is congenital being apparent at birth it is characterized by a feature known as facial clefting observed and noted in initial description of syndrome as a cleft lip and palate facial clefting is identified by clefts in bones muscles and tissues of face including lips and palate forms of cleft lip and palate typically seen with malpuech syndrome are midline down middle of lip and palate or bilateral affecting both sides of mouth and palate facial clefting generally encompasses a wide range of severity ranging from minor anomalies such as a bifid split uvula to a cleft lip and palate to major developmental and structural defects of facial bones and soft tissues clefting of lip and palate occurs during embryogenesis additional facial and ortho dental anomalies that have been described with syndrome include unusually wide set eyes sometimes reported as narrow palpebral fissures separation between upper and lower eyelids and ptosis drooping of eyelids frontal bossing prominent eyebrow ridge with highly arched eyebrows wide nasal root and a flattened nasal tip malar hypoplasia underdeveloped upper cheek bone micrognathia an undersized lower jaw and prominent incisors auditory anomalies include an enlarged ear ridge and hearing impairment associated with congenital otitis media or glue ear inflammation of middle ear and hearing loss another feature identified with malpuech syndrome is a caudal appendage a caudal appendage is a congenital outgrowth stemming from coccyx tailbone present in many non human animal species as a typical tail this feature when seen in an infant has been described as a human tail this was observed by guion almeida 1995 in three individuals from brazil appendage on x rays variously appeared as a prominent protrusion of coccyx on a physical examination appendage resembles a nodule like stub of an animal tail finn and lynch 2006 illustration p 243 deficiencies such as mental retardation learning disability growth retardation and developmental delay are common psychiatric manifestations that have been reported with syndrome include psychotic behavior obsessive compulsive disorder loss of inhibition hyperactivity aggression fear of physical contact and compulsive actions like echolalia repeating words spoken by another person neuromuscular tics have also been noted urogenital abnormalities or those affecting urinary and reproductive systems are common with syndrome malpuech et al 1983 and et al 2005 reported variously in affected males a hypospadias a congenital mislocation of urinary meatus cryptorchidism ectopic or undescended testes bifid split and underdeveloped scrotum and an obstructive urethral valve an affected boy was also reported by reardon et al 2001 with left renal agenesis an enlarged and displaced right kidney cryptorchidism and a shawl scrotum other malformations that have been noted with syndrome are omphalocele and an umbilical hernia thumb left 250px diagram of a neonatal heart affected by pda congenital abnormalities of heart have also been observed with malpuech syndrome from a healthy japanese couple chinen and 1995 described sixth child who had features consistent with disorder this two month old male infant was also affected by cardiac anomalies including patent ductus arteriosus pda and ventricular septal defect opening in ductus arteriosus associated with pda had been surgically repaired in infant at 38 days of age a number of minor skeletal aberrations were also reported in infant including bones at lambdoid sutures cause and genetics thumb right 220px malpuech facial clefting syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance malpuech syndrome as with other disorders within 3mc syndrome consideration is caused by mutations in collec11 and masp1 genes in an investigation by rooryck et al 2011 eleven families affected by 3mc syndrome were studied which resulted in identification of these two mutations both genes encode proteins of lectin complement pathway which plays a role in complement system of innate or non specific immunity in humans and other species collec11 or cl k1 gene is located on short arm of chromosome 2 3 in humans cl k1 protein is a c type lectin and belongs to family of these proteins other than its role in innate immunity protein is thought to be involved in development of tissues including craniofacial cartilage heart and kidney during embryogenesis this function in facial development was corroborated through study of zebrafish where mutations in its version of cl k1 contributed to craniofacial abnormalities such as craniofacial clefts possibly associated with errors in neural crest cell migration thumb left 150px short and long arm of a typical human chromosome masp1 or mannan binding serine protease i gene is located on long arm of human chromosome 3 at 3q27 q28 protein is a type of called a mannan binding lectin which plays a role in innate immunity by binding to pathogens such as viruses including hiv as described by et al 2010 three turkish individuals from two consanguineous families children of relatives such as cousins are said to be in a consanguineous family with various characteristics of 3mc syndrome including facial and a caudal appendage were evaluated investigation of homologous chromosomes through gene mapping revealed an region a location on a chromosome where both alleles of a gene originate from a common ancestor at chromosome 3q27 in both families in one family a missense mutation in masp1 at this location resulted in replacement of amino acid glycine by arginine at position 687 in gene sequence mutation cosegregated with observed phenotype in individuals from second family dna sequencing of masp1 showed a nonsense mutation that resulted in a deactivation of tryptophan at position 290 in gene that also cosegregated with phenotype both mutations occur in a form of masp1 known to process loss of this function associated with mutation of masp1 causes disruptions in availability of insulin like growth factor during craniofacial and musculoskeletal development during embryonic period these results indicate that mutations in masp1 are responsible for an array of features found with malformation disorders including malpuech syndrome syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner this means defective gene s responsible for disorder collec11 masp1 is located on an autosome chromosomes 2 and 3 are autosomes and two copies of defective gene one inherited from each parent are required in order to be born with disorder parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of defective gene but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of disorder diagnosis it is suggested that diagnostic criteria for malpuech syndrome should include cleft lip and or palate typical associated facial features and at least two of following urogenital anomalies caudal appendage and growth or developmental delay due to relatively high rate of hearing impairment found with disorder it too may be considered in diagnosis another congenital disorder wolf hirschhorn pitt rogers danks syndrome shares malpuech features in its diagnostic criteria because of this lacking differentiation microscopic analysis of chromosomes of an individual can be employed to distinguish two whereas deletions in short arm of chromosome 4 would be revealed with wolf hirschhorn a karyotype without this aberration present would favor a malpuech syndrome diagnosis also karyotype of an individual with malpuech syndrome alone will be normal classification malpuech syndrome has been shown to have physical or similarities with several other genetic disorders a report by reardon et al 2001 of a nine year old boy exhibiting facial caudal and urogenital anomalies consistent with malpuech syndrome who also had skeletal indicative of juberg hayward syndrome suggests that two disorders may be caused by different mutations of same gene along with several other disorders that have similar or overlapping features and autosomal recessive inheritance malpuech syndrome has been considered to belong under designation 3mc syndrome et al 2005 described a three year old female known to have michels syndrome in their review of physical similarities between michels malpuech and mingarelli carnevale syndromes particularly facial appearance including instances of cleft lip and palate and ptosis and a similarity of congenital abdominal and urogenital anomalies they believed syndromes may represent a spectrum of genetic disorders rather than three individual disorders they initially suggested this spectrum could be named 3mc michels malpuech mingarelli carnevale syndrome this conclusion and name 3mc syndrome was supported by leal et al 2008 who reported a brother and sister with an array of symptoms that overlapped various syndromes further assertion of 3mc syndrome was by rooryck et al 2011 in an elaboration of its cause management many of congenital malformations found with malpuech syndrome can be corrected surgically these include cleft lip and palate omphalocele urogenital and craniofacial abnormalities skeletal deformities such as a caudal appendage or scoliosis and hernias of primary area of concern for these procedures applied to a neonate with congenital disorders including malpuech syndrome regards logistics of anesthesia methods like tracheal intubation for management of airway during general anesthesia can be hampered by even smaller or mouth of infant for regional anesthesia methods like spinal blocking are more difficult where scoliosis is present in a 2010 report by kiernan et al a four year old girl with malpuech syndrome was being prepared for an unrelated tonsillectomy and while undergoing intubation insertion of a laryngoscope needed to identify airway for placement of endotracheal tube was made troublesome by presence of micrognathia attributed to syndrome after replacement with a laryngoscope of adjusted size intubation proceeded normally successful general anesthesia followed a rare follow up of a male with malpuech syndrome was presented by et al 2007 born at term from an uneventful pregnancy and delivery infant underwent a surgical repair of a cleft lip and palate no problems were reported with procedure a heart abnormality atrial septal defect was also apparent but required no intervention at age three years mental retardation hyperactivity and obsessive compulsive disorder were diagnosed hearing impairment was diagnosed at age six managed with use of hearing aids over course of decade that followed a number of psychiatric evaluations were performed at age 14 he exhibited a fear of physical contact at age 15 he experienced a severe psychotic episode characterized by agitation and a loss of sociosexual inhibition this array of symptoms were treated with prescription medications he maintained a low level of mental deficiency by age 17 with moments of compulsive echolalia epidemiology and history incidence of malpuech syndrome has not been determined a 1999 report by et al suggested that only about 12 individuals worldwide were affected by disorder at that time syndrome was first reported by malpuech and colleagues in 1983 observed in four children of unspecified gender in what was described as a gypsy family children included three siblings and their first cousin family was known to be highly consanguineous references external
