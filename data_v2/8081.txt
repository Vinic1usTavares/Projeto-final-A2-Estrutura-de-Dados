colours of animals is a zoology book written in 1890 by sir edward bagnall poulton 1856 1943 it was first substantial textbook to argue case for darwinian selection applying to all aspects of animal coloration book also pioneered concept of frequency dependent selection and introduced term aposematism book begins with a brief account of physical causes of animal coloration second chapter gives an overview of book describing various uses of colour in terms of advantages it can bring through natural selection next seven chapters describe camouflage both in predators and in prey methods of camouflage covered include background matching resemblance to specific objects such as bird droppings self decoration with materials from environment and seasonal colour change of arctic animals two chapters cover warning colours including both batesian mimicry where mimic is edible and mullerian mimicry where distasteful species mimic each other a chapter then looks at how animals combine multiple methods of defence for instance in puss moth two chapters examine coloration related to sexual selection finally poulton summarizes subject with a fold out table including a set of greek derived words that he invented of which aposematic and cryptic survive in biological usage colours of animals was well received on its publication although book s support for sexual selection was criticised by alfred russel wallace and its darwinism and critique of lamarckism were attacked by edward drinker cope wallace liked poulton s experimental work but was critical of his opinions on sexual selection neo lamarckian cope criticised poulton s support for darwin but liked book s many observations of animal coloration modern biologists respect poulton s advocacy of natural selection and sexual selection despite lack at time of an adequate theory of heredity and his recognition of frequency dependent selection book approach thumb left title page of first edition of colours of

royal natural history 1895 this image shows argus pheasant described in text bird is not illustrated in book poulton strongly supports darwin both on general theme of natural selection and on power of sexual selection in species which are sexually dimorphic where usually male is showier than female poulton knew his view was controversial but believed he was winning argument poulton 1890 p 286 frequency dependent selection in colours of animals poulton introduced concept of frequency dependent selection selection based on how abundant a form is in context of a polymorphism which he argued would otherwise soon vanish poulton 1890 pp 46 47 mimicry and aposematism thumb left warning coloration of brazilian skunk in colours of 1890 p 162 basic concept of warning coloration aposematism like black and yellow pattern of a wasp is approached very simply in next paragraph poulton ties aposematism to mimicry as follows poulton introduced term aposematism with words contents thumb frontispiece mimicry in south african butterflies only chromolithograph in book book s structure emphasises extent to which poulton like darwin relied on a mass of evidence mainly from insects to make his case chapter 1 physical cause of animal colours poulton introduces absorption scattering colour due to thin plates structural coloration diffraction and refraction chapter 2 uses of colour effects of natural selection in creating or destroying colour are discussed colour can be non significant e g directly useful for absorbing heat poulton argues but by far most widespread use of colour is to assist an animal in escaping from its enemies or in capturing its prey former is protective latter aggressive resemblance i e camouflage poulton 1890 p 19 topics of mimicry warning coloration and sexual selection are introduced chapter 3 protective resemblances in lepidoptera poulton distinguishes special from general resemblances meaning mimicking a specific object of no interest to its enemies or just harmonising with general artistic effect of its surroundings giving examples from moth caterpillars found in england such as peppered moth and brimstone moth chapter 4 protective resemblances in lepidoptera continued dimorphism etc privet hawkmoth caterpillar is used as an example of general resemblance dimorphism where caterpillars of a species are sometimes green sometimes brown is discussed delicacy of larvae is given as a reason for their wonderful concealment one touch from a predator being practically fatal resemblance of kallima and some moths to dead leaves is examined chapter 5 protective resemblances in vertebrata etc camouflage of snakes female birds that undertake duty of incubation birds eggs mammals fish and marine molluscs is briefly covered chapter 6 aggressive resemblances adventitious protection camouflage of predators including lizards angler fish mantises including hymenopus and bird dropping spider is described adventitious protection making use of materials from environment is illustrated with examples such as decorator crabs and caddis fly larvae which build tubes of grains of sand small shells often alive vegetable fragments poulton 1890 p 77 chapter 7 variable protective resemblance in vertebrata etc ability of animals including fish lizards and frogs to change their colours quickly is discussed changing of pelage of arctic animals is attributed to indirect effect of change in temperature i e a physiological response not a simple physical effect chapter 8 variable protective resemblance in insects poulton describes in detail experiments demonstrating that moth pupae take on colour of background experienced earlier by larvae chapter 9 protective resemblances in lepidoptera continued poulton discusses metallic appearance of insect pupae which he says is reason for name chrysalis he rejects lamarckian view of origin of colour by direct influence of environment accumulated through many generations which he agrees is a very tempting conclusion because of clear evidence that medium of nervous system was necessary poulton 1890 p 155 chapter 10 warning colours conspicuous warning colours of many insects skunks snakes and salamanders are discussed it must have been obvious to any one interested in natural history that insects met with during a walk in summer may be arranged in two great groups difficult to find and startling colours and conspicuous attitudes poulton 1890 p 159 association of warning with nauseous or dangerous animals is identified idea that warning coloured animals must be scarce relative to palatable ones is mentioned along with reason why different animals use same warning colours chapter 11 warning colours continued poulton discusses relationship of colours used for sexual selection and for warning and continues discussion of warning with many examples including mullerian mimicry noting that this can both make a pair of distasteful species converge in appearance and make a group of such species all resemble each other thumb chapter 17 s summary table colours of animals classified according to their uses chapter 12 protective mimicry chapter looks at batesian mimicry where mimic is edible in both tropical butterflies and english moths beginning we now approach one of most interesting aspects of our subject chapter 13 protective and aggressive mimicry poulton gives examples of mimicry in other insect groups remarking very imperfect resemblance of bee hawk moths to bees which totally failed to impose on a lizard but noting that much more convincing mimicry of hornet moth was treated with extreme caution by an inexperienced lizard chapter 14 combination of many methods of defence chapter describes animals including puss moth caterpillar which combines a threatening display with camouflage and ability to eject an irritant fluid for protection poulton also discusses lobster moth caterpillar chapter 15 colours produced by courtship poulton discusses sexual selection in birds butterflies and moths and spiders which he treats as another process alongside but to natural selection with arguments against views of alfred russel wallace he notes that it was remarkable that biological research since darwin had focussed mainly on comparative anatomy and embryology whereas darwin himself was interested in questions which concern living animal as a whole and observes that there are comparatively few true naturalists as opposed to anatomists microscopists systematists or collectors poulton 1890 pp 286 287 chapter 16 other theories of sexual colouring in this chapter poulton looks at causes which mr wallace and other writers believe to have been efficient in producing sexual colouring such as principle of recognition marking poulton uses example of satin bowerbird as evidence for an aesthetic sense chapter 17 summary and classification poulton sums up his views with a fold out table of colours of animals classified according to their uses greek derived category names include now widely used aposematic and cryptic alongside such epithets as and with variants reception on first publication in 1890 wallace in nature thumb an aesthetic sense two males displaying to a female masked bowerbird sericulus aureus illustrated by john gould 1804 1881 co discoverer of natural selection alfred russel wallace reviewing poulton in nature was interested by poulton s observations on thin films producing iridescence in some cases dried insects lose some of their metallic colours but these reappear when specimen is dipped in water however wallace objected to poulton s suggestion that arctic birds and mammals are white to reduce heat loss by radiation for which he argued there was no evidence in favour while a thicker covering such as actually occurs in all arctic animals would reduce heat loss effectively and could be observed to do so wallace was enthusiastic about poulton s experimental work on how butterfly larvae vary their coloration according to background admiring a number of ingenious experiments in which poulton illuminated insects in light of one colour or another causing reliable colour changes which could not be direct like photography but had to be mediated by animal s nervous system in some cases even cocoons spun by larvae are modified by surrounding colours and still more curious changes are effected in larva itself when same species feeds on several plants having differently coloured leaves even presence of numerous dark twigs has been shown to cause a corresponding change of colour in larva of peppered moth betularia wallace s main criticism occupying half his lengthy review was of poulton s acceptance of sexual selection he begins by stating mr poulton fully accepts darwin s theory of female choice as source of greater part of brilliant colour delicate patterns and ornamental appendages that exist among animals and especially among birds and insects wallace then cites poulton on courtship behaviour of spiders female always watches antics of male intently but often refuses him in end even after dancing before her for a long time such observations strongly point towards existence of female preference based on aesthetic considerations at once objecting to last four words we demur as being altogether unproved why aesthetic considerations wallace then spends a whole page attacking poulton on possession of an aesthetic sense by those creatures in which sexual ornament occurs wallace objects that poulton asserts reality of sexual selection with no proof other than mentioning that insects can perceive colour and that a few birds collect bright objects as in case of bower birds wallace gives a detailed counter example to refute poulton s argument arguing that really beautiful combinations of colour and marking are found on sea shells of molluscs where sexual selection has certainly not come into play to make point wallace lists cones olives harps volutes and innumerable other molluscan shells while many of sea anemones and considerable numbers of caterpillars with warning colours are equally beautiful and that was not all wallace continued still more doubtful and more opposed to reasonable probability is statement that our standards of beauty are largely derived from contemplation of numerous examples around us which have been created by aesthetic preferences of insect world alluding to colours and structures of flowers as being due to need of attracting insects to fertilize them there was wallace insisted not a particle of evidence of aesthetic preferences in an insect s very limited mentality mention of term aesthetic was not scientific after so many preceding remarks against theory of sexual selection wallace concludes that book is well illustrated by numerous excellent woodcuts and a coloured plate congratulates poulton on having produced so readable and suggestive a volume and on having contributed so largely by his own researches into animal coloration new york times an anonymous reviewer in new york times wrote that mr poulton wishes first of all to put himself right with regard to his attitude to darwinism mentioning that in 1888 he had been cited in edinburgh review as attacking darwinism reviewer hastens to agree that poulton is in fact ready to combat wallace his master on points wherein that great fellow laborer with charles darwin dissents from latter s views as an example of this reviewer mentions poulton s argument that wallace must be wrong that coloring whereby sexes often differ one from other in a startling way is occasioned by a surplus vitality because sexual colors are only developed in species which court by day or twilight and then only on parts of body which female would and best see them new york times reviewer argued that title should have been less general for readers are sure to demand too much from so comprehensive a term given that poulton refers mainly to insects rather than wild beasts but in end he agreed that mr poulton has written a very suggestive treatise well fitted for general reader e d cope in american naturalist thumb most perfect concealment kallima inachus dead leaf butterfly neo lamarckian edward drinker cope reviewing book for american naturalist writes that mr poulton supports his own theory of direct physiological value of uses of colour to animals by a large amount of experimental evidence brought together from many sources cope is attracted by a detail of great interest in a caterpillar s camouflage by semblance of a small hole to indicate piercing by insect larvae ichneumon flies since they avoid caterpillars that are already parasitised and is impressed by poulton s observations of perhaps most perfect concealment attained by any butterfly in dead leaf butterfly kallima first described by alfred russel wallace while admiring of poulton s detailed observations cope is critical of his support for darwin arguing that poulton fails to explain how variability that natural selection needs to work on actually arises mechanisms of mutation and genetics were not to become adequately understood until twentieth century rediscovery of mendel s work axel carlson mendel s legacy origin of classical genetics cold spring harbor laboratory press 2004 cope also objects to poulton s critique of lamarckism where in a footnote he cites s b j as writing that other butterflies noticed this immunity and copied it poulton 1890 pp 224 225 to which cope replies as that even american neo lamarckians like cope do not follow their founder so far as to believe that volition of an animal could account for all details of mimetic resemblance science journal science reviewed book in november 1890 reviewer remarks that it is impossible in this brief notice to do full justice to wealth of interesting examples with which author presents us and notes that unlike hackneyed examples of mimicry and camouflage in other textbooks many of observations are original reviewer remarks also on decided antithesis between warning and protective colors animals being either as conspicuous as possible or as cryptic as possible while conspicuous ones are usually accompanied by a nauseating taste strongly smelling or irritant fluids etc reviewer notes more critically that additional examples of mimicry might have been given such as of hymenoptera bees and wasps mimicked by diptera flies and would have liked fuller treatment of bates s south american and reviewer finds closing chapters on colors used in courtship most interesting of book since zoologists disagreed widely on subject and notes that poulton sided with darwin and against wallace who denies that so called secondary sexual characters can owe their origin to sexual selection reviewer siding with poulton writes that it would be difficult we believe to explain many of facts cited by poulton notably peckham s observations on courtship of spiders from wallace s standpoint review ends with a brief discussion of poulton s table classifying animal coloration predicting correctly that greek derivatives such as and will not be generally adopted british medical journal british medical journal reviewed book in july 1890 review begins by noting that pre darwinian view of colour to day appears almost ridiculous adding that we now know that colour is of benefit to animal and is subject to natural selection reviewer writes that it is among lepidoptera butterflies and moths that protective resemblance or cryptic coloration is most beautifully illustrated and book teems with instances of these noting that poulton had made this part of subject his own review quotes examples including twig larvae of brimstone moth and terrifying attitude of puss moth caterpillar reviewer noting wallace s different opinion has no difficulty with poulton s view of sexual selection that it is due to an aesthetic sense in female animals and likes poulton s expression that natural selection is a qualifying examination which must be passed by all candidates for honours sexual selection is an honours examination in which many who have passed previous examination will be rejected review objects to thick type headings to subdivision of chapters which it finds too much like new journalism it concludes by urging readers to compare book with darwin s descent of man and with wallace s darwinism modern view poulton was a staunch supporter of darwin through a period when there was no adequate theory of heredity and both natural selection and sexual selection had become unpopular among scientists and was attacked for his support both in colours of animals and outside it and he is recognised as first scientist to identify frequency dependent selection as described in this book by 1919 book was being described in nature as a classic work poulton is paid homage by j a allen and b c clarke for his pioneering work on frequency dependent selection by predators acting on non mimetic polymorphic prey i e for selection anticipating many of points made by later workers we draw attention to his remarkable insight oxford dictionary of national biography comments that poulton s book concisely and simply explained many forms of coloration in terms of natural selection these forms he ingeniously summarized in a comparative table introducing terms which became standard nomenclature in her book ant and peacock altruism and sexual selection from darwin to today darwinian philosopher and rationalist helena cronin writes that in colours of animals poulton defended darwin s theory of sexual selection stressing role of female choice she suggests that while people have therefore taken poulton for a staunch darwinist and supporter of sexual selection he lost his initial enthusiasm for theory and came to relegate it to a very minor position in evolution she writes that poulton s position was highly influential stating that later darwinian experts on coloration followed his views citing frank evers beddard s 1892 animal coloration as evidence in his introduction to hugh bamford cott s 1940 book
