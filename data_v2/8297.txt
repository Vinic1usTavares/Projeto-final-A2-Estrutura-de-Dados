coanda 1910 designed by romanian inventor henri coanda was an unconventional sesquiplane aircraft powered by a ducted fan called turbo propulseur by coanda its experimental engine consisted of a conventional piston engine driving a multi bladed centrifugal blower which exhausted into a duct unusual aircraft attracted attention at second international aeronautical exhibition in paris in october 1910 being only exhibit without a propeller but aircraft was not displayed afterwards and it fell from public awareness coanda used a similar turbo propulseur to drive a snow sledge but he did not develop it further for aircraft decades later after practical demonstration of and turbojets coanda began to tell various conflicting stories about how his early experiments were precursors to jet even that his turbo propulseur was first motorjet engine with fuel combustion in airstream he also claimed to have made a single brief flight in december 1910 crashing just after takeoff aircraft being destroyed by fire two aviation historians countered coanda s version of events saying there was no proof that engine had combustion in airstream and no proof that aircraft ever flew in 1965 coanda brought drawings forward to prove his claim of combustion ducting but these were shown to be reworked differing substantially from originals many aviation historians were dismissive saying that coanda s turbo propulseur design involved a weak stream of plain air not a powerful jet of air expanding from fuel combustion in 2010 based on notion that coanda invented first jet centennial of jet aircraft was celebrated in romania a special coin and stamp were issued and construction began on a working replica of aircraft at european parliament an exhibition commemorated building and testing of coanda 1910 early developments coanda was interested in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905 conducting tests of rockets attached to model aircraft at romanian army arsenal in bucharest in secret at spandau in germany coanda successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller and two counter rotating propellers providing lift powered by a 50 horsepower 37 kw antoinette engine positioned along fuselage centreline smaller rear lift propeller was mounted vertically while larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17 degrees according to later claims coanda tested aircraft at cassel witnessed by chancellor of german empire bernhard von bulow it was around this time that coanda s interest in jet propulsion began claiming that aircraft and a jet propelled model were displayed in december 1907 at indoor sports arena in berlin coanda continued his studies at liege belgium where with his roommate and friend giovanni battista caproni he built coanda caproni box glider based on plans of gliders designed by otto lilienthal and octave chanute which he previously studied at charlottenburg and spandau antoniu et al 2010 in 1909 he was employed as technical director of liege spa aeroclub and at end of that year with help of car manufacturer joachim he built coanda joachim glider caproni was present when glider was flown at spa belgium 1910s thumb left upright only aeroplanes without propellers this promotional brochure was available at paris salon in 1910 with opening of ecole superieure d aeronautique et de constructions on 15 november 1909 coanda moved to paris as a continuation of his belgian experiments and especially looking for a way to test wing aerofoils at higher speeds he contacted ernest archdeacon co founder of l aero club de france who in turn directed coanda to gustav eiffel and paul painleve with their assistance he gained approval to test different wing configurations and air resistance on a platform built by eiffel at front of a locomotive on north of france railway in march he started flying lessons at reims in a hanriot monoplane helped by his schoolfriend coanda started to build his slender sesquiplane and unusual powerplant in a workshop in courtyard of his house where he tested thrust of powerplant on a dynamometer tests which are described in detail in april 1910 edition of la technique aeronautique antoniu 2010 p 53 if we will also aim our work towards turbo propeller with fixed distributor and diffuser these would provide a better efficiency compared to those used today i do not dare however to make definitive pronouncements about their shape as my experiments on this subject were not completed yet however i hope that soon i will be able to restart my experiments at cie du nord who so generously put a train operating between paris and saint quentin at my disposal he filed for several patents for mechanism and aircraft on 30 may 1910 with later additions to existing patents coanda exhibited aircraft at second international aeronautical exhibition commonly referred to as paris salon or paris flight salon held from 15 october to 2 november 1910 together with henri fabre s first floatplane coanda s aircraft and devices used for aerodynamic experiments were placed in solitary state in an upstairs gallery separated from more usual types of aircraft on main exhibition floor aircraft s construction was a novelty for time in contrast to monoplane described in july 1910 patent application exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated construction but in return solved lateral stability control issues cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires according to coanda s description wings were built with metal spars but existing photographs of construction show a completely wooden internal structure trailing edges of upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing and were controlled by pedals in two seat open cockpit fuselage painted reddish brown and highly polished was described by technical world magazine as having a framework of steel though construction photographs indicate that it had a wooden framework this was triangular in cross section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel and strengthened with a covering of heat shaped moulded plywood tubular radiators for engine cooling were located on either side of cockpit vertical struts from wings were secured to fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45deg angles to vertical and horizontal four triangular surfaces at rear of tail were controlled using a pair of large antoinette vii style steering wheels mounted outside of cockpit one on each side and were used for pitch and directional control it was an early instance of what are now known as forward of tail was a small horizontal stabiliser fuel tank was located in fuselage between engine and cockpit most remarkable feature of aircraft was its engine instead of a propeller a 50 hp 37 kw inline water cooled internal combustion engine built by pierre clerget at clement bayard workshop with funding from l aero club de france placed in forward section of fuselage drove a rotary compressor through a 1 4 gearbox 1 000 rpm on clerget turned compressor at 4 000 rpm which drew air in from front and expelled it rearward under compression and with added heat antoniu 2010 p 53 project that he arrived by departing from this above mentioned concept represents a propulsion assembly for aeroplanes with a jet effect comprising a radial compressor powered by an internal combustion engine by means of a rotation multiplier with ratio of 1 4 an assembly that formed a ancestor of current turbofan invention was given name propeller in patent application and in documentation it was given name turbo propeller turbo was a term that described a rotor turning at high speeds of rotation compressor with a diameter of 50 centimetres 20 in was located within a cowling at front of fuselage according to later coanda descriptions cast aluminium components were also made by clerget to create an engine with a weight of equivalent to a power to weight ratio of a considerable achievement at time coanda s 1910s era patents describe inline piston engine s exhaust gases as being routed through heating channels or heat exchangers in contact with central air flow then sucked into compressor inlet to reduce back pressure on engine while adding more heat and mass to airflow turbo propulseur was claimed to be capable of generating of thrust powerplant was referred to in reports at time by different terms a turbine without propellers turbo propulseur ducted fan article included two sectional drawings of engine or a suction turbine thumb an overhead view showing clerget engine s four upright cylinders aft of rotary compressor upper and lower wings are mounted on steel tubes extending from fuselage a man stands in fuselage near two antoinette vii style trim and steering wheels aviation reporters from aero and la technique aeronautique were doubtful that engine could provide sufficient thrust engine was noted in aero reprinted in aircraft as being of remarkably small proportions in relation to size of machine writer said turbo propulseur was claimed to give an enormous wind velocity but intake area seemed too small to produce stated thrust and that it also appears as if enormous power would be necessary to drive it more than supplied by clerget coanda 1910 was reportedly sold to charles weymann in october 1910 a daily newspaper from bucharest wrote in 1910 that aircraft was constructed in clerget s workshops and that it will fly in 6 7 weeks near paris piloted by weymann one of pilots celebrated at rennes aviation meeting ref name antoniu 2010 p 74 article coanda s new aeroplane published by a daily bucharest newspaper in 1910 provides us with some important information aeroplane that received much praise in parisian newspapers was built in workshops of clerget company in paris a company well known for construction of aeroplane engines mr coanda s new aeroplane will fly in 6 7 weeks near paris piloted by weymann one of pilots celebrated at rennes aviation meeting this aeroplane had advantages over others by fact that it featured more stability and more speed than existing planes ref another bucharest newspaper listed aircraft in november as sold twice over it may be that weymann expressed his willingness to buy aircraft once tests had been carried out at exhibition reaction among observers was mixed some doubted aircraft would fly and focused on more likely machines such as sloan voisin or louis paulhan s design others gave special notice to coanda 1910 calling it original and ingenious reporter from la technique aeronautique wrote in absence of definitive trials permitting precise yield of this machine it is without doubt premature to say it will supersede propeller tentative is interesting and we watch it closely official exhibition report ignored turbo propulseur engine and instead described coanda s novel wing design and unusual empennage on 15 november 1910 l aerophile wrote that if machine were ever to develop as inventor hoped it would be a beautiful dream thumb left frontal view photograph horizontal stabiliser obscures lower part of x shaped empennage a second turbo propulseur is displayed on a stand at right after exhibition aircraft was moved to a clement bayard workshop at issy les moulineaux for further testing this work is reflected by additions to powerplant related patents of 3 december a group of modern day romanian investigators led by dan antoniu having examined photographs from 1910 concluded that rotary compressor featured at exhibition was a hybrid between one described in initial 30 may 1910 patent and that shown in a later patent application they felt that exhibition machine had a simpler director system a different rotor with a smaller intake cone and that exhaust gas heat transfer system had not been implemented antoniu 2010 pp 55 59 complexity of director as it appears in 1st patented version had major implications for construction costs due to multitude of elements that made it very difficult to build coanda simplified it and it was built from 15 independent elements made from cast aluminium that when assembled formed a more efficient director new version of propeller that coanda 1910 machine was equipped with was partially included in next patent application which included new director system but with a different rotor according to gerard hartmann in his dossiers historiques et techniques aeronautique francaise propulsion system generated only of thrust and to generate enough thrust for aircraft to take off estimated by coanda at coanda would have had to spin turbine rotary compressor at a speed of 7 000 rpm with risk of it exploding this was not tried but hartmann concluded that experiment proved that solution worked perfectly henri mirguet writing for l aerophile magazine in january 1912 recalled previous exhibition s machine as chief attraction of 1910 salon he wrote that coanda answered his pressing and indiscreet questions about turbo propulseur powered aircraft at that earlier exhibit telling him that machine had attained a speed of 112 kilometres per hour 70 mph during several flight tests an improbable answer about which mirguet reserved judgment waiting for confirmation that never materialised related developments thumb upright left 1910 coanda engine design was also used on a sledge designed for grand duke cyril of russia additional turbo propulseur patent application 13 502 dated 3 december 1910 was implemented on a double seat motorised sled commissioned by cyril vladimirovich grand duke of russia antoniu 2010 p 80 at paris automobile exhibition of december 1910 january 1911 coanda presented a two seat sled powered by coanda turbo propeller 2nd construction variant photograph included here is proof that this invention was put into practice with help of despujols a boat maker and motor manufacturer gregoire coanda supervised building of a motor sled powered by a 30 hp 22 kw gregoire engine driving turbo propulseur sledge was blessed by russian orthodox priests at despujols plant near paris on 2 december 1910 starting next day it was exhibited for two weeks at 12th automobile salon of france alongside gregoire powered automobiles on gregoire stand a number of automobile and general interest magazines published photographs or sketches of sledge a version of coanda s turbo propulseur design was shown for second time in late 1910 at grand palais of paris one of periodicals reported an expected speed of but no account exists of sledge being tested coanda continued to work on coanda 1910 project at beginning of 1911 aiming to improve stability increase power of turbo propulseur and to implement aerofoil improvements he applied for new patents for aerodynamic investigations and improvements of coanda 1910 antoniu 2010 p 84 coanda described a different more sturdy system for attachment of wings which also enabled changes in angle of attack and centre of gravity he aimed to obtain more power from propulsion system and design drawings show arrangement of two air cooled rotary engines on sides of fuselage placement of engines indicates that coanda did not intend to inject fuel into jet stream and ignite it as cooling of engines would have been compromised antoniu 2010 p 85 one relevant aspect must be noted in relation to entire propulsion system that demonstrates that reaction force was obtained only with air under pressure like engines of modern planes in case in which fuel was introduced in exhaust channel hot gases would have enveloped two rotary engines depriving them of necessary cooling patent was annotated with an additional claim on 19 july 1911 which brought significant changes including addition of retractable landing gear with dampers inside aerodynamic fairings with skids removal of horizontal stabiliser a supporting surface was provided for each engine and their accessories were covered to improve aerodynamics antoniu 2010 p 88 major changes were made to landing gear he fitted them with and retraction mechanisms whole assembly being located inside aerodynamic pants with skids on external supports of rotary engines he provided two supporting surfaces he covered their accessories improving their aerodynamic and together with cruciform empennage they were intended to contribute to longitudinal stability of machine though coanda continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms antoniu believes that coanda never implemented a practical solution because of lack of funds antoniu 2010 p 161 soon after he dedicated himself to study of rotary internal combustion engines which presented advantage of lower weights increased efficiency and power when supercharged with air compressors however this type of internal combustion engine featured great disadvantage of insufficient cooling which coanda tried to reduce he designed a project for such an internal combustion engine he was granted patent 531 to which he made successive revisions through patents 16 508 and 16 587 we found no information about construction of this type of engine or any of versions featuring revisions it appears that these successive revisions were only result of coanda s calculations or revisions in may 1911 coanda filed english language patents on turbo propulseur design in united kingdom and united states as well as a second french language patent filed in switzerland british patent a applied for may 26 patent propeller filing date 29 may 1911 issue date july 1914 swiss patent a filed 26 may 1911 published 1 march 1913 and he described it for 1911 publication of l de l air very expensive project of 1910 costing coanda about one million francs left him with limited funds possibility of a new contract with french government led coanda to build coanda 1911 he wished to win an army organised competition at reims in october one that required two engines in each aircraft as a fail safe strategy antoniu 2010 p 92 in 1911 french army announced a competition to be held in october in reims to equip its aviation with flying machines stimulated by an eventual deal with french government coanda completed project of a flying machine derived from coanda no 1 of 1910 as well as his latest projects protected by patents which he modified as a result of user s demands at third aviation salon in paris 1911 coanda displayed a scale model of aircraft which used two gnome rotary engines mounted back to back connected by a bevel gear to a single two bladed propeller combination of two engines connected to one propeller was originally intended to drive a new turbine but coanda was unable to fund one during trials assembly did not provide enough traction and a four bladed propeller was ordered mounting support of engines initially intended for a jet propulsion version was not adequate for new configuration so forward chassis had to be modified antoniu 2010 p 93 during tests two bladed propeller did not provide necessary traction either even though there was a reserve of power in engines in these conditions he used a four blade propeller made by joining two two blade propellers as results were acceptable he ordered a four blade one piece propeller chassis with two coupled engines created for reactive propulsion version was not adequate for new machine so he built a frontal chassis that extended into a latticed truss that formed load bearing structure of fuselage henri mirguet writing for l aerophile magazine in january 1912 said that new 1911 aircraft retained fuselage frame and wing of coanda s 1910 design but did not keep turbo propulseur or wooden surface including forward longitudinal ribs aircraft was flown on 21 october 1911 but with modest results as latest modifications especially those related to powerplant did not compensate for increased total weight of aircraft at military contest it did not meet requirement for independent operation of each engine antoniu 2010 pp 19 103 104 at military competition in reims in october 1911 coanda displayed a large parasol aeroplane with a wingspan powered by two gnome rotary engines mounted laterally driving a single four bladed propeller through an engine coupling system also designed by coanda lower sesquiplane wing could be added or removed as needed machine was tested but was unable to fly high enough photograph of coanda s 1911 aircraft with propeller following 1911 exhibition at personal request of sir george white coanda moved to united kingdom to take a position as chief engineer or chief designer at british and colonial aeroplane company for a few years in next four decades coanda worked on a great variety of inventions during world war ii he revived his earlier turbo propulseur engine when he was contracted by german army in late 1942 to develop an air propulsion system for military ambulance snow sledges much like one made for russian grand duke german contract concluded after one year yielding no plans for production though coanda had experimented with a variety of nozzles and said that he had achieved a degree of success no turbojet engine style fuel injection or combustion in air stream was attempted coanda and his 1910 aircraft were absent from much of aviation literature of day none of annual issues of jane s all world s aircraft ever mentioned coanda 1910 or its turbo propulseur powerplant soviet engineer nikolai made no mention of coanda in his exhaustive nine volume encyclopaedia on jet and rocket engines written in late 1920s and early 30s later claims at beginning of jet age when potential of reactive engines was recognised several histories of jet engine were written a once classified guggenheim aeronautical laboratory and jet propulsion laboratory study completed in 1946 described coanda 1910 as probably not flown but featuring a mechanical jet propulsion device with a centrifugal blower one in which heat from clerget piston engine furnished auxiliary jet propulsion in editorial lead to their 1946 article on coanda s augmented flow flight terms it scarcely a jet in same year geoffrey g smith chronicled technological development in his book gas turbines and jet propulsion for aircraft but did not mention coanda in 1950 s l aviation d ader et des temps authors assert that coanda flew first jet aircraft at issy les moulineaux for 30 metres 100 ft ending with a crash in 1953 flights treatment of aircraft in 50 years since wright brothers flight included coanda 1910 ducted fan and said of coanda that he believes that he took off for a few feet then came down hurriedly and broke two teeth quoting j w adderley s 1952 letter to editor of flight after adderley s discussion with coanda in paris at end of world war ii adderley said he can definitely confirm that power unit was of ducted fan type similar in basic principles to caproni campini aircraft of 1930s referring to caproni campini n 1 in early 1950s coanda began to claim that he had flown his 1910 aircraft himself and that 1910 engine was first motorjet using fuel injection and combustion to create its thrust in 1955 and 1956 a number of aviation articles presented coanda version of 1910 events he said he took off and crashed in december 1910 in presence of aircraft makers louis charles breguet and gabriel voisin antoniu 2010 p 75 in 1956 henri coanda described trials with this coanda no 1 1910 machine on military grounds of issy les moulineaux near paris i wanted to make an attempt and then there was no one to teach us we had to learn by ourselves i told breguet and gabriel voisin who were with me look i will try to run it on ground for a while coanda himself spoke on subject notably before wings club at new york s biltmore hotel on 18 january 1956 where he said i intended to inject fuel into air stream which would be ignited by exhaust gases also channelled through same circular vent implying that he never finished powerplant martin caidin wrote coanda story for may 1956 issue of flying based on a personal interview for his article he flew in 1910 rene aubrey interviewed coanda and wrote a contradictory story in september 1956 royal air force flying review saying that coanda had flown his unusual aircraft on 16 december 1910 that fuel was certainly injected and that it was first jet flight in world in aubrey s relation of interview aircraft stalled after take off throwing coanda clear and gently collapsed to ground where it burned aubrey wrote that aircraft engine was designed by a friend to coanda s specification and that its burning exhaust was directed below and to each side of fuselage which was protected by asbestos in vulnerable places in jet age of 1956 coanda himself published an article entitled first jet flight he submitted same text that caidin had written for flying in may thumb upright left henri coanda in 1967 a collection of aviation stories was published in 1957 by major victor houart a friend of coanda s who wrote that he was an eyewitness day coanda flew and crashed one chapter of book describes how houart together with a group of french dragoons watched as coanda taxied twice around airfield lifted off to avoid ruins of an old fortification wall started flames from engine by applying too much power and was thrown from aircraft moment it hit wall with coanda not badly hurt quoted in f h winter 1980 houart s version put fuel tank in overhead wing which was metal in further statements coanda said that his 1910 aircraft had movable leading edge slots leading edge slot was patented by handley page in 1920 retractable landing gear and a fuel supply which was held in overhead wing to reduce fuselage profile and thus drag in 1965 coanda presented a set of drawings photographs and specifications of 1910 aircraft to national air and space museum nasm prepared by huyck corporation and received by director s paul johnston and early aviation curator louis casey rocket engineer g harry stine worked alongside coanda from 1961 to 1965 at huyck corporation and interviewed him in 1962 in 1967 magazine flying printed an account written by stine which described landing gear as retracting into lower wing with fuel tank hidden in upper wing stine wrote that coanda flew on 10 december 1910 and described heat from two jet exhausts as being too much for me after powerplant was mounted in aircraft in 1980s after coanda s death stine wrote a magazine article and a book mentioning 1910 aircraft including new details such as name of master mechanic pierre clerget as friend who helped build turbo propulseur stine s recounting of 10 december flight included group of eyewitness french dragoons asbestos heat shields and metal deflector plates aft of engine intended taxiing with unintentional flight a steep climb with a stall coanda thrown clear and aircraft crashing to ground burning stine gave his assessment that coanda s had elements of a true jet but that patent application had no indication of critical stage injection of fuel into compressed air he wrote that although there were several jet propelled aircraft in existence at an early time 1910 coanda jet and 1938 caproni campini n 1 first pure jet aircraft flight was made in germany in 1938 in 1965 historian emeritus paul e garber of nasm interviewed coanda who related that december 1910 flight was no accident that he had seated himself in cockpit intending to test five factors aircraft structure engine wing lift balance of controls and aerodynamics he said that heat from engine was fantastic but that he placed mica sheets and deflecting plates to direct jet blast away from wooden fuselage garber wrote that as coanda s aircraft began to move forward and rise from ground exhaust flame instead of fanning outward curved inward and ignited aircraft in this interview coanda said that he brought aircraft back to earth under control but landing was abrupt and he was thrown clear of airframe which was consumed completely by flame engine reduced to a few handfuls of white powder rebuttals thumb upright left details of rotary fan portion of 1910 engine in 1960 charles harvard gibbs smith aviation historian at science museum in london reacted to mid 1950s assertion that coanda built and flew first jet engine aircraft gibbs smith 1960 p 220 gibbs smith wrote that there has recently arisen some controversy about this machine designed by born and french domiciled henri coanda which was exhibited at paris salon in october 1910 until recently it has been accepted as an all wood sesquiplane with cantilever wings powered by a 50 hp clerget engine driving a turbo propulseur in form of a large but simple ducted air fan this fan was fitted right across machine s nose and cowling covered nose and part of engine resulting jet of plain air was to propel aeroplane he wrote that no claims that it flew or was even tested were made at time and that story of it flying suddenly appeared in 1950s aircraft was thus disinterred from its obscurity he wrote that airfield at issy les moulineaux a former military exercise ground where test supposedly took place was under constant observation of french army who owned it by french aviation reporters and photographers and by aviation experts from other countries he said that airfield was most famous most used most observed and most reported on airfield in paris and that all events let alone an exciting crash and destruction by fire would have been carried in local papers and described in military reports but no contemporary accounts exist of coanda 1910 being tested flown or destroyed gibbs smith countered coanda assertions point by point saying that aircraft did not have a retractable undercarriage did not have leading or trailing edge wing slots did not have a fuel tank overhead in wing and did not have fuel injected into any turbine gibbs smith pointed out that pilot would have been killed by heat if any combustion had been initiated in engine s air stream in 1970 gibbs smith wrote another account of coanda 1910 using much same phrasing as in 1960 in 2010 antoniu wrote that he thought gibbs smith speculated on basis of evidence of absence that aircraft was never tested or flown but that gibbs smith did not find any concrete evidence to support his position similarly antoniu was unable to find concrete proof of a test flight antoniu also wrote that gibbs smith did not check french patents claimed by coanda in 1910 and 1911 describing retractable gear leading edge wing slot and upper wing fuel tank and that he did not see photographs from private collections demonstrating aspects about which he wrote antoniu 2010 p 97 coanda no 2 machine of 1911 preparing for flight before reims military competition of 21 october 1911 pilot sits in cockpit michel collection thumb coanda s us patent diagram for improvement in propellers filed 1911 and granted 1914 in 1980 nasm historian frank h winter examined 1965 drawings and specifications coanda prepared while at huyck corporation and wrote an article about coanda s claim there is a wholly new description of inner workings of machine that does not occur in any of accounts given in 1910s and which defies all of patent specifications he said coanda told various conflicting stories about his claimed 1910 flight and that coanda produced a set of altered drawings as proof of his claims in his article winter wondered why coanda did not add novel feature of fuel injection and air stream combustion to his may 1911 patent applications if that feature had been present during his supposed flying experience five months earlier rather winter noted that august 1910 patent filings in french were essentially same as may 1911 ones in english and that all descriptions were applicable to air or water flowing through device meaning that patents could not possibly include fuel combustion in jet stream he also noted that no mention was made in early patents of asbestos or mica heat shields or of any fuel injection or combustion while looking through aviation periodicals and paris newspapers reporting for month of december 1910 winter found that there was a spell of bad weather at issy during which no flying took place this situation occurred mid month period covering conflicting dates 10 and 16 december that coanda said his aircraft was tested flown and crashed in their regular foreign aviation news column flight magazine reported that blank period of inclement weather at issy ended on 19th when guillaume tested a monoplane made by armand deperdussin other aircraft tests and piloting activities were listed with no mention of coanda or his machine winter found that camille or cosimo canovetti an italian civil and aviation engineer had been working on a turbo propulseur style aviation engine before coanda and had attempted to show an aircraft with such an engine at aviation exposition in milan in 1909 canovetti took out patents on his machine in 1909 and more in 1910 canovetti wrote in 1911 that 1910 appearance of coanda engine called general attention to designs like his after coanda s death modern reference books about aviation history represent coanda 1910 in various ways if they mention machine or inventor at all some acknowledge coanda as discoverer of coanda effect but give hans von ohain honour of designing first jet engine to power an aircraft in manned flight and frank whittle honour of completing and patenting first jet engine capable of such flight in their 1994 book american aviation authors joe christy and leroy cook state that coanda s 1910 aircraft was first jet christy leroy 1994 pp 337 338 aviation author bill gunston changed his mind two years after publishing a 1993 book in which he gave coanda credit for first jet engine gunston s 1995 description began romanian henri coanda built a biplane with a clerget inline piston engine which instead of turning a propeller drove a centrifugal compressor blowing air to rear thrust was said to be 220 kilograms 490 lb a figure author disbelieves on 10 december 1910 aircraft thus powered inadvertently became airborne crashed and burned often called a turbine aeroplane this was of no more significance than campini aircraft mentioned later and coanda wisely decided to switch to a propeller in his publication of 1998 world encyclopedia of aero engines all major aircraft power plants from wright brothers to present day gunston did not include coanda nor did he include coanda in 2005 s jane s aero engines or 2006 s world encyclopedia of aero engines walter j boyne director of national air and space museum and a prolific aviation author mentions coanda in passing a few times in his works boyne discusses coanda briefly in one of his books leading edge professor henri coanda whose scientific work was impeccable designed and built a jet aircraft in 1910 it like martin s kitten martin kf 1 biplane was superbly built and technically advanced and could not fly in a later magazine article sidebar boyne described more details romanian inventor henri coanda attempted to fly a primitive jet aircraft in 1910 using a four cylinder internal combustion engine to drive a compressor at 4 000 revolutions per minute it was equipped with what today might be called an afterburner producing an estimated 500 pounds 2 3 kn or 230 kgf of thrust countless loyal coanda fans insist that airplane flew others say it merely crashed in 1980 and 1993 jane s encyclopedia of aviation included an entry on 1910 aircraft calling it coanda turbine and describing it as world s first jet propelled aircraft to fly in 2003 winter co authored a book with fellow nasm curator f robert van der linden 100 years of flight a chronicle of aerospace history 1903 2003 in book coanda 1910 is described as an unsuccessful ducted fan aircraft lacking documentation to substantiate any flight test citing carl a brown s 1985 a history of aviation tim brady dean of aviation at embry riddle aeronautical university wrote in 2000 development of jet is broadly story of three men henri coanda sir frank whittle and pabst von ohain his description of coanda s disputed test flight agreed that fuel injection and combustion had been initiated in rotary compressor s vent with novel detail that aircraft flew for about a thousand feet 300 m before crashing into a wall brady 2000 p 166 brady cites carl a brown s a history of aviation page 140 as his source in 1990 at

engineering owes beside one of first model planes provided with a rocket engine 1905 construction and engine experiment of first jet aircraft coanda 1910 in 2007 in his popular book extreme aircraft ron miller wrote that powerplant in coanda 1910 was one of earliest attempts at a jet engine but was unsuccessful it was incapable of actual flight unlike engines designed by whittle and ohain question of coanda 1910 being first jet aircraft does not appear to be resolved supporting stine s view whether henri coanda built first true jet will probably be argued interminably in 2000s dan antoniu and other romanian aviation experts investigated existing photographs of coanda 1910 leading them to believe that aircraft presented at exhibition was not finished that it was exhibited with many improvisations antoniu published henri coanda and his technical work during 1906 1918 a 2010 book in which he said that unfinished state of aircraft led to coanda filing several extra patents and starting a new series of studies with aim of making machine airworthy for instance antoniu wrote that exhaust pipes of clerget engine appeared free there were no devices to redirect exhaust gases to turbine as described in patent and there were no heat shields for crew protection as well central attachment of tubular struts holding wings to fuselage with mere collars secured with screws was judged by antoniu as appearing potentially unsafe during take off or landing because of considerable loads on struts x shaped empennage was covered at high angles by horizontal stabiliser making it unusable and any high speed taxi would put machine in danger of a nose over antoniu 2010 pp 66 72 79 this method of attachment without any cross braces mounted in flight direction of machine was unsafe during take off or landing as it produced considerable loads in struts by studying existing photos we can notice that openings for discharge of hot gases from cylinders of internal combustion engine were free and were not fitted with any eventual devices directing gases along fuselage in order to protect crew photographs show us an unfinished machine with many visible improvisations memorials and models thumb upright right full scale replica of coanda 1910 at national military museum in bucharest a full size replica of coanda 1910 built in 2001 is displayed in bucharest at national military museum and a scale model is displayed in french air and space museum at paris le bourget airport at site of historic issy les moulineaux airfield a large plaque lists three pioneers of flight most closely associated with airfield louis bleriot alberto santos dumont and henri farman later a plaque honouring coanda and romanian aviation engineer traian was placed on a nearby building under auspices of mayor of issy les moulineaux l aeroclub de france and romanian association for aviation history construction on a full sized functional replica of plane began in march 2010 at craiova romania by a team of engineers and former test pilots from i r av craiova replica is based on plans that coanda reworked in 1965 because 1910 plans were lost it uses metal for fuselage rather than wood and its intended engine is a true jet motorlet m 701 made for 1960s era aero l 29 delfin military trainer in october 2010 national bank of romania issued a commemorative silver coin for centennial of building of first jet aircraft 10 lei piece is intended for coin collectors with official purchase price set at 220 lei it represents aircraft on obverse side and a portrait of
