best selling retail rhythm blues records chart in 1951 howlin wolf song thumb left 160px howlin wolf performing in 1972 delta blues musician charlie patton influenced howlin wolf s early musical development wolf later recorded adaptations of several patton songs including spoonful smokestack lightning and saddle my pony relatives and early friends recall howlin wolf playing a song similar to red rooster in 1930s evelyn sumlin who was wife of long time wolf guitarist hubert sumlin felt that several of songs that were later arranged by and credited to willie dixon had already been developed by howlin wolf howlin wolf recorded red rooster in chicago in june 1961 song is performed as a slow blues in key of a although dixon biographer inaba notes it as a twelve bar blues changes in first section vary due to extra beats lyrically it follows classic aab blues pattern where two repeated lines are followed by a second opening verse echoes charlie patton s second verse as with many blues songs dixon s lyrics are ambiguous and may be seen on several levels interpretations of his verses range from most overtly phallic song since blind lemon jefferson s 1927 black snake moan to an innocuous farm ditty although dixon described it in latter terms he added i wrote it as a barnyard song really and some people even take it that way lyrics are delivered in howlin wolf s distinctive vocal style music writer bill janovitz describes it as displaying a master singer s attention to phrasing and note choice milking out maximum emotion and nuance from melody a key element of song is distinctive slide guitar played by howlin wolf with backing by long time accompanist hubert sumlin on electric guitar it is one of only two of many songs recorded by howlin wolf in early 1960s which include his guitar playing described as slinky by janovitz and sly by music historian ted gioia it weaves in and out of vocal lines and is stylistic foundation of song other musicians include johnny jones on piano willie dixon on double bass sam lay on drums and possibly jimmy rogers on guitar red rooster backed with shake for me which was also recorded during same session was issued by chess records in october 1961 neither song nor his other songs from period now considered to be among his best known entered record charts both were included on his acclaimed 1962 album howlin wolf often called rockin chair album red rooster also appears on many howlin wolf compilations including howlin wolf chess box and howlin wolf his best chess 50th anniversary collection later chess arranged for howlin wolf to record red rooster and some other songs with eric clapton steve winwood bill wyman and charlie watts for 1971 album london howlin wolf sessions at beginning of recording howlin wolf can be heard attempting to explain timing of song because as wyman later explained we were kind of playing it backwards finally clapton joined in by others encourages him to play it on guitar so i can follow you if i can see what you re doing despite their efforts to get it right according to wyman chess people ended up using old backwards take anyway sam cooke rendition on february 23 1963 american soul singer sam cooke recorded his interpretation of willie dixon s song calling it little red rooster song was first proposed for cooke s brother l c who was recording some new material at time however l c felt song was not suitable for him i said i m not a blues singer so sam said well i m gonna do it then l c recalled sam cooke chose to forgo howlin wolf s gutbucket approach and came up with an arrangement that music writer charles keil describes as somewhat more relaxed and respectable dixon s lyrics are delivered in cooke s articulate vocal style but with an additional verse cooke s musical arrangement follows a typical twelve bar blues structure and is performed at a faster tempo than howlin wolf s it has been notated as a moderate blues 92 beats per minute in 12 8 time in key of a recording took place in los angeles with a small group of session musicians a young billy preston uses playful organ vocalizing or organ lines to imitate sounds of a rooster crowing and following lyrics dogs barking and hounds howling also backing cooke are ray johnson on piano and hal blaine on drums barney kessel has also been mentioned as guitarist song was a hit reaching number seven on billboard s hot r b singles chart it was also a crossover hit and appeared at number eleven on billboard hot 100 pop chart little red rooster is included on cooke s 1963 album night beat

background chess records chicago artists including howlin wolf and muddy waters influenced rolling stones with band taking their name from a muddy waters tune and playing from a repertoire of blues songs at beginning of their career in 1962 before they had recorded as a group mick jagger brian jones and keith richards attended first american folk blues festival whose performers included howlin wolf willie dixon another festival player later recalled when rolling stones came to chess studios they had already met me and doing my songs especially little red rooster when dixon and howlin wolf were in london they met several local rock musicians early stones manager giorgio gomelsky described such a meeting dixon added i left lots of tapes when i was over there in london i told them anybody who wanted to could go and make a blues song that s how rolling stones and yardbirds got their songs stones biographer sean egan noted in many ways this is brian jones record he was always biggest blues purist in band although they had already recorded several chess songs according to bill wyman little red rooster was a slow intense blues song that producer andrew loog oldham argued was totally uncommercial and wrong for our new found fame tempo made track virtually mick jagger commented composition and recording although wyman noted some early criticism of their rendition janovitz described it as a fairly faithful version of original it is performed as a moderately slow 74 bpm blues in key of g although allmusic reviewer matthew greenwald describes their arrangement as having a straight i iv v twelve bar blues progression they sometimes vary changes but not in same manner as howlin wolf jagger uses lyrics from original omitting cooke s extra verse but makes one important change instead of i got a little red rooster he sings i am little red rooster although later verse reverts to if you see my little red rooster instrumentally bill wyman generally follows dixon s bass lines charlie watts later admitted that his drum part was inspired by sam cooke s version which was played by hal blaine keith richards adds a rhythm guitar part according to egan juxtaposition of acoustic guitar and electric slide all make for something richer and warmer than any blues they had ever attempted before however it is jones contributions that are usually singled out egan writes it is his jones playing that makes record via both cawing bottleneck that is its most prominent feature and his closing harmonica biographer stephen davis adds it was his jones masterpiece his inspired guitar howling like a hound barking like a dog crowing like a rooster similar to billy preston s playful organ vocalizing wyman wrote i believe rooster provided brian jones with one of his finest hours two different dates and recording locations are known wyman recalled that song was recorded september 2 1964 at regent sound in london while session information for 1989 rolling stones box set singles collection london years lists november 1964 chess studios chicago biographer massimo bonanno commented boys entered regent sound studios on september 2nd 1964 to resume work on little red rooster and later on november 8 1964 at chess some unverified sources indicate boys also put final touches to their next british single little red rooster according to davis jones was left to later record overdubs after track was recorded without him charts and releases little red rooster was released on friday november 13 1964 and reached number one on uk singles chart on december 5 1964 where it stayed for one week it remains to this day only time a blues song has ever topped british pop charts according to allmusic writer matthew greenwald little red rooster was brian jones favorite stones single wyman noted that it realized a cherished ambition of jones to put blues music at top of charts and meant his guilt of having sold out completely to pop fame was diminished it was band s last cover song to be released as a single during 1960s in 1964 and 1965 rolling stones performed little red rooster several times on television including british programs ready steady go november 20 1964 and thank your lucky stars december 5 1964 and american ed sullivan show may 2 1965 shindig may 20 1965 and may 1965 on shindig jagger and jones introduced howlin wolf as first one to record little red rooster and as one of their first influences although often reported that stones would only agreed to appear if howlin wolf or muddy waters also performed keith richards later explained that show s producer jack good was in on idea to present an original blues artist on prime time network television during group s concerts in 1965 charlie watts who did not normally address audiences was often brought from behind drum kit to front of stage to introduce little red rooster from jagger s microphone wyman recalled particularly enthusiastic responses to song in sydney at agricultural hall in january 1965 paris olympia in april 1965 and long beach california long beach auditorium on may 16 1965 little red rooster is included on their third american album rolling stones now released in

stones and grrr live versions appear on love you live and flashpoint with eric clapton who contributed to howlin wolf s 1971 remake on slide guitar no us single release bill wyman later wrote in his book stone alone that on december 18 1964 news came from america that little red rooster was banned from record release because of its sexual connotations this has been repeated and embellished to include that it had been banned by or from american radio stations however sam cooke s version with nearly same lyrics had been a top 40 crossover pop hit one year earlier additionally rolling stones little red rooster was included on los angeles radio station krla s at time number one top 40 radio station in second largest market in us playlist from december 9 1964 to february 5 1965 radio personality bob eubanks wrote in his weekly record review column for january 1 1965 little red rooster by stones is still krla s exclusive don t fret though it may still be released in this country mona i need you baby from rolling stones first uk album was also being aired and considered for their next single but with time is on my side heart of stone and last time on us charts during this same period neither little red rooster or mona were released as singles however they were included on rolling stones now by contrast only little red rooster and last time were released as singles in uk
