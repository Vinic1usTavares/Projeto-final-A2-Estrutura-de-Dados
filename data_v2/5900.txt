trinsey v pennsylvania 941 f 2d 224 3d cir 1991 was a case decided by united states court of appeals for third circuit that confirmed validity of special elections held without a primary under fourteenth and seventeenth amendments to united states constitution case came about due to death of h john heinz iii one of us senators from pennsylvania in a plane crash on april 4 1991 under seventeenth amendment state legislatures may give governor power to appoint officials to fill temporarily vacant senate seats until a special election can be held and pennsylvanian law contained a statute executing this and requiring no primaries for special election instead both democrats and republicans would each internally select their candidates john s trinsey jr a voter and potential candidate asked united states district court for eastern district of pennsylvania to declare statute unconstitutional as a violation on fourteenth and seventeenth amendments because lack of a primary removed his right to properly vote for candidates and delegated that power to political parties after deciding that statute s subject matter necessitated strict scrutiny approach district court decided on june 10 1991 that it was an unconstitutional violation of right to vote for and select senate candidates this decision was appealed to court of appeals for third circuit who decided against use of strict scrutiny approach and in its absence ruled that statute was not a violation of fourteenth and seventeenth amendments academics have been critical of both decision reached and approach used with one suggesting that substantial state interests test used in valenti v rockefeller 1968 would be more appropriate gold 1992 p 216 background file john heinz jpg thumb 325px senator h john heinz iii whose death and subsequent replacement led to trinsey v pennsylvania on april 4 1991 h john heinz iii one of us senators from pennsylvania was killed when his chartered plane collided with a helicopter inspecting its landing gear under seventeenth amendment to united states constitution legislature of each state has power to permit governor to fill vacant seat until a special election can be held vile 2010 p 197 in pennsylvania this power had been delegated and governor robert p casey signed a writ on may 13 1991 declaring november 5 date for a special election and temporarily appointing harris wofford to fill heinz s now vacant seat gold 1992 p 202 under pennsylvanian law there was no need for a primary in such a situation instead both democrats and republicans would each internally select their candidate who would run in special election john s trinsey jr a member of pennsylvanian electorate and potential candidate challenged constitutionality of this law claiming that it violated his rights under fourteenth and seventeenth amendments gold 1992 p 203 trinsey argued that by failing to allow for primaries state legislation prevented him from getting to select a candidate of his choice and that this violated fourteenth amendment terms of statute and absence of a requirement for primaries also allegedly infringed rights of electorate under seventeenth amendment which required selection of senators by popular vote trinsey s complaint was that legislation had effectively delegated power to choose candidates to political parties rather than electorate novakovic 1992 p 940 accordingly trinsey filed a motion for a declaratory judgment to state that statute was unconstitutional and also requested that wofford be removed from his seat counsel for commonwealth of pennsylvania joined by office of governor argued that constitution did not require holding of primary elections to fill vacancies and that statute protected valid and compelling state interests in protecting validity of electoral process and limiting term of a governor appointed senator judgment case was first heard in united states district court for eastern district of pennsylvania where following oral arguments judge dismissed both trinsey s motion to remove wofford and commonwealth s motion to dismiss on june 10 1991 however district court declared statute unconstitutional stating that it violated both fourteenth and seventeenth amendments due to failure to ensure popular participation through use of primary elections little 1991 p 630 this decision was reached following an analysis of legislative history of seventeenth amendment and electoral processes based on this analysis court concluded that pennsylvanian use of a nomination process before a special election implied a right to vote which was violated by lack of a primary and necessitated a strict scrutinising of legislation after considering evidence court concluded that interests commonwealth put forth in support of statute could not outweigh infringement of right to vote leading to conclusion that statute governing special elections was unconstitutional gold 1992 p 204 with this public press and political parties quickly turned their attention to case with republican state committee of pennsylvania supported by their democratic counterparts and several prominent politicians intervening they moved to expedite an appeal to court of appeals for third circuit in a unanimous opinion court of appeals consisting of sloviter greenberg and seitz confirmed that there was no restriction of any fundamental right and therefore that strict scrutiny process did not need to be applied in absence of this process they held that seventeenth amendment did not require primary elections to fill vacancies and more broadly gave state legislatures wide discretion as to how to hold elections as such statute did not violate constitution novakovic 1992 p 945 in december 1991 supreme court denied a writ of certiorari presumably because special election had already taken place in november and issue was thus moot novakovic 1992 p 955 significance laura e little writing in temple law review notes dearth of guidance for either district court or court of appeals in trinsey with no explicit direction and no direct precedent from either constitutional provisions or prior case law to rely on little 1991 p 631 in absence of guidance court of appeals took a narrow view of issues something she criticises under pennsylvanian law primaries are mandatory in all other elections little 1991 p 635 and in her opinion lack of a primary in this case should have been judged to be a violation of trinsey s fundamental rights combined with purpose of seventeenth amendment to ensure direct election this should have led to application of strict scrutiny test and decision that statute governing special elections was unconstitutional little 1991 p 636 kevin m gold instead suggests that test used in valenti v rockefeller an analogous decision over validity of new york state electoral law in valenti judiciary applied substantial state interests test which involves simply looking at whether statute in question furthers interests of states who under seventeenth amendment are given some discretion as to electoral process they use gold 1992 p 216 references bibliography
