mars bars and other junk food noting gascoigne s extra weight charlton on clubs tab arranged for gascoigne to eat lunch every day at a restaurant away from ground believing he would eat high quality protein meals instead of his usual high calorie junk food this did not work out and gascoigne still had a slight weight problem charlton was not overly concerned as he believed this weight would give gascoigne extra strength on football pitch and did not seem to slow him down charlton also highlights that teenager gascoigne showed early signs of being a prankster explaining on one occasion how gascoigne tied glenn roeder s boot laces together and how roeder then stormed into charlton s office and told charlton that if he did not stop one fat sixteen year old apprentice messing about that he was going to chin lad charlton even warned him to stop messing with senior pros even suggesting to gascoigne he may release him charlton noted this did not stop him and gascoigne was never caught

winning fa youth cup final at watford his team mate and friend joe allon claims it was probably 1984 85 season that really made gascoigne gazza and also states 1984 85 season was season that put him onto road to italia 90 and on to becoming in his opinion best player in world manager jack charlton handed gascoigne his first team debut as a substitute for george reilly in a 1 0 win over queens park rangers on 13 april 1985 at st james park charlton later noted that gascoigne s first team appearances under him were too brief to suggest he was more than a useful talent gascoigne captained

coaching staff who had just shouted at him nelson then remembers after smile and wink gascoigne struck a 50 yard pass onto feet of joe allon nelson believes with this pass joe allon then went on to score it was in second leg that charlton also realized newcastle had a player gascoigne first goal in match was a header his second goal was goal that impressed charlton and his assistant maurice setters charlton described goal as a goal you d only see once in a lifetime after he scored goal charlton said to setters if you live to be a hundred maurice you ll never see a better goal than that after match jack charlton told gascoigne he would be in first team next day against norwich city gascoigne did travel to norwich though charlton chose not to pick him gascoigne believed charlton could see it in his eyes that he wasn t quite psychologically ready for first team football charlton also offered gascoigne professional terms to which gascoigne accepted at age of 18 gascoigne signed a two year ps120 a week contract at newcastle with club also having a further two year option clause though gascoigne has written his first contract was around ps120 a week charlton claims gascoigne s first contract was roughly ps200 per week charlton highlights that this money for a teenage footballer in mid 1980s was very good money one worry charlton had about gascoigne was gascoigne s generosity

a bank account for him to collect in a lump sum at end of his first contract lee clark who was once hailed to be next gazza and who would go on to become a member of kevin keegan teams of 1990s

then sneaked along back of line up re joined line up and greeted mirandinha for a second time hoping to try and convince brazilian he had met gascoigne twins lee clark explained mirandinha was a super guy clark also deduced that if anyone had decided to have gazza as his mentor they wanted to have their head examined gascoigne in his eagerness to welcome to mirandinha also took it upon himself to teach mirandinha english his first exercise was to teach mirandinha days of week and then have his team mates test mirandinha on his progress gascoigne taught mirandinha all days of week but

planning on leaving but that he would want to stay if club showed ambition john hall contacted gascoigne asking him if he would wait a bit gascoigne sensing a long term board room battle behind scenes

club with many share holders from all corners of british isles many shareholders were unaware they had been gifted family shares in club going back generations from this point in 1988 john hall and malcolm dix would spend 3 years tracing share holders and buying up shares to wrestle control from mckeag it would be 3 years before newcastle could be run like a modern football club gascoigne also explains in his autobiography that because of years it took for john hall to take control of boardroom he was eventually proven right to leave old board which included mckeag and seymour would not budge and were only prepared to offer gascoigne extension that had been agreed when he was 18 this was unacceptable to gascoigne tottenham had roughly offered 6 times ps250 he was getting at newcastle
