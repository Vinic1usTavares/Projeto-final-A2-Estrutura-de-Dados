murder of leigh leigh born leigh rennea mears occurred on 3 november 1989 while she was attending a 16 year old boy s birthday party at stockton beach new south wales on east coast of australia 14 year old girl from fern bay was assaulted by a group of boys after she returned distressed from a sexual encounter on beach that a reviewing judge later called non consensual after being kicked and spat on by group leigh left party her naked body was found in sand dunes nearby following morning with severe genital damage and a crushed skull matthew grant webster an 18 year old who acted as a bouncer at event pleaded guilty to her murder and was sentenced to 20 years in prison with a 14 year non parole period he was released on parole in june 2004 after serving 14 1 2 years guy charles wilson other bouncer and only other person aged over 18 at party pleaded guilty to assault a third male aged 15 pleaded guilty to having sex with a minor investigation of leigh s murder proved controversial however as several people who admitted to various crimes including assaulting leigh were never charged nor was anyone ever charged with her sexual assault webster s confession did not match forensic evidence murder investigation was reviewed by new south wales crime commission in 1996 and by police integrity commission in 1998 with latter recommending dismissal of detective in charge of investigation leigh s murder received considerable attention in media initially focusing on her sexual assault and murder media attention later concentrated more on lack of parental supervision and drugs and alcohol at party and on leigh s sexuality media coverage of murder has been cited as an example of blaming victim leigh s murder inspired a theatrical play entitled a property of clan which was later revised and renamed blackrock as well as a feature film of same name background leigh leigh born leigh rennea mears on 24 july 1975 was daughter of robyn lynne maunsell and robert william mears leigh s grandmother said that leigh lived with her between ages of about four and seven though she did not disclose reasons for this living arrangement leigh s

some were having sex fourteen year old leigh had a written invitation to attend party and permission from her mother to stay there until 11 pm leigh s mother had been assured that responsible adults would be present at party matthew webster and guy wilson who acted as bouncers were only people aged over 18 at party leigh was said to be very excited as it was first teenage party she had attended according to police witness reports leigh was one of several under age girls who were invited to party for purpose of getting them intoxicated and having sex with them according to a police report webster approached another person at party and said hey dude we re going to get leigh pissed and all go through her leigh was also one of several under age people for whom an adult purchased alcohol before party she and her friend were given a bottle of jim beam whiskey which they then mixed with coca cola she was reported to have gotten heavily intoxicated very quickly a 15 year old boy who for legal reasons could not be named and was referred to in official documentation as nc1 is quoted to have said i m going to go and fuck leigh shortly afterwards leigh went to beach with nc1 witnesses stated leigh was so intoxicated that he had to almost carry her thumb stockton beach as seen from surf club facing north direction that leigh headed after leaving party alt a stretch of beach and sand dunes sea is to right of picture when leigh returned from beach she was bleeding between her legs distressed crying and seeking assistance some people at party reported trying to console leigh and find out what had happened to her leigh asserted she had been raped replying nc1 fucked me and i hate him after witnessing leigh s complaints webster is quoted as saying to a group of boys she s a bit of a slut and why don t all of us have a go nineteen year old guy wilson then approached leigh placed his arm around her and asked her for sex wilson pushed leigh to ground when she refused and was joined by webster and around ten other boys who surrounded leigh they yelled abuse kicked her poured beer on her and spat both beer and saliva on her several people witnessed assault yet nobody came to help her or attempted to contact police her parents or other adults assaults continued for approximately five minutes leigh stood up when they stopped and staggered away before picking up an empty beer bottle and throwing it at group of boys missing them guy wilson threw a beer bottle back at her as she left which either hit her in leg or missed according to different witness accounts group of boys followed her inside crowded clubhouse where she sought refuge and similar assaults continued leigh was seen leaving club and walking towards beach at about 10 30pm leigh s stepfather arrived at party to pick her up at 10 50pm he and several of party goers searched for leigh but she could not be found after repeated search attempts leigh s mother and stepfather decided to wait for her to return home assuming she had gone to a friend s house for night leigh s stepfather recommenced search for leigh following morning aided by several youths from party her body was found in sand dunes about north of surf club leigh s invitation to attend party was still in her pocket leigh was found naked except for her socks and shoes with her knickers and shorts around her right ankle she was on her back with her legs apart her bra which had its securing hook bent was found nearby as was her shirt and jumper which were intertwined inside out and stained with liquor saltbushes nearby had been flattened according to police forensics report a blood stained rock weighing was found next to her and blood stains were found up to from her body postmortem postmortem report stated leigh s cause of death to be a fractured skull and injury to brain leigh had been struck with great force several times including at least three times in head postmortem also found that leigh had and multiple injuries to jaw ribs liver and right kidney leigh had neck fingertip pressure injuries indicating she had been choked before she died though this was not cause of death leigh s blood alcohol reading was 0 128 a level which according to university of notre dame would have caused significant impairment of motor coordination and loss of good judgment there was no doubt that leigh was violently sexually assaulted before she was murdered and evidence indicated that prior to night of her murder she had not had sexual intercourse leigh had deep bruising to left wall of her vagina extensive bruising to her hymen and two tears one long to her vulva an analysis of postmortem by dr johan duflou deputy director of new south wales institute of forensic medicine stated that an inflexible object possibly a beer bottle was likely to have caused most of her genital injuries no semen was found in her body investigation twenty detectives led by detective sergeant lance chaffey were assigned to case though squad was reduced to fewer than ten members several weeks later crime reporter mark riley wrote that police were going through exhaustive process of cross checking stories of several dozen teenagers by 5 november police had interviewed around 40 teenagers stating they expected to interview around 20 more three suspects who emerged early in investigation were matthew webster guy wilson and nc1 in interviews on 5 november nc1 admitted to having sex with leigh but said it was consensual wilson initially denied any wrongdoing though in a later interview he admitted to pushing leigh pouring beer over her spitting on her and throwing an empty beer bottle at her webster admitted to pouring beer on leigh but denied sexually assaulting or killing her he originally told police he went to a pub after party but in an interview eight days later changed his story to state that he had gone for a walk webster also stated that two 14 year old girls had approached him and nc1 at party asking for some hash and that two of them had obtained a small bag of resin and exchanged it with girls for 20 blood samples were taken from two suspects newcastle herald reported this as probably first use of dna tests in a hunter valley murder investigation clothing samples were also taken from several suspects in her book who killed leigh leigh kerry carrington a criminologist and prominent researcher of murder described investigation as being fuelled by mutual suspicion and by rumour and counter rumour people who attended party complained of living in fear of being next rumoured killer matthew webster jason robertson and two other boys appeared on front page of newcastle herald on 8 november with such complaints for a time most popular rumour was that leigh had been murdered by her stepfather and that he had been having sex with her for months in november 1990 detective chaffey told journalist mark riley that police had heard this rumour so many times that they considered shearman to be a suspect riley s article stated that community of stockton harboured suspicions about shearman right until webster was charged with murder on 16 november webster pleaded guilty to assaulting leigh and to supplying cannabis resin to a minor he was released on bail with his sentencing scheduled for 21 february 1990 on 19 january wilson pleaded guilty to assaulting leigh he was released on bail pending sentencing on 28 january upon being taunted by four boys regarding murder webster assaulted one of them on 31 january brad shearman approached guy wilson in public and punched him in head three times after wilson allegedly told him he would get leigh s younger sister next shearman was charged and pleaded guilty to assault while he was still on bail on 16 february 1990 during his third interview with police webster admitted to killing leigh in interview transcript webster initially denied killing leigh then without being asked a further question he stated well i did it but i just can t believe it happened it s just unbelievable webster went on to state that he saw leigh while he was looking for his stash of beers according to webster they walked to saltbushes together where he pulled off her clothes and stuck a finger in her vagina webster stated he lost his temper when leigh rebuffed him choking her for a while before killing her with a rock specifically saying he killed leigh because he thought she would squeal on him for trying to rape her after spending weekend in a police cell webster appeared in court on 19 february where he was refused bail on 21 march while in custody webster was convicted and fined 250 for offensive behaviour in 28 january assault on 17 july shearman was given a 12 month good behaviour bond for 31 january assault judge did not record a conviction taking into consideration that he had been provoked into attacking wilson convictions nc1 was first to be sentenced on 28 february 1990 after pleading guilty to having sex with someone under age of consent he was given six months custody in a detention centre maximum possible sentence for a youth charged with that offence kerry carrington and andrew johnson writing in australian feminist law journal said it was likely that prosecutors did not charge nc1 with rape as a conviction on such a charge would have been unlikely due to a lack of evidence leigh s complaints about incident as reported by witnesses were hearsay and therefore inadmissible in court on 11 may sentence was reduced on appeal to 100 hours community service in reducing his sentence judge stated evidence obliged him to find that sex was consensual and that it was better for nc1 to do something positive for community rather than possibly being led further astray in custody a number of sources state judge reached conclusion that sex had been consensual because of inadequate way evidence was presented to court on 19 march 1990 wilson was sentenced to six months imprisonment for assaulting leigh charges were initially laid against webster for sexual assault though by time case went to trial they had been dropped without public explanation hillary byrne armstrong writing in australian feminist law journal stated it was likely that webster was offered a plea bargain that would drop lesser charges in exchange for his guilty plea for murder webster pleaded guilty to leigh s murder on 24 october 1990 guilty plea meant that no witnesses were called for trial detective chaffey instead read a list of facts to court justice james roland wood sentenced webster to a minimum of 14 years in prison with an additional six years during which he would be eligible for parole saying that a life sentence was inappropriate in view of webster s potential to be rehabilitated wood found that webster s motivation for killing leigh was his fear she would report his sexual assault five stockton citizens volunteered to give character evidence at his trial describing teenager as a quiet gentle giant from a good family others expressed amazement at this description of webster who was also known as fat matt thug of stockton webster served his sentence at correctional centre while acknowledging that plea bargains such as one webster was probably offered are common and help avoid expensive and time consuming trials byrne armstrong stated that accepting webster s confession helped create a legal fiction that he unquestionably acted alone in both sexually assaulting and murdering leigh actual level of sexual violence that leigh sustained was accordingly she said all but erased from sentencing and it appeared justice wood had only been given limited information from post mortem report that would have corroborated webster s confession webster was first person in new south wales to be sentenced under truth in sentencing legislation which meant he could not be released under any circumstances before end of his 14 year non parole period under previous legislation a person of webster s age would probably have been released after only nine years webster appealed length of his prison term to new south wales court of criminal appeal where justices gleeson lee and allen dismissed his appeal in july 1992 in their view crime was so gross that nothing less of a very severe sentence would accord with general moral sense of community r v webster nsw supreme court gleeson cj lee allen jj 15 july 1991 p 17 webster s first application for parole in february 2004 was denied as he had not yet undertaken work release after completing a few months of this program webster was released on parole on 10 june 2004 after serving 14 1 2 years conditions of his parole specified that he would only be allowed to visit newcastle or stockton with permission from his probation and parole officer webster s parole was discussed in parliament of new south wales with minister john responding to queries and concluding that option to supervise webster s re integration into society was better than alternative of releasing him without supervision at end of his sentence following his release leigh s family stated they harboured no ill thoughts towards webster and wished him well in re establishment of his life webster s parole was revoked in november 2004 after he was arrested for assault he pleaded not guilty citing self defence he was released from prison in may 2005 after charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence media coverage leigh s death received widespread and ongoing coverage in both sydney and newcastle media possibly due to a fascination with her reduplicated name between 1989 and 1994 newcastle herald ran at least 39 stories on leigh 23 of them featured on front page at least ten articles on case were published in sydney morning herald during same period both extended media coverage and theatrical plays and film murder inspired have led to it being termed a celebrity crime and to leigh being referred to as a celebrity victim in 1996 psychologist roger peters attributed media fascination to sense of community in stockton and due to crimes being committed by people not considered to be typical criminals stating i think one of main things is that people can identify with people involved had it of been a criminal from outside who stalked her and killed i think it would be long forgotten various sources considered media coverage prior to webster s arrest to be focused on finding something to blame other than her murderer after webster s arrest media continued to search for any outside agency that might have been responsible for event from beginning media reports highlighted lack of parental supervision at party and in sentencing webster justice wood made comments criticising lack of parental supervision researchers jonathan morrow and san roque in sydney law review wrote that wood s comments might as well have been quoted from very newspapers that were covering crime his comments in turn were heavily reported in media webster s sentencing also received considerable media coverage possibly due to his youth and length of his sentence as well as curiosity about newly established truth in sentencing principles his appeal regarding length of his sentence received similar coverage according to observations by kerry carrington and andrew johnson media references to leigh being sexually assaulted almost completely disappeared in less than a year as did references to her being assaulted by group of boys they stated that fact that nc1 was not charged with raping leigh had created legal fiction that his sex with her was consensual unsustainable assumption that leigh consented to sex was turning point in her being blamed for her own assault and murder on grounds that because she was supposedly sexually promiscuous leigh had somehow asked for attack in addition to sexual promiscuity and lack of parental supervision carrington states that media attention also shifted to presence of drugs and alcohol at party morrow and san roque credit media attention to these factors as taking attention away from abuse that leigh suffered before she died epithet slut in a pretrial psychological report also became a topic of focus for media carrington accused media of completely missing point that report was not stating views of psychiatrist rather it was psychiatrist s interpretation of webster s feelings she also considered mark riley s extended coverage of case which she described at one point as journalistic voyeurism to be most profound case of shifting blame from assailants to leigh herself one of riley s articles in particular was considered by her to have suggested that leigh s discussions with her mother about sex and leigh s looks and physical development had contributed to her murder morrow and san roque also criticised riley s article stating it disturbingly married parental blame with well documented notion that rape victim herself is presumably to blame for her attack several writers including eva cox and adele rejected concept that leigh was in any way responsible for her sexual assault and murder media coverage of murder has been considered by multiple sources to be part of a wider culture of victim blaming criticism of police police were criticised over their handling of investigation including their failure to identify perpetrators in a timely manner it took police over three months to press charges against webster even though they had established within ten days that he had lied about his whereabouts had publicly stated his intention to rape leigh and had opportunity to commit crime criticism was also raised regarding relatively few convictions despite several people s admissions to police that they physically attacked leigh at party only wilson was charged with assault and adult who admitted to supplying her with alcohol prior to party was never charged nc1 admitted to having sex with another under age girl at party though he was not charged with that offence with exception of charges against webster that were dropped without explanation nobody was ever charged with raping or sexually assaulting leigh in spite of presence of graphic forensic evidence of genital injuries during a report on radio national leigh s mother said that when she asked detective chaffey why others were not being charged he asked her if she knew how much it costs to run an investigation forensic testing police took blood and clothing samples from suspects including shirt wilson was wearing on night of murder which he admitted had a on it but it is not known whether any dna tests were carried out kerry carrington speculated that reports of evidence being sent for testing may have been a fabrication to obtain a confession leigh s grandmother told carrington that she called scotland yard to enquire about results as a detective on case had informed leigh s family that this was where suspects clothing had been sent scotland yard informed her that they had not received anything from australia for forensic testing in relevant timespan only record of forensic testing that has been uncovered is an acknowledgement by a forensic biologist of four items being received for testing on 6 november 1989 three items of leigh s clothing and blood stained rock found near her body acknowledgement however indicates that other items were not sent for testing results from supposed tests were never made available nor was information on why other items were not sent according to carrington four years after investigation a detective involved in case told her that none of samples taken from suspects were tested samples taken from webster were not used in his prosecution professor harry boettcher a forensic scientist said that if police did not actually test samples it would be professional negligence indefensible in 2009 a solicitor who acted on behalf of leigh s family stated that given advances in dna testing technology it was time to re examine evidence possibility of accomplices several factors have led to speculation that webster was not alone when he killed leigh according to transcript of webster s confession he was never asked if he acted alone carrington accused police of accepting webster s confession at face value ignoring both forensic and witness evidence her investigations highlighted several discrepancies in webster s confession and in forensic evidence for example webster stated in his confession that he had choked leigh with his left hand as he knelt beside her although according to autopsy report bruises on leigh s neck were consistent with being choked with a right hand carrington also questioned webster s statement that he walked along lit streets to other side of stockton peninsula to wash his bloodstained hands when he could have washed his hands in total darkness at beach less than away she also queried his claim that he had blood on his hands but none on his clothes despite leigh having been struck so hard blood was splattered 2 8 metres one way from her body and 1 3 metres other way webster stated that he walked to beach with leigh though according to police reports four witnesses said she walked to beach alone two witnesses stated they saw webster and wilson leave surf club together neither nc1 nor wilson had a reliable alibi for their whereabouts at time of murder wilson told police he was alone on beach when leigh walked past him as she left club minutes before she was murdered webster s statement that he only penetrated leigh with his finger has been considered by various sources to be inconsistent with autopsy findings of genital trauma and trauma is also inconsistent with nc1 s account that his sex with her was consensual in reviewing autopsy boettcher said that numerous blows which killed leigh came from multiple directions and were probably inflicted with different items indicating possibility of more than one perpetrator carrington and johnson speculated that leigh was assaulted by group of boys after returning from beach as punishment for complaining about being raped and was murdered by webster and two others because they were afraid she would tell other people they refused to specifically name two other suspects for fear of legal repercussions though clarified that one had sexually assaulted leigh earlier in night and other likely sexually assaulted her with a beer bottle before she died as punishment for publicly refusing to have sex with him webster talked to media about murder for first time in 1997 and insisted that he acted alone in killing leigh aftermath after being told that nobody was going to be charged with leigh s sexual assault in 1990 leigh s mother began a campaign for case to be officially re investigated in august 1994 kerry carrington sent a 17 000 word document and 300 pages of evidence to royal commission into new south wales police service asking for case to be investigated commission was headed by judge james roland wood though a representative for commission stated that wood s involvement in webster s trial would not affect outcome of any investigation in december 1994 a representative for commission said that after thorough consideration they would not be investigating matter in may 1993 a victim s compensation case had awarded leigh s mother and sister a combined total of 29 214 an appeal aided by carrington s research was lodged against original victim s compensation payout in may 1995 in a landmark legal decision judge joseph moore approved appeal awarding leigh s mother and sister an additional 134 048 moore said evidence indicated that leigh rejected nc1 s sexual advances and that his intercourse with her was without her consent he also acknowledged that whoever sexually assaulted leigh had never been brought to justice and lack of convictions for assault specifically naming jason robertson and three other boys as those who assaulted her in addition to webster and wilson leigh s mother abandoned her efforts to have case re opened in 1997 citing exhaustion and survival nsw crime commission in october 1996 police minister paul whelan made an announcement in parliament of new south wales stating that murder would be reviewed by new south wales crime commission acknowledging that nobody had ever been charged with leigh s sexual assault whelan stated upcoming review was our one opportunity to right terrible wrongs that occurred on night that leigh died in march 1998 crime commission released its findings stating that crimes that resulted in convictions occurred substantially in way described to courts that no further charges would be laid as webster had acted alone in both murder and assault that immediately preceded it and that police had not acted inappropriately in their decision not to charge other persons it did however criticise some police procedures and practices review did not comment on discrepancies between webster s confession and forensic evidence and it did not clarify whether forensic evidence was ever sent for testing a representative for commission refused to comment on whether wilson s blood stained shirt was ever tested one expert opinion obtained by commission wrote that it was likely webster engaged in sexual behaviour which demeaned leigh and to which he will never admit because he is ashamed and embarrassed and dr johan duflou said that a finger or penis was unlikely to have caused leigh s severe genital damage hillary byrne armstrong stated that these expert opinions which contradict webster s confession raised questions on how commission concluded that leigh s sexual assault occurred in manner to which he had confessed also raising doubts about several of commission s other findings crime commission released one of their two reports on matter their second unpublished report was handed over to police integrity commission pic for investigation police integrity commission twenty six people mainly police officers were interviewed in 1998 as part of subsequent pic inquiry several witnesses from party as well as webster wilson and nc1 were also questioned inquiry heard allegations that police assaulted four people during interviews webster wilson nc1 and another unnamed suspect referred to as nc5 a relative of webster who was 17 at time of murder admitting to inquiry that he killed leigh and insisting that he was alone in doing so webster stated that police repeatedly punched and kicked him when he refused to confess to her murder according to scott tucker writing in newcastle herald police were also accused of threatening violence falsifying reports and withholding evidence one of officers being investigated had his police locker raided by internal affairs who discovered several records on murder that had previously been listed as missing carrington was also summoned to give evidence though she was not informed why her book who killed leigh leigh which criticised police over their handling of investigation had been released earlier that year carrington was cross examined for three days longer than any of police officers who were questioned in what was described by hillary byrne armstrong as an inquisition on just about every word she had spoken or written in relation to leigh s murder byrne armstrong accused pic of summoning carrington for sole purpose of attacking her credibility on issues they had no intention of investigating and to discredit someone who had attracted considerable media attention for criticising police pic released their review in october 2000 review recommended dismissal of detective sergeant chaffey for gross dereliction of duty also recommending criminal charges against five other investigative officers review stated that webster was falsely arrested as police arrested him for purpose of questioning something for which they did not have power and that he was probably assaulted by police while he was in custody police received further criticism after it was uncovered that they had interviewed nc1 without contacting his parents and did not question him about leigh s murder only about his intercourse with her following review chaffey retired a little earlier than he intended but dismissed review s findings stating he was proud of his team s performance in october 2001 director of public prosecutions declined to press criminal charges against any of officers on grounds they had suffered emotional hardship and their careers had already been destroyed case which was described on pm as one of longest ever investigations into police conduct in new south wales prompted changes in new south wales police force including reform of record keeping procedures theatrical and film adaptations thumb stockton ferry where several scenes from blackrock were filmed alt rear of a ferry boat with jetty to its left boat has shortland and newcastle on back newcastle s freewheels theatre commissioned nick enright to produce a play that explored themes around rape and murder titled a property of clan it premiered at freewheels theatre in newcastle in 1992 and was performed at national institute of dramatic art in 1993 title was taken from controversial quote in psychological report on webster made in preparation for his trial enright omitted criminal acts and murder from play instead focusing on drama its participants and aftermath of murder play was shown at various high schools in newcastle area and following its positive reception was shown at high schools nationally winning several awards however newcastle high school where both leigh and webster had been students declined to show it play is set in fictional town of blackrock and rape and murder victim is named tracy leigh s family requested that name be changed as tracey was name of leigh s cousin and best friend name remained despite other revisions to script play was retitled blackrock it was performed by sydney theatre company in 1995 and 1996 blackrock was developed into a film of same name which was partially filmed in stockton and released in 1997 community of stockton opposed filming in area stating memories of events were still fresh and details of script were too close for comfort when filmmakers arrived in stockton local media treated them with hostility and locations that had previously been reserved were no longer available situation was exacerbated by filmmakers denial that film was specifically about leigh despite choice of stockton for filming leigh s family were opposed to film saying filmmakers were feasting on an unfortunate situation and portraying leigh negatively associate professor donna lee brien of central queensland university stated that some fictional aspects in film portrayed leigh in a negative manner though book reel tracks by rebecca doyle credited film with correcting misinformation reported in media regarding murder as well as with providing a forum for reflection on events film received a mixed to positive reception in australia but performed poorly when shown elsewhere brien stated that because film lacked poignant and powerful narrative support of leigh s tragedy it was deemed by critics to be shallow and cliched references category 1989 crimes in australia category history of newcastle new
