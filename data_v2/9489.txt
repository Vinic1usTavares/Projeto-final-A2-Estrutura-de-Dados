reception pre release reviews of miniseries were largely positive zack smith of newsarama gave miniseries a largely positive review and called it fan service writ large one that will prove immensely satisfying for long term fans of series he applauded way string of episodes managed to start out with self contained stories and move into a dense and emotional backstory tonally smith described miniseries as possessing feel of an old school post apocalyptic sf journey through a devastated but wondrous world with a sense of danger and mystery detached from land of ooo smith s only complaint was that there s enough rich emotional material once voyagers reach their destination that it feels like more time could be spent there matthew jacobson of spectrum wrote that story is masterful and imaginative and that if islands is a litmus test then final season should be one heck of an adventure post release reviews were also positive oliver sava of a v club awarded miniseries an a and wrote that it can be seen as a summary of adventure times growth over seven seasons beginning with smaller tales that build to something much deeper he applauded how islands does fantastic work fleshing out supporting characters specifically highlighting show s nuanced and multidimensional portrayal of martin dr gross and susan strong he wrote that miniseries main story is a powerful thesis statement cementing show s overall message that adventure is at core of personal discovery and fulfillment and that this same story is extremely relevant to united states current socio political climate dave trumbore of collider wrote that string of episodes were packed full of emotional resonance and deeply complex character relationships and dip ped into some emotionally difficult territory trumbore was particularly complimentary towards way show managed to susan s character by giving her a compelling backstory ultimately trumbore wrote that while adventure time islands succeeds in every aspect series has become known for it also comes up short in familiar ways unfortunately style and duration of adventure time episodes works against delving into show s mythology so we ll just have to obsess over whatever glimpses we get and settle for watching this series again and again in a highly complimentary review for new republic juliet kleber wrote that islands does a dizzying amount of plot development in 80 something minutes furthermore she argued that finn s coming of age story and exploration of post apocalyptic plotline as featured in miniseries are handled just as deftly as any other subject with fun and a tinge of sorrow zach blumenfeld of paste magazine gave islands a slightly more mixed albeit still positive review he complimented philosophical musing of miniseries which he argued takes on shades of black mirror and existentialism to cast a critical eye on technology and human spirit blumenfeld wrote islands gives us a world in which incredibly advanced bioengineering and cybernetics have kept humans alive and ensconced in relative comfort but twist is that very scientific drive to innovate and develop these technologies is precisely what damned our species in first place what islands ends up delivering therefore is most harrowing answer to fermi s famous paradox intelligent life will inevitably destroy itself with this being said he felt that episodes such as whipple happy dragon and mysterious island took time away from main story compacting finn s emotional reaction to founder s island which resulted in relative emotional emptiness accolades common sense media awarded islands miniseries with common sense seal calling it a beautiful animated miniseries that explores a deep backstory episode imaginary resources won a primetime emmy award for
