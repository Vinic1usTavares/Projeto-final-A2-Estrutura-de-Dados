gauntlet press of richard outram and barbara howard together with extensive background material and an exhaustive bibliography imagery derived from natural world was always at heart of howard s painting throughout her life she painted horizons shorelines skies sun and water although she was more concerned with essence of a subject than with its precise representation right thumb 250px engraving book design and binding by howard for gauntlet press 1974 in her sixties she devoted a decade of work to an extensive series of cetacean studies encounters with whales in his essay encounters and recollections in art of barbara howard and richard outram poet jeffery donaldson writes for most part these are portraits of mammals in something like their private element their appearances are brief ecstatic revelations fortuitous glimpses sudden soundings they seem to break forth abruptly from their solitude and then slip away as quickly again these enormous canvases some as large as across have never been publicly exhibited in late 1990s until her death in 2002 howard returned to her lifelong fascination with light night skies reflective surface of water in these last paintings there is a recurrence of circular elements an abstraction of natural forms and a balancing of darkness and light howard has stated in my painting as in all my work i am deeply involved with light as movement and inter action of colours integrity of colour and form hence with integrity of total work which has to do with spirit and abstract essence not representation i am preoccupied with life s ambiguities and dualities and in my later work i am reaching more and more from dark toward light freedom and a transcending exuberance howard s paintings drawings wood engravings and book designs can be viewed on website barbara howard s unfolding visual world critical reception with exception of very large whale canvases howard s paintings sold steadily throughout her lifetime however while she had her champions she was never a part of mainstream of canadian art and so did not attract kind of public critical attention that attends most successful careers in her introduction to catalogue for howard s 1980 solo exhibition event in mind sculptor rebecca sisler wrote classification school barbara howard s work defies specific slotting although we sense her recognition of heritage left by great masters turner being most obvious but she draws and paints in direct response to her own muse and as such cannot be aligned to any particular art movement for in common with other maverick artists throughout art history her work although bound to no age is relevant to all writing about howard s wood engravings in her 2006 essay drawing attention barbara howard s ecologies artist curator and academic martha fleming states wood engraving is a demanding process and howard was a virtuoso creatures she portrayed echo floating frameless engravings pioneered by thomas bewick in 18th century and yet they are startlingly modern as much about form as they are about anatomical accuracy they hover at brink of typology but have nothing of zoological rendering s reduction to taxonomy her counterintuitive use of colour upholds monochrome dignity inherent in technique howard was elected to royal canadian academy of arts in 1975 and served on rca council from 1980 1982
