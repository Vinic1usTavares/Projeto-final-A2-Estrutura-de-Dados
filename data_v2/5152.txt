pictured would be available to play protagonist a principal cast of six actors received star billing in show s first season poehler portrayed lead character leslie knope naive but well meaning eager to please deputy director of parks and recreation department of fictional town of pawnee indiana poehler said upon reading script provided by michael schur it took me five minutes to realize leslie knope was best character ever written for me she also felt it took a few episodes before she started feeling my groove with character but came to realize cast was extremely talented and would eventually become like family also among cast were aziz ansari as tom haverford a sarcastic parks department employee and rashida jones as ann perkins a nurse who befriends leslie and tries to help her turn a giant construction pit into a park daniels and schur intended to cast ansari and jones who previously appeared in office as karen filippelli from series earliest stages of development but ultimate parks and recreation concept did not coalesce until they learned poehler would be available to star after her recruitment general concept of series was established and script for pilot episode was written nick offerman portrayed ron swanson director of parks and recreation department offerman had previously auditioned for a part on office and schur was impressed with his comedic talents and wanted to cast him but then offerman became unavailable because he appeared on will grace a show starring his wife megan mullally schur said i just wrote his name down on a post it note and stuck it to my computer and said someday i m going to figure out what to do with that guy aubrey plaza played april ludgate a sarcastic and uninterested college intern part was written specifically for plaza after meeting her casting director allison jones told schur i just met weirdest girl i ve ever met in my life you have to meet her and put her on your show schur of meeting her aubrey came over to my office and made me feel really uncomfortable for like an hour and immediately i wanted to put her in show although writers were not immediately sure what direction her character would take rounding out main cast was paul schneider best known for his work in independent films such as lars and real girl and assassination of jesse james by coward robert ford he was cast as mark brendanawicz a city planner and leslie s unrequited love interest she still harbors feelings for mark from a one night sexual encounter years ago schneider said that early in season he was insecure in role because he was still trying to figure out character s motivations chris pratt played andy dwyer ann s well intentioned but lazy and simple minded boyfriend although pratt appeared in every episode of season 1 he was credited as guest star until second season when he was promoted to main cast andy was originally supposed to appear only in first season but producers liked pratt so much that almost immediately after casting him they decided to make andy a regular character if show was renewed jim o heir and retta made regular appearances as jerry gergich and donna meagle two fellow employees at pawnee parks and recreation department personalities of two characters did not become developed until second season but schur said parks and recreation staff liked actors so decided to include them in show and figured we d work it out later pamela reed made several appearances as marlene griggs knope leslie s mother and an important figure in pawnee school system seth gordon who directed reed in her first episode canvassing said she improvised a great deal during her audition creating many elements that helped define marlene s character jama williamson appeared in rock show as wendy attractive surgeon wife of tom haverford wendy would make numerous appearances in season 2 during which it was revealed that have a green card marriage eric edelstein guest starred in two season 1 episodes canvassing and boys club as lawrence a disgruntled neighbor of andy s conception immediately after ben silverman was named co chairman of nbc s entertainment division in 2007 he asked greg daniels to create a spin off of office half hour comedy daniels adapted from british comedy of same name created by ricky gervais idea of an office spin off stemmed from a subplot from show s third season that followed characters in an office branch in stamford connecticut separate from show s other characters who were in scranton pennsylvania silverman felt it could have served as its own series and began asking daniels about possibility of a spinoff daniels resisted idea for several years out of fears of diluting quality of office but silverman eventually insisted upon a new show daniels co created parks and recreation with michael schur who had been a writer on office like daniels schur had previously worked on nbc sketch comedy show saturday night live two spent months considering ideas for new series and debating whether to make it a stand alone show rather than a spin off with many of those conversations taking place at norm s diner in van nuys according to daniels they eventually abandoned original spin off plan because they couldn t find right fit daniels and schur considered two frontrunner ideas about a family show done as a mockumentary and a mockumentary version of west wing which they felt could make new show focus on public sector in same way that office was about private sector they also considered a series about a local government official trying to rebuild a political career following a humiliating public spectacle but ultimately abandoned idea however it was ultimately incorporated into backstory for ben wyatt character played by adam scott who was added late in second season daniels and schur specifically sought to making avoid a political show about a hypocrite running for office or bureaucrat who just makes everything impossible which they felt were cliched and overdone stereotypes after poehler agreed to play lead they decided show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small town government schur said they sought to portray a very optimistic kind of can do spirit type person in middle of a really byzantine world and frustrating world idea was partly inspired by portrayal of local politics on hbo drama series wire as well as renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from 2008 united states presidential election schur said they wanted to focus on government s involvement in people s lives at a very micro level because during great recession there was a great deal of discussion and speculation about a new great depression era intervention in people s lives writing staff was also drawn to idea of building a show around a female relationship namely leslie knope and ann perkins reports that daniels and schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would in fact be a spin off of office producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent nevertheless their concept for it shared several elements with office particularly mockumentary approach which allows actors to look at and directly address camera new show would also include documentary style interviews in which characters speak one on one with camera crew about day s events again as with office new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among actors schur said writers considered an idea in which a broken copy machine from scranton setting of office ended up in government officers of parks and recreation thus jokingly making copy machine spun off character from office but idea was ultimately abandoned indiana was identified as a setting for show because daniels said it s a midwestern state that people don t hear about much and didn t have a lot of stereotypes attached to it series was scheduled as a mid season replacement and rushed into production to meet premiere date of april 9 2009 as a result when series was featured at a panel during january 2009 television critics press tour nbc did not have a finished episode to screen only a copy of pilot script available for review some of parts were still not cast and series which did not yet have a name was referred to as untitled amy poehler project or name public service was considered but ultimately rejected because network officials did not want to be accused of mocking idea in a commercial that aired during nbc s super bowl coverage in february it was announced that series would be called parks and recreation writing show s writers spent time researching local california politics and attending los angeles city council meetings schur said they observed that many community hearings were attended only by those opposed often angrily to proposals under consideration this confirmed his existing impression i ve been to some community meetings in my life and it is often this feeling of utter sparseness that nobody cares depiction of public hearings in several parks and recreation episodes was inspired by this perspective which was also basis for entire canvassing episode schur asked urban planners in claremont california whether efforts to turn a construction pit into a park could realistically take several months or longer they told him that was entirely plausible and that they had recently broken ground on a park that had been in various planning stages for 18 years schur said pit project was conceived as a device to bring all characters together which was partially inspired by way various characters in wire were brought together to work toward a common goal or project writers originally envisioned pit becoming a park only in series finale although those plans were later changed and pit was filled in during second season pawnee residents vocally opposed to leslie s park proposal were based on real life california residents show s producers encountered who fought construction of parks in their hometowns one such group committee for a better park was actually opposed to parks in general and of their name and mission inspired producers writing for those characters parks and recreation staff worked with a number of consultants familiar with local government work including scott albright a california city planner who provided feedback for mark brendanawicz character inspiration for ron swanson came from an encounter schur had in burbank with an elected official a libertarian who favored minimal government and admitted i don t really believe in mission of my job daniels and schur wrote script for pilot episode in mid 2008 original script portrayed leslie and mark as slightly less likable than they appeared in final draft for example in premiere episode mark asks ron to greenlight park because he is inspired by leslie s optimism and wants to help her in original script mark intervened because he was attracted to ann and wanted an excuse to keep seeing her characters were made more likable in response to feedback episode received from focus groups and press tour screenings first season episodes were written and developed relatively quickly after each other and schur said staff was treating entire six episode season as if it was one television pilot when season concluded writers had not decided what would happen with developing romantic plotlines between leslie and mark or mark and ann parks and recreation involves a mixture of written dialogue and comedic improvisation in one example from pilot episode aziz ansari s character attempts to flirt with rashida jones s when she speaks at a parks and recreation public forum ansari continued to improvise long after completing his scripted dialogue in season s final episode rock show andy goes through a list of previous names of his rock band about half band names used in episode came directly from script but after actor chris pratt made up one on spot directors encouraged him to keep improvising pratt said he went through about 200 fake band names during take filming parks and recreation faced early production delays because poehler was pregnant when she signed on filming had to be postponed until she gave birth principal photography began on february 18 2009 show was filmed in southern california and construction pit featured throughout season was dug by episode s producers at an undeveloped property in van nuys a district of los angeles producers went door to door in neighborhood seeking residents permission for dig pit was guarded 24 hours a day and paparazzi regularly came to set to take photos of actors during filming exterior of pawnee government building and several of hallway scenes were shot at pasadena city hall parks and recreation department interiors as well as town hall courtyard were filmed on a sound stage set s windows were outfitted with water systems to simulate falling rain and included fake pigeons scenes set in playgrounds and elsewhere outdoors were filmed on location in los angeles and public forum scenes in premiere episode were filmed in one of city s middle schools schur said parks and recreation producers approach each episode as if they are filming a real documentary they typically shoot enough for a 35 or 40 minute episode then cut it down to 22 minutes using best material due to improvisational acting and hand held camerawork a great deal of extra footage is shot that must be discarded for final cut according to poehler for every show there could probably be a second show of stuff we ve edited out original cut of 22 minute pilot was 48 minutes long producers film about nine pages of script each day a large amount by u s television standards although series shares a mockumentary style with office daniels and schur sought to establish a slightly different tone in camerawork of pilot episode one on one interviews for example sometimes feature two separate camera angles on same person footage is intercut to create final version of scene this technique was inspired by five obstructions a 2003 experimental documentary directed by lars von trier and jorgen leth which daniels watched at suggestion of actor paul schneider parks and recreation also makes frequent use of jump cut technique for instance one scene in pilot episode repeatedly jump cuts between brief clips in which leslie seeks permission from ron to pursue pit project early in season editor dean holland developed a technique that would be used throughout series during a scene in reporter in which leslie reacts to quotes read to her by journalist poehler improvised a number of jokes many of which were ultimately going to be cut from episode holland thought they were all funny so he created a brief montage several of lines producers sought to lend authenticity to fictional pawnee setting by incorporating real life indiana elements they contacted bloomington based upland brewing company and asked for empty beer bottles and labels to be used as background props six episodes of first season aired thursdays at 8 30 p m premiere was shown between two season 5 episodes of office dream team and michael scott paper company reporter was originally supposed to be season s second episode but schedule was changed and canvassing originally planned as third episode was shown second instead reception reviews first season of parks and recreation started to receive criticism before premiere episode aired according to a march 18 2009 report that was leaked to television journalist nikki finke focus groups responded poorly to a rough cut version of pilot many focus group members felt show was a carbon copy of office some found it predictable slow paced and lacking in character development and felt beginning of episode needed to better explain setting and plot some viewers said show lacked strong male characters particularly a datable lead on other hand viewers said show s portrayal of government bureaucracy was very believable and had potential to generate amusing situations while poehler s character drew mixed comments actress herself was well liked early feedback left many critics and industry observers skeptical about show s chances of success in response to leak ben silverman co chairman of nbc entertainment said feedback on rough cuts is usually negative even with ultimately successful shows schur said that pilot had been completely re edited at least four times since focus groups described in report were held first season received generally mixed to negative reviews many critics said series was too similar to office and its mock documentary style in particular several commentators said naive and well meaning leslie knope character too closely resembled office protagonist michael scott well intentioned but dimwitted manager of a paper company sales office maureen ryan television reviewer for chicago tribune said parks and recreation surpassed friends spin off joey as worst example of nbc s tendency to extend its franchises well beyond what is desirable or logical daniels said of comparisons between leslie knope and michael scott my sense is that if we had built parks and recreation around a 90 year old maasai warrior people would still have said he reminds me of michael scott there was just no way to escape it poehler acknowledged that there was some validity to comparisons but felt that series overcame them with production of rock show i think it was something we had to work through in beginning and i m kind of hoping we re on other side of that and people will start to judge show on its own for what it is and realize it s just a completely different world in a similar style salon com writer jonah weiner said of first season each episode wound up more or less same way with humiliation of poehler s quixotic adorably bureaucrat some critics said show s characters and overall tone were too mean spirited in early episodes while reviewers praised various cast members in individual episodes some said supporting characters in general needed to be more fully developed and provided with better material several wrote that some of subplots were too predictable and risked becoming stale such as leslie s long standing crush on mark and question of whether andy and ann would keep dating others said leslie was too unintelligent and ditzy schur said that was not intention of writers and feedback prompted changes to character in second season years after first season ended schur said he believed much of early criticism stemmed from fact that audiences were not yet familiar with characters and he believed viewers who revisited episodes enjoyed them more because they had gotten to know characters better as series progressed not all reviews were negative several commentators said show had potential and pointed out that early episodes of office had been flat before series found its footing finale rock show received best reviews of season several commentators declared that parks and recreation had finally found right tone both generally and for leslie knope character in particular several reviewers even those who did not enjoy show applauded poehler s comedic abilities and said her talent timing and likability helped elevate series above some of its flaws reviewers also said they particularly liked aziz ansari as tom haverford and chris pratt as andy dwyer some commentators approved of pawnee setting as offering a good opportunity to satirize small town government and politics parks and recreation went on to run for seven seasons over span of six years looking back after show s run concluded most critics agreed that first season was worst of series in a 2015 recap of show s best episodes oliver lyttelton and jessica kiang of indiewire wrote famously parks rec didn t come flying out of gate it began with an uneven rushed truncated first season that saw writers visibly struggling with how to make leslie knope work and finding it tricky to stand apart from office nate jones of vulture com revisiting first season following series finale noted tone of series was darker and more cynical and characters particularly leslie knope were not yet clearly defined or developed jones wrote like a lot of early comedy episodes jokes are fine but series worldview is hard to pin down and true to myth tone never really coalesces until finale in a 2015 article for forbes allen st john suggests 2007 08 writers guild of america strike saved parks and recreation because it help prompt positive changes to show in season two writers turned down snark and show immediately improved leslie was still overly enthusiastic but beneath all that energy was a core of competence and good intentions ethan alter senior writer with yahoo entertainment suggested mark brendanawicz character was poorly conceived and a major problem for show during its first season from pilot it s clear that schneider is odd man out in an ensemble that s taking some time to gel anyway in a 2015 article grantland writer sam donsky said first season of parks and recreation was his favorite season though he acknowledged this was a minority opinion donsky said he preferred darker tones felt character had more leeway and preferred series when it was not worrying about being likable ratings parks and recreations premiere was seen in 6 77 million households media outlets described this as a solid result comparable to average nielsen ratings for 30 rock another thursday night show on nbc however viewership declined almost every week over rest of season culminating in a season low of 4 25 million households for final episode average first season viewership was 5 45 million households per episode office experienced similarly poor ratings during its first season and later became a success however low viewership presented a greater challenge for parks and recreation because nbc now trailed cbs abc and fox in ratings and move of comedian jay leno from tonight show to a variety show in nbc s 10 p m weeknight slot left less room on network s primetime schedule retta said acting during first season was stressful because it was unclear how long show would stay on air due to poor reviews and ratings likewise chris pratt said there was a constant feeling among parks staff that show could be canceled at any time at end of season one parks and rec you hug people really really fucking tight because you just don t know dvd release first season of parks and recreation was released on dvd in united states on september 8 2009 dvd included all six episodes as well as an
