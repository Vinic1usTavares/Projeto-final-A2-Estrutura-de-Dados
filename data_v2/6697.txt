tradition of rinzai school of zen likely undergoing koan study with a rinzai master coming to united states in 1972 he settled in providence rhode island and worked at a laundromat as a repairman spending much of his off time improving upon his english shortly after arriving he found his first students at nearby brown university most of whom came by way of a recommendation from a professor there among these first students was jacob perl who helped to found providence zen center with others thumb left providence zen center in cumberland rhode island in 1974 seung sahn began founding more zen centers in united states his school still yet to be established beginning with dharma zen center in los angeles a place where laypeople and ordained could practice and live together that following year he went on to found chogye international zen center of new york city and then in 1977 empty gate zen center meanwhile in 1979 providence zen center moved from its location in providence to its current space in cumberland rhode island kwan um school of zen was founded in 1983 and unlike more traditional practice in korea seungsahn allowed laypersons in lineage to wear robes of full monastics celibacy was not required and rituals of school are unique although kwan um school does utilize traditional seon and zen rituals elements of their practice also closely resemble rituals found often in pure land buddhism chan buddhism and huayan school in 1986 along with a former student and dharma heir dae gak seungsahn founded a retreat center and temple in clay city kentucky called furnace mountain temple name being kwan se um san ji sah or perceive world sound high ground temple center functions independently of kwan um organization today thumb right seungsahn s hermitage where he spent most of his final years over his tenure as guiding teacher seungsahn appointed many dharma heirs he created title ji do poep sa nim for those not ready for full dharma transmission but capable of teaching at a higher capacity in 1977 seungsahn was hospitalized for cardiac arrhythmia and it was then discovered that he had advanced diabetes he had been in and out of hospitals for heart complications for years preceding his death and in 1987 began spending much less time at his residence in providence zen center starting in 1990 and under invitation from mikhail gorbachev seungsahn began making trips to soviet union to teach his student myong gong sunim later opened a practice center in country novgorod center of zen meditation teaching style seungsahn implemented use of simple phraseology to convey his messages delivered with charisma which helped make teachings easier to consume for western followers some of his more frequently employed phrases included only go straight or only don t know he even went so far as to call his teachings don t know zen which was reminiscent of style of seungsahn used correspondences between him and his students as teaching opportunities back and forth letters allowed for a kind of dharma combat through mail and made him more available to school s students in his absence this was another example of his skillful implementation of unorthodox teaching methods adapting to norms of western culture and thus making himself more accessible to those he taught he was a supporter of what he often termed together action encouraging students to make lineage s centers their home and practice together thumb left joan halifax with seungsahn at a sesshin at ojai foundation in 1979 seungsahn also developed his own koan study program for students of kwan um school known today as twelve gates these twelve koans are a mixture of ancient cases and cases which he developed before receiving inka to teach in kwan um inka is not synonymous with dharma transmission students must complete twelve gates though often they will complete hundreds more one of more well known cases of twelve gates is dropping ashes on buddha sixth gate which is also title of one of his books in book compass of zen this kong an is transcribed as follows somebody comes to zen center smoking a cigarette he blows smoke and drops ashes on buddha seungsahn then poses question if you are standing there at that time what can you do not included in this version of koan is kwan um school of zen s following side note on case h ere is an important factor in this case that has apparently never been explicitly included in its print versions zen master seung sahn has always told his students that man with cigarette is also very strong and that he will hit you if he doesn t approve of your response to his actions when seungsahn first began teaching in united states there was an in his message on significance of zazen under advice from some students however he soon came to incorporate zazen into curriculum more frequently more than a few of his earliest students had practiced zen previously under soto priest suzuki laying out a convincing argument about how zazen and zen were seen as inseparable in western psyche later life throughout 1990s seung sahn made trips to israel which led to 1999 opening of tel aviv zen center his remaining years were spent in particularly poor health he had a pacemaker put in his chest in 2000 followed by renal failure in 2002 in june 2004 he was given honorific title dae jong sa great lineage master by jogye order in commemoration of his accomplishments highest title order can grant death seung sahn died shortly after on november 30 2004 at age of 77 in seoul south korea at hwagaesa first temple where he served as abbot criticisms there is a belief that seung sahn made too many students dharma teachers he also upset some in jogye order by allowing lay dharma teachers to wear long robes while korean jogye order also gives title poep sa dharma teachers to laypeople long robes are reserved for monks in korea in beginning of kwan um school of zen people became dharma teachers rather quickly mostly out of need in order to run practice kwan um school currently has a rigorous process in place for people to become dharma teachers usually there is a one two year period for someone to take five precepts and then about another two year period for someone to become a dharma teacher in training this is followed by another two years to become a dharma teacher and then at least five years to become a sr dharma teacher seung sahn was accused of carrying out sexual relationships with students secretly while supposedly celibate first accusations of sexual relationships between seung sahn and students came about in 1988 sonia alexander former director of cambridge zen center has claimed that seung sahn had carried out long term sexual relationships with a number of his female followers journalist rick fields confirms this writing supposedly celibate korean zen master seung sahn seon sa nim revealed long term relationships with two students how swans came to lake a narrative history of buddhism in america 3rd ed by rick fields shambhala 1992 pg 364 according to sonia alexander when questioned about nature of these relationships seung sahn stated that it wasn t romantic love it wasn t lust these alleged relationships caused alexander to end her involvement with kwan um school believing in retrospect that she had been used over years only to help build more zen centers for lineage in addition to alexander author sandy boucher spoke with several other women who lived at cambridge zen center at time one of whom said that in her opinion sonia was very much in minority in feeling used and that seung sahn s affairs had not been hurtful to women involved notwithstanding her reservations alexander still has reverence for seung sahn feels her time spent in school was to her benefit and subsequently rejoined kwan um school as a senior dharma teacher in 2011 according to author timothy miller kwan um organization has had to struggle with disclosures of controversial sexual conduct on part of its leader seung sahn was generally understood by his followers to be a celibate monk and revelation that he had had affairs with female students caused some members to leave movement 60s communes hippies and beyond by timothy miller syracuse university press 1999 pg 112 commenting during this period barbara rhodes now head zen master of kwan um school of zen said they were just people learning to live as a community and their teacher was just trying to learn same thing zen master seung sahn did publicly admit nature of relationships and did two repentance ceremonies kwan um school of zen has since developed and enforced an ethics committee that has very strict guidelines for teacher student relationships and consequences for unethical behavior of any member of school seung sahn
