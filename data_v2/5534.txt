wily from beginning following this mega man and rush set out to put an end to mr x s plan mega man destroys eight robot masters then makes his way to mr x s fortress villain is beaten and quickly reveals himself as none other than a disguised dr wily evil scientist flees to a new fortress stronghold where mega man pursues and defeats him again game ends with dr wily finally brought to justice and sent to prison gameplay thumb left using one of two adaptors mega man combines with rush to propel through air seen in first stage of mr x s fortress gameplay in mega man 6 is largely similar to its five nes counterparts player takes control of mega man to complete a series of side scrolling platform stages littered with smaller robot enemies and occasional larger mini bosses player s primary method of attack is mega buster cannon which can be charged for more powerful shots at end of each of initial eight stages is a boss battle where player inherits that robot master s unique master weapon if successful these eight levels can be completed in any order although all robot masters are weak to a specific master weapon adding an element of strategy to order chosen by player player s health is represented by a gauge that can be refilled by picking up energy pellets extra lives reserve energy tanks and pellets that refill master weapon power can also be found throughout each level mega man 6 introduces energy balancer which automatically refills weapon with lowest energy when picking up master weapon power previous mega man games typically allowed player to call on transformable dog rush or use other support items in order to traverse difficult or otherwise inaccessible parts of a stage mega man 6 instead features a pair of rush adaptors that fuse mega man and rush into special forms first jet mega man lets player fly upward or hover for a brief period of time but prevents use of charge shots second power mega man utilizes a powerful short range punch attack for destroying large blocks player cannot slide when using either adapter mega man 6 also presents less linear ways to complete stages than in previous entries in series there are two pathways in many of stages that lead to boss rooms but player is often required to use one of rush adaptors to begin an alternate route although either one will clear stage only one of them will give player a letter circuit board for assembling helper bird beat collecting all four parts will allow player to call on beat to attack enemies man 6 was developed at same time as franchise s first spin off mega man x for nintendo s newer console super nintendo entertainment system series artist keiji inafune credited as inafking stated that having a video game franchise with six titles is very rare and one of advantages to this is that players expect certain aspects of each game to be repeated in next after having implemented so many different mechanics to gameplay of past entries inafune thought that rush adaptor assembly was inevitable artist struggled with adaptor designs and ultimately found them to be unrealistic according to inafune if you think about it they shouldn t be able to combine like this it would be awkward if parts of rush like his neck were left over after they combined so what was i supposed to do robot masters featured in some of previous mega man games were result of design contests held in japan in which fans of series would submit their character ideas to capcom keeping with tradition japan held a design contest for mega man 6 after release of mega man 5 magazine nintendo power held a similar contest in north america only eight out of more than 200 000 worldwide character submissions for mega man 6 were accepted for game six of robot masters were designed by japanese fans while remaining two knight man and wind man were designed by north american fans who entered nintendo power contest north american cover of game pays homage to two designers by featuring their robot masters on it inafune admitted that it was stressful when last characters being designed for game were not meeting with development team s schedule he concluded for having hit a lot of roadblocks i feel like we got a lot done for 6 theme for our designs was world is our stage and i really enjoyed bringing what i felt was unique flavor of different countries into game yuko takehara credited as yuko composed musical score for mega man 6 takehara collaborated with several other composers for follow up mega man 7 in 1995 a few months after publication of mega man 5 capcom announced sixth installment in original series as well as mega man soccer and mega man x for snes making mega man 6 last title in franchise to be released on 8 bit nes capcom chose not to publish game outside japan instead nintendo of america published it in march 1994 before nes era in north america was about to end nintendo of america made a plan to help sell it along with s revenge ii and nes version of wario s woods which were also published by nintendo in north america during same time their plan was to release top loading nes 101 for a retail price of 49 99 to attract consumers to buying updated

challenge level and added power ups were generally praised gamepro was impressed with some of newer enemies and larger mid stage bosses but was displeased with game s recycling of master weapons seen in previous mega man games overall magazine described graphics audio and level design in mega man 6 as standard fare for franchise and called game a rock of reliable nes fun in a series that is as predictable as tide destructoid editor tony ponce considered mega man 6 best game in entire series he argued that game was retro before retro was cool due to capcom s decision to develop it as a higher profile game on nes during era of fourth generation consoles he also expressed appreciation for its music introductions for each robot master and use of branching pathways in each level among many other reasons nintendo power listed mega man 6 as best nes game of 1993 stating his sixth nes adventure in which he uses two new special power ups might just be his best craig skistimas of screwattack also appreciated these innovations and regretted missing out on game when it was first released mega man 6 is listed by ign as 58th best game on nes writers summarized mega man 6 is considered by many to be last worthwhile nes release in catalog and though that s not saying much when looking at title s contemporaries mega man 6 is still as good as it gets in many respects mega man 6 is occasionally seen as redundant to series gamespot editors christian nutt and justin speer labeled mega man 6 cheesiest among nes titles if you re looking for mega laughs you might want to try this one out 1up com contributors likewise found that game s inane storyline and villains both insult fans of series and outweigh game s good soundtrack and interesting power ups four members of electronic gaming monthly review panel all voiced similar opinions regarding game s familiar 8 bit presentation and its addition to already repetitive nature of series one reviewer commented ok mega man was fun and original back in days when letters n e s meant something now game is just getting redundant oh sure mega man may learn a few new tricks here and there but this series has to end soon elements of game made their way into mega man series from archie comics prior to it going on indefinite hiatus some notable liberties were taken such as introducing a creator character for plant man dr pedro and introducing x foundation renamed x corporation at conclusion of mega man 3 adapt latter concept notably featured mr x as a separate character from dr wily and as a future version of xander payne a character exclusive to comics who became involved in time travel after being part of an anti robot extremist group known as emerald spears a view of events of mega man 6 in series final issue prior to hiatus hinted as xander s overthrow and wily s seizure of his resources and alias x corporation s resources also provide wily with means of laying groundwork for other schemes including abduction of kalinka cossack leading into mega man 4 its membership was shown to include numerous identically costumed grunts and madame y a character based on an alternate universe concept by mega
