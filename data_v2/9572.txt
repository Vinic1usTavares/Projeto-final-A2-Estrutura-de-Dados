space he continued what we tended to do was watch old french films from 60s or listen to music that was so far away that it wasn t in any way relevant among songs recorded for album gang bang was

bitch according to mtv news bradley stern song revisits role of scorned songstress from thief of hearts 1992 gang bang is a dark dance electronic song with a dubstep breakdown and industrial tinged beats michael cragg from guardian commented about dub step writing that it recalls her american life album in its slightly uneasy marrying of genres with a sudden dubstep breakdown its most obvious detour writer alexander from idolator thought that song gives us a flashback to her under appreciated celebration collaboration with lil wayne revolver 2009 reception michael cragg of guardian wrote that it is a ridiculous collection of sound effects police sirens gunshots and imposing menace that s actually pretty fun in a kind of slightly unhinged way neil mccormick of telegraph wrote that song is a solid techno groove and one of album s odder and most interesting tracks stern commented that song is not only highlight of record but a highlight of madonna s career matthew perpetua of pitchfork media wrote that it s album s boldest most experimental track and it s marred only by a just off vocal performance that renders her very familiar voice a bit anonymous and a halfhearted attempt at a dub step bass drop nick levine of bbc music called it a preposterous piece of pop schlock priya elan of nme wrote that music is cold and minimal recalling grubby house beats of erotica and madge bleats on like some antagonistic disco fury driven to edge by her thirst for vengeance and gosh it s thrilling stuff sal cinquemani of slant magazine called it a standout cut in which madonna quite convincingly portrays a jilted bride turned femme fatale in vein of beatrix kiddo writing that it plays more like a piss take of ritchie s gangster fetish than a glorification of it melinda newman of hitfix called it one of most compelling tracks with madonna singing in a low whispery register detailing that she s shot her lover dead in head and furthermore she has no regrets it s violent and explicit and it s what madonna used to represent a sense of danger jim farber of new york daily news called it historic and may be world s first murder ballad as disco song samuel r murrian from parade ranked it at number 72 on his list of madonna s 100 greatest songs calling it a vintage grindhouse exploitation revenge flick within a tune this vividly cinematic track builds and builds until she s screaming at end it s a lot of fun gang bang entered some record charts due to digital downloads from mdna it entered french singles chart at number 93 for issue date of march 31 2012 in united states song charted on billboard dance electronic digital songs at number 30 in south korea song debuted at number 90 on gaon international downloads chart with sales of 3 653 copies

people started realizing what song was said concert goer aaron fransua 25 who was in section 120 we all just stood there everybody who was around me all had shock on their face i heard a lot of wows fransua said a member of her tour staff told huffington post that madonna would rather cancel her show than censor her art her entire career she has fought against people telling her what she can and cannot do she s not about to start listening to them now madonna herself explained use of guns in a letter i do not condone violence or use of guns she wrote rather they are symbols of wanting to appear strong and wanting to find a way to stop feelings that i find hurtful or damaging in my case i want to stop lies and hypocrisy of church intolerance of many narrow minded cultures and societies i have experienced throughout my life and in some cases pain i have felt from having my heart broken she further commented about controversy in an interview for good morning america saying that she would not remove weapons from performance adding that would be like asking people to not have guns in action movies i mean thing is guns don t kill people people kill people that whole first section of show is like an action movie and i was playing a super vixen who wanted revenge while reviewing mdna world tour dvd arnold wayne jones of dallas voice wrote that blood spattering projections during
