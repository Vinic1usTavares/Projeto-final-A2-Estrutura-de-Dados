it s huge i would say right now it s biggest thing i ve done in open wheel that s what i was meant to be winning in in stock cars i wasn t to get our first win in our first year is huge we know we re a little bit behind on some of ovals but i think this is a big boost for everybody working in shop harvick who finished in second felt montoya did not have sufficient fuel to reach race s conclusion i ve been a big fan of montoya s since he came over he s a great road racer but he wasn t fastest strategy won it for him today third place finisher burton was happy with his finishing position obviously we worked really hard all last year and this year on fuel mileage and it paid off for us today it was a good run for us we ran competitive all race long jeff gordon was happy with way his race was run i thought crew chief steve letarte and everyone on our team just called this race perfectly to come from that far back to a top 10 we played pit strategy best way we possibly could and we had some cautions fall our way which was some good fortune for us to gain some spots fifth place finisher biffle said his car felt good but felt it was difficult to overtake other drivers robby gordon who led 48 laps most of any driver was disappointed by finishing in 16th position not to make excuses but we were gonna run out of fuel it s disappointing that we had a car as fast as we had started on front row and not just get beat but finish 16th he said he hoped any problems with his fuel mileage would be resolved by season s second road course event at watkins glen two days after race
