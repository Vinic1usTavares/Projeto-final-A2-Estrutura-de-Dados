thumb upright 1 35 an agricultural aircraft applies low insecticide bait against western corn rootworm pest control is regulation or management of a species defined as a pest a member of animal kingdom that impacts adversely on human activities human response depends on importance of damage done and will range from tolerance through deterrence and management to attempts to completely eradicate pest pest control measures may be performed as part of an integrated pest management strategy in agriculture pests are kept at bay by cultural chemical and biological means ploughing and cultivation of soil before sowing reduces pest burden and there is a modern trend to limit use of pesticides as far as possible this can be achieved by monitoring crop only applying insecticides when necessary and by growing varieties and crops which are resistant to pests where possible biological means are used encouraging natural enemies of pests and introducing suitable predators or parasites in homes and urban environments pests are rodents birds insects and other organisms that share habitat with humans and that feed on and spoil possessions control of these pests is attempted through exclusion repulsion physical removal or chemical means alternatively various methods of biological control can be used including sterilisation programmes history thumb left bronze cat ancient egypt 664 525 bc pest control is at least as old as agriculture as there has always been a need to keep crops free from pests as long ago as 3000 bc in egypt cats were used to control pests of grain stores such as rodents taylor d complete contented cat your ultimate guide to feline fulfilment david charles 2011 p 9 archived from m cat simon and schuster 1979 pp 93 96 ferrets were domesticated by 500 ad in europe for use as mousers mongooses were introduced into homes to control rodents and snakes probably by ancient egyptians sherman d m tending animals in global village a guide to international veterinary medicine john wiley sons 2007 p 45 conventional approach was probably first to be employed since it is comparatively easy to destroy weeds by burning them or ploughing them under and to kill larger competing herbivores techniques such as crop rotation companion planting also known as intercropping or mixed cropping and selective breeding of pest resistant cultivars have a long history thumb red weaver ants here feeding on a snail have been used to control pests in china southeast asia and africa for many centuries chemical pesticides were first used around 2500 bc when sumerians used sulphur compounds as insecticides modern pest control was stimulated by spread across united states of colorado potato beetle after much discussion arsenical compounds were used to control beetle and predicted poisoning of human population did not occur this led way to a widespread acceptance of insecticides across continent with industrialisation and mechanization of agriculture in 18th and 19th centuries and introduction of insecticides and derris chemical pest control became widespread in 20th century discovery of several synthetic insecticides such as ddt and herbicides boosted this development biological control is first recorded around 300 ad in china when colonies of weaver ants oecophylla smaragdina were intentionally placed in citrus plantations to control beetles and caterpillars which cites also in china ducks were used in paddy fields to consume pests as illustrated in ancient cave art in 1762 an indian mynah was brought to mauritius to control locusts and about same time citrus trees in burma were connected by bamboos to allow ants to pass between them and help control caterpillars in 1880s ladybirds were used in citrus plantations in california to control scale insects and other biological control experiments followed introduction of ddt a cheap and effective compound put an effective stop to biological control experiments by 1960s problems of resistance to chemicals and damage to environment began to emerge and biological control had a renaissance chemical pest control is still predominant type of pest control today although a renewed interest in traditional and biological pest control developed towards end of 20th century and continues to this day in agriculture horticulture and forestry control methods biological pest control thumb biological pest control parasitoid wasp adult with pupal cocoons on its host a tobacco green background biological pest control is a method of controlling pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms it relies on predation parasitism herbivory or other natural mechanisms but typically also involves an active human management role classical biological control involves introduction of natural enemies of pest that are bred in laboratory and released into environment an alternative approach is to augment natural enemies that occur in a particular area by releasing more either in small repeated batches or in a single large scale release ideally released organism will breed and survive and provide long term control biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme for example mosquitoes are often controlled by putting bt bacillus thuringiensis ssp a bacterium that infects and kills mosquito larvae in local water sources cultural control thumb cultivation by ploughing exposes insect pests to predators such as black headed gulls mechanical pest control is use of hands on techniques as well as simple equipment and devices that provides a protective barrier between plants and insects this is referred to as tillage and is one of oldest methods of weed control as well as being useful for pest control larvae of common click beetle are very destructive pests of newly ploughed grassland and repeated cultivation exposes them to birds and other predators that feed on them crop rotation can help to control pests by depriving them of their host plants it is a major tactic in control of corn rootworm and has reduced early season incidence of colorado potato beetle by as much as 95 trap cropping a trap crop is a crop of a plant that attracts pests diverting them from nearby crops pests aggregated on trap crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods however trap cropping on its own has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales without use of pesticides possibly due to pests ability to disperse back into main field pesticides thumb left spraying pine logs with insecticide against ips a pine engraver beetle pesticides are applied to crops by agricultural aircraft tractor mounted crop sprayers or as seed dressings to control pests however successful control by pesticides is not easy right formulation must be chosen timing is often critical method of application is important adequate coverage and retention on crop are necessary killing of natural enemies of target pest should be minimised this is particularly important in countries where there are natural reservoirs of pests and their enemies in countryside surrounding plantation crops and these co exist in a delicate balance often in less developed countries crops are well adapted to local situation and no pesticides are needed where progressive farmers are using fertilisers to grow improved crop varieties these are often more susceptible to pest damage but indiscriminate application of pesticides may be detrimental in longer term efficacy of chemical pesticides tends to diminish over time this is because any organism that manages to survive initial application will pass on its genes to its offspring and a resistant strain will be developed in this way some of most serious pests have developed resistance and are no longer killed by pesticides that used to kill their ancestors this necessitates higher concentrations of chemical more frequent applications and a movement to more expensive formulations pesticides are formulated to kill pests but many have detrimental effects on non target species of particular concern is damage done to honey bees solitary bees and other pollinating insects and in this regard time of day when spray is applied can be important widely used neonicotinoids have been banned on flowering crops in some countries because of their effects on bees some pesticides may cause cancer and other health problems in humans as well as being harmful to wildlife there can be acute effects immediately after exposure or chronic effects after continuous low level or occasional exposure maximum residue limits for pesticides in foodstuffs and animal feed are set by many nations thumb spruce budworm adult and pupa shown a serious pest of forests can be monitored using pheromone traps forestry forest pests present a significant problem because it is not easy to access canopy and monitor pest populations in addition forestry pests such as bark beetles kept under control by natural enemies in their native range may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators enabling them to cause extensive economic damage pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in canopy these release volatile chemicals that attract males pheromone traps can detect arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks for example spruce budworm a destructive pest of spruce and balsam fir has been monitored using pheromone traps in canadian forests for several decades in some regions such as new brunswick areas of forest are sprayed with pesticide to control budworm population and prevent damage caused during outbreaks in homes and cities many unwelcome animals visit or make their home in residential buildings industrial sites and urban areas some contaminate foodstuffs damage structural timbers chew through fabrics or infest stored dry goods some inflict great economic loss others carry diseases or cause fire hazards and some are just a nuisance control of these pests has been attempted by improving sanitation and garbage control modifying habitat and using repellents growth regulators traps baits and pesticides general methods physical pest control thumb dog control van himachal pradesh india physical pest control involves trapping or killing pests such as insects and rodents historically local people or paid rat catchers caught and killed rodents using dogs and traps on a domestic scale sticky are used to trap flies in larger buildings insects may be trapped using such means as pheromones synthetic volatile chemicals or ultraviolet light to attract insects some have a sticky base or an electrically charged grid to kill them are sometimes used for monitoring cockroaches and to catch rodents rodents can be killed by suitably baited spring traps and can be caught in cage traps for relocation talcum powder or tracking powder can be used to establish routes used by rodents inside buildings and acoustic devices can be used for detecting beetles in structural timbers historically firearms have been one of primary methods used for pest control garden guns are smooth bore shotguns specifically made to fire 22 caliber snake shot or 9mm and are commonly used by gardeners and farmers for snakes rodents birds and other pest garden guns are short range weapons that can do little harm past 15 to 20 yards and they re relatively quiet when fired with snake shot compared to a standard ammunition these guns are especially effective inside of barns and sheds as snake shot will not shoot holes in roof or walls or more importantly injure livestock with a ricochet they are also used for pest control at airports warehouses stockyards etc most common shot cartridge is 22 long rifle loaded with 12 shot at a distance of about which is about maximum effective range pattern is about in diameter from a standard rifle special smoothbore shotguns such as marlin model can produce effective patterns out to 15 or 20 yards using 22 wmr which hold 1 8 oz of 12 shot contained in a plastic capsule poisoned bait thumb left rodent bait station chennai india poisoned bait is a common method for controlling rats mice birds slugs snails ants cockroaches and other pests basic granules or other formulation contains a food attractant for target species and a suitable poison for ants a slow acting toxin is needed so that workers have time to carry substance back to colony and for flies a quick acting substance to prevent further egg laying and nuisance baits for slugs and snails often contain dangerous to children and household pets warfarin has traditionally been used to kill rodents but many populations have developed resistance to this anticoagulant and is often substituted these are cumulative poisons requiring bait stations to be topped up regularly poisoned meat has been used for centuries to kill animals such as wolves and birds of prey poisoned carcasses however kill a wide range of carrion feeders not only targeted species raptors in israel were nearly wiped out following a period of intense poisoning of rats and other crop pests fumigation thumb tent fumigation of a house in america fumigation is treatment of a structure to kill pests such as wood boring beetles by sealing it or surrounding it with an airtight cover such as a tent and fogging with liquid insecticide for an extended period typically of 24 72 hours this is costly and inconvenient as structure cannot be used during treatment but it targets all life stages of pests an alternative space treatment is fogging or misting to disperse a liquid insecticide in atmosphere within a building without evacuation or airtight sealing allowing most work within building to continue at cost of reduced penetration contact insecticides are generally used to minimise long lasting residual effects sterilization populations of pest insects can sometimes be dramatically reduced by release of sterile individuals this involves mass rearing of a pest sterilising it by means of x rays or some other means and releasing it into a wild population it is particularly useful where a female only mates once and where insect does not disperse widely this technique has been successfully used against new world screw worm fly some species of tsetse fly tropical fruit flies pink bollworm and codling moth among others laboratory studies conducted with u 3 1 2 were attempted in early 1970s for rat control although these proved unsuccessful in 2013 new york city tested sterilization traps demonstrating a 43 reduction in rat populations product was approved for sterilization of rodents by united states environmental protection agency in august 2016 insulation boron a known pesticide can be impregnated into paper fibers of cellulose insulation at certain levels to achieve a mechanical kill factor for self grooming insects such as ants cockroaches termites and more addition of insulation into attic and walls of a structure can provide control of common pests in addition to known insulation benefits such a robust thermal envelope and acoustic noise cancelling properties epa regulates this type of general use pesticide within united states allowing it to only be sold and installed by licensed pest management professionals as part of an integrated pest management program simply adding boron or an epa registered pesticide to an insulation does not qualify it as a pesticide dosage and method must be carefully controlled and monitored methods for specific pests natural rodent control thumb left brown rat infestation several wildlife rehabilitation organizations encourage natural form of rodent control through exclusion and predator support and preventing secondary poisoning altogether united states environmental protection agency notes in its proposed risk mitigation decision for nine rodenticides that without habitat modification to make areas less attractive to commensal rodents even eradication will not prevent new populations from habitat united states environmental protection agency has prescribed guidelines for natural rodent control and for safe trapping in residential areas with subsequent release to wild people sometimes attempt to limit rodent damage using repellents balsam fir oil from tree abies is an epa approved non toxic rodent repellent balsam fir oil fact sheet pesticides us epa acacia subsp root emits chemical compounds that repel animals including rats world agroforestry centre pantry pests thumb red flour beetle attacks stored grain products worldwide insect pests including mediterranean flour moth indian cigarette beetle drugstore beetle confused flour beetle red flour beetle merchant grain beetle grain beetle wheat weevil maize weevil and rice weevil infest stored dry foods such as flour cereals and pasta in home foodstuffs found to be infested are usually discarded and storing such products in sealed containers should prevent problem from reoccurring eggs of these insects are likely to go unnoticed with larvae being destructive life stage and adult most noticeable stage since pesticides are not safe to use near food alternative treatments such as freezing for four days at or baking for half an hour at should kill any insects present clothes moths thumb larva pupa and adult clothes moth tineola bisselliella with characteristic damage to fabric larvae of clothes moths mainly tineola bisselliella and feed on fabrics and carpets particularly those that are stored or soiled adult females lay batches of eggs on natural fibres including wool silk and fur as well as cotton and linen in blends developing larvae spin protective webbing and chew into fabric creating holes and specks of excrement damage is often concentrated in concealed locations under collars and near seams of clothing in folds and crevices in upholstery and round edges of carpets as well as under furniture methods of control include using airtight containers for storage periodic laundering of garments trapping freezing heating and use of chemicals mothballs contain volatile insect repellents such as 1 4 which deter adults but to kill larvae permethrin or other insecticides may need to be used carpet beetles carpet beetles are members of family dermestidae and while adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen larvae are destructive pests in homes warehouses and museums they feed on animal products including wool silk leather fur bristles of hair brushes pet hair feathers and museum specimens they tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths leaving behind specks of excrement and brown hollow bristly looking cast skins management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible resorting to pesticides when necessary beetles can fly in from outdoors and larvae can survive on lint fragments dust and inside bags of vacuum cleaners in warehouses and museums sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems and heating freezing spraying surface with insecticide and fumigation will kill insects when suitably applied susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers books are sometimes attacked by cockroaches book mites and various beetles which feed on covers paper bindings and glue they leave behind physical damage in form of tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces book pests include larder beetle and larvae of black carpet beetle and drugstore beetle which attack leather bound books while common clothes moth and brown house moth attack cloth bindings these attacks are largely a problem with historic books because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible to this type of damage evidence of attack may be found in form of tiny piles of book dust and specks of frass damage may be concentrated in spine projecting edges of pages and cover prevention of attack relies on keeping books in cool clean dry positions with low humidity and occasional inspections should be made treatment can be by freezing for lengthy periods but some insect eggs are very resistant and can survive for long periods at low temperatures beetles thumb upright house timber split open to reveal larvae of house longhorn beetle in their burrows which are partially filled with frass various beetles in superfamily attack dry seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses and to make furniture in most cases it is larvae that do damage these are invisible from outside of timber but are chewing away at wood in interior of item examples of these are beetles which attack sapwood of hardwoods and furniture beetles which attacks including plywood damage has already been done by time adult beetles bore their way out leaving neat round holes behind them first that a householder knows about beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural timber caves in prevention is through chemical treatment of timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture termites termites with colonies in close proximity to houses can extend their galleries underground and make mud tubes to enter homes insects keep out of sight and chew their way through structural and decorative timbers leaving surface layers intact as well as through cardboard plastic and insulation materials their presence may become apparent when winged insects appear and swarm in home in spring regular inspection of structures by a trained professional may help detect termite activity before damage becomes substantial inspection and monitoring of termites is important because termite alates winged reproductives may not always swarm inside a structure control and extermination is a professional job involving trying to exclude insects from building and trying to kill those already present soil applied liquid provide a chemical barrier that prevents termites from entering buildings and lethal baits can be used these are eaten by foraging insects and carried back to nest and shared with other members of colony which goes into slow decline mosquitoes thumb upright mosquito aedes aegypti biting a human mosquitoes are midge like flies in family culicidae females of most species feed on blood and some act as vectors for malaria and other diseases historically they have been controlled by use of ddt and other chemical means but since adverse environmental effects of these insecticides has been realised other means of control have been attempted insects rely on water in which to breed and first line of control is to reduce possible breeding locations by draining marshes and reducing accumulations of standing water other approaches include biological control of larvae by use of fish or other predators genetic control introduction of pathogens growth regulating hormones release of pheromones and mosquito trapping on airfields thumb jet engine fan blades damaged by bird strike birds are a significant hazard to aircraft but it is difficult to keep them away from airfields several methods have been explored stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment leaving grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds sonic nets are being trialled these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas guidelines and legislation guidelines and legislation regarding usage permitted methods of application and storage conditions of pesticides and chemicals vary from country to country often being legislated by each state of
