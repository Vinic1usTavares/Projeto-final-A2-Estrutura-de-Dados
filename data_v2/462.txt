thumb an affected gastropod shell a juvenile tegula from a museum collection byne s disease more accurately known as bynesian decay is a peculiar and permanently damaging condition resulting from an ongoing chemical reaction which often attacks mollusk shells and other calcareous specimens that are in storage or on display for long periods of time it is a form of efflorescence of salts formed by reaction of acidic vapors with basic calcareous surface efflorescence can sometimes superficially resemble a growth of mold although first described in early 19th century bynesian decay was not well understood until almost a hundred years later condition is named after man l byne who is best known for describing it in late 19th century even though he was not first person to describe it in print in addition byne mistakenly assumed that condition was caused by bacteria and thus condition came to be referred to as a disease in addition to mollusk shells various other natural history specimens are susceptible to this form of decay including svendsen m 2001 efflorescence on an egg shell museums and archives and some fossils and mineral samples that are composed of calcium carbonate this condition is of concern for museum scientists and also for anyone who has a private collection of specimens of these kinds in order to avoid bynesian decay use of metal non reactive polymers and acid free materials of archival quality are preferred over common paper wood based materials ordinary glues and varnishes in collection environments management of affected specimens includes washing and thorough drying with a subsequent reallocation to an archival setting appearance thumb crystallized salt clusters efflorescence produced by byne s disease on a gastropod shell s surface thumb some affected mollusk shells efflorescence is clearly visible in both specimens this decay was deliberately produced under extreme conditions byne s disease can appear as a powdery white coating on a shell or other calcareous specimen it also often looks as if specimen has been infected with mold however under magnification mold like appearance is revealed to be a crystalline growth of salts history in 1839 british naturalist and malacologist thomas brown 1785 1862 briefly mentioned this form of deterioration in his book a conchologist s text book agnes kenyon also described condition in 1896 suggesting that saline particles in atmosphere were evidently exerting a corrosive effect origin of name in 1899 british amateur conchologist and naturalist loftus st george byne 1872 1947 salisbury a e 1951 obituaries ronald 1884 1950 proceedings of malacological society of london 29 1951 1953 part i 5 6 described this condition p byne s disease questions and answers accessed 25 april 2010 in a presentation to society of great britain in ireland and did so again in another presentation in june of that same year byne was convinced that butyric acid was present together with calcium acetate in affected shells although he never really described methods he used in so called extensive chemical tests he claimed to have applied to these specimens among other conclusions he assumed that butyric acid originated from bacterial activity he also concluded that decaying effect travelled from shell to shell and drawer to drawer and thus condition came to be called a disease clarification and resolution true nature of disease was partially clarified in 1934 when british government chemist john ralph nicholls explained that oak cabinets at natural history museum in london were giving off acetic acid fumes which were attacking shells stored in them in 1985 almost 150 years after byne s disease was first mentioned in literature norman h tennent and thomas baird published an extensive study on subject their deep analysis involving many complex and sophisticated techniques such as x ray diffraction infrared spectroscopy analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy finally revealed true nature of decaying process they identified substances involved calcium salts as well as chemical reactions that originated them they concluded that byne s disease is not actually a disease and is in fact caused by simple chemical reactions which occur in presence of acidic vapors originating from immediate environment in which specimens are stored chemistry thumb alt a small

in an enclosed space storage method itself usually causes this problem when containers cabinets or display cases are entirely or partially made of wood plywood or other wood products such as masonite or when specimens are surrounded by or in contact with various other kinds of materials that are cellulose based and can turn water vapor acidic other potentially damaging materials include non archival quality cardboard card paper cotton and cork all of which give off acidic vapors over time pvc and polyurethane plastics are also a problem as they also degrade and give off acidic vapors with time high humidity of air is a significant contributing factor as is lack of ventilation of specimens high ambient temperatures can increase rapidity of decay generally in cabinets or display cases that are entirely or partially made of wood hydrolysis of acetyl groups in wood creates acetic acid rate at which acetic acid is produced is proportional to concentration of esters in wood humidity temperature and overall acidity of environment berndt h 1987 assessing detrimental effects of wood and wood products on environment inside display cases aic vancouver bc acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins commonly urea formaldehyde resins in first case acetic acid reacts with calcium carbonate one of main components of freshwater marine and land shells birds eggs and other such specimens producing calcium acetate a salt formaldehyde can be oxidized by oxygen in air to create formic acid which then has basically same effects as acetic acid reacting with calcium carbonate to produce a salt salts calcium acetate and calcium formate crystallize through specimen s outer surface destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction as condition progresses salt crystals build up over specimen s surface which becomes increasingly eroded calcium carbonate and acetic acid chemical reaction occurs as follows a 1999 application of sorbents to protect calcareous materials against acetic acid vapours indoor air

prevention and management when specimens are to be placed in any size of container for long term storage or display consistent use of only archival quality materials prevents development of byne s disease thus materials such as metal cabinets and display cases archival quality paper labels and card trays are used in museum collections of specimens that might be vulnerable to this reaction it is also worth mentioning that sea shells after collecting need to be washed thoroughly in freshwater to remove salt that is on and in shell and then dried thoroughly before they are stored salt attracts moisture and makes shells more vulnerable to bynesian decay following is a chart that shows non archival materials and their archival equivalents traditional non archival materials archival materials

storage bags archival polypropylene zipper storage bags if possible use of wood and cellulose derivatives should be avoided entirely many varnishes and paints are well known emitters of volatile organic compounds some of which may be acidic and thus have potential to damage calcium carbonate specimens because of this these coatings should also be avoided water based varnishes and paints are considered less harmful and should be preferred because reactions involved in bynesian decay require a certain quantity of moisture in air in order for them to take place keeping air somewhat dry i e keeping environmental relative humidity under control is beneficial this is achieved by careful monitoring of relative humidity using instruments such as a and applying dehumidifiers when necessary sometimes simple air conditioning systems may suffice extremely low humidity can damage some specimens so caution is recommended usually a relative humidity maintained around 50 is considered to be adequate applying sorbents containing a strong base such as potassium hydroxide inside storage environment to protect specimens against degradation is also possible copy paper or koh impregnated filter paper are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used these strong bases have a preference to react with acid thus they compete successfully with calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present bases also help reduce overall acid concentration inside enclosed space damage to specimens is unfortunately not reversible however decay can be arrested by washing or soaking specimens in water followed by a very thorough drying specimens must then be placed in an environment that consists of only archival materials in a completely archival setting pyrite disease in collections which contain fossils high humidity can also affect pyrite or its more reactive polymorph marcasite iron sulphide fossils in a somewhat similar condition which is known as pyrite disease iron sulfide can react with water and oxygen to form iron sulfates and sulfuric acid which then can produce bynesian decay references external links category museology
