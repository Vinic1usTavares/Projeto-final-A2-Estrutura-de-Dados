propaganda fide in rome removed norfolk virginia from jurisdiction of archdiocese of baltimore placing it within new diocese of richmond this upset matthews who arranged for archbishop ambrose marechal of baltimore to use diplomatic pouch of french ambassador to united states to express his misgivings ambassador would deliver archbishop s letters to french ministers to holy see who would

june 13 1815 despite his earlier disagreements with society matthews offered jesuits a plot of land adjacent to church on which to build a house of jesuit priests who would assist him in his parochial duties and simultaneously accommodate relocated jesuit seminarians while jesuits prepared to move into new building they allowed george ironside an educator and former episcopal priest who converted to catholicism to use structure as a school for lay students beginning in 1817 subsequently fr anthony kohlmann returned to washington and continued operation of school as its superior this gave rise to washington catholic seminary a school primarily for lay students not seminarians on september 8 1821 contrary to initial intentions of matthews who sought to build a rectory and jesuits who sought to use building as their seminary since this arrangement did not provide matthews with assistant priests he initially sought he wrote to archbishop marechal expressing his desire that jesuits who he viewed as trying to take over his parish be removed from land of st patrick s nonetheless matthews succeeded fr adam marshall s j as third president of washington catholic seminary later gonzaga college high school in 1824 he also taught as a faculty member at school he served as a figurehead president so that school could accept tuition jesuits were forbidden from accepting tuition but

20 000 orphanage was incorporated by an act of congress which also remitted some of its taxes until congress exempted it from property taxes entirely matthews friendships with many of washington s social elite drew contributions to orphanage from people such as mayor thomas carberry and president andrew jackson he was also well acquainted with daniel webster henry clay and roger taney these friendships were partly result of matthews strong federalist and later whig views initial purpose of institution was to be an orphanage for girls but since its founding it was operated as a free school for poor children of washington that educated orphans and non orphans alike this educational function became integral to institution s purpose and number of non orphaned students eventually far exceeded number of orphans in 1831 a board of trustees and a board of female lay managers were created latter of which was composed of prominent women in district who were able to enlist financial
