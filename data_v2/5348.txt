bjoroy tunnel is a subsea road tunnel in hordaland county norway tunnel is part of norwegian county road 207 which connects island of bjoroy in municipality of fjell to mainland near hakonshella and in city municipality of bergen it crosses underneath vatlestraumen strait reaching below mean sea level it serves as a fixed link for 900 residents of islands of bjoroy and tyssoy as well as a large number of cottage owners who vacation on islands first proposal was launched in 1980 and construction started on 29 september 1993 there were severe problems because tunneling encountered an area of sandstone causing a year s delay total construction cost was it opened on 7 may 1996 and remained a toll road until 29 january 2005 specifications bjoroy tunnel is a subsea tunnel which runs below vatlestraumen strait between island of bjoroy and mainland of bergen it carries two lanes of hordaland county road 207 it is only fixed link for islands of bjoroy and tyssoy tyssoy is connected to bjoroy by a bridge tunnel is long and reaches below mean sea level maximum gradient is 10 degrees about 18 grade it is one of few tunnels in norway without mobile telephone coverage although there are emergency telephones that connect to operation center of norwegian public roads administration and tunnel will receive coverage with future norwegian public safety radio before construction of bjoroy tunnel geology of area was thought to consist entirely of metamorphic basement rocks similar to those exposed on surrounding islands jurassic sediments encountered in tunnel included breccia and conglomerate in contact with underlying gneisses and a sandstone with coal fragments some of which was quite unconsolidated spore and pollen samples gave an oxfordian age late jurassic for sequence sedimentary rocks appear to have been deposited into an eroded depression caused by a fault zone which later reactivated disrupting bedding and causing steep dips history thumb map of bjoroy and surrounding area planning since 1966 bjoroy had been served by ferry plans for a tunnel to bjoroy were first launched by engineer jack jahnsen in 1980 these were based on then under construction vardo tunnel which became first subsea tunnel in norway when it opened in 1982 he had a meeting at his place on 18 december 1980 to which three municipal councilors from bjoroy also were invited where he tried to get support for tunnel which would be topic of a municipal council meeting on 20 december council unanimously voted in favour of establishing a committee to look into tunnel committee was established on 6 january 1981 and concluded with that there were three alternative possibilities to build a fixed link to bjoroy a bridge from island over sore via vestre and to sore on litlesotra a tunnel under vatlestraumen to hakonshella or a bridge over vatlestraumen to hakonshella or at time a bridge to litlesotra was estimated to cost a tunnel was estimated to cost while a bridge over vatlestraumen was estimated to cost all three included a road connection to tyssoy with bridge proposals costing for tyssoy connection and tunnel having a cost of in part because earthworks volume from tunnel could be used to build a mole with a short bridge seismology tests were done in august 1983 and they concluded that ground had good conditions uncompacted material laid mostly only deep albeit at times as deep as proposed tunnel crossing followed a mountain ridge and maximum depth was between although topography went steep down to those depths plans were presented to johan j minister of transport and communications and cooperation was started with norwegian public roads administration to find a suitable connection to tyssoy so that they could also take advantage of tunnel to connect two islands it was chosen to build across which was shallow and wide in 1987 kaare hartman joined committee and proposed that tunnel be built with borrowed money guaranteed by land owners on islands and repaid using tolls at time project was not on any prioritized investment list and this way project was not dependent on public grants on 7 september 1987 hartmann reached agreement with norges skibshypotek to borrow estimated bank had a guarantee in income from tunnel however norges skibshypotek had to withdraw as it was not permitted to invest in non shipping investments instead a loan was taken in bergens four land owners made a guarantee for nok 9 million with a judicial registration covering an area of they hoped that value of their land would increase after tunnel had been built same amount was also guaranteed by fjell municipality public grants were also secured so debt would be nok 27 to 30 million planning was done by chr f groner for which municipality paid costs statistics from ferry showed that 26 400 cars and 93 902 people had taken it in 1986 which had grown to 40 400 and 121 000 in 1989 estimates were for a 90 increase until 2000 given an opening in 2002 a bid for project was gathered from selmer furuholmen which gave a maximum price of nok 55 million given that construction started in 1989 on 12 december 1989 committee sent an official offer to hordaland public roads administration whereby they as a company under establishment offered to fully finance tunnel plans called for tolls of for a car and an investment cost of nok 47 million plans were at first nearly discarded by administration as they felt it was impossible for a community of 400 people to finance such a large project without other grants however it became evident that administration was spending nok 2 million per year on ferry service and as ferry soon would have to be replaced this would increase to nok 3 to 5 million per year on 1 october 1990 issue was considered by hordaland transport board which approved plans this was followed up by hordaland county council on 19 june 1991 which involved nok 27 million being financed by debt and nok 28 to 33 million being financed through reduced subsidies to ferry plans were met with criticism from locals on bergen side where tunnel would emerge they stated that plans had cheap solutions and had unnecessary negative impact on their local environment this included demolishing of a football field and lack of noise barriers bergen municipality demanded that costs of a new field be paid for by project and that tunnel be slightly extended a new estimate was made which increased price by nok 10 3 million however hordaland public roads administration protested stating that it would give an inferior road technically that existing development plans permitted construction and that noise would not exceed permitted limits they concluded that should these demands remain increased costs would terminate project on 16 november 1992 bergen city council voted to allow tunnel under condition that tunnel project financed a new football field decision was appealed by lawyers representing local community but this was rejected by hordaland county governor on 30 august 1993 originally unlimited company bjoroy og tyssoy ans had been attempted established with capital from locals but instead company bjoroy tyssoy as was established on 29 september 1993 capital for nok 40 000 was paid by fjell municipality nok 20 000 by sund municipality and nok 10 000 by jack jahnsen plans were sent to ministry of transport and communications in october 1992 who started working on a proposal for parliament in january 1993 issues raised by ministry were that loans had been issued in 1987 and whether land estimated value of guaranteed real estate was real project was presented to parliament of norway who must approve all toll roads by then costs were estimated at nok 61 5 million including nok 4 5 million in ordinary county grants and nok 30 million in extraordinary county grants proposal estimated annual toll collection costs to nok 825 000 with collection taking place on bjoroy it was originally planned that toll plaza would be manned between 06 00 and 22 00 meaning passing would be free at night an agreement was made between ministry tunnel company and county municipality on 6 january 1994 to build tunnel company had right to collect tolls for up to 15 years on fees dictated by county municipality and would have to pay nok 27 million for tunnel with county paying for rest of costs construction would be responsibility of hordaland public roads administration with tunnel company only responsible for their part of financing and collection of tolls an agreement was made with selmer whereby they would charge nok 59 422 500 and take risk of project including any expenditures for unknown geological conditions or similar costs increases they were also responsible for an insurance to reclaim investments should it be proven impossible to build tunnel construction construction of tunnel started on 29 september 1993 with original plans calling for tunnel to open on 15 june 1995 original construction consisted of blasting from bjoroy but by january 1994 there were problems with water leaks through cracks contractor described these as common problems when building tunnels but that construction would be delayed by up to two weeks to keep up with schedule company started also blasting from mainland however problems increased and by september tunnel was leaking per minute which was 50 more than estimated this caused extra work to be done on exterior to tunnel and costs had increased by several tens of millions of kroner in particular a different type of rock had been struck and of concrete had been injected without this giving desired effects on 30 september selmer stopped construction from bjoroy side although it continued from mainland about from bjoroy side construction found a section of sandstone upper jurassic bjoroy formation a condition that had never been encountered during subsea tunnel construction before geological engineers stated that there was no known solution to overcoming problem and that if contractor had blasted into area tunnel would have been filled with sand and water within minutes on a meeting on 10 october o t blindheim a geological consulting company and selmer presented three alternatives continued injection of cement recommended by blindheim freezing recommended by selmer because it was cheapest but would take more time and use of a water tight shield a technical committee was established and on 16 december they recommended use of cement injection combined with a ring of drainage holes around tunnel before blasting method was to be continually tested and if it was insufficient freezing could be used as tunnel advanced hole was to be continuously secured using carbon fibre reinforced carbon gunite self boring bolts steel ribs and full pouring work was taken up after a meeting on 27 march 1995 and on 16 august final blast was made representatives from selmer stated that method they had chosen had resulted in international interest for tunnel and they had demonstrated it to several international delegations tolls and auxiliary roads grants were only given for tunnel to bjoroy and not for necessary roads that would connect tyssoy to bjoroy this caused local controversy as some people on bjoroy disagreed that tolls on bjoroy tunnel should pay for tyssoy bridge on 13 may 1993 costs of connection to tyssoy were estimated at nok 5 million issue was not resolved when construction of tunnel started original costs for bridge were for nok 11 4 million including a bridge with a clearance of this was later reduced to length and which reduced costs to nok 9 4 million of this county paid nok 4 million while two municipalities had advanced transporting earthwork from tunnel to sound on 22 january 1996 tunnel company agreed to advance construction costs and collect it from tolls with sund municipality guaranteeing for debt on 2 february 1996 tunnel company had an agreement with bru og which operates bergen toll ring to collect tolls in tunnel using autopass automatic toll collection system a manual collection system was estimated to cost nok 1 4 million per year while an automated system was estimated at nok 0 4 million tunnel opened on 7 may 1996 same day last ferry ran originally plan was to charge tolls similar to ferry with a manual system it would not be possible to charge for two wheeled vehicles and passengers so fares for other vehicles were raised slightly in 1995 it had cost nok 44 for a single passing with a car on ferry tolls were set to nok 120 for all types of vehicles except two wheelers and nok 72 was charged per travel with pre paid ticket books bus riders had to pay for two extra zones toll plaza was open a few hour each week to allow people to purchase discounted tickets contract for construction of bridge to tyssoy was announced on 20 august 1996 and was won by ncc eeg henriksen anlegg who wanted nok 8 5 million for job link opened on 27 september 1997 in 2000 a public meeting was held in which it was proposed to reduce rates and instead prolong collection time but this was rejected in 1999 norwegian public roads administration reported that bjoroy tunnel had cheapest administration costs per passing at of all small toll companies tolls were removed on 29 january 2005 after eight years and eight months almost half stipulated time on 19 january 2004 freight ship ran aground on unmarked underwater bank of in vatlestraumen located above tunnel accident cost 18 people their lives and was most extensive and costly oil spill in norwegian history in an attempt to avoid similar incidents occurring again norwegian coastal administration started in may 2012 to blast away bank increasing depth from this allows sailing width though vatlestraumen to increase by work required tarp covering tunnel to be removed causing increased leaks in tunnel during work period project was highly controversial amongst islanders and plans were approved by only a single decisive vote in municipal council islanders were especially concerned that work might damage tunnel calculations conducted by coastal administration conclude that there is no chance of this occurring as blasting is taking place above tunnel references bibliography category subsea tunnels in norway category road tunnels in hordaland category road tunnels in bergen
