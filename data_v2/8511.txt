animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form biological kingdom animalia with few exceptions animals consume organic material breathe oxygen are able to move can reproduce sexually and grow from a hollow sphere of cells blastula during embryonic development over 1 5 million living animal species have been described of which around 1 million are insects but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total animals range in length from 8 5 millionths of a metre to they have complex interactions with each other and their environments forming intricate food webs kingdom animalia includes humans but in colloquial use term animal often refers only to non human animals study of non human animals is known as zoology most living animal species are in bilateria a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan bilateria include protostomes in which many groups of invertebrates are found such as nematodes arthropods and molluscs and deuterostomes containing both echinoderms as well as chordates latter containing vertebrates life forms interpreted as early animals were present in ediacaran biota of late precambrian many modern animal phyla became clearly established in fossil record as marine species during cambrian explosion which began around 542 million years ago 6 331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago historically aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without carl linnaeus created first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his systema naturae which jean baptiste lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809 in 1874 ernst haeckel divided animal kingdom into multicellular metazoa synonymous for animalia and protozoa single celled organisms no longer considered animals in modern times biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques such as molecular phylogenetics which are effective at demonstrating evolutionary relationships between animal taxa humans make use of many other animal species for food including meat milk and eggs and also for materials such as leather and wool also pets and as working animals for transports dogs have been used in hunting while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports non human animals have appeared in art from earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion etymology word animal comes from latin meaning having breath having soul or living being biological definition includes all members of kingdom animalia in colloquial usage as a consequence of anthropocentrism term animal is sometimes used to refer only to non human animals characteristics thumb upright 1 3 animals are unique in having ball of cells of early embryo 1 develop into a hollow ball or blastula 2 animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things animals are eukaryotic and multicellular unlike bacteria which are prokaryotic and unlike protists which are eukaryotic but unicellular unlike plants and algae which produce their own nutrients animals are heterotrophic feeding on organic material and digesting it internally with very few exceptions animals respire all animals are motile able to spontaneously move their bodies during at least part of their life cycle but some animals such as sponges corals mussels and barnacles later become sessile blastula is a stage in embryonic development that is unique to most animals allowing cells to be differentiated into specialised tissues and organs structure all animals are composed of cells surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins during development animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised making formation of complex structures possible this may be calcified forming structures such as shells bones and spicules in contrast cells of other multicellular organisms primarily algae plants and fungi are held in place by cell walls and so develop by progressive growth animal cells uniquely possess cell junctions called tight junctions gap junctions and with few exceptions in particular sponges and placozoans animal bodies are differentiated into tissues these include muscles which enable locomotion and nerve tissues which transmit signals and coordinate body typically there is also an internal digestive chamber with either one opening in ctenophora cnidaria and flatworms or two openings in most bilaterians reproduction and development thumb left sexual reproduction is nearly universal in animals such as these dragonflies nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction they produce haploid gametes by meiosis smaller motile gametes are spermatozoa and larger non motile gametes are ova these fuse to form zygotes which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere called a blastula in sponges blastula larvae swim to a new location attach to seabed and develop into a new sponge in most other groups blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement it first to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm in most cases a third germ layer mesoderm also develops between them these germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs repeated instances of mating with a close relative during sexual reproduction generally leads to inbreeding depression within a population due to increased prevalence of harmful recessive traits animals have evolved numerous mechanisms for avoiding close inbreeding in some species such as splendid fairywren malurus splendens females benefit by mating with multiple males thus producing more offspring of higher genetic quality some animals are capable of asexual reproduction which often results in a genetic clone of parent this may take place through fragmentation budding such as in hydra and other cnidarians or parthenogenesis where fertile eggs are produced without mating such as in aphids ecology thumb upright right predators such as this ultramarine flycatcher superciliaris feed on other animals animals are categorised into ecological groups depending on how they obtain or consume organic material including carnivores herbivores omnivores detritivores and parasites interactions between animals form complex food webs in carnivorous or omnivorous species predation is a consumer resource interaction where a predator feeds on another organism called its prey selective pressures imposed on one another lead to an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey resulting in various anti predator adaptations almost all multicellular predators are animals some consumers use multiple methods for example in parasitoid wasps larvae feed on hosts living tissues killing them in process but adults primarily consume nectar from flowers other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours such as hawksbill sea turtles that primarily eat sponges thumb hydrothermal vent mussels and shrimps most animals rely on energy produced by plants through photosynthesis herbivores eat plant material directly while carnivores and other animals on higher trophic levels typically acquire energy in form of reduced carbon by eating other animals carbohydrates lipids proteins and other biomolecules are broken down to allow animal to grow and to sustain biological processes such as locomotion animals living close to hydrothermal vents and cold seeps on dark sea floor do not depend on energy of sunlight rather archaea and bacteria in these locations produce organic matter through chemosynthesis by oxidizing inorganic compounds such as methane and form base of local food web animals originally evolved in sea lineages of arthropods colonised land around same time as land plants probably between 510 471 million years ago during late cambrian or early ordovician vertebrates such as lobe finned fish tiktaalik started to move on to land in late devonian about 375 million years ago animals occupy virtually all of earth s habitats and microhabitats including salt water hydrothermal vents fresh water hot springs swamps forests pastures deserts air and interiors of animals plants fungi and rocks animals are however not particularly heat tolerant very few of them can survive at constant temperatures above only very few species of animals mostly nematodes inhabit most extreme cold deserts of continental antarctica diversity thumb blue whale is largest animal that has ever lived largest and smallest blue whale balaenoptera musculus is largest animal that has ever lived weighing up to 190 metric tonnes and measuring up to long largest extant terrestrial animal is african bush elephant loxodonta africana weighing up to 12 25 tonnes and measuring up to long largest terrestrial animals that ever lived were titanosaur sauropod dinosaurs such as argentinosaurus which may have weighed as much as 73 tonnes several animals are microscopic some myxozoa obligate parasites within cnidaria never grow larger than 20 um and one of smallest species myxobolus shekel is no more than 8 5 um when fully grown numbers and habitats following table lists estimated numbers of described extant species for animal groups with largest numbers of species along with their principal habitats terrestrial fresh water and marine and free living or parasitic ways of life species estimates shown here are based on numbers described scientifically much larger estimates have been calculated based on various means of prediction and these can vary wildly for instance around 25 000 27 000 species of nematodes have been described while published estimates of total number of nematode species include 10 000 20 000 500 000 10 million and 100 million using patterns within taxonomic hierarchy total number of animal species including those not yet described was calculated to be about 7 77 million in 2011 phylum example no land sea

from ediacaran biota c 635 542 mya is one of earliest animal species known first fossils that might represent animals appear in 665 million year old rocks of formation of south australia these fossils are interpreted as most probably being early sponges oldest animals are found in ediacaran biota towards end of precambrian around 610 million years ago it had long been doubtful whether these included animals but discovery of animal lipid cholesterol in fossils of dickinsonia establishes that these were indeed animals animals are thought to have originated under low oxygen conditions suggesting that they were capable of living entirely by anaerobic respiration but as they became specialized for aerobic metabolism they became fully dependent on oxygen in their environments thumb anomalocaris canadensis is one of many animal species that emerged in cambrian explosion starting some 542 million years ago and found in fossil beds of burgess shale many animal phyla first appear in fossil record during cambrian explosion starting about 542 million years ago in beds such as burgess shale extant phyla in these rocks include molluscs brachiopods onychophorans tardigrades arthropods echinoderms and along with numerous now extinct forms such as predatory anomalocaris apparent suddenness of event may however be an artefact of fossil record rather than showing that all these animals appeared simultaneously some palaeontologists have suggested that animals appeared much earlier than cambrian explosion possibly as early as 1 billion years ago trace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in tonian period may indicate presence of triploblastic worm like animals roughly as large about 5 mm wide and complex as earthworms however similar tracks are produced today by giant single celled protist so tonian trace fossils may not indicate early animal evolution around same time another line of evidence may indicate appearance of grazing animals layered mats of microorganisms called stromatolites decreased in diversity perhaps due to grazing phylogeny animals are monophyletic meaning they are derived from a common ancestor animals are sister to with which they form most basal animals porifera ctenophora cnidaria and placozoa have body plans that lack bilateral symmetry their relationships are still disputed sister group to all other animals could be porifera or ctenophora both of which lack hox genes important in body plan development these genes are found in placozoa and higher animals bilateria 6 331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago in precambrian 25 of these are novel core gene groups found only in animals of those 8 are for essential components of wnt and beta signalling pathways which may have enabled animals to become multicellular by providing a pattern for body s system of axes in three dimensions and another 7 are for transcription factors including proteins involved in control of development phylogenetic tree of major lineages only indicates approximately how many millions of years ago lineages split non bilaterian animals thumb upright right non bilaterians include sponges centre and corals background several animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry among these sponges porifera probably diverged first representing oldest animal phylum sponges lack complex organization found in most other animal phyla their cells are differentiated but in most cases not organised into distinct tissues they typically feed by drawing in water through pores ctenophora comb jellies and cnidaria which includes jellyfish sea anemones and corals are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening which serves as both mouth and anus animals in both phyla have distinct tissues but these are not organised into organs they are diploblastic having only two main germ layers ectoderm and endoderm tiny placozoans are similar but they do not have a permanent digestive chamber bilaterian animals thumb upright 1 7 left idealised bilaterian body plan with an elongated body and a direction of movement animal has head and tail ends sense organs and mouth form basis of head opposed circular and longitudinal muscles enable motion remaining animals great majority comprising some 29 phyla and over a million species form a clade bilateria body is triploblastic with three well developed germ layers and their tissues form distinct organs digestive chamber has two openings a mouth and an anus and there is an internal body cavity a coelom or pseudocoelom animals with this bilaterally symmetric body plan and a tendency to move in one direction have a head end anterior and a tail end posterior as well as a back dorsal and a belly ventral therefore they also have a left side and a right side having a front end means that this part of body encounters stimuli such as food favouring cephalisation development of a head with sense organs and a mouth many bilaterians have a combination of circular muscles that constrict body making it longer and an opposing set of longitudinal muscles that shorten body these enable soft bodied animals with a hydrostatic skeleton to move by peristalsis they also have a gut that extends through basically cylindrical body from mouth to anus many bilaterian phyla have primary larvae which swim with cilia and have an apical organ containing sensory cells however there are exceptions to each of these characteristics for example adult echinoderms are radially symmetric unlike their larvae while some parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures genetic studies have considerably changed zoologists understanding of relationships within bilateria most appear to belong to two major lineages protostomes and deuterostomes basalmost bilaterians are protostomes and deuterostomes thumb upright 1 3 right bilaterian gut develops in two ways in many protostomes develops into mouth while in deuterostomes it becomes anus protostomes and deuterostomes differ in several ways early in development deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division while many protostomes spiralia undergo spiral cleavage animals from both groups possess a complete digestive tract but in protostomes first opening of embryonic gut develops into mouth and anus forms secondarily in deuterostomes anus forms first while mouth develops secondarily most protostomes have development where cells simply fill in interior of gastrula to form mesoderm in deuterostomes mesoderm forms by through invagination of endoderm main deuterostome phyla are and chordata echinoderms are exclusively marine and include starfish sea urchins and sea cucumbers chordates are dominated by vertebrates animals with backbones which consist of fishes amphibians reptiles birds and mammals deuterostomes also include acorn worms ecdysozoa thumb upright ecdysis a dragonfly has emerged from its dry exuviae and is expanding its wings like other arthropods its body is divided into segments ecdysozoa are protostomes named after their shared trait of ecdysis growth by moulting they include largest animal phylum arthropoda which contains insects spiders crabs and their kin all of these have a body divided into repeating segments typically with paired appendages two smaller phyla onychophora and are close relatives of arthropods and share these traits also include nematoda or roundworms perhaps second largest animal phylum roundworms are typically microscopic and occur in nearly every environment where there is water some are important parasites smaller phyla related to them are or horsehair worms and and these groups have a reduced coelom called a pseudocoelom spiralia thumb left upright 1 6 spiral cleavage in a sea snail embryo spiralia are a large group of protostomes that develop by spiral cleavage in early embryo spiralia s phylogeny has been disputed but it contains a large clade superphylum lophotrochozoa and smaller groups of phyla such as which includes and flatworms all of these are grouped as which has a sister group which includes rotifers lophotrochozoa includes molluscs annelids brachiopods nemerteans bryozoa and entoprocts molluscs second largest animal phylum by number of described species includes snails clams and squids while annelids are segmented worms such as earthworms lugworms and leeches these two groups have long been considered close relatives because they share trochophore larvae history of classification thumb upright left jean baptiste de lamarck led creation of a modern classification of invertebrates breaking up linnaeus s vermes into 9 phyla by 1809 in classical era aristotle divided animals based on his own observations into those with blood roughly vertebrates and those without animals were then arranged on a scale from man with blood 2 legs rational soul down through live bearing tetrapods with blood 4 legs sensitive soul and other groups such as crustaceans no blood many legs sensitive soul down to spontaneously generating creatures like sponges no blood no legs vegetable soul aristotle was uncertain whether sponges were animals which in his system ought to have sensation appetite and locomotion or plants which did not he knew that sponges could sense touch and would contract if about to be pulled off their rocks but that they were rooted like plants and never moved about in 1758 carl linnaeus created first hierarchical classification in his systema naturae in his original scheme animals were one of three kingdoms divided into classes of vermes insecta pisces amphibia aves and mammalia since then last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum chordata while his insecta which included crustaceans and arachnids and vermes have been renamed or broken up process was begun in 1793 by jean baptiste de lamarck who called vermes une espece de chaos a chaotic mess and split group into three new phyla worms echinoderms and polyps which contained corals and jellyfish by 1809 in his philosophie zoologique lamarck had created 9 phyla apart from vertebrates where he still had 4 phyla mammals birds reptiles and fish and molluscs namely annelids crustaceans arachnids insects worms radiates polyps and in his 1817 le regne animal georges cuvier used comparative anatomy to group animals into four branches with different body plans roughly corresponding to phyla namely vertebrates molluscs articulated animals arthropods and annelids and zoophytes radiata echinoderms cnidaria and other forms this division into four was followed by embryologist karl ernst von baer in 1828 zoologist louis agassiz in 1857 and comparative anatomist richard owen in 1860 in 1874 ernst haeckel divided animal kingdom into two subkingdoms metazoa multicellular animals with five phyla echinoderms articulates molluscs and vertebrates and protozoa single celled animals including a sixth animal phylum sponges protozoa were later moved to former kingdom protista leaving only metazoa as a synonym of animalia in human culture thumb upright sides of beef in a slaughterhouse human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food both of domesticated livestock species in animal husbandry and mainly at sea by hunting wild species marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food a smaller number of species are farmed commercially invertebrates including cephalopods crustaceans and bivalve or gastropod molluscs are hunted or farmed for food chickens cattle sheep pigs and other animals are raised as livestock for meat across world animal fibres such as wool are used to make textiles while animal have been used as lashings and bindings and leather is widely used to make shoes and other items animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur to make items such as coats and hats including carmine cochineal shellac and kermes have been made from bodies of insects working animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from first days of agriculture animals such as fruit fly drosophila melanogaster serve a major role in science as experimental models animals have been used to create vaccines since their discovery in 18th century some medicines such as cancer drug are based on toxins or other molecules of animal origin thumb left a gun dog retrieving a duck during a hunt people have used hunting dogs to help chase down and retrieve animals and birds of prey to catch birds and mammals while tethered cormorants have been used to catch fish poison dart frogs have been used to poison tips of blowpipe darts a wide variety of animals are kept as pets from invertebrates such as tarantulas and octopuses insects including praying mantises reptiles such as snakes and chameleons and birds including canaries parakeets and parrots all finding a place however most kept pet species are mammals namely dogs cats and rabbits there is a tension between role of animals as companions to humans and their existence as individuals with rights of their own a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport thumb artistic vision still life with lobster and oysters by alexander c 1660 animals have been subjects of art from earliest times both
