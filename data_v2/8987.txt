battle of gang toi 8 november 1965 was fought during vietnam war between australian troops and viet cong battle was one of first engagements between two forces during war and occurred when a company 1st battalion royal australian regiment 1 rar struck a viet cong bunker system defended by company 238 in gang toi hills in northern bien hoa province it occurred during a major joint us australian operation codenamed operation hump involving us 173rd airborne brigade to which 1 rar was attached during latter part of operation an australian rifle company clashed with an entrenched company sized viet cong force in well prepared defensive positions meanwhile an american paratroop battalion was also heavily engaged in fighting on other side of song dong nai australians were unable to concentrate sufficient combat power to launch an assault on position and consequently they were forced to withdraw after a fierce engagement during which both sides suffered a number of casualties reluctantly leaving behind two men who had been shot and could not be recovered due to heavy machine gun and rifle fire although they were most likely dead a battalion attack to recover missing soldiers was planned by australians for next day but this was cancelled by american brigade commander due to rising casualties and need to utilise all available helicopters for casualty evacuation bodies of two missing australian soldiers were subsequently recovered more than 40 years later and were finally returned to australia for burial background military situation although initial american commitment to war in vietnam had been limited to advice and materiel support by 1964 there were 21 000 us advisors in south vietnam however with army of republic of vietnam arvn weakened by successive defeats at hands of communists south vietnamese government faltering and saigon threatened with a major offensive situation led to a significant escalation of war in 1965 with a large scale commitment of us ground troops under command of general william westmoreland at first americans had adopted a cautious strategy applied to strictly limited role of base defence by us marine units this was abandoned in april 1965 and replaced by a new enclave strategy of defending key coastal population centres and installations this strategy required introduction of nine additional us battalions or 14 000 troops to bring total in vietnam to 13 allied nations of free world military forces were expected to contribute another four battalions thumb 260px left iii ctz may to september 1965 alt a map illustrating locations referred to in text westmoreland planned to develop a series of defensive positions around saigon before expanding operations to pacify south vietnamese countryside and as a result a number of sites close to viet cong dominated areas were subsequently chosen to be developed into semi permanent divisional level bases such areas included di an which was intended to become headquarters of us 1st infantry division while us 25th infantry division would be based in vicinity of cu chi however large scale military operations to clear intended base areas had to wait until dry season yet allied enclave strategy proved only transitory and further setbacks led to additional troop increases to halt losing trend with situation reaching a crisis point during viet cong wet season offensive in june 1965 westmoreland requested further reinforcement and us and allied forces increased to 44 battalions which would be used to directly bolster arvn australia s growing involvement in vietnam reflected american build up in 1963 australian government had committed a small advisory team known as australian army training team vietnam aattv to help train south vietnamese forces however in june 1965 decision to commit ground troops was made and 1st battalion royal australian regiment originally commanded by lieutenant colonel ivan lou brumfield was dispatched supporting 1 rar was 1 troop a squadron 4th 19th prince of wales s light horse equipped with m113 armored personnel carriers artillery from 105th field battery royal australian artillery and 161st battery royal new zealand artillery and 161st reconnaissance flight operating cessna 180s and bell h 13 sioux light observation helicopters in total 1 400 personnel australian units and new zealand artillery were attached to us 173rd airborne brigade under command of brigadier general ellis w williamson in bien hoa and operated throughout iii corps tactical zone iii ctz to help establish bien hoa vung tau enclave although logistics and resupply were primarily provided by americans a small logistic unit 1st australian logistics company was situated at bien hoa airbase unlike later australian units that served in vietnam which included conscripts 1 rar was manned by regular personnel only attached to us forces 1 rar was primarily employed in search and destroy operations using newly developed doctrine of airmobile operations utilising helicopters to insert light infantry and artillery into an area of operations and to support them with aerial mobility fire support casualty evacuation and resupply battalion commenced operations in late june 1965 and initially focussed on defeating viet cong s wet season offensive during this time us 173rd brigade including 1 rar conducted a number of operations into war zone d a major communist base area at junction of phuoc long long khanh bien hoa and binh duong provinces as well as in iron triangle in november prelude opposing forces by late 1965 junction of song be and song dong nai rivers had become a major communist staging area for men equipment and supplies for units based around saigon and mekong delta communist communications and resupply routes between war zone c and d also met ho chi minh trail in this area westmoreland planned to use us 173rd airborne brigade to keep viet cong off balance and to target their base areas and consequently a search and destroy operation codenamed operation hump was planned operation hump marked half way point in twelve month tour of duty of us 173rd airborne brigade and was named accordingly concept of operations envisioned 1 rar and 1st battalion us 503rd infantry regiment being inserted by helicopter during an airmobile operation into war zone d in an area about north east of us airbase at bien hoa australian and american area of operations ao was to be separated by song dong nai with 1 rar to deploy into a landing zone lz to south while us 1 503rd battalion would conduct a helicopter assault onto a lz northwest of song dong nai and song be meanwhile us 173rd airborne brigade s second battalion 2nd battalion us 503rd infantry regiment would be left to defend bien hoa airbase area was thought to be a viet cong stronghold and american intelligence initially identified main force regiment and main force battalion as being nearby however unknown to allied force viet cong 9th division had likely received forewarning of operation and had deployed one of its most experienced regiments supported by a number of local force battalions determined for a test of allied strength 271 vc main force regiment also known as main force regiment subsequently took up defensive positions in area while communist u1 headquarters protected by company 238 was situated on plateau atop gang toi hills in an area which formed part of 1 rar s objective u1 was responsible for co ordinating viet cong regional defence against bien hoa air base and for developing anti government resistance and had been tasked with rebuilding covert organisation in bien hoa city and surrounding villages up to dong nai as well as re establishing link between bien hoa city and war zone d and for planning and executing attacks against air base itself yet having relocated to rainforest two months earlier its presence was also unknown to australians and americans regardless a company 1 rar was scheduled to conduct a search of plateau on fourth day of operation battle insertion and patrolling 5 7 november 1965 thumb 300px right battle of gang toi 8 november 1965 alt a map illustrating locations referred to in text on 5 november 1 rar began routine search and destroy operation inserting by helicopter south of song dong nai at 08 00 while us 1 503rd battalion was inserted onto lz king north west of song dong nai and song be rivers at 11 00 operation started badly for australians and americans with fly in delayed despite a lengthy preparation by fire a large viet cong force had been observed in vicinity of lz queen prior to insertion of lead australian rifle company d company under command of captain peter rothwell escorting helicopter gunships began taking small arms fire as they attempted to provide suppressing fire and rothwell made decision to activate alternate landing zone to north east lz princess d company was subsequently inserted safely and swept back to lz queen securing it for remainder of battalion by mid morning 1 rar occupied lz queen with 105 mm l5 pack howitzers of 105 field battery also flying in to provide direct support augmenting australian gunners us 3 319 artillery battalion and 161st battery royal new zealand artillery occupied fsb ace further south scheme of manoeuvre adopted by 1 rar dictated that each company undertake a dispersed patrol program in their own tactical area of responsibility a fact which would allow them to search more ground but limit their ability to concentrate combat power in event of contact a company under major john healy patrolled east b company moved north along song be to while d company patrolled south c company remained at lz queen to protect 105 field battery which had established a fire support base fsb over next two days australians patrolled relentlessly through leech infested swamps and dense jungle at midday on 6 november a company received two mortar rounds which failed to do any damage but marked start of a series of minor clashes a company had a number of contacts during this time with australians killing a viet cong scout for loss of two wounded in one skirmish a further contact soon after resulted in two more viet cong killed and one wounded intelligence gained from these incidents indicated presence of a viet cong main force regiment in area while documents recovered contained plans for attacks on arvn outposts near bien hoa airbase by nightfall on 7 november despite earlier contacts no major actions had occurred in australian ao with rifle companies now several kilometres apart a company had patrolled into a network of well used roads and tracks that formed part of a branch of ho chi minh trail healy s men spent night astride tracks and would resume patrolling following day along a track which led to hill 82 meanwhile although unknown to them at time us 1 503rd battalion across song dong nai had patrolled to within of a major viet cong bunker system sited on two spur lines in vicinity of hill 65 hill 82 8 november 1965 brumfield arrived by helicopter on morning of 8 november just as a company was preparing to depart from its night location at 08 00 with contact now seeming unlikely to australians healy was instructed to move to a rendezvous from which battalion would be extracted back to bien hoa following day a company subsequently set out on a compass bearing which would take them across northern edge of gang toi plateau by 10 30 australians moved out in single file but had not gone far before a lone viet cong scout was observed shadowing them he was subsequently shot and killed by rear section crossing a creek line australians uncovered a company sized camp of dugouts and trenches before being fired upon at 15 40 by a single viet cong soldier who then fled a company halted briefly and at this time two viet cong approached their position before being killed by 1 platoon australians continued in single file towards top of plateau with 1 platoon under sergeant gordon peterson leading followed by 2 and then 3 platoon going was slow in dense jungle and visibility was limited by 16 30 lead section was nearing top of hill having gone just while last platoon 3 platoon was still leaving harbour suddenly 1 platoon was hit by heavy small arms fire from at least three viet cong machine guns in well sited bunkers supported by rifles and grenades fire engulfed lead section and platoon headquarters causing five casualties in opening minute pinned down australians went to ground and began returning fire allowing all except one of wounded to crawl to safety private richard parker who had fallen directly in front of bunker system was unable to be recovered failing to respond to shouts of his comrades parker was exposed to further hits although was probably already dead to support beleaguered platoon healy subsequently ordered support section from company headquarters to move forward to provide covering fire while 3 platoon moved up on left flank however due to dispersed patrolling plan adopted remaining companies were unable to provide any assistance still at bottom of hill 3 platoon under second lieutenant clive williams had just shot and killed two viet cong moving along creek line reaching top of hill to left of company headquarters williams turned to right towards viet cong positions moving into extended line on a front australians had advanced just before left flank was engaged by a number of machine guns from another sector of viet cong position in danger of being outflanked 3 platoon continued to advance regardless using fire and movement just from bunkers private peter gillson machine gunner in forward section was shot as he tried to move around twisted roots of a tall tree as he fell two viet cong rushed forward to take m60 machine gun however gillson was still conscious and they were killed at point blank range before he collapsed williams radioed healy of increasing danger while his platoon sergeant sergeant colin fawcett had crawled forward under heavy fire to gillson whose body was wedged in buttress of a large tree unable to find a pulse fawcett attempted to extract gillson but was unable to do so due to heavy fire two other attempts to recover body were also beaten back and although unsuccessful fawcett was later awarded military medal for his actions taking heavy fire from both front and flanks williams had little choice but to withdraw with viet cong moving rapidly to encircle them and unable to move forward australians had to fight using small arms fire and grenades to extract themselves back to company headquarters without further casualties however by this time artillery was beginning to have an impact as a company s forward observer captain bruce murphy a new zealander directed fires australians had unavoidably been placed in worst possible position to their supporting artillery with 105 battery firing on a line directly towards them from their gun line on other side of gang toi plateau consequently murphy was unable to observe fall of shot and had to walk rounds onto target by sound a slight miscalculation could have sent a round over hill into australian positions regardless and despite persistent rifle and machine gun fire murphy calmly directed artillery throughout battle for his skill and bravery he was later awarded military cross by 18 30 more than two hours since fighting began darkness was approaching battalion would be unable to concentrate against viet cong position until following day and healy subsequently made decision to withdraw with artillery falling as close as possible weight of indirect fires provided australians with a degree of protection and an opportunity to extricate themselves lieutenant ian guild s 2 platoon was subsequently moved into position to cover withdrawal and carrying their wounded australians successfully broke contact without suffering further losses a company initially moved to a landing zone below ridgeline which had been cleared to allow casualties to be evacuated yet there were no helicopters available as a result australians had to look after their casualties until following morning and they proceeded further north to a night harbour as area was pounded by artillery aerial bombing and helicopter gunships healy assessed that his company had encountered a force of at least company size later it became apparent that they had indeed contacted company 238 which was tasked with protecting u1 headquarters and to carry out operations in bien hoa region throughout day viet cong reconnaissance parties perhaps including those that had been contacted intermittently had observed approaching australian force on a line leading directly to u1 headquarters during fighting viet cong company commander nguyen van bao had split his force into two allocating one platoon to fight advancing australians and other two to protect headquarters following australian withdrawal van bao had also withdrawn pre empting ensuing barrage yet u1 base remained in communist hands fighting across song dong nai thumb right 170px us paratroopers under heavy fire during operation hump alt a soldier laying prone on ground with his back to camera through broken foliage and smoke other soldiers can be seen meanwhile across river in american ao us 1 503rd battalion had uncovered a large viet cong bunker system and became involved in fierce fighting that had included desperate hand to hand combat with both sides resorting to using bayonets throughout morning australians had heard increasing crescendo of firing as battle raged however as neither they nor us 2 503rd battalion had been called on to reinforce us 1 503rd battalion they had pressed on american paratroopers had contacted a well equipped viet cong main force regiment complete with khaki uniforms steel helmets and soviet automatic weaponry and small arms fighting across song dong nai continued into afternoon before subsiding into sporadic sniper and small arms fire in later afternoon and early evening during fighting specialist lawrence joel a medic distinguished himself tending to his wounded comrades while under heavy fire he was subsequently awarded medal of honor brumfield demanded right to return to hill 82 in order to destroy bunker system and to recover bodies of parker and gillson and he and major john essex clark operations officer began planning a battalion attack however with american casualties rising and all available helicopters required for casualty evacuation planned operation was cancelled thick jungle canopy compounded issue and williamson decided to stage casualties through an area secured by australians at lz princess operation hump concluded on 9 november with us 1 503rd battalion and 1 rar being extracted by helicopter and returning to bien hoa in late afternoon following 1 rar s return to bien hoa brumfield continued to petition for permission to conduct operation a battalion attack was subsequently planned for 14 november but williamson later deferred it dependent on availability of air and helicopter support and start date of upcoming operation new life ultimately it was never conducted aftermath casualties battle of gang toi was first set piece action between australian and viet cong forces in vietnam war australian casualties included two missing presumed killed and six wounded and despite efforts of their comrades bodies of australian dead were unable to be recovered against these losses viet cong had suffered at least six killed one wounded and five captured confronted by an equal sized force dug in in well prepared defences australians had performed creditably enough even if they had been forced to withdraw leaving battlefield to viet cong despite inflicting heavier casualties on communists than they had suffered themselves many of australians were depressed at having left two soldiers behind and they longed for opportunity to return to gang toi in 2007 more than 40 years after fighting an australian vietnam veteran jim bourke mg and a team of volunteers successfully located remains of both parker and gillson they had been hastily buried together in a weapon pit day after battle by viet cong soldiers and with assistance of australian and vietnamese governments they were subsequently returned to australia for burial assessment although a company 1 rar had been mauled experience of australians at gang toi was relatively minor when compared to that of americans during fierce fighting us 1 503rd battalion had suffered 40 killed and 51 wounded while more than 400 viet cong were believed killed american claims were later raised to over 700 killed when captured documents revealed losses caused by artillery and air strikes yet it was questionable as to whether such battles of attrition would be viable while equally american battalion had taken casualties far beyond what would have been politically acceptable for 1 rar indeed their losses had been significant and although claimed as a victory americans had failed to secure area even if viet cong had temporarily surrendered control of battlefield ultimately communists continued to use bien hoa area as a major supply route for rest of war brumfield considered operation hump to be least successful operation in which australian battalion had participated and he criticised it as being badly conceived from start and mounted with too little intelligence or prior reconnaissance indeed from initial landing zone being occupied by viet cong failures in passage of information heavy losses suffered by us 1 503rd battalion and subsequent difficulties with casualty evacuation operation had not run smoothly australians were vengeful for their losses and wanted to return to collect their dead however with 1 rar absorbed into other operations planned battalion attack on hill 82 never occurred regardless further operations followed in months afterwards with 1 rar subsequently employed on operation new life in november and december and later operation crimp in ho bo woods in january 1966 operation hump was brumfield s last with an old football injury forcing his evacuation to australia in mid november he was subsequently replaced by lieutenant colonel alex preece subsequent operations at strategic level arvn and south vietnamese government had both rallied after appearing on verge of collapse and communist threat against saigon had subsided yet additional troop increases were required if westmoreland was to adopt a more offensive strategy with us troop levels planned to rise from 210 000 in january 1966 to 327 000 by december 1966 australian government increased its own commitment to ground war in march 1966 announcing deployment of a two battalion brigade 1st australian task force 1 atf with armour aviation engineer and artillery support in total 4 500 men additional royal australian air force raaf and royal australian navy ran force elements would also be deployed and with all three services total australian strength in vietnam was planned to increase to 6 300 personnel 1 rar was subsequently replaced by 1 atf which was allocated its own area of operations in phuoc tuy province thereby allowing australians to pursue operations more independently using their own counter insurgency tactics and techniques task force arrived between april and june 1966 constructing a base at nui dat while logistic arrangements were provided by 1st australian logistic support
