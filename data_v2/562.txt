tischendorf s contact making claim at least plausible simonides also claimed his father had died and invitation to mt athos came from his uncle a monk there but subsequent letters to his father were found among his possessions at his death while word forgery has been bandied about among scholars regarding claims on sinaiticus by tischendorf perhaps a more accurate rendering would be and adjusted

fragments of 3 leaves in russian national library in saint petersburg saint catherine s monastery still maintains importance of a letter handwritten in 1844 with an original signature of tischendorf confirming that he borrowed those leaves o sinaitikos kodikas however recently published documents including a deed of gift dated 11 september 1868 and signed by archbishop and monks of monastery indicate that manuscript was acquired entirely legitimately istoriia v svete iz a v issledovaniia po i i moskva s 2007 209 266 this deed which agrees with a report by kurt aland on matter has now been published unfortunately this development is not widely known in english speaking world as only german and russian language media reported on it in 2009 doubts as to legality of gift arose because when tischendorf originally removed manuscript from saint catherine s monastery in september 1859 monastery was without an archbishop so that even though intention to present manuscript to tsar had been expressed no legal gift could be made at time resolution of matter was delayed through turbulent reign of archbishop cyril consecrated 7 december 1859 deposed 24 august 1866 and situation only formalised after restoration of peace skeat in his article last chapter in history of codex sinaiticus concluded in this way this is not place to pass judgements but perhaps i may say that as it seems to me both monks and tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude tischendorf for having alerted monks to importance of manuscript and monks for having undertaken daunting task of searching through vast mass of material with such spectacular results and then doing everything in their power to safeguard manuscript against further loss if we accept statement of uspensky that he saw codex in 1845 monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up results in so short a period skeat t c 2000 last chapter in history of codex sinaiticus novum testamentum vol 42 fasc 3 jul 2000 p 315 impact on biblical scholarship along with codex vaticanus codex sinaiticus is considered one of most valuable manuscripts available as it is one of oldest and likely closer to original text of greek new testament it is only uncial manuscript with complete text of new testament and only ancient manuscript of new testament written in four columns per page which has survived to present day with only 300 years separating codex sinaiticus and proposed lifetime of jesus it is considered by some to be more accurate than most new testament copies in preserving readings where almost all manuscripts are assumed by them to be in error for gospels sinaiticus is considered among some people as second most reliable witness of text after vaticanus in acts of apostles its text is equal to that of vaticanus in epistles sinaiticus is assumed to be most reliable witness of text in book of revelation however its text is corrupted and is considered of poor quality and inferior to texts of codex alexandrinus
