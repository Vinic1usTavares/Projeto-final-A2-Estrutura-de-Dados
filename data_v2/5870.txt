e c row expressway is a municipal expressway in city of windsor ontario canada it divides city in half as it crosses it between ojibway parkway in west and banwell road in east a distance of it was built between 1971 and 1983 reaching completion across city on june 9 1983 it was part of highway 2 and highway 18 until province transferred ownership and responsibility for route to city of windsor on april 1 1997 in 2015 westernmost was significantly upgraded as part of highway 401 extension herb gray parkway project freeway is named after edward charles row president of chrysler canada between 1951 and 1956 while allowing for easy travel across city e c row expressway was isolated for much of its existence as it did not connect directly to united states nor highway 401 drivers had to access ambassador bridge via huron church road or detroit windsor tunnel via dougall parkway both surface streets were also needed to reach highway 401 this situation is being rectified from 2011 onward as expressway s western terminus is located at port of entry for gordie howe international bridge scheduled for completion in 2024 dave gordie howe bridge to cost 5 7b open in 2024 windsor star september 28 2018 with slip ramps to access bridge bound portion of highway 401 route description e c row expressway is a route with a speed limit of it begins at a signalized intersection with ojibway parkway curving gently from northeastward to eastward it travels east northeast as a four lane fully controlled access freeway with a grass median and grade separated interchanges thumb left e c row facing west at huron church road prior to construction of herb gray parkway after crossing matchette road where ramps provide access to and from eastbound and westbound lanes of expressway respectively opposing lanes of expressway split to south of malden park eastbound lanes diverge south and cross herb gray parkway sandwiching it between e c row expressway slip ramps provide access between two parallel freeways before parkway diverges and travels under eastbound carriageway of e c row to west of huron church road expressway curves east northeast and crosses huron church and becomes sandwiched between residential subdivisions after interchanges with dominion boulevard and dougall avenue route crosses canadian national cn caso subdivision railway lines and briefly passes through an industrial area highway quickly meets another interchange at howard avenue where it also crosses turkey creek and former alignment of grand marais road southeast of this interchange is devonshire mall while to north are low density commercial units east of interchange e c row once again travels between residential subdivisions to north lies remington park while to south is devonshire heights crossing into at a diamond interchange with walker road highway becomes surrounded by a business park walker road interchange also connects with central avenue interchange now north of windsor airport

zoning eventually transitions to agricultural fields and e c row expressway curves northeast and intersects banwell road at grade east of banwell road road continues as pike creek bypass former highway 2 history history of e c row expressway dates back to january 1963 when city of windsor and department of highways released a report called windsor area transportation study wats one of primary issues identified by study was a limited and inadequate street network in east west direction generally resulting from several railway barriers properties were purchased along e c row avenue named in 1956 after retiring president of chrysler canada 1951 1956 ohio born e c row and third concession within sandwich township beginning in 1958 for what was then intended as a two lane road linking highway 18 with highway 39 which became highway 2 in 1970 however with release of wats and subsequent amalgamation in 1966 in which windsor annexed portions of surrounding townships plans for an expressway along corridor were first conceived original plans for expressway dating back to 1969 were for it to travel from current county road 22 heading west along southern edge of belle river and tecumseh meeting up with current two lane freeway alignment pike creek bypass just east of puce as well as having west end continue south through lasalle to north of amherstburg first stage of construction began in 1970 to bridge two sections of e c row avenue over cn railway line between dougall avenue then highway 3b and howard avenue a former alignment of highway 2 this work was completed in 1973 in 1976 contracts were awarded to extend new divided expressway east to walker avenue at request of ford motor company of canada construction on expressway was soon accelerated by early 1980 existing construction contracts were completed and work began to connect expressway between huron church road and dougall avenue construction of a two laned extension west to connect with ojibway parkway highway 18 began by end of that year by april 1982 four laned expressway was complete between huron church road and east of lauzon parkway connecting with highway 2 as a two lane expressway at banwell road in east and with ojibway parkway via a two lane expressway west of huron church road following this highway 2 was rerouted west of banwell road off road to instead travel along expressway while highway 18 was rerouted off sandwich street to follow expressway both then followed highway 3 along huron church road to ambassador bridge construction stalled for several years as funding was diverted from project during a recession in early 1980s it would take until 1987 for work to resume to replace at grade intersections at matchette road malden road huron church road and dominion boulevard city of windsor nevertheless earmarked funding from their budget to build last two of those interchanges in late 1986 province later stepped in to provide a share of funding in march 1987 and work began with contracts being awarded for construction on august 26 and september 16 of that year for interchanges at dominion boulevard and huron church road respectively city of windsor also negotiated with province for funding of an interchange at matchette road in late april of that year which was approved by september 1 on september 29 1988 huron church road and dominion boulevard interchanges were opened to traffic work began in october 1989 to twin existing two laned route between ojibway parkway and huron church road by building a second parallel roadway to serve as eastbound lanes construction of a partial interchange at matchette road as well as an overpass of malden road was included in this project which was completed in september 1990 project to complete expressway in east by twinning route between lauzon parkway and windsor boundary east of banwell road began immediately after it was completed in late 1991 overall cost of expressway between ojibway parkway and banwell road originally estimated in 1967 at 55 million was 115 million out of which province contributed 94 million planning subsequently began to extend expressway east to manning road along existing two lane pike creek bypass however budget constraints brought on by a recession in early 1990s resulted in mike harris provincial government forming who does what committee to determine cost cutting measures in order to balance budget after a deficit incurred under premier bob rae it was determined that many ontario highways no longer served long distance traffic movement and should therefore be maintained by local or regional levels of government mto consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998 removing a significant percentage of provincial highway network as e c row expressway was designed to serve commuter traffic in windsor and not province wide movement route was transferred to city of windsor on april 1 1997 no work has progressed on extension since beginning in 2011 e c row expressway west of huron church road underwent a complete reconstruction as part of 1 4 billion herb gray parkway project which included a major realignment of of eastbound highway between matchette road and huron church road to allow for an extension of highway 401 to travel within their median project was completed on november 21 2015 and allows e c row traffic to connect with bridge bound portion of highway 401 via slip ramps located east of machete road e c row still lacks direct access to london bound portion of highway 401 however completion of phase one of highway 401 extension herb gray parkway means that indirect connection using huron church road has been reduced to a short distance with one traffic light between parclo a4 interchange with e c row and slip ramps with highway 401 in 2015 construction began on widening and expansion of e c row s eastern extension county road 22 highway was widened to four lanes from banwell road to e puce road county road 25 in puce as of 2018 this project has been completed and includes a roundabout at intersection of county road 22 and old tecumseh road exit list see also list
