order embioptera commonly known as webspinners or are a small group of mostly tropical and subtropical insects classified under subclass order has also been called or embiidina more than 400 species in 11 families have been described oldest known fossils of group being from mid jurassic species are very similar in appearance having long flexible bodies short legs and only males having wings webspinners are gregarious living in galleries of fine silk which they spin from glands on their forelegs members of these colonies are often related females and their offspring males do not feed and die soon after mating males of some species have wings and are able to disperse whereas females remain near where they were hatched newly mated females may vacate colony and found a new one nearby others may emerge to search for a new food source to which galleries can be extended but in general insects rarely venture from their galleries name and etymology name embioptera lively wings comes from greek meaning lively and meaning wing a name that has not been considered to be particularly descriptive for this group of fliers perhaps instead referring to their remarkable speed of movement both forward and backward common name webspinner comes from insects unique tarsi on their front legs which produce multiple strands of silk they use silk to make web like galleries in which they live early entomologists considered webspinners to be a group within termites or and a variety of group names have been suggested including and in 1909 gunther used name embiidina which was used widely for a while edward s ross suggested a new name in 2007 currently most widely accepted ordinal name is embioptera suggested by arthur shipley in 1904 evolution fossil history fossils of webspinners are rare group probably first appeared during jurassic oldest known rossi and ningchengensis both in a new family created for them are from middle jurassic of inner mongolia and were described in 2009 female of j ningchengensis had wings supporting ross s proposal that both sexes of ancestral embioptera were winged species such as possibly first fossil member of clothodidae to be discovered sometimes thought to be a primitive family have been found in mid cretaceous amber from northern myanmar delicatus oligotomidae has been found in same locality largest number of fossils have been found in mid eocene baltic amber and early miocene dominican amber flattened compression fossils that have been interpreted as being webspinners have been found from eocene oligocene shales of florissant colorado phylogeny over 400 embiopteran species in 11 families have been described worldwide largest proportion of which inhabit tropical regions it is estimated that there may be around 2000 species extant today external phylogeny of embioptera has been debated with order controversially classed in 2007 as a sister group to both angel insects and phasmatodea stick insects position of embioptera within polyneoptera suggested by a phylogenetic analysis carried out in 2012 by miller et al combining morphological and molecular evidence is shown in cladogram internal phylogeny of group is not yet fully resolved miller et al s phylogenetic analysis examined 96 morphological characters and 5 genes for 82 species across order four families were found to be robustly monophyletic in whatever way phylogeny was analysed parsimony maximum likelihood or bayesian clothodidae oligotomidae and and australembiidae remain monophyletic in one or more of three analyses but are broken up in others so their status remains uncertain either clothodidae under parsimony analysis or australembiidae under bayesian analysis is sister taxon to remaining embioptera taxa so no single phylogenetic tree can be taken as definitive from this work description thumb upright 2 0 left drawings of major winged male male nymph and adult female from himalayas by augustus daniel 1913 all webspinners have a remarkably similar body form although they do vary in coloration and size majority are brown or black ranging to pink or reddish shades in some species and range in length from body form of these insects is completely specialised for silk tunnels and chambers in which they reside being cylindrical long narrow and highly flexible head has projecting mouthparts with chewing mandibles compound eyes are kidney shaped there are no ocelli and thread like antennae are long with up to 32 segments antennae are flexible so they do not become entangled in silk and wings have a crosswise crease allowing them to fold forwards and enable male to dart backwards without wings snagging fabric first segment of thorax is small and narrow while second and third are larger and broader especially in males where they include flight muscles all females and nymphs are wingless whereas adult males can be either winged or wingless depending on species wings where present occur as two pairs that are similar in size and shape long and narrow with relatively simple venation these wings operate using basic hydraulics pre flight chambers sinus veins within wings inflate with hemolymph blood making them rigid enough for use on landing these chambers deflate and wings become flexible folding back against body wings can also fold forwards over body and this along with flexibility allows easy movement through narrow silk galleries either forwards or backwards without resulting in damage thumb upright 1 5 male s wings are stiffened and inflated as hemolymph fills sinus veins for flight a crosswise crease allows them to fold in half to prevent damage when insect runs backwards in a gallery in both males and females legs are short and sturdy with an enlarged basal on front pair containing silk producing glands mid and hind legs also have three tarsal segments with hind femur enlarged to house strong tibial depressor muscles that enable rapid reverse movement it is these silk glands on front tarsi that distinguish embiopterans other noteworthy characteristics of this group include three jointed tarsi simple wing venation with few cross veins prognathous head with forward facing mouthparts and absence of ocelli simple eyes abdomen has ten segments with a pair of cerci on final segment these cerci made up of two segments and asymmetric in length especially in males are highly sensitive to touch and allow animal to navigate while moving backwards through gallery tunnels which are too narrow to allow insect to turn round because morphology is so similar between taxa species identification is extremely difficult for this reason main form of taxonomic identification used in past has been close observation of distinctive copulatory structures of males although this method is now thought by some entomologists and taxonomists as giving insufficient classification detail although males never eat during their adult stage they do have mouthparts similar to those of females these mouthparts are used to hold onto female during copulation life cycle eggs hatch into nymphs that resemble small wingless adults after a short period of parental care nymphs undergo incomplete metamorphosis moulting a total of four times before reaching adult form adult males never eat and leave home colony almost immediately to find a female and mate those males that cannot fly often mate with females in nearby colonies meaning their chosen mates are often siblings or close relatives in some species female eats male after mating but in any event male does not survive for long a few species are parthenogenetic meaning they can produce viable offspring without fertilisation of eggs this phenomenon occurs when a female is for whatever reason unable to find a male to mate with thus giving her and her species reproductive security at all times after moulting and mating female lays a single batch of eggs either within existing gallery or wanders away to start a new colony elsewhere because females are flightless their potential for dispersal is limited to distance a female can walk behaviour and ecology behaviour most if not all embiopteran species are gregarious but typically adult females show maternal care of their eggs and young and often live in large colonies with other adult females creating and sharing webbing cover that helps to protect them against predators advantages of living in these colonies outweigh disadvantage that results from increased parasite load that this lifestyle entails although some species breed once a year or even once in two years others breed more frequently with aposthonia ceylonica producing four or five batches of eggs in a twelve month period maternal care starts with placement of eggs some species attach batches of eggs to web structure with silk others form eggs into rows in grooves excavated in bark others fix them in rows with a cement formed from saliva while many species bury them in a mass of silk even incorporating other materials into covering majority of embiopterans guard their eggs some actually standing over them main exception being species such as calypso that scatter their eggs widely main threat to eggs is from egg parasitoids which can attack whole batches of undefended eggs at this time adult females become very territorial and aggressive to other individuals with whom they previously lived in harmony three different types of vibratory signals are used to deter other embiopterans that approach eggs too closely and intruder usually retires after eggs have hatched mothers resume their gregarious behaviour in some species they continue caring for their young for several days after hatching and in a few this parental care even involves female feeding nymphs with portions of chewed up leaf litter and other foods parthenogenetic virgo incorporates scraps of lichen into silk wrapping eggs and this may be eaten by newly hatched nymphs perhaps because individuals of this species are so closely related adults spin silk together and move around in coordinated groups even in species that provide no further parental care nymphs in colony benefit from greater silk producing power of adults and extra protection that more copious silk covering brings is a trade off for female as energy and time that is exerted in caring for her young is rewarded by giving them a much greater chance of surviving and carrying on her genetic lineage some species do share galleries with more than one adult however most groups consist of one adult female and her offspring when webspinners clean their antennae they may differ in their behavior from other insects which typically make use of forelegs to either clean or bring antennae toward mouthparts for manipulation webspinners as observed in genus instead fold antennae under body and clean antennae as they are held between mouthparts and substrate when constructing their silken galleries webspinners use characteristic cyclic movements of their forelegs alternating actions with left and right legs while also moving there are variations in choreography of these movements across species silk web production embiopterans produce a silk thread similar to that produced by silkworm bombyx mori silk is produced in spherical secretory glands in swollen tarsi lower leg segments of forelimbs and can be produced by both adults and larvae unlike bombyx mori and other silk producing and spinning members of both lepidoptera and hymenoptera which only have one pair of silk glands per individual some species of embiid are estimated to have up to 300 silk glands 150 in each forelimb these glands are linked to a bristle like cuticular process known as a silk ejector and their exceedingly high numbers allow individuals to spin large amounts of silk very quickly creating extensive galleries silk web is produced throughout all stages of embiopteran lifespan and requires modest energy output webspinner silk is among thinnest of all animal silks being in most species about 90 to 100 nanometres in diameter finest of any insect are those of webspinner aposthonia averaging about 65 nanometres in diameter each thread consists of a protein core folded into pleated beta sheets with a water repellent coating rich in waxy alkanes galleries thumb adult female in gallery thumb web on a stone wall galleries produced by embiopterans are tunnels and chambers woven from silk they produce these woven constructions can be found on substrates such as rocks and bark of trees or in leaf litter some species camouflage their galleries by decorating outer layers with bits of leaf litter or other materials to match their surroundings galleries are essential to their life cycle maintaining moisture in their environment and also offering protection from predators and elements while foraging breeding and simply existing embiopterans only leave gallery complex in search of a mate or when females explore immediate area in search of a new food source webspinners continually extend their galleries to reach new food sources and expand their existing galleries as they grow in size insects spin silk by moving their forelegs back and forth over substrate and rotating their bodies to create a cylindrical silk lined tunnel older galleries have multiple laminate layers of silk each gallery complex contains several individuals often descended from a single female and forms a maze like structure extending from a secure retreat into whatever vegetable food matter is available nearby size and complexity of colony vary between species and they can be very extensive in those species that live in hot and humid climates diet embiopteran diet varies between species with available food sources changing with varying habitat nymphs and adult females feed on plant litter bark moss algae and lichen they are generalist herbivores during his research ross maintained a number of species in laboratory on a diet of lettuce and dry oak leaves adult males do not eat at all so they die of starvation soon after mating parasites and predators are a small family of aculeate wasps that are specialist parasites of embiopterans wasp lays an egg on abdomen of a nymph wasp larva emerges and attaches itself to host s body consuming host s tissues as it grows it eventually forms a cocoon and drops off carcass a neotropical tachinid fly and a braconid wasp species in genus are known to be parasitoids of adult embioptera a few wasps in tribe are egg parasitoids of embioptera a protozoan parasite in italy effectively males forcing remaining female population to become parthenogenetic these parasites and agents of disease may put evolutionary pressure on embiopterans to live more socially adult webspinners are vulnerable when they emerge from their galleries and are preyed on by birds geckos ants and spiders they have been observed being attacked by larvae birds may pull sheets of silk off galleries to expose their prey ants may cut holes to gain entry and harvestmen may pierce silk to feed on webspinners inside associates another group of associates inside galleries are bugs in family whether these are feeding on embiopteran eggs or larvae on mites and other residents of gallery or are scavenging is unclear embiopteran aposthonia ceylonica has been found living inside a colony of indian cooperative spider probably feeding on algae growing on spider sheetweb and two webspinner species have been discovered living in outer covering of termites nests where their silk galleries may protect them from attack distribution and habitat embiopterans are distributed worldwide and are found on every continent except antarctica with highest density and diversity of species being in tropical regions some common species have been accidentally transported to other parts of world while many native species are unobtrusive and yet to be detected some species live underground or concealed under rocks or behind sections of loose bark others live out in open either swathed in sheets of white or blue silk or hidden in less conspicuous silken tubes on ground on trunks of trees or on surface of granite rocks largely restricted to warmer locations webspinners are found as far north as state of virginia in united states 38degn and as high as in ecuador they were absent from britain until 2019 when aposthonia ceylonica a southeast asian species was found in a glasshouse at rhs garden wisley references further reading world list of extant and fossil
