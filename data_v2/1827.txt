it took over 10 years to record i m looking for perfect timing to release it musical style x japan s music developed in wake of american and british glam and heavy metal music and is characterized by driving speed power metal compositions with symphonic elements e g kurenai silent jealousy and emotional ballads e g endless rain forever love many of group s songs make use of orchestrated passages particularly on longer tracks such as ten and a half minute tears crucify my love and twenty nine minute art of life majority of band s lyrics are in japanese band s native language however many instances show lyrics alternating from japanese to english and back examples of this include spoken word background vocals during bridge of rusty nail and multiple lines including entire pre chorus of song week end first recorded version of kurenai from vanishing vision contains lyrics entirely in english majority of band s catalog of music was written by yoshiki with relatively little composition from other members hide contributed several songs including single scars while pata s only claim is white wind from mr martin pata s nap toshi s contributions are limited to lyrics for a few songs taiji contributed music to a couple of songs notably voiceless screaming from album jealousy for which when performed live he played acoustic guitar and desperate angel heath s only writing credit is instrumental song wriggle on 1996 album dahlia which he wrote with pata only one song is credited as a full band collaboration easy fight rambling on 1989 album blue blood of songs from band s lesser known former members only track time trip loving from single orgasm composed by jun with toshi writing lyrics was officially released in 2010 it was reported that sugizo had written some songs though no further information has been given since that year yoshiki claimed that their new material was pretty much same thing maybe a little edgier however in 2014 he specifically stated it will not be same as before adding that it will be very heavy melodic and more contemporary yoshiki s songwriting process is unusual in that he writes score for each song by hand before beginning to play it with band his composing style tends to make use of chords in sequences of eights or more with riff based motifs or call and response style phrasing he has maintained this style for majority of his career as a composer having played classical piano since he was four years old yoshiki claims to be as influenced by classical music as he is by rock while also serving as main songwriter yoshiki has production credit on much of x japan s later material during live performances band relies for most part on its members with drummer and pianist yoshiki and guitarist and violinist sugizo switching between their instruments and prerecorded tracks for orchestrated strings spoken word passages and more recently some of hide s guitar parts appearance and image x japan s appearance was inspired by glam rock kiss david bowie as well as traditional japanese kabuki theatre where it was customary for male actors to play female roles and dress like women visual kei artists still often employ feminine looks and for their stage according to josephine yun like its music x s look was individualistic square shouldered toshi donned leather and metal looking like a character out of anime gundam taiji up in perfect pretty glam pata s sleepy backseat demeanor and whiskey bottle became his trademark as hide forever goaded audience and yoshiki was a paradox all his own effeminate one moment and a full force wrist breaking literally hurricane in concert next will hodgkinson of times described x japan as having grandiosity of queen heavy metal hysteria of iron maiden and symphonic sophistication of classical music all tied up with a healthy dose of melodrama their early image was characterized by heavy make up dark eyeliner and face painting and high standing hair which one critic described as skyscraper hair yoshiki s highly androgynous looks dressed in lace and pearls were referred to as decadent band also used accessories reminiscent of glam goth metal jewelry crosses their stage reflected band s duality in nature forceful masculine heavy metal songs were balanced out by toshi s high pitched tenor voice and yoshiki s soft piano play where he would often wear long female dresses and act effeminate by release of their 1995 studio album dahlia band toned its stage appearance down cutting their hair and wearing more rock inspired outfits in a 2010 interview yoshiki stated that abandoning of stronger make up and outrageous outfits was a natural progression in their style however they still do use make up on stage sometimes heavy sometimes less and that he still considers band visual kei legacy and influence thumb guitarists pata heath and sugizo at madison square garden 2014 thumb yoshiki and toshi at madison square garden 2014 x japan are considered one of founders of visual kei a movement among japanese musicians comparable to western glam with name itself believed to have been derived from their slogan psychedelic violence crime of visual shock in 2011 yoshiki briefly described their early years and movement s development saying when we started band problem was we didn t belong anywhere because we were playing very heavy music we were wearing tons of make up and crazy outfits so we couldn t belong anywhere we did our own thing and that eventually became visual kei he added but visual kei is more like a spirit it s not a music style or you know i think it is a freedom about describing myself a freedom to express myself that s what i believe visual kei is upon former guitarist hide s death in 1998 less than a year after band broke up billboard s steve mcclure declared it end of an era explaining x were first generation of visual kei bands for next generation of bands it s like that s it torch has been passed to us many bands and artists most related to visual kei count them as an influence or look up to them including miyavi dir en grey syu and of galneryus gazette d sadie vocalist mao toru kawauchi from 12012 maya of lm c flow yuuki from dj ozma kei of dio distraught overlord from deadman screw s jin and members of versailles named x and luna sea as influences with singer saying i think there isn t anyone in japanese
