great western railway gwr was a british railway company that linked london with southwest and west of england west midlands and most of wales it was founded in 1833 received its enabling act of parliament on 31 august 1835 and ran its first trains in 1838 it was engineered by isambard kingdom brunel who chose a broad gauge of later slightly widened to but from 1854 a series of amalgamations saw it also operate standard gauge trains last broad gauge services were operated in 1892 gwr was only company to keep its identity through railways act 1921 which amalgamated it with remaining independent railways within its territory and it was finally merged at end of 1947 when it was nationalised and became western region of british railways gwr was called by some god s wonderful railway and by others great way round but it was famed as holiday line taking many people to english and bristol channel resorts in west country as well as far southwest of england such as torquay in devon minehead in somerset and newquay and st ives in cornwall company s locomotives many of which were built in company s workshops at swindon were painted a brunswick green colour while for most of its existence it used a two tone chocolate and cream livery for its passenger coaches goods wagons were painted red but this was later changed to mid grey great western trains included long distance express services such as flying dutchman cornish riviera express and cheltenham spa express it also operated many suburban and rural services some operated by steam railmotors or autotrains company pioneered use of larger more economic goods wagons than were usual in britain it operated a network of road motor bus routes was a part of railway air services and owned ships docks and hotels history formation thumb left alt two trains and two empty rail tracks below an ornate roof which recedes into distance interior of brunel s train shed at temple meads first bristol terminus of gwr from an engraving by j c bourne great western railway originated from desire of bristol merchants to maintain their city as second port of country and chief one for american trade increase in size of ships and gradual silting of river avon had made liverpool an increasingly attractive port and with a liverpool to london rail line under construction in 1830s bristol s status was threatened answer for bristol was with co operation of london interests to build a line of their own a railway built to unprecedented standards of excellence to out perform lines being constructed to north west of england company was founded at a public meeting in bristol in 1833 and was incorporated by act of parliament in 1835 isambard kingdom brunel then aged twenty nine was appointed engineer route of line this was by far brunel s largest contract to date he made two controversial decisions firstly he chose to use a broad gauge of to allow for possibility of large wheels outside bodies of rolling stock which could give smoother running at high speeds secondly he selected a route north of marlborough downs which had no significant towns but which offered potential connections to oxford and gloucester this meant line was not direct from london to bristol from reading heading west line would curve in a northerly sweep back to bath brunel surveyed entire length of route between london and bristol himself with help of many including his solicitor jeremiah osborne of bristol law firm osborne clarke who on one occasion rowed brunel down river avon himself to survey bank of river for route george thomas clark played an important role as an engineer on project reputedly taking management of two divisions of route including bridges over river thames at lower basildon and moulsford and of paddington station involvement in major earth moving works seems to have fed clark s interest in geology and archaeology and he anonymously authored two guidebooks on railway one illustrated with lithographs by john cooke bourne other a critique of brunel s methods and broad gauge right thumb alt a trestle bridge on four piers spans a cutting over two rail tracks sonning cutting in 1846 first of line from

30 march 1840 cutting was scene of a railway disaster two years later when a goods train ran into a landslip ten passengers who were travelling in open trucks were killed this accident prompted parliament to pass 1844 railway regulation act requiring railway companies to provide better carriages for passengers next section from reading to crossed thames twice and opened for traffic on 1 june

after which trains ran from paddington through to bridgwater in 1851 gwr purchased kennet and avon canal which was a competing carrier between london reading bath and bristol gwr was closely involved with c gwur and b er and with several other broad gauge railways south devon railway was completed in 1849 extending broad gauge to plymouth whence cornwall railway took it over royal albert bridge and into cornwall in 1859 and in 1867 it reached over west cornwall railway which originally had been laid in 1852 with standard gauge or narrow gauge as it was known at time south wales railway had opened between and in 1850 and became connected to gwr by brunel s chepstow bridge in 1852 it was completed to in 1856 where a transatlantic port was established there was initially no direct line from london to wales as tidal river severn was too wide to cross trains instead had to follow a lengthy route via gloucester where river was narrow enough to be crossed by a bridge work on severn

either gauge may be referred to as brunel s gauge in 1844 broad gauge bristol and gloucester railway had opened but gloucester was already served by lines of birmingham and gloucester railway this resulted in a break of gauge that forced all passengers and goods to change trains if travelling between south west and north this was beginning of gauge war and led to appointment by parliament of a gauge commission which reported in 1846 in favour of standard gauge so 7 foot gauge was proscribed by law regulating gauge of railways act except for southwest of england and wales where connected to gwr network other railways in britain were to use standard gauge in 1846 bristol and gloucester was bought by midland railway and it was converted to standard gauge in 1854 which brought mixed gauge track to temple meads station this had three rails to allow trains to run on either broad or standard gauge gwr extended into west midlands in competition with midland and london and north western railway birmingham was reached through in 1852 and wolverhampton in 1854 this was furthest north that broad gauge reached in same year shrewsbury and birmingham railway and shrewsbury and chester railway both amalgamated with gwr but these lines were standard gauge and gwr s own line north of oxford had been built with mixed gauge this mixed gauge was extended southwards from oxford to at end

chippenham and a route initially started by wilts somerset and weymouth railway further west lswr took over broad gauge exeter and crediton railway and north devon railway also standard gauge bodmin and wadebridge railway it was several years before these remote lines were connected with parent lswr system and any through traffic to them was handled by gwr and its associated companies by now gauge war was lost and mixed gauge was brought to paddington in 1861 allowing through passenger trains from london to chester broad gauge south wales railway amalgamated with gwr in 1862 as did west midland railway which brought with it oxford worcester and wolverhampton railway a line that had been conceived as another broad gauge route to midlands but which had been built as standard gauge after several battles both political and physical on 1 april 1869 broad gauge was taken out of use between oxford and wolverhampton and from reading to basingstoke in august line from to was converted from broad to standard and whole of line from swindon through gloucester to south wales was similarly treated in may 1872 in 1874 mixed gauge was extended along main line to chippenham and line from there to weymouth was narrowed following year saw mixed gauge laid through box tunnel with broad gauge now retained only for through services beyond bristol and on a few branch lines bristol and exeter railway amalgamated with gwr on 1 january 1876 it had already made a start on mixing gauge on its line a task completed through to exeter on 1 march 1876 by gwr station here had been shared with lswr since 1862 this rival company had continued to push westwards over its exeter and crediton line and arrived in plymouth later in 1876 which spurred south devon railway to also amalgamate with great western cornwall railway remained a nominally independent line until 1889 although gwr held a large number of shares in company one final new broad gauge route was opened on 1 june 1877 st

transatlantic liner traffic and provided a better facility for anglo irish ferries than that at neyland generally conservative gwr made other improvements in years before world war i such as restaurant cars better conditions for third class passengers steam heating of trains and faster express services these were largely at initiative of t i allen superintendent of line and one of a group of talented senior managers who led railway into edwardian era viscount emlyn earl cawdor chairman from 1895 to 1905 sir joseph wilkinson general manager from 1896 to 1903 his successor former chief engineer sir james inglis and george jackson churchward chief mechanical engineer it was during this period that gwr introduced road motor services as an alternative to building new lines in rural areas and started using steam rail motors to bring cheaper operation to existing branch lines one of big four thumb left alt a green steam engine with three pairs of large wheels and two smaller ones and reporting letters on front 1923 saw construction of first of 171 castle class locomotives at outbreak of world war i in 1914 gwr was taken into government control as were most major railways in britain many of its staff joined armed forces and it was more difficult to build and maintain equipment than in peacetime after war government considered permanent nationalisation but decided instead on a compulsory amalgamation of railways into four large groups gwr alone preserved its name through grouping under which smaller companies were amalgamated into four main companies in 1922 and 1923 new great western railway had more routes in wales including of former cambrian railways lines and from taff vale railway a few independent lines in its english area of operations were also added notably midland and south western junction railway a line previously working closely with midland railway but which now gave gwr a second station at swindon along with a line that carried through traffic from north via cheltenham and to southampton 1930s brought hard times but company remained in fair financial health despite depression development loans guarantees and grants act 1929 allowed gwr to obtain money in return for stimulating employment and this was used to improve stations including london paddington and cardiff general to improve facilities at depots and to lay additional tracks to reduce congestion road motor services were transferred to local bus companies in which gwr took a share but instead it participated in air services a legacy of broad gauge was that trains for some routes could be built slightly wider than was normal in britain and these included 1929 built super saloons used on boat train services that conveyed transatlantic passengers to london in luxury when company celebrated its centenary during 1935 new centenary carriages were built for cornish riviera express which again made full use of wider loading gauge on that route harris 1985 p 95 world war ii and after with outbreak of world war ii in 1939 gwr returned to direct government control and by end of war a labour government was in power and again planning to nationalise railways after a couple of years trying to recover from ravages of war gwr became western region of british railways on 1 january 1948 great western railway company continued to exist as a legal entity for nearly two more years being formally wound up on 23 december 1949 gwr designs of locomotives and rolling stock continued to be built for a while and region maintained its own distinctive character even painting for a while its stations and express trains in a form of chocolate and cream about 40 years after nationalisation british rail was privatised and old name was revived by great western

linked london paddington station with temple meads station in bristol by way of didcot and bath this line was extended westwards through exeter and plymouth to reach and most westerly railway station in england brunel and gooch placed gwr s main locomotive workshops close to village of swindon and locomotives of many trains were changed here in early years up to this point route had climbed very gradually westwards from london but from here it changed into one with steeper gradients which with primitive locomotives available to brunel was better operated by types with smaller wheels better able to climb hills these gradients faced both directions first dropping down through wootton bassett junction to cross river avon then climbing back up through chippenham to box tunnel before descending once more to regain river avon s valley which it followed to bath and bristol swindon was also junction for a line that ran north westwards to then south westwards on far side of river severn to reach cardiff and west wales this route was later shortened by opening of a more direct east west route through severn tunnel another route ran northwards from didcot to from where two different routes continued to wolverhampton one through birmingham and other through worcester beyond wolverhampton line continued via to and birkenhead another route via enabled gwr to reach operating agreements with other companies also allowed gwr trains to run to manchester south of london to bristol main line were routes from didcot to southampton via and from chippenham to via a network of cross country routes linked these main lines and there were also many and varied branch lines some were short such as clevedon branch line others were much longer such as minehead branch a few were promoted and built by gwr to counter competition from other companies such as reading to basingstoke line to keep london and south western railway away from however many were built by local companies that then sold their railway to their larger neighbour examples include launceston and branches further variety came from traffic carried holidaymakers st ives royalty windsor or just goods

included third class accommodation at a fare of not more than one penny per mile and a speed of at least by 1882 third class carriages were attached to all trains except for fastest expresses another parliamentary order meant that trains began to include smoking carriages from 1868 special excursion cheap day tickets were first issued in may 1849 and season tickets in 1851 until 1869 most revenue came from second class passengers but volume of third class passengers grew to extent that second class facilities were withdrawn in 1912 cheap trains act 1883 resulted in provision of workmen s

constructed these trains had special retractable steps that could be used at stations with lower platforms than was usual in england railmotors proved so successful on many routes that they had to be supplemented by trailer cars with driving controls first of which entered service at end of 1904 from following year a number of small locomotives were fitted so that they could work with these trailers combined sets becoming known as autotrains and eventually replacing steam rail motors diesel railcars were introduced in 1934 some railcars were fully streamlined some had buffet counters for

source of revenue for gwr when it first opened but goods were also carried in separate trains it was not until coal mining and industrial districts of wales and midlands were reached that goods traffic became significant in 1856 ruabon coal company signed an agreement with gwr to transport coal to london at special rates which nonetheless was worth at least ps40 000 each year to railway as locomotives increased in size so did length of goods trains from 40 to as many as 100 four wheeled wagons although gradient of line often limited this while typical goods wagons could carry 8 10 or later 12 tons load placed into a wagon could be as little as 1 ton many smaller consignments were sent to a local transhipment centre where they were re sorted into larger loads for main segment of their journey there were more than 550 station truck workings running on timetabled goods trains carrying small consignments to and from specified stations and 200 pick up trucks that collected small loads from groups of stations atkins 1975 p 16 gwr provided special wagons handling equipment and storage facilities for its largest traffic flows for example coal mines in wales sent much of their coal to docks along coast many of which were owned and equipped by railway as were some in cornwall that exported most of china clay production of that county wagons provided for both these traffic flows both those owned by gwr and mining companies were fitted with end doors that allowed their loads to be tipped straight into ships holds using wagon tipping equipment on dockside special wagons were produced for many other different commodities such as gunpowder aeroplanes milk fruit and fish heavy traffic was carried from agricultural and fishing areas in southwest of england often in fast perishables trains for instance more than 3 500 cattle were sent from in 12 months to june 1869 and in 1876 nearly than 17 000 tons of fish was carried from west cornwall to london perishables trains running in nineteenth century used wagons built to same standards as passenger coaches with vacuum brakes and large wheels to allow fast running ordinary goods trains on gwr as on all other british railways at time had wheels close together around apart smaller wheels and only hand brakes in 1905 gwr ran its first vacuum braked general goods train between london and bristol using newly built goods wagons with small wheels but vacuum brakes this was followed by other services to create a network of fast trains between major centres of production and population that were scheduled to run at speeds averaging other railway companies also followed gwr s lead by providing their own vacuum braked or fitted services atkins 1975 pp 12 15 ancillary operations right thumb alt a sepia picture of

soon appointed as railway s locomotive superintendent and set about establishing a reliable fleet he bought two locomotives from robert stephenson and company which proved more successful than brunel s and then designed a series of standardised locomotives from 1846 these could be built at company s newly established railway workshops at swindon he designed several different broad gauge types for growing railway such as firefly 2 2 2s and later iron duke class 4 2 2s in 1864 gooch was succeeded by joseph armstrong who brought his standard gauge experience to railway some of armstrong s designs were built as either broad or standard gauge just by fitting different wheels those needing tenders were given old ones from withdrawn broad gauge locomotives joseph armstrong s early death in 1877 meant that next phase of motive power design was responsibility of william dean who developed express 4 4 0 types rather than single driver 2 2 2s and 4 2 2s that had hauled fast trains up to that time dean retired in 1902 to be replaced by george jackson churchward who introduced familiar 4 6 0 locomotives it was during churchward s tenure that term locomotive superintendent was changed to chief mechanical engineer cme charles collett succeeded churchward in 1921 he was soon responsible for much larger fleet that gwr operated following railways act 1921 mergers he set about replacing older and less numerous classes and rebuilding remainder using as many standardised gwr components as possible he also produced many new designs using standard parts such as castle and king classes final cme was frederick hawksworth who took control in 1941 seeing railway through wartime shortages and producing gwr design locomotives until after nationalisation brunel and gooch both gave their locomotives names to identify them but standard gauge companies that became a part of gwr used numbers until 1864 gwr therefore had named broad gauge locomotives and numbered standard gauge ones from time of armstrong s arrival all new locomotives both broad and standard were given numbers including broad gauge ones that had previously carried names when they were acquired from other railways dean introduced a policy in 1895 of giving passenger tender locomotives both numbers and names each batch was given names with a distinctive theme for example kings for 6000 class and castles for class gwr first painted its locomotives a dark holly green but this was changed to middle chrome or brunswick green for most of its existence they initially had chocolate brown or indian red frames but this was

brakes bogies and through corridors all came into use during nineteenth century and in 1900 first electrically lit coaches were put into service 1920s saw some vehicles fitted with automatic couplings and steel bodies early vehicles were built by a number of independent companies but in 1844 railway started to build carriages at swindon railway works which eventually provided most of railway s rolling stock special vehicles included sleeping cars restaurant cars and slip coaches passengers were also carried in railmotors autotrains and diesel railcars passenger rated vans carried parcels horses and milk at express speeds representative examples of these carriages survive in service today on various heritage railways up and down country most coaches were generally painted in variations

livery being plain brown or red instead which caused them to be known as brown vehicles lewis 2009 pp 100 113 wagons thumb left alt a short goods van built from planks of wood sides are mid grey with a large white g to left of doors and a large white w to right a gwr goods van in grey livery used from about 1904 this one has end doors to allow motor cars to be loaded in early years of gwr its wagons were painted brown but this changed to red before end of broad gauge familiar dark grey livery was introduced about 1904 most early wagons were four wheeled open vehicles although a few six wheeled vehicles were provided for special loads covered vans followed initially for carrying cattle but later for both general and vulnerable goods too first bogie wagons appeared in 1873 for heavy loads but bogie coal wagons were built in 1904 following on from large four wheel coal wagons that had first appeared in 1898 rated at 20 tons 20 3 tonnes these were twice size of typical wagons of period but it was not until 1923 that company invested heavily in coal wagons of this size and infrastructure necessary for their unloading at their docks these were known as felix pole wagons after gwr s general manager who promoted their use container wagons appeared in 1931 and special vans for motor cars in 1933 when gwr was opened no trains in united kingdom were fitted with vacuum brakes instead were fitted to individual wagons and trains also conveyed brake vans where a guard had control of a screw operated brake first goods wagons to be fitted with vacuum brakes were those that ran in passenger trains carrying perishable goods such as fish some ballast hoppers were given vacuum brakes in december 1903 and general goods wagons were constructed with them from 1904 onwards although unfitted wagons those without vacuum brakes still formed majority of fleet in 1948 when railway was nationalised to become a part of british railways atkins 1975 pp 67 80 all wagons for public traffic had a code name that was used in telegraphic messages as this was usually painted onto wagon it is common to see them referred to by these names such as mink a van mica refrigerated van crocodile boiler truck and toad brake van lewis 2009 pp a17 a18 track thumb right alt three rails cross picture from left to right supported on thick timbers occasional smaller timbers cross between these and stone chippings fill space between them baulk road track for permanent way brunel decided to use a light bridge rail continuously supported on thick timber baulks known as baulk road thinner timber transoms were used to keep baulks correct distance apart this produced a smoother track and whole assembly proved cheaper than using conventional sleepers for broad gauge track although this advantage was lost with standard or mixed gauge lines because of higher ratio of timber to length of line more conventional track forms were later used although baulk road could still be seen in sidings in first half of twentieth century lewis 2009 pp 143 149 signalling thumb right upright alt a white pole supports two cross arms joined by four short verticals to make a grid above that is a red disc perforated by eight holes disc and crossbar signal brunel developed a system of disc and crossbar signals to control train movements but people operating them could only assume that each train reached next signal without stopping unexpectedly world s first commercial telegraph line was installed along from paddington to west drayton and came into operation on 9 april 1839 this later spread throughout system and allowed stations to use telegraphic messages to tell people operating signals when each train arrived safely a long list of code words were developed to help make messages both quick to send and clear in meaning more conventional semaphore signals replaced discs and crossbars over time gwr persisted with lower quadrant form where a proceed aspect is indicated by lowering signal arm despite other british railways changing to an upper quadrant form electric light signals of searchlight pattern were later introduced at busy stations these could show same red green or yellow green aspects that semaphore signals showed at night an automatic train control system was introduced from 1906 which was a safety system that applied a train s brakes if it passed a danger signal cultural impact gwr is known admiringly to some as god s wonderful railway but jocularly to others as great way round as some of its earliest routes were not most direct railway however

tours to popular destinations not served directly by train and its ships offered cruises from places such as plymouth redundant carriages were converted to camp coaches and placed at country or seaside stations such as and and hired to holidaymakers who arrived by train gwr had operated hotels at major stations and junctions since early days but in 1877 it opened its first country house hotel castle in st ives cornwall it later added fishguard bay hotel in wales and manor house at devon to which it added a golf course in 1930 it promoted itself from 1908 as holiday 1970 pp 24 27

bridge and in 1862 william powell frith painted railway station a large crowd scene on platform at paddington station itself was initially painted for powell by w scott morton an architect and a train was specially provided by gwr for painting in front of which a variety of travellers and railway staff form an animated focal point gwr has featured in many television programmes such as bbc children
