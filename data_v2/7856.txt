vietnamese president ngo dinh diem in hope of achieving a negotiated peace together with le duc tho head of party organisational department and nguyen chi thanh a military general le duan tried to monopolise decision making process this became even more evident following ho s death in 1964 ho s health began to fail and le duan as his trusted underling more visibly took on day to day decision

began between le duan s pro soviet and its rival pro chinese factions former rivals le duan and le duc tho formed a coalition and purged pro chinese faction their first victims were hoang van hoan and chu van tan while politburo made decisions through consensus le duan through his post as general secretary was most powerful figure and was able to increase his power via his alliance with le duc tho tran quoc hoan and vo nguyen giap together with le duc tho le duan controlled personnel appointments in ministry of internal affairs state planning commission ministry of foreign affairs general political directorate of people s army of vietnam pavn general logistics department of pavn and ministry of transport to strengthen their hold on power le duan and le duc tho established a patronage network for instance le duc tho s brother dinh duc thien was appointed minister of communications and transport in april 1982 dong si nguyen a protege of le duan became minister of transport mai chi tho brother of le duc tho was chairman of people s committee of ho chi minh city equivalent to a mayor from 1978 to 1985 several of le duan s relatives were appointed to offices in propaganda and

south vietnamese people s front central committee supported proposal a central committee resolution stated that common task of vietnamese revolution at present is to accelerate socialist revolution in north vietnam whilst at same time stepping up national people s democratic revolution in south vietnam on 20 december 1960 three months later viet cong was established le duan claimed that viet cong would rally all patriotic forces to overthrow diem government in south and thus ensure conditions for peaceful reunification of fatherland after sino soviet split vietnamese communist leadership divided into pro china and pro soviet factions from 1956 63 le duan played a moderating role between two factions but with death of diem and gulf of tonkin incident he became considerably more radical chinese continued to support them throughout war with liu shaoqi president of people s republic in 1965 stating it is our policy that we will do our best to support you unlike ho who wanted a peaceful resolution le duan was far more militant he wanted in his own words final victory he dismissed ho s position as did majority of politburo calling him naive when ho called for establishment of a neutral south vietnamese state in 1963 le duan responded by making overtures to chinese who rejected soviet position of peaceful coexistence with increased involvement of united states military in 1965 north s military strategy was forced to change as le duan noted in a letter to nguyen chi thanh war would become fiercer and longer he believed fundamentals of conflict had not changed south vietnamese regime s unpopularity remained its achilles heel and he continued to advocate a combination of guerrilla warfare and pavn offensives communist commanders in south were to avoid large attacks on army of republic of vietnam arvn but instead focus on many small attacks to demoralize enemy le duan believed that key to victory was for pavn to keep initiative he dismissed possibility of an attack against north vietnam by american forces claiming that an attack on north vietnam would be an attack on entire socialist camp in 1967 despite opposition of other party leaders such as vo nguyen giap le duan and his militant group adopted nguyen chi thanh s operational plan for general offensive general uprising involving attacks on arvn and south vietnamese government installations throughout south vietnam which they believed would spark a spontaneous popular uprising among south vietnamese population forcing us and its allies to depart after having sidelined and in some cases arrested opponents of plan this would be adopted as official strategy to win war general offensive general uprising would be launched during tet holiday in january february 1968 and tet offensive would prove to be a military disaster despite failure of offensive north vietnamese launched a phase ii attack in may 1968 and a phase iii attack in august 1968 both of which were easily repulsed with pavn and vc again suffering large casualties after failure of these attacks cosvn issued directive 55 on 5 april 1969 to all of its subordinate units never again and under no circumstances are we going to risk our entire military force for just such an offensive on contrary we should endeavor to preserve our military potential for future campaigns by july 1974 following cut off of us aid to south north vietnamese leadership had decided to abrogate paris peace accords and to invade in 1975 instead of 1976 as previously planned because they believed an earlier vietnamese unification would put vietnam in a stronger position against chinese and soviet influence in his victory speech le duan stated our party is unique and single leader that organised controlled and governed entire struggle of vietnamese people from first day of revolution in his speech he congratulated provisional revolutionary government of republic of south vietnam prgrsv underground south vietnamese government established in 1969 for liberating south vietnam from imperialism prgrsv ruled south vietnam did not last long however and in 1976 reunified socialist republic of vietnam was established le duan purged south vietnamese who had fought against north imprisoning up to 300 000 people in re education camps not including dissidents detained in many prisons of vietnam and setting off a mass exodus and humanitarian disaster see vietnamese boat people economy thumbnail inflation in retail prices in vietnam since unification until 6th national congress in 1986 vietnam developed little during war years industry was nearly non existent in both north and south and both countries were dependent on foreign donor countries worse country s critical agricultural infrastructure had been badly damaged south had roughly 20 000 bomb craters 10 million refugees 362 000 war invalids 1 000 000 widows 880 000 orphans 250 000 drug addicts 300 000 prostitutes and 3 million unemployed having won war and defeated south vietnam le duan s mood in april 1975 was optimistic as one central committee member put it now nothing more can happen problems we face now are trifles compared to those in past le duan promised vietnamese people in 1976 that each family would own a radio set refrigerator and tv within ten years he seemed to believe he could easily integrate south vietnamese consumer society with agrarian north vietnam in 1976 4th national congress declared vietnam would complete its socialist transformation within twenty years this optimism proved unfounded instead vietnam staggered from one economic crisis to another after war per capita income stood at us 101 it decreased to 91 in 1980 and then increased to 99 by 1982 according to united nations figures pham van dong admitted that per capita income had not increased compared to what it was ten years ago physical health declined and malnutrition increased under le duan according to ministry of health according to international herald tribune an estimated 6 000 000 vietnamese were suffering from malnutrition leading government to request aid from united nations food and agriculture organization le duan s policies led to an abrupt decline in standard of living monthly per capita income in north declined from 82 in 1976 to 58 in 1980 main goals of second five year plan 1976 80 which was initiated at 4th national congress were as follows concentrate forces of whole country to achieve a leap forward in agriculture vigorously develop light industry t urn to full account existing heavy industry capacity and build many new industrial installations especially in machine industry so as to support primary agriculture and light industry v complete socialist transformation in south vietnamese leadership expected to reach these targets with economic aid from council for mutual economic assistance comecon and loans from international agencies of capitalist world 4th national congress made it clear that agriculture would be socialised however during second five year plan socialisation measures went so badly that vo chi cong a politburo member and chairman of committee for socialist transformation of agriculture claimed it would be impossible to meet targets set by plan by 1980 an estimated 10 000 out of 13 246 socialist cooperatives established during plan had collapsed in south by 1980 politburo member le thanh nghi attacked lower level cadres for failure of socialist agriculture transformation process led to an abrupt drop in food production in 1977 and 1978 leading 6th plenum of central committee to completely overhaul party s agricultural policies thumbnail real national income growth in vietnam from 1976 until 1985 with regard to heavy industry leadership s position was muddled in his fourth political report le duan stated that during transition to socialism priority would be given to heavy industry on basis of developing agriculture and light industry in another section of report le duan stated that light industry would be prioritised ahead of heavy industry position of pham van dong chairman of council of ministers head of government was just as confused as le duan s in practice le duan prioritised heavy industry 21 4 of state investment was in heavy industry in second five year plan and 29 7 percent in third five year plan 1981 85 light industry only received 10 5 and 11 5 respectively from 1976 to 1978 industry grew but from 1979 to 1980 industrial production fell substantially during second five year plan industry grew just 0 1 percent 6th plenum of central committee criticised policy that state had to own everything before 5th central committee plenum le duan believed that vietnam was in a perilous position although no talk of reforms followed beginning in 1979 le duan acknowledged that economic policy mistakes had been made by national party and state leadership until 6th plenum planners prevailed that plenum condemned old ways and promised that from then on economy would be governed by objective laws roles of plan and market were openly discussed for first time and roles of family and private economy were enhanced and certain market prices were officially supported by party le duan endorsed reforms at 1982 5th national congress le duan talked about need to strengthen both central planned economy and local economy at once in his report le duan admitted that second five year plan had been a failure economically at beginning these changes had little practical effect possibly due to opposition by planners and confusion or fear among cadres from 1981 84 agricultural production grew substantially but government did not use this opportunity to increase production of such crucial farm inputs as fertilizer pesticide and fuel nor of consumer goods by end of le duan s rule in 1985 1986 inflation had reached over 100 annually complicating economic policy making foreign relations relations with eastern bloc le duan visited soviet union in october 1975 result of visit was an official communique which stated that soviets would send qualified experts to country to educate and train economic scientific technical and cultural personnel soviet union gave vietnam economic assistance and supported several national economic projects on most favoured terms communique stated that cooperation was within frameworks of multilateral cooperation of socialist countries such a statement would normally have meant membership in comecon but vietnam was not a member wanting to establish its sovereignty pham van dong snubbed soviet ambassador during anniversary of october revolution and rejected key soviet foreign policies despite continued pressure from soviets to join comecon vietnam declined instead vietnam joined international monetary fund and world bank moves soviet union opposed thumb le duan and truong chinh with nicolae and elena ceausescu from socialist republic of romania vietnam relented in 1978 seeking economic aid to fund second five year plan in 1978 le duan and pham van dong signed a 25 year treaty of friendship and mutual cooperation with ussr under soviet protection vietnam invaded kampuchea in reaction china invaded vietnam vietnam leased several bases to soviet union to protect its territory from china it was rumored that one of china s demands for peace was ending of soviet assistance to vietnam in asia vietnam played a role similar to cuba s in latin america it supported local revolutionary groups and was a headquarters for soviet style communism vietnam supported soviet invasion of afghanistan and received 3 million a day in military aid at 5th national congress le duan reaffirmed vietnam s relations with ussr he stated solidarity and co operation with ussr such is corner stone of external policy of our party and of our state he further noted that their alliance was a guarantee of victory of defense of motherland and socialist edification of our people soviet official mikhail gorbachev echoed le duan s sentiments and said vietnam can count on solidarity and support of ussr le duan s foreign policy was criticised by hoang van hoan who accused him of sacrificing country s sovereignty a delegation led by vitaly visited vietnam during its national day holiday that celebrated establishment of north vietnam after august revolution and met with le duan le duan attended 27th communist party congress and later met with gorbachev soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov and anatoly dobrynin attended le duan s funeral relations with china during vietnam war chinese claimed that soviet union would betray north vietnam chinese premier zhou enlai told le duan that soviets would lie to them to improve its relationship with united states according to zhou this policy was enacted following alexei kosygin s departure from vietnam in 1965 le duan did not accept this view and at 23rd party congress which china boycotted he referred to soviet union as a second motherland because of his statement china immediately began to cut its aid to north vietnam according to first secretary at soviet embassy to china north vietnamese saw chinese actions as an attack on them at chinese communist party s 45th anniversary instead of a communique by ho chi minh pham van dong and le duan as had happened at 44th anniversary vietnamese central committee offered official greetings but without signatures from top level officials relations between two countries further deteriorated following china us rapprochement north vietnamese who were still fighting americans felt betrayed at cpv politburo meeting on 16 july 1971 north vietnamese agreed that chinese policy towards united states was like a torpedo directed against north vietnam zhou was told by pham van dong and le duan that us president richard nixon s upcoming visit to china was against interests of vietnam later in november pham asked chinese to cancel nixon s visit chinese refused north vietnamese began to doubt china and they hid information about north vietnam s next planned military offensive sino us rapprochement did not hurt sino vietnamese relations in long run because soviet union also eventually reconciled with us chinese and north vietnamese documents state that relations between them worsened in 1973 75 a vietnamese document claimed that china hindered eventual reunification while chinese documents claimed that source of conflict was vietnamese policy towards spratly and paracel islands however core issue for chinese was to minimize vietnam s cooperation with soviets increasing soviet vietnamese cooperation left china ambivalent about reunification during le duan s china visit in june 1973 zhou told him that north vietnam should adhere to paris peace accords following signing le thanh nghi stated that direction of vietnam s communism was directly linked to its relations with soviet union chinese opposed immediate reunification and to that end began making economic agreements with provisional revolutionary communist government of south vietnam prgsv prgsv head nguyen huu tho was treated well by chinese this policy further damaged relations china and vietnam drifted further apart eventual chinese aid did not improve relations le thanh unsuccessfully visited china in august 1975 to seek aid on 22 28 september le duan and le thanh visited china in a second attempt during visit vietnamese wanted to assure chinese they were interested in maintaining good relations with both china and soviet union deng xiaoping stated that both superpowers acted as imperialists and sought hegemony le duan in a speech did not mention soviet union by name but noted that vietnam had succeeded because of help from other socialist countries meaning eastern bloc two agreements were signed but no non refundable aid agreement was made no joint communique was issued and le duan left earlier than planned according to anne gilks sino vietnamese alliance effectively ended with fall of saigon relations with china further deteriorated several leading pro chinese communists were purged from party le duan visited china from 20 25 november 1977 to seek aid cpc chairman hua guofeng stated that sino vietnamese relations had deteriorated because they held different principles hua insisted that china could not help vietnam because of its own economic difficulties and differences in principles le duan countered that only difference was how they viewed soviet union and united states following his visit china xinhua condemned comecon china halted all economic development projects between may and july 1978 during this period total chinese aid to vietnam amounted to 300 million chinese invasion on 17 february 1979 chinese people s liberation army crossed vietnamese border withdrawing on 5 march after a two week campaign which devastated northern vietnam and briefly threatened hanoi both china 40 000 and vietnam over 20 000 suffered heavy losses peace talks broke down in december 1979 and both china 400 000 and vietnam 600 000 began a major build up of forces along border sporadic fighting on border occurred throughout 1980s and china threatened to force vietnam s exit from kampuchea vietnamese invasion and occupation of cambodia independent kampuchean communist party kcp was established alongside vietnamese and laotian parties following dissolution of indochinese communist party in 1955 kampuchean movement was weakest of three when vietnamese began formal military aid to khmer rouge in 1970 khmer leadership remained skeptical on orders of vo chi cong two regiments were sent into kampuchea vo chi cong promised khmer leader ieng sary that vietnamese troops would withdraw when conflict had been won by communists entry of vietnamese troops led many vietnamese officials to believe that khmer rouge officials had begun to fear something in a conversation with pham hung le duan told him that despite some differences in opinions authentic internationalism and attitude of sides would strengthen their party to party relations after reading reports by vo chi cong le duan probably concluded that authentic internationalism in kampuchea was in trouble at time vietnamese leadership hoped this situation would change but privately they understood that kampuchean situation was different from lao situation thumb left ba chuc massacre was perpetrated by kampuchean revolutionary army during one of their attacks on vietnam in 1978 after pol pot and his supporters seized control of kcp in 1973 kcp vcp relations deteriorated sharply north vietnamese formations that were active in kampuchea during civil war were thereafter regularly attacked by their allies by 1976 while it appeared that kampuchea vietnam relations were normalizing private suspicions within respective leaderships grew le duan ton duc thang truong chinh and pham van dong sent messages congratulating ascension of pol pot and nuon chea as premier president of presidium and president of assembly of people s representative respectively in turn kcp sent a congratulatory message to prgrsv on its seventh anniversary on 21 september 1976 a vietnamese women s delegation visited kampuchea and kcp sent public greetings to 4th national congress vietnamese leadership hoped that pro vietnamese elements would develop within kcp when kampuchean radio announced pol pot s resignation le duan and vietnamese leadership took it seriously during a meeting with soviet ambassador le duan told him that pol pot and ieng sary had been removed from kcp leadership change was welcome to vietnam since two were a pro chinese sect conducting a crude and severe policy le duan added that these were bad people kcp leadership headed by pol pot but that nuon chea was our man and is my personal friend all out confrontation was not planned and le duan still believed that state to state relations could improve he further noted that kampuchea would eventually become like laos a socialist state and value its relationship with vietnam and soviet union on 30 april 1977 democratic kampuchea attacked several vietnamese villages in an giang province most notably in ba chuc massacre vietnamese leadership was shocked by this unprovoked attack and counterattacked vietnam still sought improved relations and when pol pot on 27 september 1977 announced existence of kcp vietnam sent a congratulatory note in a conversation with soviet ambassador on 6 october le duan had no explanation for kampuchea s actions he described leadership as strongly nationalistic and under strong influence of peking china le duan called pol pot a trotskyist while claiming that ieng sary was a fierce nationalist and pro chinese he erroneously believed that nuon chea and son sen harbored pro vietnamese views on 31 december 1977 kampuchea broke relations with vietnam stating that aggressor forces from vietnam sent had to be withdrawn this was needed to restore friendly atmosphere between two countries while they accused vietnam of aggression real problem all along was vietnamese leadership plan or ideal of establishing a vietnamese dominated indochinese federation vietnamese troops withdrew from country in january taking thousands of prisoners and civilian refugees while point of vietnamese attack had been to dampen kampuchean leadership s aggressive stance it had opposite effect kampuchean leadership treated it as a major victory over vietnam matching their victory over americans kampuchea did not respond to diplomatic overtures and began another attack vietnam responded by promoting an uprising against pol pot s rule and invaded on 15 june 1978 vcp politburo sent a request to soviet union to allow a delegation headed by le duan to meet with leonid brezhnev and soviet leadership in general in a meeting with soviet ambassador in september le duan said that vietnam intended to solve fully this question of kampuchea by beginning of 1979 le duan did not believe that china would retaliate because it would have to send its forces by sea although china did attack in 1979 but chose vietnam as its target he claimed that vietnam had little time and that waiting would benefit china he further claimed that vietnam had established nine battalions of khmer deserters and that it was seeking sao pheum to lead them in fact sao pheum had been dead for three months le duan still believed that nuon chea was a friend of vietnam despite his largely anti vietnam speech nuon chea and son sen remained staunch pol pot supporters until 1990s vietnam sent 13 divisions into country on 25 december 1978 with an estimated 150 000 soldiers supported by heavy artillery and air power kampuchea attempted a conventional defense but this tactic led to loss of half of its army within two weeks defeats prompted much of kampuchean leadership to evacuate to western region of country on 7 january 1979 vietnamese army and kampuchean united front for national salvation entered phnom penh on following day a pro vietnamese state known as people s republic of kampuchea prk was established with heng as head of state and pen as general secretary of kampuchean people s revolutionary party struggle between khmer rouge and prk ended only with vietnam s withdrawal in 1989 last years and death thumb 250px vietnam s aging leadership in 1980s from left to right pham van dong truong chinh and le duan by time of 5th national congress party leadership had turned into a veritable gerontocracy five most powerful politburo members were all over age of 70 le duan was 74 truong chinh was 75 pham van dong was 76 pham hung was 70 and le duc tho was 72 le duan is believed to have been in bad health during this period he had travelled to soviet union on several occasions for medical treatment during late 1970s and early 1980s it was reported that le duan did not lead party delegates of 5th national congress to ho chi minh mausoleum because of his deteriorating health le duan looked both feeble and old he had problems reading his report to congress at 5th national congress le duan le duc tho clique amassed considerable power by staffing 5th central committee 5th secretariat and 5th politburo with their own supporters several moderates and old companions of ho chi minh as well as pro chinese communists labelled dismissively as maoists and followers of truong chinh were removed from politburo and central committee most prominent ouster was that of vo nguyen giap commander at battle of dien bien phu giap s removal signaled more defeat of a rival than of an ideological tendency nguyen duy trinh and le thanh nghi were removed from politburo because of their moderate stances while tran quoc hoan le van luong and nguyen van linh were removed because of their alignment with truong chinh in their place le duan and le duc tho appointed military men including do le duc anh and general dong si nguyen appointment of nguyen duc tam and nguyen co thach strengthened le duc tho le duan le duc tho clique thereafter had a clear majority within 5th secretariat le duan s report to 5th national congress was a biting self criticism of his leadership and party s management he criticised political and economic corruption and gerontocracy itself 5th central committee contained only one member under 60 during this period central committee was disrupted by factional infighting between pragmatists and conservatives this struggle would lead to economic reform le duan and his supporters began effort to open economy apparently le duan suffered a heart attack after congress and was hospitalized in soviet union he remained general secretary until on 10 july 1986 he died of natural causes in hanoi at age 79 he was temporarily succeeded by truong chinh who was replaced by nguyen van linh at december 6th national congress political beliefs le duan was a nationalist and during war he claimed that nation and socialism were one he stressed importance of building socialism politically economically and culturally and of defending socialist fatherland ideologically he was often referred to as a pragmatist he often broke with marxism leninism to stress vietnam s uniqueness most notably in agriculture le duan s view of socialism was statist highly centralised and managerial in one of his own works le duan talked about right of collective mastery but in practice he opposed this for instance party cadres who presented peasants demands for higher prices for their products at national congress were criticised by le duan his ideas of collective mastery were hierarchical management by state aims at ensuring right of masses to be collective masters of country how then will state manage its affairs so as to ensure this right of collective mastery his answer to this problem was managerial and statist le duan s concept of collective mastery was featured in 1980 vietnamese constitution as was his concept of collective mastery of society concept was le duan s version of popular sovereignty that advocated an active role for people so that they could become their own masters as well as masters of society nature and nation it stated that people s collective mastery in all fields was assured by state and was implemented by permitting their participation in state affairs and in mass organisations on paper these organisations to which almost all citizens belong play an active role in government and have right to introduce bills before national assembly le duan said that land ownership entailed a struggle between two roads collective production and private production large scale socialist production and small scattered production this quote could easily have been taken from joseph stalin mao zedong or truong chinh in his radical years his views had a direct impact on vietnam since it was believed that collective ownership was only alternative to capitalism it was introduced without controversy by country s leadership subcontracting cooperatives to peasants became norm by late 1970s and was legalised in 1981 for conservatives this policy was similar to that of lenin s new economic policy a temporary break from hardline socialist development however those who supported reforms saw subcontracting as another way of implementing socialism in agriculture which was justified by ideological tenet of three interests this was an important ideological innovation and broke with le duan s two roads theory le duan departed from marxist leninist orthodoxy when it came to practical policy and stated that country had to carry out agricultural cooperation immediately even before having built large industry while he acknowledged that his view was heresy le duan insisted that vietnam was in a unique situation it seems that no country so far in history has been in a situation such as ours we must lead peasantry and agriculture immediately to socialism without waiting for a developed industry though we know very well that without strong impact of industry agriculture cannot achieve large scale production and new relations of agriculture cannot be consolidated to proceed from small scale production to large scale production is a new one according to le duan key to socialism was not mechanisation and industrialisation but a new division of labour he also believed that cooperatives did not need to be autarkic but rather organically connected through process of production itself with other cooperatives and with state economic sector vietnam could achieve this through state intervention and control he saw economy as one whole directed by state and not many parts intertwined in his victory speech after 1976 parliamentary election le duan talked about perfecting socialism in north by eliminating private ownership and last vestiges of capitalism and of need to initiate socialist transformation in south in south party according to le duan would focus on abolishing comprador bourgeoisie and last remnants of feudal landlord classes comprador bourgeoisie was their term for bourgeois classes who made a living by financial dealings and through transactions with westerners le duan did not reveal that in addition to removing comprador bourgeoisie and feudal landlord classes from south he intended to obliterate entire bourgeois class
