a critic author daniel handler initially viewed count olaf as being a james mason type carrey was not familiar with book series when he was cast but he became a fan of series handler s books are just a bold and original way to tell a children s story actor explained carrey was also attracted to role despite self parody concerns director brad silberling was open to carrey s idea of improvisation for various scenes especially stephano and captain sham alter egos to make his prosthetic makeup more comfortable and easier to apply carrey shaved his head bald for part actor s inspiration for olaf

silberling took over then her character s accent was changed to american production development nickelodeon movies purchased film rights to a series of unfortunate events novel series in may 2000 paramount pictures owner of nickelodeon movies agreed to co finance along with scott rudin various directors including terry gilliam and roman polanski were interested in making film one of author daniel handler s favorite candidates was guy maddin in june 2002 barry sonnenfeld was hired to direct he was chosen because he previously collaborated with rudin and because of his black comedy directing style from addams family addams family values and get shorty sonnenfeld referred to lemony snicket novels as his favorite children s stories director hired handler to write script with intention of making lemony snicket as a musical and cast jim carrey as count olaf in september 2002 film suffered setbacks in development in december 2002 rudin left unfortunate events over budget concerns while sonnenfeld and carrey remained sonnenfeld admitted he was skeptical of paramount s 100 million budget studio decided that changing shoot from hollywood to wilmington north carolina would be less expensive april 2003 start date was also pushed back paramount eventually settled situation in january 2003 by enlisting help from dreamworks to co finance film but sonnenfeld vacated director s position rudin and sonnenfeld had no involvement with film afterward but were credited as executive producers carrey remained with approval over hiring of next director very little of what i wrote is in film which i actually think is appropriate being as that i was writing it for barry sonnenfeld it s a director s medium and brad makes entirely different films from barry sonnenfeld i wasn t filled with resentment because they didn t use it my script i was just disappointed because i d worked a long time on it and scott rudin barry sonnenfeld and i were all sort of ready to go along with jim carrey with film that we had so it was sort of a long rocky journey but that s all in past series author daniel handler brad silberling signed on to direct in february 2003 he was not familiar with series when he was first approached he quickly read first three novels and was excited that hollywood was taking a chance to put over 100 million to adapt these inventive children s books onto screen handler who wrote eight drafts of script for sonnenfeld was replaced by robert gordon in may 2003 handler approved of changes that were made to his original screenplay i was offered credit on film for screenwriting by writers guild of america handler continued but i didn t take it because i didn t write it i felt like it would be an insult to guy who did filming filming was set to begin in october 2003 but it was pushed back principal photography for lemony snicket s a series of unfortunate events began on november 10 2003 using sound stages and backlot at paramount studios in hollywood director brad silberling avoided using too many digital or chroma key effects because he wanted younger actors to feel as if they were working in a realistic environment olaf s mansion occupied two sound stages while graveyard and ruins of baudelaire mansion were constructed on paramount back lot after 21 weeks of shooting at paramount production then moved to downey studios a former nasa facility in downey california for eight more weeks downey housed circular railroad crossing set complete with forced perspective scenery as well as a newly constructed water tank complete with over one million gallons of water water tank was instrumental in filming scenes set at briny beach lake lachrymose damocles dock and curdled cave filming for a series of unfortunate events ended on may 29 2004 design thumb left alt character count olaf played by jim carrey sports an idyllic top hat and black striped overcoat seen from his thighs and up behind him shows a bleak cornfield on left and a gas station on right station has a red and white striped awning and looks worn olaf faces to driver s side window of car and he positions his right hand as if he s pointing at something above him while concentrating his eyes on window and holding car keys in his left hand some scenery was designed using forced perspective techniques combined with matte paintings silberling production designer rick heinrichs and costume designer colleen atwood all aimed for film s setting to be ambiguous giving it a timeless feel heinrichs also added steampunk designs to period a woeful world 2005 paramount dvd to contribute to setting silberling hired emmanuel lubezki as cinematographer because he was impressed with trio s work on sleepy hollow lubezki compared cinematic similarities to sleepy hollow notably monochromatic look of both films he also chose a specific color palette backdrop for a series of unfortunate events story is very episodic so we picked a different color scheme for each section for example lubezki continued count olaf s house has a lot of greens blacks and grays house of uncle monty has a lot of greens and browns and a bit of yellow and house of aunt josephine has blues and blacks railroad crossing set was constructed on a cyclorama which was most ambitious setpiece for art department on using elements of in house special effects and matte paintings visual effects industrial light magic ilm supervised by created film s 505 visual effects shots filmmakers used as few digital effects as possible though train and smoke for railroad crossing scene was entirely created using computer animation ilm also used color grading techniques for lake lachrymose scene which required complete animation for leeches digital animators studied footage of 2003 atlantic hurricane season to accurately depict hurricane herman which was ilm s most ambitious use of computer generated imagery cgi for film nexus productions designed opening littlest elf animated sequence by modeling it after stop motion animation and completing it with computer animation snakes at uncle monty s house were a combination of real snakes and animatronics animatronics primarily incredibly deadly viper were used as reference models that ilm later enhanced using cgi because working with infants was sometimes risky in producing a film four scenes involving sunny baudelaire required cgi with motion capture technology among these are shot of sunny hanging on to a table by her teeth catching a spindle with her mouth and scene where she is entangled with incredibly deadly viper animation supervisor colin brady used his baby daughter for motion capture recording a remote controlled animatronic of sunny was also designed by kevin another show of visual effects used for film was in opening with littlest elf stop motion filming was done for film s beginning until it is interrupted by jude law who as lemony snicket lets audience know that film they will see is most unpleasant release marketing in october 2002 nickelodeon movies hired activision who actually had a partnership with dreamworks to create film s tie in video game agreement also included options for sequels director brad silberling delivered his first cut of film to studio in august 2004 fearing his original version was too dark paramount and dreamworks conducted test screenings film was then re edited over family friendliness concerns given its december release film s marketing campaign was criticized for being a deliberately anti holiday comedy with taglines like taking cheer out of christmas and mishaps misadventures mayhem oh joy premiere for lemony snicket s a series of unfortunate events was held at cinerama dome on december 13 2004 a tent display on vine street was decorated with pieces from film s sets home media lemony snicket s a series of unfortunate events was released on dvd and vhs on april 26 2005 a portuguese labeled all region blu ray was released in 2012 and

162 reviews with an average rating of 6 7 10 site s critical consensus reads although it softens nasty edges of its source material lemony snicket s a series of unfortunate events is a gothic visual treat and it features a hilariously manic turn from jim carrey as evil count olaf on metacritic they gave film a score of 62 out of 100 based on 37 critics indicating generally favorable reviews robert k elder of chicago tribune praised rick heinrichs s production design and jim carrey for having a balanced performance as a scene stealer elder called film exceptionally clever hilariously gloomy and subversive desson thomson from washington post reasoned over a fellow film goer s characterization of count olaf olaf is a humorless villain in book he s not amusing like carrey at all to which i would counter if you can t let carrey be carrey put someone boring and less expensive in role in his various disguises he s rubbery inventive and inspired i particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur ty burr writing in boston globe observed director brad silberling has essentially made a tim burton movie without weird shafts of adolescent pain at same time silberling s not a hack like chris columbus and snicket has more zip and inspired than first two harry potter films film s no masterpiece but at least you re in hands of people who know what they re doing movie like books flatters children s innate sense that world is not a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying to sell you something how you deal with cognitive dissonance of a 125 million hollywood picture telling you this is up to you at least there are no lemony snicket happy meals yet internet reviewer james berardinelli felt that film is first and foremost a fantasy but there are dark currents running just beneath surface i give silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow film lemony snicket s a series of unfortunate events manages to remain witty throughout roger ebert gave a mixed review jim carrey is over top as count olaf but i suppose a character named count olaf is over top by definition i liked film but i ll tell you what i think this one is a tune up for series a trial run in which they figure out what works and what needs to be tweaked original spider man was a disappointment but same team came back and made spider man 2 best superhero movie ever made scott foundas of variety gave a negative review criticizing filmmakers for sacrificing storyline in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography he wrote a series of unfortunate events suggests what mary poppins might have looked like had tim burton directed it not surprisingly burton s longtime production designer rick heinrichs was responsible for sets while ace emmanuel lubezki burton s sleepy hollow contributed expressionistic lighting schemes awards award category recipient result academy awards best makeup valli o reilly and bill corso best art direction rick heinrichs and cheryl best costume design colleen atwood best original score thomas newman visual effects society outstanding performance by an animated character in a live action motion picture rick o connor martin murphy indira sam breach saturn awards best fantasy film best make up valli o reilly and bill corso best dvd special edition release possible franchise and reboot possible film franchise paramount pictures dreamworks and nickelodeon movies hoped film would become a franchise like harry potter film series jim carrey thought his character would be good as basis for a film franchise since it would allow him to dive into a new role i don t have a deal for a sequel but it s one that i wouldn t mind doing again because there are so many characters actor explained in december 2004 i mean it s just so much fun it s so much fun being a bad actor playing a character in may 2005 producer laurie macdonald said lemony snicket is still something paramount is interested in pursuing and we re going to be talking with them more in october 2008 daniel handler said that a sequel does seem to be in works paramount has had quite a few corporate which has led to many a delay of course many many plans in hollywood come to naught but i m assured that another film will be made someday perhaps in june 2009 silberling confirmed he still talked about project with handler and suggested sequel be a stop motion film with each film being in a new medium due to young lead actors having grown too old to continue their roles in an odd way best thing you could do is actually have lemony snicket say to audience okay we pawned first film off as a mere dramatization with actors now i m afraid i m going to have to show you real thing netflix series in november 2014 netflix announced its plans of creating a television series to adapt entire novel series series stars neil patrick harris malina weissman louis hynes and presley smith with patrick warburton as lemony snicket series also titled a
