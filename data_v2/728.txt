kepier power station refers to a cancelled coal fired power station on river wear at kepier north east of durham county durham north east england planned by north eastern electric supply company nesco in 1944 it was never realised as scheme faced stiff opposition from those who claimed it would obstruct views of historic durham cathedral from east coast main line a number of people supported scheme as it would help meet increasing demand for electricity and provide much needed jobs in post depression post war economy of britain station which had been designed by architect giles gilbert scott would have been operational by late 1940s and would have generated 150 megawatts of electricity however following a public inquiry plans were not approved and instead nesco installed additional capacity at their existing power stations background after several years of preliminary planning surveying sites and drawing up plans north eastern electric supply company nesco bought site of a large rifle range over both sides of river wear at kepier north east of city of durham and in early 1944 publicly announced their plans to build a large coal fired power station on site station was part of a post war plan by nesco and scheme had a projected cost of ps3 500 000 site was chosen in mid durham area to be close to coal supplies it also needed to be a short distance from river wear downstream of durham and on solid foundations mine workings in county durham restricted number of possible sites which could meet requirement for solid foundations site also required good road and rail access estimated build time for station was around four years and once completed station was expected to employ around 300 people in june 1944 nesco formally submitted their plans for consent of construction design station s site plans and elevations were designed by giles gilbert scott he had previously designed battersea power station in london and so designs of kepier station were considered to have been of a very high architectural quality nesco claimed that design of station would be considered a credit to whole district main station building was to be in height station would have burned between 1 500 and 2 000 tonnes of low grade coal per week to produce 150 megawatts mw of electricity coal was to be taken from mines in county durham and transported to station by durham goods branch of line railway which terminated at nearby new sidings would have been required to reach site from railway line which would have required cutting into hillside above kepier upon arriving at station coal would have been discharged from wagons above station and transported via a conveyor belt over six arches down to station itself coal burnt would have had an estimated ash content of between 14 and 22 and so at a cost of ps160 000 company were to install electrostatic precipitators to remove 97 of dust from smoke and waste gases from combustion before leaving two high chimneys view at time was that remaining dust that would leave chimneys would not have caused any appreciable pollution and waste gases consisting of carbon dioxide were thought not to cause any injury or harm to inhabitants of city to buildings or to vegetation between 350 and 450 tonnes of bottom ash clinker would be produced by station per week nesco intended to sell this on to local construction companies as a construction material and believed there was a ready market for this fly ash from precipitators would also have built up and nesco claimed they would have spread this on land to west of station and mixed it with soil to produce a high spoil tip station would have featured six high cooling towers it was said that there would be provision to prevent excessive amounts of steam leaving cooling towers with no haze coming from towers on 95 of days of year criticism and support thumb right it was thought that power station would interfere with views of durham cathedral from railway line when plans were first announced county surveyor raised no objections and it was not until october 1943 and onwards that ministry of town and country planning began to increasingly warn of opposition that was bound to arise against scheme plans were strongly opposed by thomas wilfred sharp an urban planner from durham who thought that station would intrude on city s skyline they were also opposed by city of durham preservation society now city of durham trust which had been founded two years earlier at time station had been given go ahead by durham city council and planning authority but trust believed station s tall chimneys and cooling towers would dwarf nearby durham cathedral nesco argued that they thought power station would enhance city s attractions with people coming to see power station itself at least they tried to assure public that if built station would take as little away from city as possible an official statement from company stated consultants of every kind will be employed in connection with construction and city corporation can rest assured that every precaution will be taken both in design and working of station to cause as little harm as possible to amenities of city nesco also argued that they had chosen site to protect city s amenities in that it was outside city boundary partially surrounded by higher ground and in lee of prevailing winds they also said that much could be done architecturally to fit station into its surroundings local trade unions durham county council and even farmers union were in support of scheme along with a number of private persons general reason being that it would bring a new form of employment to city and surrounding areas opponents to station however claimed that new jobs at power station would go to specialist technicians brought into region and that positioning of station near durham would not be beneficial to city s electricity supply or make cost of electricity any cheaper for those living near station critics also claimed that wherever in region a new power station were to be built county durham coal would be used in it and that despite nesco s claims there may be more suitable sites elsewhere critics claimed that durham s functioning as a cultural educational administrative and tourist centre would be ultimately destroyed by heavy industrialisation at a meeting of durham county council on 26 july 1944 j w foster chairman of finance committee of council spoke in favour of proposals claiming they would fulfill government s white paper on employment policy and its policy on rehabilitation of depressed areas at outbreak of war north of country had still not fully recovered from great depression of 1930s and foster believed employment station s construction and maintenance provided would help prevent a return to those conditions it was also seen that station would generally improve supply of electricity for industry he pointed out that criticism of scheme was based entirely on assumption that station would destroy medieval charm of city without taking into account thoughts of experts who designed station he also pointed out that critics made their comments without any suggestion of an alternative and that their campaign against scheme had attracted publicity through a bbc broadcast foster also claimed that if any other feasible site could be found then it should be used to avoid any violation of view however he warned that interest of county s economy should be put in front of concerns of those ill informed critics who view durham from railway passing from one more fortunate district to another durham mp charles grey later referred to development as vital to well being of county of durham british architect frederick gibberd published a diagrammatic comparison of durham cathedral alongside a power station typical of design of time like one planned at kepier this made clear that although cathedral was one of largest in country it still would looked small next to projected power station it was argued that as long as two structures were viewed simultaneously visual juxtaposition would be detrimental to cathedral somewhat ironically gibberd s didcot power station would later be voted third worst eyesore in britain in 2003 although geographically located north east and lower it was thought that kepier power station would dominate any view into which it entered and that it would enter into most of views in city a northern echo reader summarised these ideas in 1944 as traveller by train approaches kepier and durham from north there would meet his eye in foreground this vast power station kepier a local beauty spot and picturesque remains of kepier hospital a building of much historic interest would be blotted out castle and cathedral beyond would be dwarfed by an incongruous mass of concrete buildings ill sorting with landscape inquiry after suggestion by head of ministry of war transport cyril hurcomb to conduct a joint local hearing chaired by an outsider was turned down by government due to much greater means being needed government agreed that a public inquiry should be opened a public inquiry into plans was opened in december 1944 with hearing lasting for three days ministry of town and country planning appointed hurcomb as chairman of inquiry electricity commissioners appointed george pepler and c g morley new key opponents of scheme were city of durham preservation society chaired by cyril alington nesco were represented by craig henderson and sydney turner nesco representatives argued that although company already supplied around 85 of north east region a great deal more generating capacity would need to be built to meet demand for years to come and that mid durham area was best place to erect a new station henderson claimed only real opposition to scheme was that it would interfere with amenities of durham john hacking chief engineer of central electricity board backed nesco because if scheme were declined and consent and new arrangements had to be made they would have no new plant in operation until after 1948 a plasticine model of station city and surroundings was used in inquiry it was accompanied by a certificate of essentiality issued by electricity commissioners photographs of city were also shown with power station superimposed during hearing hurcomb pointed out a letter published in times in july 1944 in which bishop and dean of durham and warden of durham colleges had given misleading impression that proposed station would ruin views from railway line an idea compounded by publication a few days later of a photograph taken from proposed site he acknowledged that a number of views from parts of river would be ruined and that station would be visible from cathedral and church hurcomb emphasised that majority of beautiful views around city would remain pepler also found that from railway station power station and cathedral could not be viewed simultaneously members of inquiry initially concluded that station should be given go ahead based on grounds that a more suitable site could not be decided upon city of durham preservation society however argued that with so many of europe s finest monuments being destroyed in second world war durham and its cathedral was a gem which had survived both war and industrial which had laid waste so much of rest of county pepler supported view that durham was more suited as an administrative shopping and tourist centre than it was for large scale industrial development legal and political difficulties caused a long delay in reaching a decision an important issue was whether or not inquiry was subject to new town and country planning act of 1944 nesco from beginning challenged right of minister of town and planning w s morrison to convene an inquiry at all initial legal advice to government was that it was not subject and inquiry was convened with terms of reference that they were to consider whether a proposed new or extended station could supply sufficient electricity to meet needs of consumers at no greater cost than any alternative source of supply in hurcomb s view inquiry could not refuse consent if these conditions were met a later decision by treasury solicitor that inquiry was in fact subject to act had effect of paralysing decision making if hurcomb persisted in adhering to his terms of reference and approved power station but durham rural district council then withheld planning consent on grounds of objections nesco would be entitled to compensation for their losses due to delay and building on a new site district council would be liable for this but it was out of question that they would be able to afford large amount involved and government wished to avoid stepping in to pay themselves if inquiry could be persuaded to find against nesco then no compensation would be payable and hurcomb came under pressure from ministers to do just that hurcomb argued that this would be denying compensation to those entitled to it and by april 1945 decision on station was still being delayed chairman of nesco at time voiced his anger in times and frank tribe secretary of ministry of fuel and power wrote to hurcomb asking if anything could be done to bring inquiry to a decision eventually hurcomb put forward at a ministerial meeting a solution whereby members of inquiry would inform nesco that on purely technical grounds they would have approved scheme but due to opposition of morrison they had decided not to proceed to a decision although nesco were initially hostile in june 1945 they agreed to drop scheme on condition that they received a letter from morrison agreeing that they had satisfied commissioners on technical grounds thus entitling them to compensation government thought site was open to well founded objections and even if scheme had proceeded past inquiry stage they would have refused consent anyway outcome ultimately decision of inquiry went against nesco and those in support of station and company dropped their plans nesco received an ex gratia payment of ps6 650 from ministry of town and country planning for expenditure incurred to that point site itself was inherited by nationalised british electricity authority in 1948 and they eventually sold it on 9 october 1945 minister of town and country planning lewis silkin made clear in house of commons that nesco had begun extending their existing power stations by installing additional generating plant at sites other than kepier sufficing demand for electricity and meaning no station was needed at kepier references category coal fired power stations in england category power stations in north east england
