1975 and 1976 regardless of when struck each coin bears double date 1776 1976 on normal obverses for washington quarter kennedy half dollar and eisenhower dollar no coins dated 1975 of any of three denominations were minted given past abuses in system mint advocated against issuance of commemorative coins starting in 1950s beginning in 1971 members of congress introduced bills to authorize coins to honor united states bicentennial which would occur in 1976 mint through its director mary brooks initially opposed such proposals but later supported them and congress passed legislation requiring temporary redesign of reverse of quarter half dollar and dollar a nationwide competition resulted in designs of a colonial drummer for quarter independence hall for half dollar and liberty bell superimposed against moon for dollar all three coins remain common today due to quantity struck circulation pieces were in copper nickel congress also mandated 45 000 000 part silver pieces be struck for collectors mint sold over half of part silver coins before melting remainder after withdrawing them from sale in 1986 background commemorative coins had been struck for a number of events and anniversaries by united states mint since 1892 organizations would get congress to authorize a coin and would be allowed to buy up issue selling it to public at a premium final issue among these commemoratives half dollars honoring booker t washington and george washington carver were struck over a number of years and were discontinued in 1954 originally priced at 3 50 they were repeatedly discounted many could not be sold at a premium and entered circulation promoter of these issues s j phillips mishandled distribution and lost 140 000 negative publicity caused department of treasury of which mint is a part to oppose subsequent commemorative coin proposals and until 1970s congress passed none in 1966 congress established american revolutionary bicentennial commission arbc to plan and coordinate activities connected with 1976 bicentennial of american independence bicentennial in february 1970 arbc established a coins and medals advisory committee committee s initial report in july 1970 called for production of a commemorative half dollar for bicentennial in december 1970 committee called for special designs for all denominations of us coinage for bicentennial arbc endorsed this position following month treasury however opposed change following its longstanding position against commemorative coins several proposals for bicentennial coins were introduced in congress in 1971 and 1972 but did not pass mint director mary brooks had attended advisory committee meetings at one meeting she supported having a 1776 1976 double date on circulating coins to mark anniversary in 1976 although accommodating two dates on obverse would involve production difficulties however in a newspaper interview she termed idea of changing six circulating coins cent through dollar a disaster she felt if any bicentennial coin was issued it should be non circulating perhaps a half cent or a gold piece brooks believed that such a coin would not disrupt mint in production of coins for circulation during 1972 however she retreated from that position and by end of year had persuaded treasury secretary george shultz to support a bicentennial coin bill authorization in january 1973 texas representative richard c white introduced legislation for commemorative dollars and half dollars oregon senator mark hatfield also put forward a bill calling for a 25 gold piece on march 2 1973 treasury announced its support for bicentennial coin legislation for design changes to reverses of circulating dollars and half dollars and sent proposed legislation to congress three days later hearings before a subcommittee in house of representatives were held on may 2 1973 brooks testified supporting limited redesign in bill but opposing a more extensive coin redesign separately from bicentennial matter she asked for authority to strike us coins at west point bullion depository where space was available to install older coinage presses brooks deprecated hatfield proposal stating that coin would have to be 667 pure or less to avoid hoarding as a result of hearings several additional bills were introduced and additional hearings were held before a senate subcommittee on june 6 brooks testified again and responding to criticism that only two least popular denominations were to be changed indicated her support for a bicentennial quarter as well on june 13 a bill s 1141 which provided for a circulating bicentennial quarter half dollar and dollar gave permission for coins to be struck at west point and allowed for 40 silver clad versions of new coins for collectors was reported favorably by senate banking committee it passed senate on july 13 however amendments authorizing us citizens to own gold and to implement hatfield proposal were attached to bill a similar bill passed house of representatives on september 12 differing from senate bill in lacking any provision relating to gold and in not authorizing silver versions of new coins members of two houses met in a conference committee on september 19 in a session described by onlookers as fairly hot and heavy resulting bill had no gold provisions but authorized changes to reverses of quarter half dollar and dollar for bicentennial obverses of three coins would not change but would bear double date 1776 1976 by terms of statute all coins minted to be issued after july 4 1975 and before january 1 1977 would bear bicentennial dates and designs congress directed mint to strike 45 000 000 silver clad coins that is 15 000 000 sets and mint received requested authority to strike coins at west point circulation quarters half dollars and dollars would continue to be of copper nickel bonded to an internal layer of copper that is copper nickel clad modified bill passed both houses of congress on october 4 1973 and bill was signed into law by president richard nixon on october 18 hatfield s measure along with similar legislation from other senators was reintroduced in 1975 but died in committee as did legislation seeking a bicentennial two cent piece and a bill seeking a coin honoring abigail adams and susan b anthony extra production at west point was key to overcoming a shortage of cents in 1974 and permitted mint greater flexibility as it geared up to strike bicentennial pieces competition on october 23 1973 department of treasury announced a competition for three reverse designs any us citizen could submit one drawing or photograph of a plaster model in diameter submissions were to include legend treasury secretary shultz advised by a panel of judges would decide which design would be used for which denomination inscription would be changed to and for higher denominations additionally reverses were to bear name of country and motto as required by law at director brooks request national sculpture society selected five judges for competition judges were society president robert weinman son of adolph weinman who had designed mercury dime and walking liberty half dollar connecticut sculptor adlai s hardin former mint chief engraver gilroy roberts julius of medallic art company and elvira curator in division of numismatics smithsonian institution deadline was originally december 14 1973 but was extended to january 9 1974 because of energy crisis and christmas mail delays brooks traveled more than to publicize competition by deadline mint had received 15 000 inquiries and 884 entries members of panel and any person employed by us government as a sculptor were ineligible to enter prize for each of three winners was 5 000 judging was originally supposed to take place at west point with delay it took place instead at philadelphia mint from entries judges selected twelve semifinalist designs sculptor submitting each received a prize of 750 competitors were to place their work on plaster models if that had not already been done and were offered assistance in making models preparation twelve remaining designs were released by treasury for public comment in early 1974 two of proposed coins featured sailing ships two featured independence hall in philadelphia where declaration of independence was signed and three depicted moon or lunar spacecraft another depicted liberty bell superimposed on an atomic symbol according to numismatist michael marotta in his 2001 article on bicentennial coins numismatic community s reaction to entries was predictable everyone complained by writing letters to editor from twelve judges selected six finalists for review by national bicentennial coin design competition committee consisting of brooks representative wright patman senator john commission of fine arts secretary charles h atherton and eric p newman chairman of arbc s coins and medals advisory committee after receiving committee s recommendations secretary shultz selected winners and on march 6 1974 brooks went on today show to announce them jack l ahr s design featuring a colonial drummer with a torch of victory surrounded by thirteen stars representing original states was selected for quarter seth huntington s image of independence hall was selected for half dollar while dennis r williams superimposition of liberty bell against moon was successful for dollar ahr owned a commercial art firm and huntington was head artist for brown and bigelow a minneapolis publishing firm williams at age r williams designer youngest person to design a us coin was an art student who had originally created his design for a class assignment no change would be made to obverses of coins except for double dating thumb this 1973 bicentennial stamp like quarter depicts a colonial drummer ahr was accused of copying his drummer from a 1973 stamp by stamp s designer william a smith he denied it according to numismatic historian walter breen both obviously derive from archibald willard s 1876 painting spirit of 76 a painting which numismatic author david l ganz suggests that both undoubtedly saw sometime in their lives ahr however stated that his son had been model for drummer brooks in a letter to smith stated that design for quarter was sufficiently original to impress national sculpture society weinman later deprecated winning designs i really don t think what we got was a great bargain nothing we selected was a real winner that i d fight to death for in terms of what we had to work with though i think we did best we could on april 24 1974 three winning designers were brought to washington d c after a tour of white house and meetings with congressional committees which considered coin bills they went to treasury building and received their 5 000 checks from new treasury secretary william e simon who jokingly asked them if they wanted to invest their awards in savings bonds mint chief engraver frank gasparro made minor changes to all three reverse designs gasparro simplified quarter design altered drum for sake of authenticity changed lettering and modified expression on drummer s face he made slight changes to independence hall on half dollar and altered lettering on dollar to facilitate metal flow during stamping and asked designer to straighten bottom edge of liberty bell d r williams ahr later stated that he would have liked more time to finalize his design wishing to clarify features of drummer s face initials of designer were added to design by mint all three agreed that gasparro s changes improved their designs production thumb 242px mint director mary brooks presents president gerald ford center with first set of bicentennial coins november 13 1974 as american revolutionary bicentennial administration director john warner looks on on august 12 1974 three designers were at philadelphia mint where they ceremonially operated presses to strike first coins bearing their designs these prototypes were exhibited under armed guard at american numismatic association convention in florida next day they differ from all other bicentennial coins in that they were struck in silver proof without mint mark other silver proof coins bear an s mint mark as struck at san francisco assay office as san francisco mint was then known coins struck at denver bear a d on obverse pieces lacking a mint mark were struck at philadelphia sets of these prototypes were presented to president gerald ford counselor to president anne armstrong and director john warner of american revolutionary bicentennial administration successor to arbc all other first strikes were melted with copies not even kept for national numismatic collection mint believed that if it was required to strike 1975 quarters half dollars and dollars not enough could be struck before it had to begin bicentennial issues to prevent 1975 pieces from becoming collector s items this risked coin shortages at a time when mint was seeking to build a surplus of quarters mint officials returned to congress to seek amending legislation president ford signed a bill on december 26 1974 that made several noncontroversial changes to law including provisions to allow mint to keep striking 1974 dated pieces until it began striking bicentennial coins by terms of amending legislation commemorative coins could not be issued until after july 4 1975 on november 15 1974 mint began taking orders for silver clad pieces at a price of 15 for proof sets and 9 for uncirculated with a deadline for orders of january 31 1975 uncirculated coins are like those newly released into circulation proof coins have a mirror finish buyers were initially limited to five sets per person on january 19 1975 brooks announced that silver proof set price was cut to 12 and order limit was waived buyers who had paid higher price were sent refunds by check brooks stated that price reduction was because of production efficiencies benefit of which she wished to pass along to public numismatic columnist ed reiter noted though that reduction came amidst protests from numismatic community that price was too high coin dealer herby skelton suggested in 1977 that initial high price for sets followed by reduction together with large mintage of silver sets made public suspicious and contributed to lagging sales on august 20 1975 price for uncirculated silver sets was reduced to 7 when bulk purchases of 50 or more were made a bank in taiwan ordered 250 000 sets at this price first bicentennial coins to be produced that were intended for public were dollars struck during february 1975 first for collectors were struck at san francisco on april 23 1975 san francisco assay office struck 45 000 000 silver coins first producing eleven million sets in uncirculated and four million in proof then began base metal pieces once striking began mint found that copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly a problem not seen with silver pieces mint modified dies most noticeable change is that revised issue or type ii as it came to be known have narrower sharper lettering on reverse all silver pieces struck only at san francisco are type i all three mints struck both type i and type ii copper nickel pieces all dollars included in 1975 proof sets are type i all those included in 1976 proof sets are type ii bicentennial coins for collectors were not delivered until after july 4 1975 bicentennial pieces in base metal were included in 1975 proof sets and mint sets together with 1975 dated cents nickels and dimes new coins first entered circulation on july 7 1975 when half dollar was released in conjunction with ceremonies in minneapolis huntington s hometown quarter followed in september and dollar in october each also with ceremonies to mark issuance pieces were struck in numbers exceeding those needed for circulation a mint spokesman stated theory in striking them was to have enough available so as many americans as possible would have an opportunity to have a coinage commemoration of bicentennial year they re mementos in 1977 mint returned to old reverse designs for quarter half dollar and dollar sales by mid 1977 had dropped off considerably to perhaps 300 sets a week with one mint official describing sales against massive unsold quantities as a drop in bucket by 1979 mint anticipated an eventual sellout for silver proof set but admitted that with massive quantities unsold there was no realistic possibility of selling all uncirculated silver sets on september 17 1979 faced with a spike in silver prices mint director stella b hackel announced that sets were being removed from sale they were returned to sale in august 1980 at increased prices of 20 in proof and 15 in uncirculated in september 1981 mint citing a decline in price of silver reduced price of sets to 15 in proof and 12 in uncirculated a limit of 100 sets per person was set on proof sales with none on uncirculated a large number of sets were melted by government in 1982 reagan administration mint director donna pope later stated sales of 1776 1976 regular issue bicentennial coins went on and on seemingly forever on december 31 1986 remaining bicentennial uncirculated silver sets were removed from sale at time it was announced that proof sets had already sold out when coins went off sale however marotta writing in 2001 stated that when sales ceased 400 000 proof sets and 200 000 uncirculated sets remained in inventory due to large quantities struck bicentennial coins remain inexpensive a set of three silver coins contains of precious metal in a 1996 statistical study t v buttrey found that about 750 000 000 of circulation quarters more than a third had been hoarded and did not circulate coin dealer marcel suggested in 1977 of silver sets there were just too many sold and i think it will take a long time before they have any real value maybe by
