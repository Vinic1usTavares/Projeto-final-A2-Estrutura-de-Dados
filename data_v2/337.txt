atlanta was a casemate ironclad that served in confederate and union navies during american civil war she was converted from a british built blockade runner named fingal by confederacy after she made one run to savannah georgia after several failed attempts to attack union blockaders ship was captured by two union monitors in 1863 when she ran aground atlanta was floated off repaired and rearmed serving in union navy for rest of war she spent most of her time deployed on james river supporting union forces there ship was decommissioned in 1865 and placed in reserve several years after end of war atlanta was sold to haiti but was lost at sea in december 1869 on her delivery voyage description and career as fingal fingal was designed and built as a merchantman by j g thomson s clyde bank iron shipyard at govan in glasgow scotland and was completed early in 1861 she was described by midshipman dabney scales who served on atlanta before her battle with monitors as being a two masted iron hulled ship long with a beam of she had a draft of and a depth of hold of he estimated her tonnage at around 700 tons bm fingal was equipped with two vertical single cylinder direct acting steam engines using steam generated by one flue tubular boiler engines drove ship at a top speed of around they had a bore of and a stroke of emerson pp 368 371 377 ship briefly operated between glasgow and other ports in scotland for hutcheson s west highland service before she was purchased in september 1861 by james d bulloch primary foreign agent in great britain for confederacy and major edward clifford anderson confederate secretary of war in england to deliver military and naval ordnance and supplies that they purchased to disguise his control of fingal and destination of her cargo bulloch hired an english crew and captain and put out his destination as bermuda and nassau in bahamas cargo was loaded in greenock in early october although bullock and other passengers would not attempt to board until they rendezvoused with ship at holyhead wales on night 14 15 october as she was slowly rounding breakwater at holyhead fingal rammed and sank austrian brig slowly swinging at anchor without lights bulloch and passengers embarked in steamer while bulloch dispatched a letter to his financial agents instructing them to settle damages with brig s owners because he could not afford to take time to deal with affair lest he and fingal be detained bullock pp 110 15 ship reached bermuda on 2 november and after leaving port on 7 november bulloch informed crew that steamer s real destination was savannah georgia he offered to take anyone who objected to plan to nassau however all of crew agreed to join in effort to run union blockade fingal was able slip safely into savannah estuary in a heavy fog on night of 12 november without sighting any blockaders scharf pp 639 40 while fingal was discharging her cargo bulloch and anderson went to richmond to confer with stephen mallory secretary of navy mallory endorsed bulloch s plan to load fingal with cotton to sell on navy department s account to be used to purchase more ships and equipment in europe wise p 56 he returned to savannah on 23 november and it took him almost a month to purchase a cargo and acquire enough coal he made one attempt to break through blockade on 23 december but it proved impossible to do as union controlled every channel from savannah aided by their occupation of tybee island at mouth of savannah river bulloch reported to mallory in late january 1862 that breaking out was hopeless so mallory ordered him to turn ship over to another officer and to return to europe some other way scharf pp 640 41 as atlanta thumb left cross section of atlanta brothers asa and nelson received contract to convert blockade runner into an ironclad in early 1862 with name of atlanta after city in georgia this was largely financed by contributions from women of savannah fingal was cut down to her main deck and large wooden sponsons were built out from sides of her hull to support her casemate emerson p 373 after conversion atlanta was long overall and had a beam of silverstone p 151 her depth of hold was now and she now had a draft of atlanta now displaced and her speed was estimated at emerson p 377 armor of casemate was angled at 30deg from horizontal and made from two layers of railroad rails rolled into plates thick and wide outer layer ran vertically and inner layer horizontally her armor was backed by of oak vertically oriented and two layers of of pine alternating in direction bottom of casemate was some from waterline and its top was above waterline pyramidal pilothouse was armored in same way and had room for two men upper portion of atlantas hull received of armor emerson pp 371 72 382 thumb 264px one of atlantas 7 inch brooke rifles in washington navy yard rectangular casemate was pierced with eight narrow gun ports one each at bow and stern and three along each side each gun port was protected by an armored shutter made of two layers of iron riveted together and allowed guns to elevate only to a maximum of 5 to 7deg atlanta was armed with single banded brooke rifles on pivot mounts at bow and stern emerson p 372 middle gun port on each side was occupied by a single banded brooke rifle 17 caliber seven inch guns weighed about and fired armor piercing bolts and explosive shells equivalent statistics for 18 5 caliber 6 4 inch gun were with 80 pound bolts and shells olmsted et al pp 126 27 218 224 atlanta was also armed with a solid iron ram that was reinforced by a series of vertical steel bars in front of ram was a spar torpedo that carried of black powder on a wooden pole connected to an iron lever that could be raised or lowered by means of pulleys emerson p 375 on 31 july 1862 under command of lieutenant charles h mcblair atlanta conducted her sea trials down savannah river toward fort pulaski scharf pp 641 42 ship proved to be difficult to steer and additional weight of her armor and guns significantly reduced her speed and increased her draft this latter was a real problem in shallow waters near savannah she also leaked significantly and her design virtually eliminated air circulation one report said that it was almost intolerable on board atlanta there being no method of ventilation and heat was intense scales commented in his diary what a infernal and god forsaken ship attempts were made to fix problems and were at least partially successful in stopping many of leaks emerson pp 371 71 ship was commissioned on 22 november and became flagship of flag officer josiah tattnall commander of naval defenses of georgia under pressure from mallory to engage blockading ships tattnall attempted to engage them before any ironclads arrived on 5 january 1863 but army engineers could not clear obstacles blocking channel in a timely manner despite early coordination being made by tattnall to do so it took another month to actually clear obstacles and two monitors arrived before end of january nonetheless tattnall attempted to pass through obstructions during high tide on 3 february but high winds prevented water from rising enough to allow ship to do so after atlanta successfully passed through them on 19 march tattnall planned to attack union base at port royal south carolina while monitors were attacking charleston deserters revealed s plan while he was waiting at head of wassaw sound and he was forced to retreat when three monitors augmented defenses at port royal dissatisfied with tattnall s perceived lack of aggressiveness mallory replaced tattnall as commander of savannah squadron later that month with commander richard l page page in his turn was relieved in may by commander william a webb atlanta remained squadron flagship throughout this time still pp 130 35 webb demonstrated his aggressiveness when he attempted to sortie on first spring tide 30 may after taking command but atlantas forward engine broke down after he had passed obstructions and ship ran aground she was not damaged although it took over a day to pull her free he planned to make another attempt on next full tide rejecting mallory s idea that he wait until nearly complete ironclad savannah was finished before his next sortie in meantime rear admiral samuel f du pont commander of south atlantic blockading squadron had ordered monitors weehawken and nahant into wassaw sound commander john rodgers in weehawken had overall command of two ships still pp 135 36 thumb 264px a drawing of uss weehawken capturing atlanta 17 june 1863 in early evening of 15 june webb began his next attempt by passing over lower obstructions in wilmington river and spent rest of night coaling he moved forward next evening to a concealed position within easy reach of monitors for an attack early following morning webb planned to sink one of monitors with his spar torpedo and then deal with other one with his guns still p 136 gunboat and tugboat resolute were to accompany him to tow one or both of monitors back to savannah emerson p 381 a lookout aboard weehawken spotted atlanta at 04 10 on morning of 17 june when latter ship closed to within about of two union ships she fired one round from her bow gun that passed over weehawken and landed near nahant shortly afterward atlanta ran aground on a sandbar she was briefly able to free herself but pressure of tide pushed her back onto sandbar this time webb was unable to get off and monitors closed range when weehawken leading ship closed to within she opened fire with both of her guns shell missed but shell struck ironclad above port middle gun port penetrated her armor and broke wooden backing behind it spraying splinters and fragments that disabled entire gun crew and half crew of bow gun even though it failed to cleanly penetrate through backing next shot from 11 inch dahlgren gun struck upper hull and started a small leak even though it failed to penetrate two inch armor there next shell from 15 inch dahlgren glanced off middle starboard gun shutter as it was being opened wounding half gun s crew with fragments final shell was also from 15 inch dahlgren and it struck top of pilothouse breaking armor there and wounding both pilots in it by this time atlanta had been able to fire only seven shots none of which hit either union ship and was hard aground with high tide not due for another hour and a half weehawken and nahant were able to freely maneuver into positions from which atlantas narrow gun ports would not allow her to reply and damage already inflicted by former ship made further resistance futile webb surrendered his ship within 15 minutes of opening fire before nahant even had a chance to fire of ironclad s 21 officers and 124 enlisted men one man was killed and another sixteen were wounded badly enough to require hospitalization emerson pp 381 82 still pp 136 37 in union navy thumb uss atlanta on james river photo by mathew brady atlanta was easily pulled free by union ships and she reached port royal under her own power not badly damaged she was repaired and bought by union navy prize money of 350 000 was shared between crews of weehawken nahant and gunboat only ships within signaling distance ship retained her name and was commissioned again on 2 february 1864 rearmed with a pair of 150

atlanta was assigned to north atlantic blockading squadron and spent most of her time stationed up james river where she could support operations against richmond and defend against a sortie by ironclads of james river squadron on 21 may 1864 she and gunboat fired on and dispersed confederate cavalry that was attacking fort powhatan and she was deployed further upriver in february 1865 after battle of trent s reach to better blockade confederate ironclads at richmond still p 186 after end of war in april atlanta was decommissioned in philadelphia on 21 june 1865 and placed in reserve at league island she was sold to sam ward on 4 may 1869 for price of 25 000 and subsequently delivered to representatives of haiti on 8 december by sydney a lawyer who had received an advance of 50 000 on her purchase price of 260 000 ship was briefly seized by customs service possibly for violations of neutrality laws as she had just loaded four large guns and a number of recruits for forces of sylvain president of haiti who was embroiled in a civil war atlanta was released and sailed for port au prince three days later she broke down in delaware bay and had to put in at chester pennsylvania
