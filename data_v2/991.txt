television critics upon its initial airing erica futterman of rolling stone gave a very positive review of episode and wrote this was our favorite type of glee episode though we enjoy over top spectacles show s real cleverness shines when they take songs from across board and fit them into a cohesive storyline sue sylvester didn t make an appearance and dare we say it we didn t even miss her bobby hankinson of houston chronicle enjoyed episode going on to write i thought it was a strong showing if a little disjointed well at least it was honest if this show is one thing it s disjointed it s part of its spazzy appeal melissa maerz of los angeles times gave episode a positive review on tuesday night glee wasn t only back at its usual time it was back to doing what it does best giving us entertaining storylines involving characters we care about who sing songs that emerge organically and advance story it was like a perfect heart shaped bubble of an episode reminding show s fans about all things we ve missed about show these last couple of months robert canning of ign also gave episode a positive review and opined with dissing of glee club temporarily put on hold glee series was able to have a little fun with tuesday night s episode and fun it was with gang of new directions taking on valentine s day with flirting kissing and of course singing without bullying this was a much lighter episode of glee and results gave way to a lot more laughs and story development he went on to praise ashley fink s performance as lauren zizes and said of puck s falling in love with lauren i can t decide if i want to root for this couple but i certainly know i m going to be rooting for lauren canning ultimately gave episode an 8 5 out of 10 wyndham wyeth of paste went on to praise episode for its depiction of relationships in high school as well as backing vocals for salling s performance of fat bottomed girls by queen emily vanderwerff of a v club gave episode a positive review and a grade of a silly love songs is a fine example of show at what s very nearly its absolute best there s nothing too heady here but if show has one tone that it s nailed almost completely consistently it s feeling of teenage romance sense that person you re in love with is only person you will ever be in love with followed almost immediately by crippling feeling of heartbreak of losing that person too soon teenage life moves fast and is filled with heightened emotions and like most musicals glee has always been at its best when it embraces those two sides of its characters lives as such silly love songs which is pretty much just an excuse to play around with show s many romantic pairings among its glee club characters is a lot of fun without trying all that hard in conclusion of her review she wrote best episodes play that elation and devastation off of each other worst episodes flounder about for some sort of emotional foothold but when glee just tells small sweet stories about these kids and ways they re trying to cope with being in high school when they know they re meant for bigger things it can be terrific tonight was one of those episodes and tonight s episode was terrific here s to a good february sweeps matt richenthal of tv fanatic gave episode a 4 6 out of 5 stars and went on to describe episode as a funny touching entertaining glee episode that didn t feature a single line from sue sylvester i never thought i d see day but that s exactly what transpired on silly love songs as show stopped feeling like a public service announcement for a week and actually focused on well paced well written relationship developments among its core characters joel keller of tv squad gave episode a positive review and wrote silly love songs strikes an interesting contrast to sunday night s post super bowl episode in that tonight was more about kids and where they are in their stories than about big production numbers and sue s cartoon evilness it was also funniest episode of season in no small part because we got some insight into lives of two new directions members we rarely get to hang out with for any length of time santana and lauren james poniewozik of time magazine praised storyline and musical performances of episode however soraya roberts of daily news gave episode a negative review this show sometimes sounds like it was written by a pit prime idiot tv writer it s almost as bad as tina breaking down into tears for no reason while singing my funny valentine to mike and blaine attempting to channel frank sinatra while singing paul mccartney s silly love songs in middle of lisa de moraes of washington post praised storyline calling it cohesive musical performances right thumb 200px critics reacted positively to puck s mark salling pictured rendition of fat bottomed girls musical covers and performances for episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike sandra gonzalez of entertainment weekly stated that her favorite was silly love songs by paul mccartney performed by warblers in a review of performance she wrote this is much more warbler esque than when i get you alone i had also been worried we wouldn t get our weekly dose of dorky warbler dance moves plus major points for blink and you ll miss it moment when blaine sang love won t come at all line to santana it was probably my personal biggest laugh out loud moment of episode she gave performance an a she also praised puck s performance of fat bottomed girls and opined in general i m in love with mark salling s voice he s right up there with artie in my book and this song was smothered in awesome sauce bonus points for puck s sort of feminine head bob brittany s background groovin club s reactions to him singing to lauren and mr s mild eye roll she went on to give performance an a kristin coachman of seattle post intelligencer was a bit more critical of puck s cover of song this week mark salling is singing queen s fat bottomed girls i know this song fits in with puck s storyline for episode but i feel like song was in wrong key for him at times it sounded like he was straining to hit higher notes because of this i have to wonder if backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out it seems depending on song selection for him salling s vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season tina s cover of my funny valentine stirred mixed emotions in gonzalez she criticized ending when she started sobbing it got weird then weirder then downright uncomfortable however she liked earlier part of performance and wrote it was when tina started getting choked up during her song because let s face it it happens you can love someone so much it hurts if she would have continued song with a mild lump in her throat i think i might have gotten choked up with her rachel s cover of firework by katy perry was reviewed negatively by coachman she wrote i m not loving michele s vocals on this track it was like they wanted to purposely make her sound like katy perry as much as i really like katy perry michele has more of a tremendous voice there are parts where i thought she sounded really great but for most part this song just wasn t my cup of tea michele has such a beautiful voice i wish she was given songs that would allow her to showcase it to her advantage katie morgan of billboard gave a positive review of warblers performance of silly love songs writing not only do they sound great but song brings a sugary sweet end to a super saccharine episode marquee blog at cnn gave music numbers a positive review a notable segment reads i just loved seeing warblers get their groove on amidst jeans and cotton t shirts and kurt was super gracious trying to be supportive of blaine in spite of his own feelings i also totally loved music and overall this was one of my favorite episodes this season brett berk of vanity fair praised salling s performance of fat bottomed girls as well as casts performances of p y t by michael jackson and when i get you alone by robin thicke erica futterman of rolling stone gave salling s performance a positive review she wrote we were thoroughly entertained by puck s attempt to win newbie lauren zizes over with his tribute to her larger figure only in puck s world would queen s raucous song qualify as a serenade and our horror turned amusement was mirrored on his fellow new directions faces puck is no freddie mercury but he handles melody well and makes up for lack of range with swagger chart
