coelurus is a genus of coelurosaurian dinosaur from late jurassic period mid late kimmeridgian faunal stage 155 152 million years ago name means hollow tail referring to its hollow tail vertebrae greek koilos koilos hollow oura oura tail although its name is linked to one of main divisions of theropods coelurosauria it has historically been poorly understood and sometimes confused with its better known contemporary ornitholestes like many dinosaurs studied in early years of paleontology it has had a confusing taxonomic history with several species being named and later transferred to other genera or abandoned only one species is currently recognized as valid type species c fragilis described by othniel charles marsh in 1879 it is known from one partial skeleton found in morrison formation of wyoming united states it was a small bipedal carnivore with elongate legs description thumb left restoration coelurus is known from most of skeleton of a single individual including numerous vertebrae partial pelvic and shoulder girdles and much of arms and legs stored at peabody museum of natural history however relative completeness of skeleton was not known until 1980 fossils were recovered from reed s quarry 13 at como bluff wyoming additionally two arm bones possibly belonging to this genus are known from cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry in utah it was not a large dinosaur its weight has been estimated at around with a length of about 2 4 meters 7 9 ft and a hip height of 0 7 meters 2 3 ft from reconstructions of skeleton coelurus had a relatively long neck and torso due to its long vertebrae a long slender hindlimb due to its long metatarsus and potentially a small slender skull thumb coelurus compared in size to an average adult human skull is unknown except for possibly a portion of lower jaw found at same site as rest of known coelurus material although it has same preservation and coloring as fossils known to belong to coelurus skeleton it is very slender which may mean it does not belong to skeleton this bone is 7 9 centimeters long 3 1 in but only 1 1 centimeters tall 0 43 in in general its vertebrae were long and low with low neural spines and thin walls to bodies of vertebrae its neck vertebrae were very pneumatic with numerous hollow spaces on their surfaces pleurocoels these hollows were not evenly distributed among vertebrae and varied in size neck vertebrae were very elongate with bodies four times longer than wide and they articulated with concave faces on both ends back vertebrae were not as elongate lacked surface hollows and had less developed concave faces and bodies that were hourglass shaped tail vertebrae also lacked surface hollows only bone known from shoulder girdle is a fragment of scapula upper arm had a distinct s shaped curve in side view and was slightly longer than forearm 11 9 centimeters 4 7 in versus 9 6 centimeters 3 8 in wrist had a carpal similar to that of deinonychus and fingers were long and slender only bone known from pelvic girdle is paired and fused pubis bones which had a prominent long foot at end thigh bones had an s shape when viewed from front metatarsals were unusually long and slender nearly length of thigh bones best preserved thigh bone is about 21 centimeters long 8 3 in coelurus ornitholestes and tanycolagreus three best known small theropods of morrison formation coelurus ornitholestes and tanycolagreus were generalized coelurosaurs and they have been mistaken for each other at various times now that coelurus and ornitholestes have been more fully described it is possible to distinguish them by various characteristics of their anatomy for example they had visibly different proportions coelurus had a longer back and neck than ornitholestes and longer more slender legs and feet coelurus and tanycolagreus are more similar but differ in a variety of details such details include shape of upper arm forearm and thigh bones location of muscle attachments on thigh bone proportionally longer back vertebrae and again very long metatarsus of coelurus classification since growth of phylogenetic studies in 1980s coelurus has usually been found to be a coelurosaurian of uncertain affinities not fitting with better known clades of cretaceous along with several other generalized coelurosaurians such as compsognathids ornitholestes and proceratosaurus it has had multiple placements around base of coelurosauria phylogenetic analysis conducted by rauhut 2003 and smith et al 2007 found that coelurus was more closely related to compsognathids than to other coelurosaurs oliver rauhut 2003 proposed that coeluridae was composed of coelurus plus compsognathids but he and others have not since found compsognathids to group with coelurus however a work published by phil senter in 2007 following description of tanycolagreus found it and coelurus to be closely related at base of tyrannosauroidea senter proposed that coelurus and tanycolagreus were only coelurids and were actually tyrannosauroids but phylogenetic analysis of turner et al 2007b found that coelurus was a basal coelurosaur although more derived than tyrannosaurids in 2010 recovered coelurus as a basal maniraptoran coelurus is sometimes put into its own family coeluridae although membership of family has not been stable before use of phylogenetic analyses coeluridae and coelurosauria were taxonomic wastebaskets used for small theropods that did not belong to other groups thus they accumulated many dubious genera as late as 1980s popular books recognized over a dozen coelurids including such disparate forms as noasaurid laevisuchus and oviraptorosaurian microvenator and considered them descendants of a wastebasket coeluridae lingered into early 1990s in some sources and appears in at least one 2006 source but since then it has only been recognized in a much reduced form coeluridae received a formal phylogenetic definition in 2015 when it was defined as all species more closely related to coelurus fragilis than to proceratosaurus bradleyi tyrannosaurus rex allosaurus fragilis compsognathus longipes ornithomimus edmontonicus or deinonychus antirrhopus by hendrickx hartman and mateus it remains unclear whether or not this group contains any species other than coelurus itself and while tanycolagreus is often included support for this relationship has been weak in most of studies that recovered it below is a cladogram placing coelurus in coelurosauria by cau et al in 2015 history thumb upright othniel charles marsh s illustration of coelurus vertebrae from 1884 coelurus was described in 1879 by othniel charles marsh an american paleontologist and naturalist known for his bone wars with edward drinker cope at time he only described what he interpreted as vertebrae from back and tail found at same location as type specimen of his new genus and species camptonotus dispar later renamed camptosaurus because camptonotus was already in use for a cricket marsh was impressed with hollow interiors of thin walled vertebrae a characteristic that gave type species its name coelurus fragilis he thought of his new genus as an animal about as large as a wolf and probably carnivorous coelurus would prove to be first named small theropod from morrison formation although at time marsh was not certain that it was a dinosaur he returned to it in 1881 and provided illustrations of some bones along with putting it in a new order and family coeluridae from there story becomes more complex apparently skeleton was scattered throughout quarry with remains being recovered from september 1879 to september 1880 marsh elected to place some of material in a new species c agilis on strength of a pair of fused pubic bones he thought belonged to an animal three times size of c fragilis he returned to genus in 1888 to add c gracilis based on unknown remains only represented today by a single claw bone pertaining to a small theropod from early cretaceous arundel formation of maryland this species is not currently accepted as representing coelurus in reviews of genus but has not been given its own genus despite their professional animosity cope also assigned species to coelurus in 1887 he named fossils from late triassic of new mexico as c bauri and c longicollis he later gave them their own genus coelophysis in 1903 henry fairfield osborn named a second genus of small theropod from morrison formation ornitholestes this genus was based on a partial skeleton from bone cabin quarry north of como bluff ornitholestes became intertwined with coelurus in 1920 when charles gilmore in his influential study of theropod dinosaurs concluded that two were synonyms this was followed in literature for decades two genera were not formally compared however nor was there a full accounting of what actually belonged to coelurus until john ostrom s study in 1980 gilmore had suspected that c fragilis and c agilis were same but ostrom was able to demonstrate this synonymy this greatly expanded known material pertaining to c fragilis and ostrom was able to demonstrate that ornitholestes was quite different from coelurus at time dale russell had proposed that c agilis was a species of elaphrosaurus based on incomplete information then published ostrom was also able to demonstrate that this was not case additionally he showed that one of three vertebrae marsh had illustrated for c fragilis was actually a composite of two vertebrae one of which was later shown to come from another quarry and belonged not to coelurus but to another unnamed small theropod this unnamed genus would not be last small theropod from morrison formation to be confused with coelurus a later discovery 1995 of a partial skeleton in wyoming was first thought to be a new larger specimen of coelurus but further study showed it belonged to a different but related genus tanycolagreus species only one species of coelurus type species c fragilis is still recognized as valid today although six other species have been named over years c agilis as discussed was named by marsh in 1884 for what turned out to be additional parts of skeleton of c fragilis cope s c bauri and c longicollis named in 1887 from late triassic fossils from new mexico were transferred by cope in 1889 to his new genus coelophysis c daviesi was named by richard lydekker in 1888 for harry seeley s daviesi a neck vertebra from early cretaceous of england but this species was later transferred to its own genus thecocoelurus c gracilis another early cretaceous species was also named in 1888 it was coined by marsh for what seems to be an assortment of limb remains but gilmore could only find a single claw when he reviewed species in 1920 this species has been proposed as outside coelurus since 1920s when gilmore assigned it to and has been regarded as a dubious species outside of coelurus in recent reviews finally during period when ornitholestes was thought to be same as coelurus its type species was recognized as distinct by steel as c hermanni paleobiology and paleoecology provenance and occurrence type specimen of coelurus agilis ypm 2010 now considered a synonym of coelurus fragilis was recovered in brushy basin member of morrison formation in albany county wyoming specimen was collected by reed in gray sandstone and brown green claystone that were deposited during kimmeridgian stage of jurassic period approximately 157 to 152 million years ago this specimen is housed in collection of yale peabody museum in new haven connecticut fauna and habitat morrison formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons and flat floodplains vegetation varied from river lining forests of conifers tree ferns and ferns to fern savannas with rare trees it has been a rich fossil hunting ground holding fossils of green algae fungi mosses horsetails ferns cycads ginkgoes and several families of conifers other fossils discovered include bivalves snails ray finned fishes frogs salamanders turtles such as sphenodonts lizards terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans like several species of pterosaur like numerous dinosaur species and early mammals such as docodonts multituberculates symmetrodonts and triconodonts such dinosaurs as theropods ceratosaurus allosaurus ornitholestes and torvosaurus sauropods apatosaurus brachiosaurus camarasaurus and diplodocus and ornithischians camptosaurus hesperosaurus drinker fruitadens dryosaurus and stegosaurus are known from morrison coelurus is regarded as a small terrestrial carnivore feeding on small prey items like insects mammals and lizards it is thought to have been a fast animal certainly faster than similar but shorter footed ornitholestes coelurus is present in stratigraphic zones 2 and 5 of morrison formation foster j 2007 appendix jurassic west dinosaurs of morrison
