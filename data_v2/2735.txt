300px thumbnail repeating decimal continues infinitely in mathematics 0 999 also written 0 among other ways denotes repeating decimal consisting of infinitely many 9s after decimal point and one 0 before it this repeating decimal represents smallest number no less than every decimal number in sequence 0 9 0 99 0 999 this definition is equivalent to definition of decimal numbers as limits of their summed components which in case of 0 999 is limit of sequence 0 9 0 99 0 999 equivalence is due to bounded increasing sequences having their limit always equal to their least upper bound this number is equal to 1 in other words 0 999 and 1 represent same number there are many ways of showing this equality from intuitive arguments to mathematically rigorous proofs technique used depends on target audience background assumptions historical context and preferred development of real numbers system within which 0 999 is commonly defined in other systems 0 999 can have same meaning a different definition or be undefined more generally every nonzero terminating decimal has two equal representations for example 8 32 and 8 31999 which is a property of all base representations utilitarian preference for terminating decimal representation contributes to misconception that it is only representation for this and other reasons such as rigorous proofs relying on non elementary techniques properties or disciplines some people can find equality sufficiently counterintuitive that they question or reject it this has been subject of several studies in mathematics education elementary proof right thumb archimedean property any point x before finish line lies between two of points inclusive there is an elementary proof of equation which uses just mathematical tools of comparison and addition of finite decimal numbers without any reference to more advanced topics such as series limits formal construction of real numbers etc proof an exercise given by is a direct formalization of intuitive fact that if one draws 0 9 0 99 0 999 etc on number line there is no room left for placing a number between them and 1 meaning of notation 0 999 is least point on number line lying to right of all of numbers 0 9 0 99 0 999 etc because there is ultimately no room between 1 and these numbers point 1 must be this least point and so intuitive explanation if one places 0 9 0 99 0 999 etc on number line one sees immediately that all these points are to left of 1 and that they get closer and closer to 1 more precisely distance from 0 9 to 1 is distance from 0 99 to 1 is and so on distance to 1 from th point one with 9s after decimal point is therefore if 1 were not smallest number greater than 0 9 0 99 0 999 etc then there would be a point on number line that lies between 1 and all these points this point would be at a positive distance from 1 that is less than for every integer in standard number systems rational numbers and real numbers there is no positive number that is less than for all n this is one version of archimedean property which can be proven to hold in system of rational numbers therefore 1 is smallest number that is greater than all 0 9 0 99 0 999 etc and so discussion on completeness part of what this argument shows is that there is a least upper bound of sequence 0 9 0 99 0 999 etc a smallest number that is greater than all of terms of sequence one of axioms of real number system is completeness axiom which states that every bounded sequence has a least upper bound this least upper bound is one way to define infinite decimal expansions real number represented by an infinite decimal is least upper bound of its finite truncations argument here does not need to assume completeness to be valid because it shows that this particular sequence of rational numbers in fact has a least upper bound and that this least upper bound is equal to one formal proof previous explanation is not a proof as one cannot define properly relationship between a number and its representation as a point on number line for accuracy of proof number with nines after decimal point is denoted thus and so on as with digits after decimal point addition rule for decimal numbers implies and for every positive integer one has to show that 1 is smallest number that is no less than all for this it suffices to prove that if a number is not larger than 1 and no less than all then so let such that for every positive integer therefore this implies that difference between and is less than inverse of any positive integer thus this difference must be zero and thus that is this proof relies on fact that zero is only nonnegative number that is less than all inverses of integers or equivalently that there is no number that is larger than every integer this is archimedean property that is verified for rational numbers and real numbers real numbers may be enlarged into number systems such as hyperreal numbers with infinitely small numbers infinitesimals and infinitely large numbers infinite numbers when using such systems notation 0 999 is generally not used as there is no smallest number that is no less than all this is implied by fact that implies algebraic arguments matter of overly simplified illustrations of equality is a subject of pedagogical discussion and critique discusses argument that in elementary school one is taught that so ignoring all essential subtleties multiplying this identity by gives he further says that this argument is unconvincing because of an unresolved ambiguity over meaning of equals sign a student might think it surely does not mean that number 1 is identical to that which is meant by notation most undergraduate mathematics majors encountered by byers feel that while is very close to 1 on strength of this argument with some even saying that it is infinitely close they are not ready to say that it is equal to 1 discusses how this argument gets its force from fact that most people have been indoctrinated to accept first equation without thinking but also suggests that argument may lead skeptics to question this assumption byers also presents following argument let students who did not accept first argument sometimes accept second argument but in byers opinion still have not resolved ambiguity and therefore do not understand representation for infinite decimals presenting same argument also state that it does not explain equality indicating that such an explanation would likely involve concepts of infinity and completeness citing also conclude that treatment of identity based on such arguments as these without formal concept of a limit is premature same argument is also given by who notes that skeptics may question whether is cancellable whether it makes sense to subtract from both sides analytic proofs since question of 0 999 does not affect formal development of mathematics it can be postponed until one proves standard theorems of real analysis one requirement is to characterize real numbers that can be written in decimal notation consisting of an optional sign a finite sequence of one or more digits forming an integer part a decimal separator and a sequence of digits forming a fractional part for purpose of discussing 0 999 integer part can be summarized as b0 and one can neglect negatives so a decimal expansion has form fraction part unlike integer part is not limited to finitely many digits this is a positional notation so for example digit 5 in 500 contributes ten times as much as 5 in 50 and 5 in 0 05 contributes one tenth as much as 5 in 0 5 infinite series and sequences perhaps most common development of decimal expansions is to define them as sums of infinite series in general for 0 999 one can apply convergence theorem concerning geometric series rudin p 61 theorem 3 26 j stewart p 706 since 0 999 is such a sum with a 9 and common ratio r theorem makes short work of question this proof appears as early as 1770 in leonhard euler s elements of algebra euler p 170 right thumb 200px limits unit interval including base 4 fraction sequence 3 33 333 converging to 1 sum of a geometric series is itself a result even older than euler a typical 18th century derivation used a term by term manipulation similar to algebraic proof given above and as late as 1811 bonnycastle s textbook an introduction to algebra uses such an argument for geometric series to justify same maneuver on 0 999 grattan guinness p 69 bonnycastle p 177 a 19th century reaction against such liberal summation methods resulted in definition that still dominates today sum of a series is defined to be limit of sequence of its partial sums a corresponding proof of theorem explicitly computes that sequence it can be found in any proof based introduction to calculus or analysis for example j stewart p 706 rudin p 61 protter and morrey p 213 pugh p 180 j b conway p 31 a sequence x0 x1 x2 has a limit x if distance x xn becomes arbitrarily small as n increases statement that 0 999 1 can itself be interpreted and proven as a limit limit follows for example from rudin p 57 theorem 3 20e for a more direct approach see also finney weir giordano 2001 thomas calculus early addison wesley new york section 8 1 example 2 a example 6 b first two equalities can be interpreted as symbol shorthand definitions remaining equalities can be proven last step that 0 as n is often justified by archimedean property of real numbers this limit based attitude towards 0 999 is often put in more evocative but less precise terms for example 1846 textbook university arithmetic explains 999 continued to infinity 1 because every annexation of a 9 brings value closer to 1 1895 arithmetic for schools says when a large number of 9s is taken difference between 1 and 99999 becomes inconceivably small davies p 175 smith and harrington p 115 such heuristics are often interpreted by students as implying that 0 999 itself is less than 1 nested intervals and least upper bounds right thumb 250px nested intervals in base 3 1 1 000 0 222 series definition above is a simple way to define real number named by a decimal expansion a complementary approach is tailored to opposite process for a given real number define decimal expansion s to name it if a real number x is known to lie in closed interval 0 10 i e it is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10 one can imagine dividing that interval into ten pieces that overlap only at their endpoints 0 1 1 2 2 3 and so on up to 9 10 number x must belong to one of these if it belongs to 2 3 then one records digit 2 and subdivides that interval into 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 8 2 9 2 9 3 continuing this process yields an infinite sequence of nested intervals labeled by an infinite sequence of digits b0 b1 b2 b3 and one writes in this formalism identities 1 0 999 and 1 1 000 reflect respectively fact that 1 lies in both 0 1 and 1 2 so one can choose either subinterval when finding its digits to ensure that this notation does not abuse sign one needs a way to reconstruct a unique real number for each decimal this can be done with limits but other constructions continue with ordering theme beals p 22 i stewart p 34 one straightforward choice is nested intervals theorem which guarantees that given a sequence of nested closed intervals whose lengths become arbitrarily small intervals contain exactly one real number in their intersection so b0 b1b2b3 is defined to be unique number contained within all intervals b0 b0 1 b0 b1 b0 b1 0 1 and so on 0 999 is then unique real number that lies in all of intervals 0 1 0 9 1 0 99 1 and 0 99 9 1 for every finite string of 9s since 1 is an element of each of these intervals 0 999 1 bartle and sherbert pp 60 62 pedrick p 29 p 46 nested intervals theorem is usually founded upon a more fundamental characteristic of real numbers existence of least upper bounds or suprema to directly exploit these objects one may define b0 b1b2b3 to be least upper bound of set of approximants b0 b0 b1 b0 apostol pp 9 11 12 beals p 22 p 27 one can then show that this definition or nested intervals definition is consistent with subdivision procedure implying 0 999 1 again tom apostol concludes proofs from construction of real numbers some approaches explicitly define real numbers to be certain structures built upon rational numbers using axiomatic set theory natural numbers 0 1 2 3 and so on begin with 0 and continue upwards so that every number has a successor one can extend natural numbers with their negatives to give all integers and to further extend to ratios giving rational numbers these number systems are accompanied by arithmetic of addition subtraction multiplication and division more subtly they include ordering so that one number can be compared to another and found to be less than greater than or equal to another number step from rationals to reals is a major extension there are at least two popular ways to achieve this step both published in 1872 dedekind cuts and cauchy sequences proofs that 0 999 1 which directly use these constructions are not found in textbooks on real analysis where modern trend for last few decades has been to use an axiomatic analysis even when a construction is offered it is usually applied towards proving axioms of real numbers which then support above proofs however several authors express idea that starting with a construction is more logically appropriate and resulting proofs are more self contained historical synthesis is claimed by griffiths and hilton p xiv in 1970 and again by pugh p 10 in 2001 both actually prefer dedekind cuts to axioms for use of cuts in textbooks see pugh p 17 or rudin p 17 for viewpoints on logic pugh p 10 rudin p ix or munkres p 30 dedekind cuts in dedekind cut approach each real number x is defined as infinite set of all rational numbers less than x enderton p 113 qualifies this description idea behind dedekind cuts is that a real number x can be named by giving an infinite set of rationals namely all rationals less than x we will in effect define x to be set of rationals smaller than x to avoid circularity in definition we must be able to characterize sets of rationals obtainable in this way in particular real number 1 is set of all rational numbers that are less than 1 rudin pp 17 20 richman p 399 or enderton p 119 to be precise rudin richman and enderton call this cut 1 1 and 1r respectively all three identify it with traditional real number 1 note that what rudin and enderton call a dedekind cut richman calls a dedekind cut every positive decimal expansion easily determines a dedekind cut set of rational numbers which are less than some stage of expansion so real number 0 999 is set of rational numbers r such that r 0 or r 0 9 or r 0 99 or r is less than some other number of p 399 every element of 0 999 is less than 1 so it is an element of real number 1 conversely all elements of 1 are rational numbers that can be written as with and this implies and thus and since by definition above every element of 1 is also an element of 0 999 and combined with proof above that every element of 0 999 is also an element of 1 sets 0 999 and 1 contain same rational numbers and are therefore same set that is 0 999 1 definition of real numbers as dedekind cuts was first published by richard dedekind in 1872 above approach to assigning a real number to each decimal expansion is due to an expository paper titled is 0 999 1 by fred richman in mathematics magazine which is targeted at teachers of collegiate mathematics especially at junior senior level and their students richman richman notes that taking dedekind cuts in any dense subset of rational numbers yields same results in particular he uses decimal fractions for which proof is more immediate he also notes that typically definitions allow x x 1 to be a cut but not x x 1 or vice versa why do that precisely to rule out existence of distinct numbers 0 9 and 1 so we see that in traditional definition of real numbers equation 0 9 1 is built in at beginning richman pp 398 399 a further modification of procedure leads to a different structure where two are not equal although it is consistent many of common rules of decimal arithmetic no longer hold for example fraction has no representation see alternative number systems below cauchy sequences another approach is to define a real number as limit of a cauchy sequence of rational numbers this construction of real numbers uses ordering of rationals less directly first distance between x and y is defined as absolute value x y where absolute value z is defined as maximum of z and z thus never negative then reals are defined to be sequences of rationals that have cauchy sequence property using this distance that is in sequence x0 x1 x2 a mapping from natural numbers to rationals for any positive rational d there is an n such that xm xn d for all m n n distance between terms becomes smaller than any positive rational griffiths hilton 2 sequences p 386 if xn and yn are two cauchy sequences then they are defined to be equal as real numbers if sequence xn yn has limit 0 truncations of decimal number b0 b1b2b3 generate a sequence of rationals which is cauchy this is taken to define real value of number griffiths hilton pp 388 393 thus in this formalism task is to show that sequence of rational numbers has limit 0 considering nth term of sequence for it must therefore be shown that this limit is hilton p 395 if one understands definition of limit so again 0 999 1 definition of real numbers as cauchy sequences was first published separately by eduard heine and georg cantor also in 1872 above approach to decimal expansions including proof that 0 999 1 closely follows griffiths hilton s 1970 work a comprehensive textbook of classical mathematics a contemporary interpretation book is written specifically to offer a second look at familiar concepts in a contemporary light griffiths hilton pp viii 395 infinite decimal representation commonly in secondary schools mathematics education real numbers are constructed by defining a number using an integer followed by a radix point and an infinite sequence written out as a string to represent fractional part of any given real number in this construction set of any combination of an integer and digits after decimal point or radix point in non base 10 systems is set of real numbers this construction can be rigorously shown to satisfy all of real axioms after defining an equivalence relation over set that defines 1 eq 0 999 as well as for any other nonzero decimals with only finitely many nonzero terms in decimal string with its trailing 9s version with this construction of reals all proofs of statement 1 0 999 can be viewed as implicitly assuming equality when any operations are performed on real numbers generalizations result that 0 999 1 generalizes readily in two ways first every nonzero number with a finite decimal notation equivalently endless trailing 0s has a counterpart with trailing 9s for example 0 equals 0 25 exactly as in special case considered these numbers are exactly decimal fractions and they are dense petkovsek p 408 second a comparable theorem applies in each radix or base for example in base 2 binary numeral system 0 111 equals 1 and in base 3 ternary numeral system 0 222 equals 1 in general any terminating base b expression has a counterpart with repeated trailing digits equal to b 1 textbooks of real analysis are likely to skip example of 0 999 and present one or both of these generalizations from start protter and morrey p 503 bartle and sherbert p 61 alternative representations of 1 also occur in non integer bases for example in golden ratio base two standard representations are 1 000 and 0 and there are infinitely many more representations that include adjacent 1s generally for almost all q between 1 and 2 there are uncountably many base q expansions of 1 on other hand there are still uncountably many q including all natural numbers greater than 1 for which there is only one base q expansion of 1 other than trivial 1 000 this result was first obtained by paul erdos miklos horvath and istvan joo around 1990 in 1998 vilmos komornik and paola loreti determined smallest such base komornik loreti constant q 1 in this base 1 0 digits are given by thue morse sequence which does not repeat komornik and loreti p 636 a more far reaching generalization addresses most general positional numeral systems they too have multiple representations and in some sense difficulties are even worse for example kempner p 611 petkovsek p 409 in balanced ternary system 0 111 1 111 in reverse factorial number system using bases 2 3 4 for positions after decimal point 1 1 000 0 1234 impossibility of unique representation that all these different number systems suffer from multiple representations for some real numbers can be attributed to a fundamental difference between real numbers as an ordered set and collections of infinite strings of symbols ordered lexicographically indeed following two properties account for difficulty if an interval of real numbers is partitioned into two non empty parts l r such that every element of l is strictly less than every element of r then either l contains a largest element or r contains a smallest element but not both collection of infinite strings of symbols taken from any finite alphabet lexicographically ordered can be partitioned into two non empty parts l r such that every element of l is less than every element of r while l contains a largest element and r contains a smallest element indeed it suffices to take two finite prefixes initial substrings p1 p2 of elements from collection such that they differ only in their final symbol for which symbol they have successive values and take for l set of all strings in collection whose corresponding prefix is at most p1 and for r remainder strings in collection whose corresponding prefix is at least p2 then l has a largest element starting with p1 and choosing largest available symbol in all following positions while r has a smallest element obtained by following p2 by smallest symbol in all positions first point follows from basic properties of real numbers l has a supremum and r has an which are easily seen to be equal being a real number it either lies in r or in l but not both since l and r are supposed to be disjoint second point generalizes 0 999 1 000 pair obtained for p1 0 p2 1 in fact one need not use same alphabet for all positions so that for instance mixed radix systems can be included or consider full collection of possible strings only important points are that at each position a finite set of symbols which may even depend on previous symbols can be chosen from this is needed to ensure maximal and minimal choices and that making a valid choice for any position should result in a valid infinite string so one should not allow 9 in each position while forbidding an infinite succession of 9 s under these assumptions above argument shows that an order preserving map from collection of strings to an interval of real numbers cannot be a bijection either some numbers do not correspond to any string or some of them correspond to more than one string marko petkovsek has proven that for any positional system that names all real numbers set of reals with multiple representations is always dense he calls proof an instructive exercise in elementary point set topology it involves viewing sets of positional values as stone spaces and noticing that their real representations are given by continuous functions petkovsek pp 410 411 applications one application of 0 999 as a representation of 1 occurs in elementary number theory in 1802 h goodwin published an observation on appearance of 9s in repeating decimal representations of fractions whose denominators are certain prime numbers examples include 0 and 142 857 999 0 and 9999 e midy proved a general result about such fractions now called midy s theorem in 1836 publication was obscure and it is unclear if his proof directly involved 0 999 but at least one modern proof by w g leavitt does if it can be proved that if a decimal of form 0 b1b2b3 is a positive integer then it must be 0 999 which is then source of 9s in theorem leavitt 1984 p 301 investigations in this direction can motivate such concepts as greatest common modular arithmetic fermat primes order of group elements and quadratic reciprocity pp 1 3 leavitt 1967 pp 669 673 shrader frechette pp 96 98 right thumb positions of and 1 in cantor set returning to real analysis base 3 analogue 0 222 1 plays a key role in a characterization of one of simplest fractals middle thirds cantor set a point in unit interval lies in cantor set if and only if it can be represented in ternary using only digits 0 and 2 nth digit of representation reflects position of point in nth stage of construction for example point is given usual representation of 0 2 or 0 2000 since it lies to right of first deletion and to left of every deletion thereafter point is represented not as 0 1 but as 0 since it lies to left of first deletion and to right of every deletion thereafter pugh p 97 sauer and yorke pp 150 152 protter and morrey p 507 and pedrick p 29 assign this description as an exercise repeating nines also turn up in yet another of georg cantor s works they must be taken into account to construct a valid proof applying his 1891 diagonal argument to decimal expansions of uncountability of unit interval such a proof needs to be able to declare certain pairs of real numbers to be different based on their decimal expansions so one needs to avoid pairs like 0 2 and 0 1999 a simple method represents all numbers with nonterminating expansions opposite method rules out repeating nines maor p 60 and mankiewicz p 151 review former method mankiewicz attributes it to cantor but primary source is unclear munkres p 50 mentions latter method a variant that may be closer to cantor s original argument actually uses base 2 and by turning base 3 expansions into base 2 expansions one can prove uncountability of cantor set as well rudin p 50 pugh p 98 skepticism in education students of mathematics often reject equality of 0 999 and 1 for reasons ranging from their disparate appearance to deep misgivings over limit concept and disagreements over nature of infinitesimals there are many common contributing factors to confusion students are often mentally committed to notion that a number can be represented in one and only one way by a decimal seeing two manifestly different decimals representing same number appears to be a paradox which is amplified by appearance of seemingly well understood number 1 bunch p 119 tall and schwarzenberger p 6 last suggestion is due to burrell p 28 perhaps most reassuring of all numbers is 1 so it is particularly unsettling when someone tries to pass off 0 9 as 1 some students interpret 0 999 or similar notation as a large but finite string of 9s possibly with a variable unspecified length if they accept an infinite string of nines they may still expect a last 9 at infinity tall and schwarzenberger pp 6 7 tall 2000 p 221 intuition and ambiguous teaching lead students to think of limit of a sequence as a kind of infinite process rather than a fixed value since a sequence need not reach its limit where students accept difference between a sequence of numbers and its limit they might read 0 999 as meaning sequence rather than its limit tall and schwarzenberger p 6 tall 2000 p 221 these ideas are mistaken in context of standard real numbers although some may be valid in other number systems either invented for their general mathematical utility or as instructive counterexamples to better understand 0 999 many of these explanations were found by david tall who has studied characteristics of teaching and cognition that lead to some of misunderstandings he has encountered in his college students interviewing his students to determine why vast majority initially rejected equality he found that students continued to conceive of 0 999 as a sequence of numbers getting closer and closer to 1 and not a fixed value because you haven t specified how many places there are or it is nearest possible decimal below 1 tall 2000 p 221 elementary argument of multiplying 0 333 by 3 can convince reluctant students that 0 999 1 still when confronted with conflict between their belief of first equation and their disbelief of second some students either begin to disbelieve first equation or simply become frustrated tall 1976 pp 10 14 nor are more sophisticated methods foolproof students who are fully capable of applying rigorous definitions may still fall back on intuitive images when they are surprised by a result in advanced mathematics including 0 999 for example one real analysis student was able to prove that 0 333 using a supremum definition but then insisted that 0 999 1 based on her earlier understanding of long division pinto and tall p 5 edwards and ward pp 416 417 others still are able to prove that 0 333 but upon being confronted by fractional proof insist that logic supersedes mathematical calculations joseph mazur tells tale of an otherwise brilliant calculus student of his who challenged almost everything i said in class but never questioned his calculator and who had come to believe that nine digits are all one needs to do mathematics including calculating square root of 23 student remained uncomfortable with a limiting argument that 9 99 10 calling it a wildly imagined infinite growing process mazur pp 137 141 as part of ed dubinsky s apos theory of mathematical learning he and his collaborators 2005 propose that students who conceive of 0 999 as a finite indeterminate string with an infinitely small distance from 1 have not yet constructed a complete process conception of infinite decimal other students who have a complete process conception of 0 999 may not yet be able to encapsulate that process into an object conception like object conception they have of 1 and so they view process 0 999 and object 1 as incompatible dubinsky et al also link this mental ability of encapsulation to viewing as a number in its own right and to dealing with set of natural numbers as a whole dubinsky et al pp 261 262 cultural phenomenon with rise of internet debates about 0 999 have become commonplace on newsgroups and message boards including many that nominally have little to do with mathematics in newsgroup arguing over 0 999 is described as a popular sport and it is one of questions answered in its faq as observed by richman p 396 faq briefly covers multiplication by 10 and limits and it alludes to cauchy sequences as well a 2003 edition of general interest newspaper column straight dope discusses 0 999 via and limits saying of misconceptions a slate article reports that concept of 0 999 is hotly disputed on websites ranging from world of warcraft message boards to ayn rand forums in same vein question of 0 999 proved such a popular topic in first seven years of blizzard entertainment s battle net forums that company issued a press release on april fools day 2004 that it is 1 two proofs are then offered based on limits and multiplication by 10 0 999 features also in mathematical jokes such as and p 27 in alternative number systems although real numbers form an extremely useful number system decision to interpret notation 0 999 as naming a real number is ultimately a convention and timothy gowers argues in mathematics a very short introduction that resulting identity 0 999 1 is a convention as well one can define other number systems using different rules or new objects in some such number systems above proofs would need to be reinterpreted and one might find that in a given number system 0 999 and 1 might not be identical however many number systems are extensions of rather than independent alternatives to real number system so 0 999 1 continues to hold even in such number systems though it is worthwhile to examine alternative number systems not only for how 0 999 behaves if indeed a number expressed as 0 999 is both meaningful and unambiguous but also for behavior of related phenomena if such phenomena differ from those in real number system then at least one of assumptions built into system must break down infinitesimals some proofs that 0 999 1 rely on archimedean property of real numbers that there are no nonzero infinitesimals specifically difference 1 0 999 must be smaller than any positive rational number so it must be an infinitesimal but since reals do not contain nonzero infinitesimals difference is therefore zero and therefore two values are same however there are mathematically coherent ordered algebraic structures including various alternatives to real numbers which are non archimedean non standard analysis provides a number system with a full array of infinitesimals and their inverses for a full treatment of non standard numbers see for example robinson s non standard analysis a h lightstone developed a decimal expansion for hyperreal numbers in 0 1 lightstone pp 245 247 lightstone shows how to associate to each number a sequence of digits indexed by hypernatural numbers while he does not directly discuss 0 999 he shows real number is represented by 0 333 333 which is a consequence of transfer principle as a consequence number 0 999 999 1 with this type of decimal representation not every expansion represents a number in particular 0 333 000 and 0 999 000 do not correspond to any number standard definition of number 0 999 is limit of sequence 0 9 0 99 0 999 a different definition involves what terry tao refers to as i e equivalence class 0 9 0 99 0 999 of this sequence in construction which is a number that falls short of 1 by an infinitesimal amount more generally hyperreal number with last digit 9 at infinite hypernatural rank h satisfies a strict inequality accordingly an alternative interpretation for zero followed by infinitely many 9s could be all such interpretations of 0 999 are infinitely close to 1 ian stewart characterizes this interpretation as an entirely reasonable way to rigorously justify intuition that there s a little bit missing from 1 in 0 999 stewart 2009 p 175 full discussion of 0 999 is spread through pp 172 175 along with katz katz robert ely also questions assumption that students ideas about are erroneous intuitions about real numbers interpreting them rather as nonstandard intuitions that could be valuable in learning of calculus katz katz 2010b r ely 2010 jose in his book infinity an essay in metaphysics argues that some natural pre mathematical intuitions cannot be expressed if one is limited to an overly restrictive number system hackenbush combinatorial game theory provides alternative reals as well with infinite blue red hackenbush as one particularly relevant example in 1974 elwyn berlekamp described a correspondence between hackenbush strings and binary expansions of real numbers motivated by idea of data compression for example value of hackenbush string is 0 however value of corresponding to 0 111 2 is infinitesimally less than 1 difference between two is surreal number where o is first infinite ordinal relevant game is or 0 000 2 berlekamp conway and guy pp 79 80 307 311 discuss 1 and and touch on game for 0 111 2 follows directly from berlekamp s rule this is in fact true of binary expansions of many rational numbers where values of numbers are equal but corresponding binary tree paths are different for example 0 10111 2 0 11000 2 which are both equal to 3 4 but first representation corresponds to binary tree path while second corresponds to different path revisiting subtraction another manner in which proofs might be undermined is if 1 0 999 simply does not exist because subtraction is not always possible mathematical structures with an addition operation but not a subtraction operation include commutative commutative monoids and richman considers two such systems designed so that 0 999 1 first richman defines a nonnegative decimal number to be a literal decimal expansion he defines lexicographical order and an addition operation noting that 0 999 1 simply because 0 1 in ones place but for any nonterminating x one has 0 999 x 1 x so one peculiarity of decimal numbers is that addition cannot always be cancelled another is that no decimal number corresponds to after defining multiplication decimal numbers form a positive totally ordered commutative richman pp 397 399 in process of defining multiplication richman also defines another system he calls cut d which is set of dedekind cuts of decimal fractions ordinarily this definition leads to real numbers but for a decimal fraction d he allows both cut d and principal cut d result is that real numbers are living uneasily together with decimal fractions again 0 999 1 there are no positive infinitesimals in cut d but there is a sort of negative infinitesimal 0 which has no decimal expansion he concludes that 0 999 1 0 while equation 0 999 x 1 has no solution richman pp 398 400 rudin p 23 assigns this alternative construction but over rationals as last exercise of chapter 1 p adic numbers when asked about 0 999 novices often believe there should be a final 9 believing 1 0 999 to be a positive number which they write as 0 000 1 whether or not that makes sense intuitive goal is clear adding a 1 to final 9 in 0 999 would carry all 9s into 0s and leave a 1 in ones place among other reasons this idea fails because there is no final 9 in 0 999 gardiner p 98 gowers p 60 however there is a system that contains an infinite string of 9s including a last 9 right thumb 200px 4 adic integers black points including sequence 3 33 333 converging to 1 10 adic analogue is 999 1 p adic numbers are an alternative number system of interest in number theory like real numbers p adic numbers can be built from rational numbers via cauchy sequences construction uses a different metric in which 0 is closer to p and much closer to pn than it is to 1 p adic numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p including 10 so arithmetic can be performed in p adics and there are no infinitesimals in 10 adic numbers analogues of decimal expansions run to left 10 adic expansion 999 does have a last 9 and it does not have a first 9 one can add 1 to ones place and it leaves behind only 0s after carrying through 1 999 000 0 and so 999 1 p 11 another derivation uses a geometric series infinite series implied by 999 does not converge in real numbers but it converges in 10 adics and so one can re use familiar formula compare with series above a third derivation was invented by a seventh grader who was doubtful over her teacher s limiting argument that 0 999 1 but was inspired to take multiply by 10 proof above in opposite direction if x 999 then 10x 990 so 10x x 9 hence x 1 again as a final extension since 0 999 1 in reals and 999 1 in 10 adics then by blind faith and unabashed juggling of symbols desua p 901 one may add two equations and arrive at 999 999 0 this equation does not make sense either as a 10 adic expansion or an ordinary decimal expansion but it turns out to be meaningful and true if one develops a theory of double decimals with eventually repeating left ends to represent a familiar system real numbers desua pp 902 903 ultrafinitism philosophy of ultrafinitism rejects as meaningless concepts dealing with infinite sets such as idea that notation might stand for a decimal number with an infinite sequence of nines as well as summation of infinitely many numbers corresponding to positional values of decimal digits in that infinite string in this approach to mathematics only some particular fixed number of finite decimal digits is meaningful instead of equality one has approximate equality which is equality up to number of decimal digits that one is permitted to compute although katz and katz argue that ultrafinitism may capture student intuition that 0 999 ought to be less than 1 ideas of ultrafinitism do not enjoy widespread acceptance in mathematical community and philosophy lacks a generally agreed upon formal mathematical foundation katz katz 2010a related questions zeno s paradoxes particularly paradox of runner are reminiscent of apparent paradox that 0 999 and 1 are equal runner paradox can be mathematically modelled and then like 0 999 resolved using a geometric series however it is not clear if this mathematical treatment addresses underlying metaphysical issues zeno was exploring wallace p 51 maor p 17 division by zero occurs in some popular discussions of 0 999 and it also stirs up contention while most authors choose to define 0 999 almost all modern treatments leave division by zero undefined as it can be given no meaning in standard real numbers however division by zero is defined in some other systems such as complex analysis where extended complex plane i e riemann sphere has a point at infinity here it makes sense to define to be infinity see for example j b conway s treatment of mobius transformations pp 47 57 and in fact results are profound and applicable to many problems in engineering and physics some prominent mathematicians argued for such a definition long before either number system was developed maor p 54 negative zero is another redundant feature of many ways of writing numbers in number systems such as real numbers where 0 denotes additive identity and is neither positive nor negative usual interpretation of 0 is that it should denote additive inverse of 0 which forces 0 0 munkres p 34 exercise 1 c nonetheless some scientific applications use separate positive and negative zeroes as do some computing binary number systems for example integers stored in sign and magnitude or ones complement formats or floating point numbers as specified by ieee floating point standard see also limit mathematics series mathematics naive mathematics notes references this introductory textbook on dynamical systems is aimed at undergraduate and beginning graduate students p ix a transition from calculus to advanced analysis mathematical analysis is intended to be honest rigorous up to date and at same time not too pedantic pref apostol s development of real numbers uses least upper bound axiom and introduces infinite decimals two pages later pp 9 11 this text aims to be an accessible reasonably paced textbook that deals with fundamental concepts and techniques of real analysis its development of real numbers relies on supremum axiom pp vii viii this book presents an analysis of paradoxes and fallacies as a tool for exploring its central topic rather tenuous relationship between mathematical reality and physical reality it assumes first year high school algebra further mathematics is developed in book including geometric series in chapter 2 although 0 999 is not one of paradoxes to be fully treated it is briefly mentioned during a development of cantor s diagonal method pp ix xi 119 this text assumes a stiff course in basic calculus as a prerequisite its stated principles are to present complex analysis as an introduction to mathematics and to state material clearly and precisely p vii an introductory undergraduate textbook in set theory that presupposes no specific background it is written to accommodate a course focusing on axiomatic set theory or on construction of number systems axiomatic material is marked such that it may be de emphasized pp xi xii this book grew out of a course for birmingham area grammar school mathematics teachers course was intended to convey a university level perspective on school mathematics and book is aimed at students who have reached roughly level of completing one year of specialist mathematical study at a university real numbers are constructed in chapter 24 perhaps most difficult chapter in entire book although authors ascribe much of difficulty to their use of ideal theory which is not reproduced here pp vii xiv mankiewicz seeks to represent history of mathematics in an accessible style by combining visual and qualitative aspects of mathematics mathematicians writings and historical sketches p 8 a topical rather than chronological review of infinity this book is intended for general reader but told from point of view of a mathematician on dilemma of rigor versus readable language maor comments i hope i have succeeded in properly addressing this problem pp x xiii intended as an introduction at senior or first year graduate level with no formal prerequisites i do not even assume reader knows much set theory p xi munkres treatment of reals is axiomatic he claims of bare hands constructions this way of approaching subject takes a good deal of time and effort and is of greater logical than mathematical interest p 30 this book aims to present a theoretical foundation of analysis that is suitable for students who have completed a standard course in calculus p vii at end of chapter 2 authors assume as an axiom for real numbers that bounded sequences converge later proving nested intervals theorem and least upper bound property pp 56 64 decimal expansions appear in appendix 3 expansions of real numbers in any base pp 503 507 while assuming familiarity with rational numbers pugh introduces dedekind cuts as soon as possible saying of axiomatic treatment this is something of a fraud considering that entire structure of analysis is built on real number system p 10 after proving least upper bound property and some allied facts cuts are not used in rest of book free html preprint note journal article contains material and wording not found in preprint this book gives a careful rigorous introduction to real analysis it gives axioms of real numbers and then constructs them pp 27 31 as infinite decimals with 0 999 1 as part of definition a textbook for an advanced undergraduate course experience has convinced me that it is unsound though logically correct to start off with construction of real numbers from rational ones at beginning most students simply fail to appreciate need for doing this accordingly real number system is introduced as an ordered field with least upper bound property and a few interesting applications of this property are quickly made however dedekind s construction is not omitted it is now in an appendix to chapter 1 where it may be studied and enjoyed whenever time is ripe p ix this book aims to assist students in discovering calculus and to foster conceptual understanding p v it omits proofs of foundations of calculus further
