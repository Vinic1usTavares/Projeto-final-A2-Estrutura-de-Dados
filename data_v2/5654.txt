1 neil ross as crysta s father themes in book disney pixar and hidden messages of children s films m keith booker states that ferngully focuses on theme of destruction of earth s rainforests in this case rainforest is located near mount warning on eastern coast of australia but theme is global and specific location is not particularly emphasized despite environmental theme booker stated film was somewhat vague in its explanation of dire consequences of rainforest destruction and it addresses economic impetus behind this destruction hardly at all fact that rainforest was saved at end of film diminishes urgency of its environmentalist message and that character of hexxus displaces real blame for environmental destruction from its real perpetrators onto nonexistent supernatural perpetrators further diluting political message character of batty was said to introduce secondary theme of animal experimentation though with a light touch that presents this potentially horrifying motif as essentially humorous in book eco impacts and greening of postmodernity tom and david mckie comment that radical views of ecology flourished in film perhaps because it was aimed at a younger generation and belong s to relatively discredited genres as zak is shrunk to fairy size and integrated into fairy world more similarities rather than differences are implied with nonhuman characters crysta is said to defeat evil hexxus in manner of classic western genre heroes though with key difference that her weapon is a seed rather than a revolver allowing produce of nature to share heroic role with her production producer wayne young said his passion for environment was his motivation for making film saying film was blatantly environmental although we have gone to a lot of trouble to avoid preaching we also want it to be viewed as entertainment inspiration for ferngully came from stories written by his former wife diana young diana first wrote story of ferngully 15 years before film s release wayne said couple planned a film adaptation for five years then spent seven years of dreaming and hustling followed by another three years of production wayne stated their dream was not possible until success of walt disney feature animation s 1989 film little mermaid which brought popularity back to animation hand drawn scenes in film were complemented by computer animation which was used to create elements such as flocks of birds that would have taken much longer to animate traditionally kroyer states 40 000 frames of computer generated graphics were used in film and that use of such animation halved production time most of film s 24 million budget was spent on animation and soundtrack film marked robin williams s first animation role with character batty koda being created specifically for him williams provided 14 hours worth of improvised lines for part which had been originally conceived as an eight minute role director bill kroyer was so impressed with voice work he ended up tripling screen time given to character williams went on to provide critically applauded voice of genie in disney s aladdin later same year voice cast of ferngully agreed with film s message and worked for scale wages film marked first time that both members of cheech chong had worked together in six years with two voicing beetle brothers stump and root cheech marin said it was just like old times but we only worked for two or three hours had a pizza and split soundtracks soundtrack album was released by mca records peter fawthrop from allmusic gave album three out of five stars commenting that songs were lighter and more pop driven than disney soundtracks from 90s but they are not childish score of ferngully which was composed and produced by alan silvestri was also

performance was described as a moderate success though it was considered to have done less well than expected possibly due to its ecological message joseph from newsday however described box office performance as dismal though noted it was most successful recent non disney animated film co executive producer jaime willett and josh baran who worked on film s marketing both spoke of difficulties of getting attention to an animated film that was not produced by disney with willett stating box office revenue would have at least doubled by simply having headline walt disney presents on film usa today noted that combined box office gross of ferngully and five other non disney animated films released in 1992 did not even equal a third of gross for disney s 1991 film beauty and beast critical response ferngully received generally positive reviews film holds an approval rating of 63 at rotten tomatoes based on 16 reviews film critic roger ebert gave it three out of four stars saying film was visually very pleasing told a useful lesson and although movie is not a masterpiece it s pleasant to watch for its humor and sweetness hollis chacona from austin chronicle added that film was funny pretty touching scary magical stuff janet maslin of new york times had an unfavorable impression of film describing it as a n uncertain blend of sanctimonious principles and saturday morning cartoon aesthetics according to wayne young jeffrey katzenberg then chairman of walt disney studios called producers of ferngully to tell them that he loved film legacy wayne young stated that portions of film s gross would be donated to greenpeace rainforest foundation fund and sierra club as well as a special fund benefiting environmental projects worldwide that was administered by smithsonian institution though he did not disclose exact figures film also inspired a 1992 video game by capstone software and called ferngully computerized coloring book in 1998 film was followed by
