an ala or hala plural ale or hali is a female mythological creature recorded in folklore of bulgarians macedonians and serbs ale are considered demons of bad weather whose main purpose is to lead hail producing thunderclouds in direction of fields vineyards or orchards to destroy crops or loot and take them away extremely voracious ale particularly like to eat children though their gluttony is not limited to earth it is believed they sometimes try devouring sun or moon causing eclipses and that it would mean end of world should they succeed when people encounter an ala their mental or physical health or even life are in peril however her favor can be gained by approaching her with respect and trust being in a good relationship with an ala is very beneficial because she makes her favorites rich and saves their lives in times of trouble appearance of an ala is diversely and often vaguely described in folklore a given ala may look like a black wind a gigantic creature of indistinct form a huge mouthed humanlike or snakelike monster a female dragon or a raven an ala may also assume various human or animal shapes and can even possess a person s body it is believed that diversity of appearances described is due to ala s being a synthesis of a slavic demon of bad weather and a similar demon of central balkans pre slavic population in folk tales with a humanlike ala her personality is similar to that of russian baba yaga ale are said to live in clouds or in a lake spring hidden remote place forest inhospitable mountain cave or gigantic tree while ale are usually hostile towards humans they do have other powerful enemies that can defeat them like dragons in christianized tales st elijah takes dragons role but in some cases saint and dragons fight ale together eagles are also regarded as defenders against ale chasing them away from fields and thus preventing them from bringing hail clouds overhead origin while some mythological beings are common to all slavic ethnic groups ale seem to be exclusive to bulgarian macedonian and serb folklore even so other slavic groups also had demons of bad weather among east slavs this witch was called baba yaga and was imagined as a woman of gigantic stature with a big nose iron teeth and protruding chin it was believed that she ate children and her presence brought thunderstorms and cold weather term baba is present in customs beliefs and toponyms of all slavic groups usually as a personification of wind darkness and rain this leads some scholars to believe there was a proto slavic divinity or demon called baba associated with bad weather traces of beliefs in that demon are preserved among south slavs in expressions for bad weather common in early spring baba marta huke etc brought to balkans from ancient homeland these beliefs combined with those of native populations eventually developing into personage of ala pre slavic balkan source of ala is related to female demons of bad weather of vlachs of serbia who like ale led hail clouds over crops to ruin them and uprooted trees a greek female demon lamia might also have contributed in development of ala just like ale she eats children and is called gluttonous in southern serbia and macedonia a word derived from lamia is also a synonym for ala bulgarian has remained a creature distinct from ala but shares many similarities with her numerous variations in form of ale ranging from animal and half animal to humanlike concepts tell us that beliefs in these demons were not uniform etymology r ipac r demon s name in standard serbian ala comes from dialects which lost velar fricative while hala is recorded in a serbian dialect which has retained this sound and in bulgarian for this reason it is believed that original name had an initial h sound a fact that has led serbian scholar ljubinko radenkovic to reject etymology given by several dictionaries including that of serbian academy of sciences and arts by which demon s name comes from turkish word ala snake as that word lacks h sound name may instead stem from greek word for hail khalaza pronounced transliterated or khalaza this etymology is proposed by bulgarian scholar georgieva and supported by bulgarian scholar popov and serbian scholars slobodan zecevic and petrovic according to serbian scholar marta bjeletic ala and hala stem from noun xala in proto south slavic dialect of proto slavic from which south slavic languages emerged x in xala represents voiceless velar fricative that noun was derived from proto slavic root denoting fury of elements a possible cognate in kashubian language might be hala a large creature or thing appearance dragon or serpent like demon connected with wind and thunderstorm and hail clouds it was believed in gruza region of central serbia that ala is invisible but that she can be heard her powerful hissing resonated in front of dark hail clouds in bulgaria farmers saw a horrible ala with huge wings and sword like thick tail in contours of a dark cloud when an ala cloud overtook village villagers peered into sky hoping to see an imperial eagle emerging there they believed that mighty bird with a cross on its back could banish ala cloud from fields in eastern bulgaria ala appeared not in clouds but in gales and whirlwinds in other regions of bulgaria ala was seen either as a bull with huge horns a black cloud dark fog or a snake like monster with six wings and twelve tails ala is thought to inhabit remote mountain areas or caves in which she keeps bad weather in bulgarian tradition thunderstorms and hail clouds were interpreted as a battle between good dragon or eagle and evil ala serbs in kosovo believed that ala lowers her tail to ground and hides her head in clouds anyone who saw her head became instantly insane in a high relief carved above a window of monastery s church an eagle clutches a snakelike ala while an eaglet looks on according to a description from eastern serbia ala is a very large creature with a snake s body and a horse s head a very common opinion is that ala is sister of dragon and looks more or less like him in a spell from eastern serbia ala is described as a three headed snake u jedna usta vile i usta i usta in one mouth she bears fairies and winds second mouth infirmity and bad diseases third mouth spells curses by a description recorded in boljevac region ala is a black and horrible creature in form of wind similarly in homolje region of eastern serbia people imagine ala as a black wind moving over land wherever she goes a whirlwind blows turning like a drill and those who get exposed to whirlwind go mad in bulgaria too ala is a violent wind that sweeps up everything in its way and brings havoc do tri khali godini se three furious ale had come out for nine years they would be blowing a belief from leskovac region states ala is a monster with an enormous mouth who holds in her hand a big wooden spoon with which she grabs and devours everything that gets in her way one story has it that a man kept such an ala in his barn she drank thirty liters of milk every day another warns that ale in form of twelve ravens used to take crops from vineyards in eastern serbia it was believed that ale who interact with people can metamorphose into humans or animals after which their true selves can be seen only by so called men with six fingers on both hands and six toes on both feet though human looking ale cause houses to shake when they enter by a belief recorded in homolje region ale that charge to moon also display shapeshifting abilities they repeatedly shift from their basic shape of two headed snakes to six fingered men who hold iron pitchforks black young bulls big boars or black wolves and back effect on humans thumb locals of kopaonik mountain depicted believed that local ala defended crops from outsider ale ale primarily destroy crops in fields vineyards and orchards by leading hail storm clouds overhead usually during first half of summer when grain crops ripen ale are also believed to drink crops or seize crops of a village and transport them to another place in their huge ears thereby making some villages poor and others rich this was held as reason why aleksandrovac region in central serbia was so fruitful it was where ale transported their loot people of kopaonik mountain believed local ala defended crops of area from other ale if hail destroyed crops it was thought that an ala from another area had defeated local ala and drunk crops ale can also spread themselves over fields and thwart ripening of crops or worse consume field s fertility and drink milk from sheep especially when it thunders ale also possess great strength when a storm uprooted trees people believed that an ala had done it this resulted in a saying for a very strong man jak kao ala as strong as an ala at sight of hail and thunderstorm clouds i e ala that leads them people did not just sit and wait they resorted to magic in region this magic was assisted by ala s herbs picked in levees and places on a field where a plow turns around during plowing these locations were considered unclean because ale visited them in folk spells of eastern serbia a particular ala could be addressed by a female personal name kalina magdalena dobrica etc an expression for addressing an ala is of uncertain meaning one of spells that was used upon sighting hail clouds and which explicitly mentioned an ala was shouted in direction of clouds alo ne ovamo na tatar planinu ala not hither travel to tatar mountain another spell was spoken by a a woman versed in magic while she performed a suitable ritual ne alo ovamo ovamo je ala u planinu gde ne gde pas ne gde ne gde ne gde se slava ne not hither ala a mightier bareheaded ala is here off into mountain cloud where no rooster crows where no dog barks where no cows bellow where no sheep bleat where slava is not celebrated as several other supernatural entities were also held responsible for bringing hail and torrential rains when entity is not explicitly named it is often impossible to conclude to which magical measures apply there was for example a custom used when approach of a thunderstorm was perceived to bring a table in front of house and to put bread salt a knife with a black sheath and an axe with its edge directed skywards on table by another custom a fireplace with its legs directed skywards knives forks and stub of slava candle were put on table another characteristic attributed to ala is extreme voracity in leskovac region she was imagined as a monster with a huge mouth and a wooden spoon in her hand with which she grabbed and devoured whatever came her way according to a widely spread tradition ale used to seize children and devour them in her dwelling which was full of children s bones and spilt blood less often they attacked and ate adults they were able to find a hidden human by smell people in eastern and southern serbia believed that ale in their voracity attacked sun and moon they gradually ate more and more of those celestial bodies thereby causing an eclipse during an eclipse sun turned red because it was covered with its own blood as a result of ale s bites when it shone brightly again that meant it had defeated ale spots on moon were seen as scars from ale s bites while ale devoured sun or moon many elderly people became depressed and even wept in fear if ale succeeded in devouring sun world would end to prevent that men shot their guns toward eclipse or rang bells and women cast spells incessantly there was a notion in homolje region that if ale succeeded in devouring moon sun would die from sorrow and darkness would overwhelm world ale were believed to be able to make men insane in eastern serbia there is a special term for such a man alosan when people encountered an ala on a road or field they could get dangerous diseases from her ale are also responsible for dogs rabies although indirectly a skylark that reaches clouds and encounters an ala there goes mad alosan plunges to ground and so kills itself a dog that finds and eats bird goes mad too traversing a crossroads at night was considered dangerous because it was place and time of ala s supper unfortunate person who stepped on an ala s table could become blind deaf or lame ale gather at night on eves of greater holidays divert men from their ways into gullies and torture them there by riding them like horses ala can sneak into humans gaining a human form while retaining their own properties a tradition has it that an ala sneaked into st simeon which made him voracious but st sava took her out of him in a tale recorded in eastern serbia and bulgaria a farmer killed an ala who possessed a skinny man living in a distant village because ala destroyed his vineyard in another story an ala gets into a deceased princess and devours soldiers on watch a human going into an ala s house which is frequently deep in a forest but may also be in clouds in a lake spring cave gigantic tree or other hidden remote place or on an inhospitable mountain can have varied consequences if he approaches ala with an appeal and does not mention differences between her and humans he will be rewarded otherwise he will be cruelly punished according to one story a stepdaughter driven away from home by her stepmother comes to an ala s house addresses her with word mother picks lice from ala s hair full of worms and feeds ala s livestock of owls wolves badgers and other wild animals behaving and talking as if these things are quite normal to her and is rewarded by ala with a chest filled with gold when stepmother s daughter comes to ala s house she does opposite and ala punishes her and her mother by sending them a chest of snakes which blind them in another example when a prince asks an ala for her daughter s hand she saves him from other ale and helps him get married but when a girl to whom an ala is godmother visits ala with her mother ala eats them both because mother talked about strange things in her house that even a dead ala is bad is seen in legend explaining origin of golubatz fly simulium beside biological data page mentions a legend on black flies from carpathians a species of bloodsucking black fly of genus simulium that can be lethal to livestock legend recorded in district in 19th century by vuk karadzic tells how a serbian man after a chase caught and wounded an ala but she broke away and fled into a cave near golubac a town in district where she died of wounds ever since her body has bred golubatz flies and in late spring they fly out of cave in a big swarm spreading as far as sumadija people walled up cave s opening once but when time came for flies to swarm wall shattered aloviti men thumb grand prince stefan nemanja was believed to have been aloviti ala like in serbia men believed to possess properties of an ala were called aloviti ala like men and they were given several explanations an ala may have sneaked into them these were recognized by their voracity because ala in order to satisfy her excessive hunger drove them to eat incessantly they may also have survived an ala blowing on them an ala s breath is usually lethal to humans these people would then become exceptionally strong alternatively they could be offspring of an ala and a woman or could have been born covered with caul it was believed that aloviti men could not be killed with a gun or arrow unless gold or silver was used like ale aloviti men led hail producing and thunderstorm clouds when skies darkened such a man would fall into a trance and his spirit would fly out of his body toward clouds as if his spirit were an ala herself there was however a significant difference he never led clouds over fields of his own village damage was done to neighboring villages in this respect aloviti men are equivalent to zduhaci besides leading clouds away an aloviti man could also fight against ale to protect his village children too could be aloviti and they fought ale using plough beams in these fights they were helped by aesculapian snake smuk in serbian and for this reason people would not hurt these snakes there is a story about an aloviti man who is described as unusually tall thin bony faced and with a long beard and moustache when weather was nice he worked and behaved like other people in his village but as soon as dark clouds covered sky he used to close himself in his house put blinds on windows and remain alone and in a trance as long as bad weather and thunder lasted historical persons believed to be aloviti men are stefan nemanja and stefan decanski in modern serbian adjective still signifies voracious appetite adversaries right thumb in folklore st elijah often replaces pagan dragon as ala s main opponent ale have several adversaries including dragons zmajeviti dragon like men eagles st elijah and st sava principal enemy of ala is dragon he is able to defeat her and eliminate her harmful effects dragons are thus seen as guardians of fields and harvest and as protectors against bad weather when an ala threatens by bringing hail clouds a dragon comes out to fight with her and drive her away his main weapon is lightning thunder represents a fight between ale and dragons during which ale hide in tall trees an instance of a more abundant crop at a particular point is explained in region as a result of a dragon having struck an ala with lightning just over that place making her drop looted grains she had been carrying in her huge ears if an ala finds a dragon in a hollow tree however she can destroy him by burning tree ale can be defeated by zmajeviti men who have a human mother but a dragon father they look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits such men are always born at night after a twelve month term much like a zduhac a zmajeviti man lives like everybody else when weather is nice but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight he falls into a trance and his spirit comes out of his body and flies up to clouds to fight with ala just like a dragon would do a story from banat which was held as true until 1950s says that before world war i an exhausted ala in form of a giant snake fell from clouds onto a road explanation of event was that ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man people gave her milk to help her recover in a christianized version duel involves christian st elijah and ala but there is a belief that saint and dragons in fact cooperate as soon as st elijah spots an ala he summons dragons either takes them aboard his chariot or harnesses them to it and they jointly shoot ala with lightning arrow shaped stones like belemnites or stone age arrowheads are regarded as materialized lightning bolts imbued with a beneficial magical power and finding one is a good omen in a more christianized version st elijah shoots lightning at devils who lead hail clouds devils in this case are obviously ale as shown by these examples beliefs with various degrees of christianization from none to almost complete can exist side by side an eagle s appearance in sky when thunderclouds threatened was greeted with joy and hope by people who trusted in their power to defeat an ala after defeating ala eagle led clouds away from fields an explanation for this recorded in eastern serbia is that eagles which nest in vicinity of a village want thunderstorms and hail as far as possible from their nestlings so coincidentally protect village s fields as well role of eagles however was controversial because in same region there was a belief that an eagle flying in front of thunderstorm clouds was a manifestation of an ala leading clouds toward crops rather than driving them away connection with baba yaga thumb upright a painting of baba yaga in her human like form ala is similar to baba yaga comparing folk tales there are similarities between ala and russian baba yaga aforementioned motif of a stepdaughter coming to an ala s house in a forest is recorded among russians too there a stepdaughter comes to baba yaga s house and feeds her livestock similar are also motifs of an ala by serbs and baba yaga by russians becoming to children whom they later eat because children discover their secret in serbian example mother of an ala s godchild speaks with ala and in russian godchild speaks with baba yaga serbian tale yesterday woman went to ala s house with her child ala s godchild upon entering first room she saw a poker and a broom fighting in second room she saw human legs in fourth human flesh in fifth blood in sixth she saw that ala had taken off her head and was delousing it while wearing a horse s head in its place after that ala brought lunch and said to woman eat kuma how can i eat after i saw a poker and a broom fighting in first room eat kuma eat those are my maids they fight about which one should take broom and sweep how can i eat after i saw human arms and legs in second and third rooms and ala told her eat kuma eat that is my food how can i eat kuma after i saw sixth room full of blood eat kuma eat that is wine that i drink how can i eat after i saw that you had taken your head off and were delousing it having fixed a horse s head on yourself ala after hearing that ate both woman and her child russian tale on her name day girl goes to her godmother s house with cakes to treat her she comes to gate gate is closed with a human leg she goes into yard there a barrel full of blood she goes up stairs there dead children porch is closed with an arm on floor arms legs door is closed with a finger baba yaga comes to meet her at door and asks her have you seen anything my dear on your way to my house i saw girl answers gate closed with a leg that is my iron latch i saw a barrel in yard full of blood that is my wine my darling i saw children lying on stairs those are my pigs porch is closed with an arm that is my latch my golden one i saw in house a hairy head that is my broom my curly one said baba yaga then got angry with her prying goddaughter and ate her two examples witness chthonic nature of these mythological creatures a hero can enter chthonic space and discover secret of that world but he is not allowed to relate that secret to other humans both ala and baba yaga can be traced back to an older concept of a female demonic divinity snakelike mistress of underworld annotations references sources first appeared in academic journal issue no 2 1996 kragujevac serbia pages 11 16 online version published by
