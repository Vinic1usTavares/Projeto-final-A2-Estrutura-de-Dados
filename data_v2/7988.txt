zancanella with tedder and blanco also serving as song s producers it is a midtempo electropop and reggae pop song which begins with stefani announcing uh huh here we go to a rubbery bass line and hand claps song also has a hip hop inflected breakdown in which stefani raps you can tell me what you re boy and you can tell me if i m gettin warm lyrically song discusses insecurities in a relationship where stefani questions her man s love nolan feeney of time complimented that song is about falling in love with someone who s got a few skeletons in their closet as noted by spins brennan carley stefani sounds shattered as she sings but there s something behind those eyes those eyes that you can t that you can t disguise disguise in stomping infuriatingly catchy chorus she sings baby don t baby don t baby don t lie i don t want to cry no longer melodically baby don t lie is written in key of b minor performed in a common time moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute and follows sequence bm g d as its chord progression stefani s voice spans two octaves from lowest note a3 to highest note a5 critical reception baby don t lie received generally mixed to favorable reviews from music critics who commended song s reggae flavour but some dismissed stefani s performance on track sal cinquemani wrote for slant magazine that single doesn t venture too far from her band s established template claiming that it finds stefani effortlessly grooving to a reggae flavored beat and an admittedly catchy hook complete with her signature yelp but it hews too close to sound of no doubt s slept on sixth album push and shove cinquemani also noted that during song s breakdown she feels forced even for eternally youthful stefani on an otherwise breezy track bradley stern wrote for muumuse that song is dangerously catchy and an obvious radio smash upon first listen nolan feeney of time remarked that in less capable hands baby don t lie would leave a weaker impression but stefani and all her vocal idiosyncrasies find a way to make it her own christina lee from idolator noted that stefani hiccups through her lyrics like rihanna does in 2012 s sia written diamonds save for love angel music baby ready sung rap breakdown however lee observed that considering song s subject matter her bold faced collaborators ryan tedder benny blanco and noel zancanella and of course her own track record stefani s new song isn t nearly as assertive as i had expected brennan carley of spin simply called it a pretty broadly pop effort in line with 2012 s no doubt record push and shove lucas villa of axs was mixed with song writing that gwen had always been ahead of pop curve on her past two albums but baby don t lie sees her on par with everyone else currently on charts mike ayers of wall street journal believed that gwen doesn t sound too inspired here while carolyn menyes of music times disagreed noting that song doesn t seem to have quite infectious annoyance of some of stefani s other works but it s a more solid well rounded pop single menyes also praised her signature sassy slightly reggae touched vocals which according to herself sells emotions of this song steven j horowitz from billboard noted that even though song embraces her stefani less experimental side it misses her signature bite rating it three stars out of five chart performance baby don t lie charted moderately in north america after its release track debuted at number 35 on billboard adult pop songs chart and at number 29 on billboard pop songs chart respectively for week ending

muller and muller has worked with stefani in numerous videos from her band no doubt and her solo career on october 20 2014 stefani posted on her instagram a sneak peek of behind scenes from video it was released on october 21 2014 day after song s release according to daniel kreps from rolling stone video which is a play on wizard of oz stars a wildly polygonal yellow brick road an army of dancers and mountains of reoccurring stefani patterns like bold black and white stripes houndstooth and plenty of pink kreps continued description commenting that in eye popping video stefani and her dancers are shown with bright pink beats by dre headphones around her neck while using beats music app jason lipshutz of billboard added that video has gwen tiptoeing down a morphing yellow road and showing off first in her array of polka dotted outfits with a dance troupe eventually ing to jazz up clip a little beginning of music video finds singer in a gray world but by end of video same scenes are now shown in full color reception video received divided critics lipshutz was disappointed in it commenting that colorful video lacks innovation of say stefani s what you waiting for visual james grebey of spin stated how he was frustrated with video s glitchy low resolution land of colorful patterns and shapes calling it a jarring rejection of aesthetic design made all more confusing when last third of video suddenly changes scenery from a computer generated to a back alley filled with live action cars jeff benjamin of fuse noted that video is not wacky and sassy like past stefani visuals like wind it up or hollaback girl but praised video writing that it oozes sophistication while still adding gwen s signature quirky side with its crazy computer effects carolyn menyes of music times was favorable remarking that video fits song s strong reggae vibes with stefani channeling everything that s chaotic and trippy not just about her own genre but also about her single bradley stern was more negative claiming that video lacks a storyline complaining about its resolution and named it a phoned in green screen affair with some poorly rendered graphics bianca gracie wrote for idolator that video s geometric and graphic animation is nothing new but praised fun dance scene towards end which breaks monotony of video track listing digital download baby don t lie 3 21 digital
