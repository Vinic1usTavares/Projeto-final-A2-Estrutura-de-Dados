lynton barnstaple railway l b opened as an independent railway in may 1898 it was a single track narrow gauge railway and was slightly over long running through rugged and picturesque area bordering exmoor in north devon england although opened after 1896 light railways act came into force it was authorised and constructed prior to that act therefore as with all other railways it was authorised under its own act of parliament and built to higher and more costly standards than similar railways of time in united kingdom it was notable as being only narrow gauge line required to use main line standard signalling for a short period line earned a modest return for shareholders but for most of its life l b made a loss g a brown j d c a prideaux h g radcliffe lynton barnstaple railway

several schemes were proposed from established railway companies and independent developers one scheme suggested electric power while another proposed a line from south none of these schemes offered sufficient prospects to encourage investment and few got further than initial plans due to difficult terrain one scheme suggested a narrow gauge already in use by and elsewhere to ease construction this scheme was supported by sir george newnes publisher of and strand magazine who became chairman of company lynton barnstaple railway bill was passed on 27 june 1895 and line opened on 11 may 1898 with public service commencing on 16 may connecting with trains from waterloo on ilfracombe branch line at barnstaple town scheme did not meet with universal enthusiasm and from beginning there were some who doubted true intentions of promoters although many of sinuous curves and deviations were due to having to maintain a 1 in 50 gradient where there was no leeway most observers being oblivious to fact that a straighter shorter line would have made gradient even steeper several were due to resistance by local landowners along route a guide published whilst line was being built stated l b seldom attracted sufficient passengers to remain viable journey of nearly took on average an hour and a half to satisfy several influential residents terminus at lynton was some distance from town itself and from cliff railway to lynmouth declining tourism during first world war improved roads increased car ownership further depleted line s income until it was no longer economic a guidebook
