road plan called for a limited objective attack to restore rok 1st division lines in vicinity of a village north of tabu dong m26 pershing tanks of c company 73rd tank battalion and two batteries of 37th field artillery battalion were to support 27th infantry in attack terrain in front of 27th infantry position poplar lined taegu sangju road ran northward in narrow mountain valley a stream on west closely paralleled road which was nearly straight on a north south axis through 27th infantry position and for some distance northward this stretch of road later became known as bowling alley about in front of 27th infantry position road forked at a small village called ch onp yong dong western prong was main sangju road eastern one was road to kunwi at road fork sangju road bends to northwest in a long curve village of sinjumak lay on this curve a short distance north of fork hills protected it against direct fire from 27th infantry position it was there that kpa tanks remained hidden during daytime rising from valley on west side was yuhak san mountain range which swept up to a height of on east a similar mountain range rose to a height of culminating southward in a mountain called ka san more than high at its walled summit kunwi and sangju roads from northeast and northwest entered natural and easy corridor between yuhak san and ka san at ch onp yong dong leading into taegu basin battles in bowling alley occurred south of this road junction battle deadlock rok 1st infantry division with 7 500 men had held line around bowling alley since august 12 bowling alley area was selected because of its advantageous high ground which provided natural barriers to funnel kpa troops into smaller fronts where rok defenses could attack them from high ground in concealed positions in meantime kpa 3rd 13th and 15th divisions were advancing south and preparing to close on taegu kpa 13th division converged on tabu dong corridor and a vicious melee ensued between kpa and rok troops with rok 1st division s 11th 12th and 13th regiments committed against kpa 13th division s 19th 21st and 23rd regiments fight became a battle of attrition as two sides closed on one another battle took a brutal turn by august 15 as supplies ran low and units were locked in close quarters combat with little ammunition for weapons fighting across entire front became hand to hand combat and grenade fights at close range two divisions were so evenly matched that neither could make any appreciable gains for days of fighting and huge numbers of casualties bloody fighting obliged paik to call for emergency reinforcements to hold line eighth army responded immediately by sending us 27th infantry as well as rok 10th regiment 8th division to reinforce rok 1st division s three regiments us air force aircraft also conducted a carpet bombing campaign against advancing kpa positions to undetermined effect around that time kpa 15th division which had been supporting kpa 13th division withdrew from front to attack elsewhere leaving rok 1st division with us 27th infantry and kpa 13th division as principal opponents in conflict that followed us infantry advance as 27th infantry s trucks rolled northward from tabu dong and approached their line of departure men inside could see kpa and rok fighting on ridges overlooking road infantry dismounted and deployed an attacking line with 1st battalion on left of road and 2nd battalion on right with us tanks leading infantry on road two battalions crossed line at 13 00 tanks opened fire against mountain escarpments to aid rok infantry engaged there us infantry on either side of road swept lower hills as tanks on road paced their advance with infantry a kpa outpost line in valley withdrew and there was almost no kpa opposition during first hour of us advance kpa outpost lines were in front of their main positions 27th infantry had reached a point about north of tabu dong when michaelis was informed that neither of rok regiments on high ground flanking valley road had been able to advance he was ordered to halt and form a perimeter defense with both battalions astride road two battalions of 27th infantry went into a perimeter defense just north of village of soi ri 1st battalion on left of road took a position with c company on high ground in front and with a company on a ridge behind it on their right b company was placed parallel to a company and carried line across stream and narrow valley to road there 2nd battalion took up defense line with e company on road and f company on its right while g company held a ridge behind f company thus two battalions presented a four company front with one company holding a refused flank position on either side a platoon of tanks took positions on front line two tanks on road and two in stream bed with four more tanks in reserve artillery went into firing positions behind force six bazooka teams took up positions in front of infantry positions along road and in stream bed at same time rok 1st division remained in control of high ground on either side of 27th infantry positions august 18 attack first of seven successive kpa night attacks struck 27th infantry defensive perimeter shortly after dark that night august 18 kpa mortars and artillery fired a heavy preparation for general attack for several hours two t 34 tanks and an su 76 self propelled gun moved out of village of sinjumak in front of 27th infantry lines infantry followed them some in trucks and others on foot lead tank moved slowly and without firing apparently observing while second one and su 76 fired repeatedly into f company s position as tanks drew near a 3 5 inch bazooka team from f company destroyed second one in line bazooka teams also hit lead tank causing its crew to abandon it fire from 8th field artillery battalion knocked out self propelled gun destroyed two trucks and killed or wounded an estimated 100 kpa troops at point of advance us first lieutenant lewis millett an artillery forward observer and later a medal of honor winner after he transferred to infantry directed this artillery fire on kpa even as a t 34 tank approached within of his position three more t 34s had come down road but on realizing that americans had effective anti tank weapons they switched on their running lights and retreated north without engaging un troops around 00 30 on august 19 first kpa attack had stalled and they withdrew kpa troops made a second effort much weaker than first around 02 30 but artillery and mortar fire dispersed them before they reached un lines over course of next week us troops were able to discern kpa system of attack and use it to their advantage kpa used a system of flares to signal various actions and coordinate them it quickly became apparent to defending americans that green flares were used to signal an attack on a given area so 27th infantry obtained its own green flares and then after kpa attack had begun fired them over its main defensive positions this confused attacking forces and often drew them to points of greatest us strength where they suffered massive casualties from defensive machine gun crossfire us troops also began using land mines in front of their positions to stall kpa mines stopped tanks and infantry tried to remove them when this happened us troops fired flares to illuminate scene and pre registered artillery and mortar fire blasted immobilized kpa this tactic was effective in inflicting further significant casualties stalemate on morning of august 19 rok 11th and 13th regiments launched counterattacks along ridges with some gains however fight continued to produce heavy casualties for both sides walker ordered another reserve unit a battalion of rok 10th regiment to taegu front to close a gap between rok 1st and 6th divisions later in day walker also ordered us 23rd infantry regiment under command of colonel paul l freeman jr to move up and establish a defense perimeter around 8th and 37th field artillery battalions at their positions north of taegu to protect them from kpa attack this was only occasion during war that two us regiments were assigned to a rok command 3rd battalion 23rd infantry took up a defensive position around artillery while 2nd battalion occupied a defensive position on road behind 27th infantry next day two battalions exchanged places rok troops suffering losses from fighting began recruiting students and civilians from nearby villages to fight thumb 250px alt a pair of heavily damaged tanks destroyed in a ditch destroyed north korean t 34 tanks 1950 there was little fighting on ground during day on august 20 however us aircraft attacked kpa positions around taegu repeatedly during day often in close proximity to american ground forces as night fell kpa troops launched a second attack firing a barrage of 120 mm mortar shells into 27th infantry s heavy weapons company area at 17 00 several of their tanks also began advancing down corridor us troops responded with artillery and mortar fire hitting kpa column and its accompanying infantry waiting americans held their small arms and machine gun fire until kpa were within of their positions combined fire of all us weapons repulsed this attack next morning august 21 a us patrol of two platoons of infantry and m26 pershing tanks went up road toward kpa positions white flags had appeared in front of american line and civilians in area said many kpa wanted to surrender us patrol s mission was to investigate this situation and to form an estimate of kpa losses patrol advanced about engaging small kpa groups and receiving some artillery fire on its way it destroyed five disabled kpa tanks with grenades patrol also found a 37 mm anti tank gun two su 76 self propelled guns and a 120 mm mortar among destroyed kpa equipment as well as recognizing a large number of kpa dead at point of farthest advance patrol found and destroyed an abandoned t 34 tank in a village schoolhouse courtyard august 21 attack that evening 27th infantry placed two belts of antipersonnel mines and trip flares across road and stream bed and in front of its positions in valley after dusk kpa began shelling general area of 27th infantry positions until just before midnight rok troops had planned to mount an attack but it became apparent that kpa would hit first then kpa 13th division launched a major attack against entire un front in and around valley nine us tanks supported infantry troops in valley because it was on higher ground and positioned in front of all other american units c company on left of road usually was first to detect an approaching attack that evening c company commander telephoned regimental headquarters that he could hear tanks when artillery fired an illuminating shell he was able to count 19 kpa vehicles in attacking column on road tanks and self propelled guns approached american positions firing rapidly most of their shells landed in rear areas kpa infantry moved forward on both sides of road simultaneously other kpa units attacked rok troops on high ridges flanking valley american artillery and mortar fire bombarded kpa trying to separate tanks from infantry us machine gun fire opened on kpa infantry only after they had entered mine field and were at close range us m26 tanks in front line held their fire until kpa tanks came very close one of american tanks knocked out lead kpa tank and a bazooka team from f company knocked out a towed gun third vehicle in column trapped second tank was disabled by bazooka fire and abandoned by its crew it was during this fight that battle received its name us troops at battle noted tank shells being fired up and down valley in dark looked like bowling balls artillery and 90 mm tank fire destroyed seven more kpa t 34s three more su 76 towed guns and several trucks and personnel carriers this night battle which was at times very intense lasted about five hours us b battery 8th field artillery battalion alone fired 1 661 105 mm rounds 4 2 inch mortar platoon fired 902 rounds 81 mm mortar platoon fired 1 200 rounds and f company 27th infantry fired 385 60 mm mortar rounds kpa column was completely destroyed us patrols after daylight estimated kpa had suffered 1 300 casualties in fight eleven prisoners captured by patrol said action had decimated their units and that division was only at 25 percent strength north korean flanking moves during night battle kpa forces infiltrated along high ridge line around east flank of 27th infantry and appeared next day at about 12 00 in rear of that regiment and only from taegu this force was a regiment of kpa 1st division and was 1 500 men strong regiment had just arrived from kunwi area to join in battle for taegu it began ambushing supply lines to american forces in valley one of regiment s companies attacked rok 1st division s headquarters with intent to capture paik but was repulsed by rok 10th regiment about this time michaelis sent an urgent message to eighth army saying that rok troops on his left had given way and that those people are not fighting one of battalions of rok 11th regiment had been driven back and was retreating in disarray prisoners told him that about 1 000 kpa were on his west flank he asked for an air strike had these kpa troops been driven from this high ground perimeter position of 27th infantry regiment would have been untenable paik bitterly resented michaelis charge that his men were not fighting and in argument eighth army korean military advisory group advisers visited each rok unit to ensure they were remaining in position paik personally rallied rok 11th regiment for a charge back into its positions impressing michaelis later michaelis apologized to paik though their relationship for remainder of battle remained strained on afternoon of august 22 2nd battalion 23rd infantry guarding support artillery behind 27th infantry came under attack by kpa 1st division troops that had passed around forward positions freeman reported to eighth army at 16 40 that kpa had shelled rear battery of 37th field artillery battalion that kpa infantry were between us 27th and us 23rd regiments on road and that other kpa groups had passed around east side of his forward battalion an intense artillery barrage began falling on headquarters area of 8th field artillery battalion at 16 05 and 25 minutes later two direct hits destroyed fire direction center killing four officers and two non commissioned officers individual batteries quickly took over control of battalion fires and continued to support infantry while battalion headquarters and headquarters company withdrew under fire un aircraft launched air strikes on kpa held ridge east of road and on valley beyond that night walker released control of 23rd infantry less 1st battalion to us 1st cavalry division with orders for it to clear kpa from road and commanding ground overlooking main supply route about 10 00 lieutenant colonel chong pong uk commanding artillery regiment supporting kpa 13th division walked up alone to a rok 1st division position north of tabu dong and defected chong highest ranking kpa prisoner of war thus far in war gave precise information on location of his artillery according to him there were seven 122 mm howitzers and thirteen 76 mm guns emplaced and camouflaged in an orchard north of tabu dong in a little valley on north side of yuhak san upon receiving this information eighth army immediately prepared to destroy kpa weapons fighter bombers attacked orchard site with napalm and us artillery took location under fire chong was eventually commissioned in south korea s armed forces final moves during night of august 22 23 kpa launched a weak attack against 27th infantry which was quickly repulsed just before 12 00 on august 23 however a violent action occurred some distance behind front line when about 100 kpa soldiers undetected succeeded in reaching positions of k company 27th infantry and of 1st platoon c company 65th engineer combat battalion they overran parts of these positions before being driven off and suffering 50 killed meanwhile as ordered by walker 2nd battalion 23rd infantry after repelling several kpa night attacks counterattacked at dawn and seized high ground overlooking road at artillery positions at same time 3rd battalion started an all day attack that swept a stretch of high ground east of road this action largely cleared kpa from area behind and on flanks of 27th infantry at 13 35 michaelis reported from bowling alley to eighth army that kpa 13th division had blown road to his front had mined it and was withdrawing next day august 24 23rd infantry continued clearing rear areas and by night it estimated that there were fewer than 200 kpa behind forward positions bowling alley front was quiet during day shortly after midnight on august 24 kpa launched what had by now become their regular nightly attack down bowling alley this attack was in an estimated two company strength supported by a few tanks 27th infantry broke up attack and two more kpa tanks were destroyed by supporting artillery fire this was last night 27th infantry regiment spent in bowling alley with kpa turned back north of taegu walker issued orders for 27th infantry to leave
