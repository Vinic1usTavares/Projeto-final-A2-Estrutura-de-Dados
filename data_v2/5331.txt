chincoteague pony also known as assateague horse is a breed of horse that developed and lives in a feral condition on assateague island in states of virginia and maryland in united states breed was made famous by misty of chincoteague series of novels written by marguerite henry starting in 1947 while phenotypically horse like they are commonly called ponies this is due in part to their smaller stature created by poor habitat on assateague island variation is found in their physical characteristics due to blood from different breeds being introduced at various points in their history they can be any solid color and are often found in pinto patterns which are a favorite with breed enthusiasts island chincoteagues live on a diet of salt marsh plants and brush this poor quality and often scarce food combined with uncontrolled inbreeding created a propensity for conformation faults in chincoteague before outside blood was added beginning in early 20th century several legends are told regarding origins of chincoteague ponies most popular holds that they descend from survivors of wrecked spanish galleons off virginia coast it is more likely that they descend from stock released on island by 17th century colonists looking to escape livestock laws and taxes on mainland in 1835 practice of pony penning began with local residents rounding up ponies and removing some of them to mainland in 1924 first official pony penning day was held by chincoteague volunteer fire company where ponies were auctioned as a way to raise money for fire equipment annual event has continued in same fashion almost uninterrupted to present day although popularly known as chincoteague ponies feral ponies actually live on assateague island entire island is owned by federal government and is split by a fence at maryland virginia state line with a herd of around 150 ponies living on each side of fence herds live on land managed by two different federal agencies with very different management strategies ponies from maryland herd referred to in literature of national park service as assateague horses live within assateague island national seashore they are generally treated as wild animals given no more or less assistance than other species on island other than to be treated with contraceptives to prevent overpopulation conversely virginia herd referred to as chincoteague ponies lives within chincoteague national wildlife refuge but is owned by chincoteague volunteer fire company virginia ponies are treated to twice yearly veterinary inspections which prepare them for life among general equine population if they are sold at auction while only around 300 ponies live on assateague island around 1 000 more live off island having been purchased or bred by private breeders characteristics thumb right a bay pony from maryland herd among plants which make up its diet while phenotypically horses chincoteague is most often referred to as a pony breed chincoteagues average around in their feral state but grow to at least when domesticated and provided better nutrition they generally weigh around all solid colors are found in breed as are pinto patterns horses with pinto coloration tend to sell for most money at annual auction due to outside bloodlines being added to chincoteague herd there is some variation in physical characteristics in general breed tends to have a straight or slightly concave facial profile with a broad forehead and refined throatlatch and neck shoulders are well angled ribs well sprung chest broad and back short with broad loins croup is rounded with a thick low set tail breed s legs tend to be straight with good dense bone that makes them sound and sturdy dutson pp 287 290 domesticated chincoteagues are considered intelligent and willing to please they are viewed as easy to train and are used as hunter driving and trail ponies in terms of health they are generally hardy and easy keepers able to live on little food in late 19th century one author praised their good manners and gentle disposition while reporting story of one pony who was ridden a distance of around in 34 days by a man with equipment a load that weighed around pony weighed approximately lawley pp 224 225 history legend states that chincoteague ponies descend from spanish horses shipwrecked off virginia coast on their way to peru in 16th century another story holds that they descend from horses left on island by pirates both of these theories are unlikely as no documentation has been found to show horses inhabiting island this early and no mention of horses already existing on island was made by colonists on either mainland or island in mid to late 1600s evidence points however to their ancestors actually being horses brought to islands in 17th century by mainland farmers livestock on islands were not subject to taxes or fencing laws and so many animals including hogs sheep cattle and horses were brought to islands while national park service holds to theory that horses were brought to island in 17th century chincoteague volunteer fire company which owns ponies on virginia side of assateague argues that spanish shipwreck theory is correct they argue that horses were too valuable in 17th century to have been left to run wild on island and claim that there are two sunken spanish galleons off virginia coast in support of their theory national chincoteague pony association also promotes shipwreck theory in early 1900s they were described as having been on islands since well before american revolution and were described at that time as very diminutive but many of them are of perfect symmetry and extraordinary powers of action and endurance in early 1800s virginia governor henry a wise released what one author called earliest printed testimony on chincoteague during 1920s before herds were managed by various agencies many conformation faults were found effects of uncontrolled inbreeding misshapen legs narrow chests poor bone and a lack of substance plagued breed with many stunted animals not growing above this was partially due to limited and poor quality feed found on islands although this harsh habitat also allowed only hardiest and most adaptable ponies to survive welsh and shetland pony blood was added to upgrade stock and horses with pinto coloring were introduced to give herd its common distinctive patterns and contribute to more horse like phenotype of breed edwards pp 244 245 twenty mustangs owned by bureau of land management were introduced in 1939 arabian blood was added in hopes of adding refinement and height to breed as well as increasing length of their legs arabian stallions were used at two different points within breed history one was released with herd but did not survive while another was bred to mares that had been removed from island for breeding and then returned once in foal chincoteague pony has a similar history to shackleford banker horse which comes from shackleford banks off coast of north carolina however shackleford is a more isolated population with no outside blood added to island herd dutson p 324 island itself has also undergone change at one time island was connected to lowest point of fenwick island in august 1933 a hurricane created an inlet south of ocean city maryland separating two landforms after storm between 1933 and 1935 a permanent system of artificial jetties was built to preserve inlet as a navigation channel as a result of jetties disrupting sand movement in area island has drifted considerably westward and two landmasses are now over apart pony penning thumb right pony penning 2007 in 1835 first written description of pony penning roundup appeared though practice of rounding up livestock on island existed for many years before that initially unclaimed animals were marked for ownership by groups of settlers by 1885 event had become a festival day and two days of horse and sheep roundups were held on assateague and chincoteague islands while sheep population diminished over time pony population grew in 1909 last wednesday and thursday of july were designated as annual days for pony penning still taking place on both assateague and chincoteague islands however in early 1920s much of assateague island was purchased by a wealthy farmer forcing many settlers to move to chincoteague island and necessitating a change in pony penning format by 1923 all parts of pony penning except for actual roundup had moved to chincoteague island with ponies being transported by truck for first two years before annual swim was begun harris langrish p 80 by early 1900s chincoteague island had been established as a tourism and sport haven and in 1922 a causeway was completed that connected island to virginia mainland after a pair of fires ravaged chincoteague island that same year chincoteague volunteer fire company was established in 1924 first official pony penning day was held where foals were auctioned at 25 50 each to raise money for fire equipment pony penning day has been held annually ever since with exception of 1942 and 1943 currently as many as 50 000 visitors gather on last wednesday in july to watch mounted riders bring virginia herd from assateague and swim them across channel to chincoteague island swim takes five ten minutes with both rider and observers on hand to assist horses especially foals who may have a hard time with crossing before swim herd is evaluated and mares in late stages of pregnancy and those with very young foals are removed from herd to be trailered between islands during swim some lactating mares become affected with which is treated by on site veterinarians larger foals are auctioned next day and majority of herd including any young foals are returned to assateague on friday as of 2015 highest price paid for a pony was 25 000 and lowest price was 500 some ponies are purchased under buy back conditions where bidder donates money to fire department but allows pony to be released back onto assateague island breed registry and preservation national chincoteague pony association was founded in 1985 and chincoteague pony association in 1994 latter is open only to horses purchased from annual auction while former maintains a breed registry and studbook that registers all ponies including those from private breeders many ponies are registered with both associations there are almost 1 000 chincoteague ponies owned by private individuals off chincoteague island spread throughout us and canada management thumb right a pair of ponies in marshes of assateague all of chincoteague island lies within virginia state lines while assateague island is split between two states a larger northern portion in maryland and smaller southern section within virginia two separate herds of ponies live on assateague island separated by a fence that runs along maryland virginia state border though descended from same original stock maryland feral ponies are called assateague horses and are maintained by national park service virginia feral ponies are called chincoteague ponies and are owned by chincoteague volunteer fire department in 1943 entire island was purchased by federal government and divided into two protected areas assateague island national seashore in maryland and chincoteague national wildlife refuge in virginia two herds lie under jurisdiction of different governmental agencies and different management strategies have been applied to each herd maryland section of assateague also contains assateague state park state owned land where ponies are allowed to roam although state plays little or no part in their management feral ponies in both herds separate themselves into small bands with most consisting of a stallion several mares and their foals ponies on assateague have a diet that consists mainly of cordgrass a coarse grass that grows in salt marshes which makes up around 80 percent of their food this diet is supplemented by other vegetation such as rose hips american beach grass seaweed and poison ivy chincoteague ponies require up to twice as much water as most horses require due to saltiness of their diet hendricks pp 48 50 increased amount of water that they drink contributes to many ponies appearing to be bloated or fat maryland herd maryland herd often called assateague herd is owned and managed by national park service its presence on a relatively small and naturally confined area has made it ideal for scientific study since late 1970s scientists have used herd to conduct studies on feral horse behavior social structure ecology remote contraceptive delivery and pregnancy testing and effects of human intervention on other wild animal populations there are few other wildlife populations of any species worldwide that have been studied in as much detail over as long a period as maryland herd of chincoteague ponies thumb left ponies often come into close contact with humans even in their native environment herd numbers grew from 28 to over 165 between 1968 and 1997 and overgrazing negatively impacted their living environment to manage population numbers long term non hormonal contraceptives have been employed proving 95 percent effective over a seven year field trial contraceptive which began to be used at a management level in 1995 although it was used in smaller amounts as early as 1989 has also proven effective at improving health and increasing life expectancy of older mares through removal of pregnancy and lactation related stress since 1990 general herd health has improved early mortality has decreased and older ponies are now found with many over age of 20 and some even over 25 no horse has ever been injured during dart administered treatments although there is a 0 2 percent rate of abscess at injection site which normally heals within two weeks each mare between two and four years old is given contraceptives and treatment is then withdrawn until she produces a foal once she has produced enough foals to be well represented genetically within herd she is placed on a yearly treatment plan until her death after introduction of contraceptive herd numbers continued to rise to a high of 175 in 2001 to 2005 but then dropped significantly to around 130 in 2009 in 2009 a study determined that mitochondrial dna diversity in herd was quite low most likely due to their isolation but that their nuclear genetic diversity remained at a level similar to that of breeds from mainland other than contraceptive and treatment in emergencies ponies from maryland herd are treated much like other wildlife with no extra attention paid to them by park service employees it is thought likely that maryland herd carries equine infectious anemia eia they are effectively quarantined however by allowing no riding or camping with privately owned horses along mainland shore during insect season which stretches from mid may to october due to their treatment as wild animals ponies from maryland herd can be aggressive and there have been reports of them tearing down tents and biting kicking and knocking down visitors in 2010 after an increase in biting incidents national park service implemented new measures for educating visitors about ponies these measures included new safety information in brochures and recommended viewing distances between visitors and ponies there is also some danger to ponies from visitors ponies have become ill from being fed inappropriate human foods and on average one maryland pony a year is killed by a car since 1991 there has been a pony patrol where volunteers on bikes patrol island educating visitors about ponies virginia herd virginia herd often called chincoteague herd is owned and managed by chincoteague volunteer fire company us fish and wildlife service fws allows ponies to live on assateague under a special use grazing permit allowing approximately 150 adult ponies in chincoteague national wildlife refuge thirty to 45 foals are born into chincoteague herd each year annual pony pennings are used to maintain herd size at around 150 animals since 1943 fws has been working on island to protect and increase wildfowl population and their efforts have sometimes endangered chincoteague herd due to placement of fences by fws a reduced amount of land is available for grazing by ponies fencing also prevents them from reaching sea where they often went to escape biting insects including mosquitos in 1962 several ponies were trapped in an enclosure by high water and died when they were carried out to sea during a storm unlike maryland herd ponies on virginia side of island are fenced off from roadways to prevent auto accidents and to discourage visitors from feeding ponies in late 20th century some ponies previously sold at auction were returned to assateague island when population numbers threatened to drop below targeted numbers due to large numbers of deaths from storms or other issues since 1990 ponies from virginia herd have been rounded up biannually for veterinary treatment including and vaccinations for diseases such as rabies tetanus and eastern and western encephalitis although they make swim to chincoteague only once per year in addition continual monitoring and basic first aid for any minor injuries is performed by a committee from fire department such intervention is needed because many of ponies will be brought into general horse population through auction and purchase by private buyers during veterinary visits they are also tested for eia thumb right a statue of misty of chincoteague stands in chincoteague virginia books in 1947 marguerite henry released children s book misty of chincoteague first in a series of novels that made chincoteague breed internationally famous real misty was foaled on chincoteague island in 1946 and was purchased as a weanling by henry hayes bennett p 62 in 1961 publicity was increased even more when film misty was made based on book publicity generated by books assisted chincoteague fire department and breed in remaining viable into 21st century while fictionalized books were based on a real horse and ranch on chincoteague island and misty of chincoteague foundation was established in 1990 to preserve beebe ranch and establish a museum with memorabilia from series model horse company breyer animal creations has created models of misty and five of her descendants as of 2001 there were around 40 surviving descendants of misty worldwide notes references
