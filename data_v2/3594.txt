soon after music critic bruce eder in a review for allmusic website wrote beach boys brush up against dark side of 60s in form of never learn not to love in his assessment of song richie unterberger commented never learn not to love is far more notorious for its relation to manson not music itself which he describes as average colin larkin in encyclopedia of popular music wrote track had ironic distinction of putting charles manson in charts journalist nathan jolly called song softer but still eerie also noting how fans of beach boys who listened to song over years had no idea of inherent evil of its actual composer manson recording during manson s trial for conspiracy murders of seven people he released his debut studio album lie love and terror cult on march 6 1970 consisting of 13 tracks recorded between 1967 and 1968 it included manson s original arrangement of cease to exist approximately 2 000 copies of lie were distributed but only 300 albums were reportedly sold in an allmusic review of manson s album his rendition of cease to exist was regarded by theodor grenier as one of manson s signature performances and has justifiably invited comparison with jim croce and jose feliciano critic michael little considers manson s version superior to beach boys having praise especially for manson s vocals you expect a tattered raw and raggedy voice with a touch of lunatic rage but what you get is a smooth voiced folk singer he also wrote that manson s raw stripped down take gives song an impressive lo fi immediacy that is a million miles away from beach boys treatment
