thomas bates 1567 30 january 1606 was a member of group of provincial english catholics who planned failed gunpowder plot of 1605 bates was born at lapworth in warwickshire and became a retainer to robert catesby who from 1604 planned to kill king james i by blowing up house of lords with gunpowder and inciting a popular revolt during which a catholic monarch would be restored to english throne bates was invited to join conspiracy after he accidentally became aware of it as he rode with catesby to prepare for group s planned uprising on 5 november 1605 guy fawkes was found guarding gunpowder stored under house of lords and arrested bates subsequently accompanied catesby and his small group of fugitives to holbeche house in staffordshire but left shortly before his master was killed there by government forces on 8 november he was subsequently captured and taken to london bates was only member of group to implicate jesuits in conspiracy but may have done so only to alleviate his punishment he retracted his statement when it became clear he was to be executed three days after his trial on 27 january 1606 he was hanged drawn and quartered biography servant bates was born at lapworth in warwickshire and was married to martha bates he was employed as a retainer to sir robert catesby s family and with his wife lived in a cottage on catesby family estate he was allowed his own servant as well as his own armour bates was considered a loyal and devoted servant to catesby bates was seventh man to be enlisted into what became known as gunpowder plot a scheme devised early in 1604 by catesby to kill king james i by blowing up house of lords with gunpowder and inciting a popular revolt during which a catholic monarch would be restored to english throne bates s involvement in plot began when he became suspicious of catesby s movements in december 1604 he was invited to his master s lodgings at puddle wharf in london and questioned there by thomas wintour and catesby who had noted his suspicion bates told them that he thought that they intended some dangerous matter about parliament house because he had been sent to get a lodging near unto that place at that point two men let bates in on secret in same month it was announced that because of plague re opening of parliament would not be in february but rather in october during this delay conspirators may have dug a tunnel beneath parliament although no evidence for its existence has ever been found plotters ultimately stored their gunpowder in undercroft directly beneath house of lords in july 1605 opening of parliament was again delayed this time until tuesday 5 november catesby had funded most of plot but by august 1605 he was running out of money during a secret meeting at bath in august at which he percy and thomas wintour were present plotters decided that company being yet but few he was to be allowed to call in whom he thought best bates was uncomfortable with idea and was only member of conspiracy to object he was over ruled however and catesby soon enlisted ambrose rookwood francis tresham and everard digby failure last details of plot were finalised in october guy fawkes would light fuse and then escape across thames while simultaneously a revolt in midlands would help to ensure capture of princess elizabeth late on monday 4 november bates set out with catesby and john wright for planned revolt following day while at dunstable re shoeing catesby s horse they were met by rookwood who delivered devastating news that fawkes had been discovered guarding gunpowder and arrested as those conspirators still in london fled city group soon integrated christopher wright and thomas percy they rode toward dunchurch on horses sent from everard digby by they met robert wintour brother to thomas at ashby st ledgers and digby at dunchurch on 6 november they stole horses from warwick castle and collected stored weapons from norbrook near stratford upon avon as they continued toward huddington and as government issued a proclamation for fugitives arrest catesby s servant was listed as robert ashfield probably a mistake for bates catesby ordered bates to deliver a letter to father garnet at coughton court asking for his support bates s news proved momentous for jesuits he overheard tesimond exclaim we are all utterly undone garnet s reply to catesby begged them to stop their wicked actions and to listen to pope s teachings capture by time fugitives and their supporters arrived at holbeche house on border of staffordshire they were exhausted drenched from rain they spread out some of now soaked gunpowder in front of fire to dry out a spark from fire landed on powder and resultant flames engulfed catesby rookwood grant and another man at some point between then and arrival of sheriff of worcester and his men bates left house possibly with his son and digby if he was with latter he was captured later same day and taken to london catesby was killed early that day along with percy john wright and his brother christopher imprisonment and execution while imprisoned on 4 december bates claimed that father oswald tesimond knew of plot in opinion of author antonia fraser however bates s evidence is suspect he was of a lower class than his co conspirators and could therefore reasonably have assumed he was at more risk of being tortured than others perhaps trying to curry favour with his interrogators he was only conspirator to implicate jesuits he later retracted his confession when it became clear that he was to be executed bates was charged with high treason and tried at westminster hall on monday 27 january 1606 alongside seven of his fellow conspirators he arrived at hall separately from others prisons operated on a class based system and so he was kept at gatehouse prison rather than tower only digby pleaded guilty on morning of 30 january 1606 therefore bates was tied to a wattled hurdle and dragged by horse along street from gatehouse prison to western end of st paul s churchyard there he was present as first digby then robert wintour and then grant were hanged drawn and quartered bates was last to ascend scaffold that day and met a similarly gruesome end following day four remaining conspirators were executed in same manner references notes footnotes bibliography category 1606 deaths category executed
