thumb right december 1956 issue of nebula cover is by james stark whose work is described by science fiction art historian david hardy as severe portrayals of technology against which men were mere ants nebula science fiction was first scottish science fiction magazine it was published from 1952 to 1959 and was edited by peter hamilton a young scot who was able to take advantage of spare capacity at his parents printing company crownpoint to launch magazine because hamilton could only print nebula when crownpoint had no other work schedule was initially erratic in 1955 he moved printing to a dublin based firm and schedule became a little more regular with a steady monthly run beginning in 1958 that lasted into following year nebulas circulation was international with only a quarter of sales in united kingdom this led to disaster when south africa and australia imposed import controls on foreign periodicals at end of 1950s excise duties imposed in uk added to hamilton s financial burdens and he was rapidly forced to close magazine last issue was dated june 1959 magazine was popular with writers partly because hamilton went to great lengths to encourage new writers and partly because he paid better rates per word than much of his competition initially he could not compete with american market but he offered a bonus for most popular story in issue and was eventually able to match leading american magazines he published first stories of several well known writers including robert silverberg brian aldiss and bob shaw nebula was also a fan favourite author ken bulmer recalled that it became what many fans regard as best loved british sf magazine publishing history in 1952 peter hamilton was 18 years old and had just left school he was looking for a job but was not healthy enough for hard physical work ashley transformations pp 86 89 his parents ran a printing house in glasgow crownpoint publications and occasionally had spare capacity they were interested in using idle time on their machinery to enter publishing business and peter persuaded them to publish paperback science fiction sf novels two novels were acquired but when crownpoint approached a local wholesaler to handle distribution they were told that paperbacks would be a mistake and that a magazine with a regular publication schedule would be more likely to sell well result was nebula science fiction first issue was dated autumn 1952 and sold 4 000 copies jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec 1952 1 1 19531 2 1 3 1 4 2 1 2 21954 2 3 2 4 9 10 12 13 16 17 20 21

nebula science fiction in tymn ashley science fiction fantasy and weird fiction magazines pp 419 423 advertisements stated that nebula was scotland s first s f magazine several british science fiction fans helped hamilton with production of magazine including ken slater clarke and john brunner william f temple was involved as an editorial consultant and also assisted with editing manuscripts philip harbottle introduction in bounds best of sydney j bounds vol 1 p 12 hamilton provided all financing but he had to wait for money to come in from each issue before he could afford to produce next in addition crownpoint only intermittently had enough spare capacity to print nebula so first few issues appeared on an erratic schedule after a dozen issues conflicts led to hamilton moving nebula to a printing firm based in dublin and breaking connection with crownpoint he was then able to publish on a slightly more regular schedule although planned bi monthly issues were still sometimes delayed hamilton paid 21 shillings ps1 05 per thousand words equivalent of three tenths of a cent per word this was a low rate compared to american market but was marginally better than contemporary british magazine authentic science fiction which paid ps1 per thousand words ashley history of science fiction magazine vol 3 pp 68 71 hamilton offered a bonus of ps2 or ps5 to story that turned out to be readers favourite in each issue which helped attract writers and he later increased rates paying as much as 2d 0 8p or 2 3 cents per word for well known authors this was higher than best uk markets such as new worlds and was close to rates paid by top magazines in us at that time both high rates of pay and hamilton s willingness to work with new authors were designed to encourage writers to submit their work to nebula before trying other magazines philip harbottle remembering phil high in fantasy adventures 13 p 122 hamilton s editorial in september 1957 issue reported a circulation of 40 000 and starting in january 1958 nebula went on a regular monthly schedule that was maintained until early 1959 although nebulas circulation was strong only about a quarter of its sales were in uk a further quarter of sales were in australia another third in us and nearly a tenth in south africa at end of 1950s first south africa and then australia began to limit foreign magazine imports for economic reasons and when this was followed by uk excise duties magazine was quickly in debt hamilton was forced to cease publication with issue 41 dated june 1959 ashley transformations p 230 hamilton had also had health problems which contributed to his decision to stop publication ashley history of science fiction magazine part 4 p 42 contents and reception first two issues of nebula contained two novels hamilton had bought before changing his plans from a paperback series to a magazine robots never weep by e r james and thou pasture us by f g these left little room for other material but hamilton was able to reprint a short story by a e van vogt in first issue and stories by john brunner and e c tubb in second issue along with material by lesser known writers see individual issues for convenience an online index is available at there was also a column by walt willis called electric fan later renamed fanorama which covered science fiction fandom ken bulmer quoted in harbottle holland vultures of void pp 81 85 many of better known british writers began to appear in nebula including william f temple and eric frank russell new authors also began to be published hamilton was glad to work with beginning writers and in 1953 several writers who later became very well known including brian aldiss barrington bayley and bob shaw each sold their first story to nebula not all these stories reached print that year aldiss s t appeared in november 1956 issue by which time other stories of aldiss s were in print and first story by bayley is not certainly identified it may have been consolidation which appeared in november 1959 but it is also possible that it was never printed robert silverberg had begun submitting stories to hamilton as soon as he heard of nebula realising that hamilton was unlikely to be getting many submissions from us writers and found hamilton very helpful silverberg s first story gorgon planet was accepted by hamilton on 11 january 1954 silverberg phases of moon pp 12 13 brian aldiss echoes silverberg s assessment of hamilton commenting that hamilton was a sympathetic editor to a beginner he was also a patient editor other authors who appeared in nebula early in their careers included harlan ellison john rackham and james white science fiction historian mike ashley regards stories hamilton selected as demonstrating a wide range of material by excellent writers that was seldom predictable but adds that stories have become dated with result that few are now well known among a short list of exceptions ashley includes brian aldiss s legends of smith s burst and dumb show because of erratic schedule hamilton only serialised one novel wisdom of gods by ken bulmer which appeared in four parts starting in july 1958 issue hamilton was planning to serialise a novel by robert heinlein when magazine ceased publication clute science fiction illustrated encyclopedia p 103 cover art came
