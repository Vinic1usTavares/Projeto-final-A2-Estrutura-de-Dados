hardnose shark carcharhinus macloti is a species of requiem shark in family carcharhinidae so named because of heavily calcified cartilages in its snout a small bronze coloured shark reaching a length of it has a slender body and a long pointed snout its two modestly sized dorsal fins have distinctively elongated rear tips hardnose shark is widely distributed in western indo pacific from kenya to southern china and northern australia it inhabits warm shallow waters close to shore common and gregarious hardnose shark is a predator of bony fishes cephalopods and crustaceans this species is viviparous with growing embryos sustained to term via a placental connection to their mother females have a biennial reproductive cycle and bear litters of one or two pups after a twelve month gestation period hardnose shark is fished for meat throughout its range and given its low reproductive rate international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed it as near threatened taxonomy thumb left illustration that accompanied muller and henle s description hardnose shark was described by german biologists johannes muller and jakob henle in their 1839 systematische beschreibung der plagiostomen they named it carcharias hypoprion macloti in honour of heinrich christian who collected type specimen from new guinea in 1862 american ichthyologist theodore gill elevated hypoprion to rank of full genus with c macloti as type species in 1985 jack garrick synonymised hypoprion with carcharhinus this species may also be called s shark phylogeny and evolution evolutionary relationships of hardnose shark have not been fully resolved in a 1988 study based on morphology leonard compagno tentatively grouped hardnose shark with borneo shark c whitecheek shark c dussumieri pondicherry shark c creek whaler c fitzroyensis shark c porosus blackspot shark c sealei and spottail shark c sorrah results from molecular phylogenetic analyses have been inconsistent with some supporting parts of compagno s hypothesis a 1992 study could not resolve hardnose shark s position in detail a 2011 study reported that it was close to clade formed by whitecheek and blackspot sharks and a 2012 study concluded that it was sister species of borneo shark teeth apparently belonging to hardnose shark have been recovered from pungo river and yorktown formations in united states and from formation in brazil earliest of these fossils date to lower miocene 23 16 ma description thumb left hardnose shark is slender with a long snout and elongated rear tips on dorsal fins hardnose shark is a slim bodied species with a long narrow and pointed snout unlike in other carcharhinus species its rostral snout cartilages are highly calcified hence name hardnose circular eyes are rather large and equipped with protective nictitating membranes there is a narrow lobe of skin on anterior rim of each nostril arched mouth bears inconspicuous furrows at corners some sources report that hyomandibular pores a series of pores above corners of mouth are enlarged while others report that they are not upper teeth number 29 32 rows and have a narrow smooth edged central cusp with very coarse serrations at base on either side lower teeth number 26 29 rows and are narrow and smooth edged there are five pairs of fairly short gill slits pectoral fins are fairly short and pointed with a falcate sickle like shape first dorsal fin is medium sized and triangular and originates roughly over pectoral fin free rear tips second dorsal fin is small and low and originates over middle of anal fin base both dorsal fins have very long free rear tips and there is a subtle midline ridge between them a prominent notch is present on caudal peduncle at dorsal origin of caudal fin caudal fin has a well developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a ventral notch near tip skin is covered by overlapping oval shaped dermal denticles each denticle has three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth this species is bronze above and white below with a barely noticeable pale band on flanks pectoral pelvic and anal fins sometimes have lighter margins while first dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe may have darker margins hardnose shark reaches in length distribution and habitat hardnose shark is common and widely distributed in tropical western indo pacific it is found from kenya to myanmar in indian ocean including sri lanka and andaman islands in pacific ocean it is found from vietnam to taiwan and southern japan in indonesia and off new guinea and northern australia it is usually found in shallow inshore waters but has been reported to a depth of tagging data has shown that this shark tends not to make long distance movements with 30 of re caught individuals having moved less than from their initial tagging location longest known distance travelled by an individual is biology and ecology hardnose shark forms large groups often associating with spottail sharks and australian blacktip sharks c tilstoni males and females generally roam separately from each other bony fishes form main part of this shark s diet with cephalopods and crustaceans making up remainder parasites of this species include nematode and tapeworm otobothrium hardnose shark is viviparous like in other requiem sharks once embryos exhaust their yolk supply empty yolk sac develops into a placental connection through which mother provides nutrition females give birth once every other year to one or two pups following a gestation period of twelve months newborns measure long and sexual maturity is attained at long maximum lifespan is at least 15 20 years human interactions harmless to humans hardnose shark is caught with gillnets and line gear by artisanal and commercial fisheries across much of its range it is used for meat which is sold fresh or dried and salted though its small size limits its economic importance its low reproductive rate may render it susceptible to overfishing and given existing levels of exploitation international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed it as near threatened off northern australia hardnose shark makes up 13 6 of gillnet catch and 4 0 of longline catch since these losses do not appear to have diminished its population there iucn has given it a regional assessment of least concern references external links
