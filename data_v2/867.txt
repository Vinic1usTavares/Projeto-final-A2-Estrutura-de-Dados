purpose vehicle 101 nomenclature see gander tanks and armour panzerkampfwagen i ii p 10 design of panzer i began in 1932 and mass production began in 1934 intended only as a training tank to introduce concept of armored warfare to german army panzer i saw combat in spain during spanish civil war in poland france soviet union and north africa during second world war and in china during second sino japanese war experiences with panzer i during spanish civil war helped shape german s invasion of poland in 1939 and france in 1940 by 1941 panzer i chassis design was used as basis of tank destroyers and assault guns there were attempts to upgrade panzer i throughout its service history including by foreign nations to extend design s lifespan it continued to serve in spanish armed forces until 1954 panzer i s performance in armored combat was limited by its thin armour and light armament of two machine guns which were never intended for use against armoured targets rather being ideal for infantry suppression in line with inter war doctrine as a design intended for training panzer i was less capable than some other contemporary light tank designs such as soviet t 26 although it was still relatively advanced compared to older designs such as renault ft still in service in several nations and others although lacking in armoured combat as a tank it formed a large part of germany s mechanized forces and was used in all major campaigns between september 1939 and december 1941 where it still performed much useful service against entrenched infantry and other soft targets which were unable to respond even against thin armor and who were highly vulnerable to machine gun fire small vulnerable light tank along with its somewhat more powerful successor panzer ii would soon be surpassed as a front line armoured combat vehicle by more powerful german tanks such as panzer iii and later panzer iv panzer v and panzer vi nevertheless panzer i s contribution to early victories of nazi germany during world war ii was significant later in that war turrets of many of then obsolete pzkpfw is and pzkpfw iis were repurposed as gun turrets on specially built defensive bunkers particularly on atlantic wall development history post world war i treaty of versailles of 1919 prohibited design manufacture and deployment of tanks within reichswehr paragraph twenty four of treaty provided for a 100 000 mark fine and imprisonment of up to six months for anybody who manufactured armoured vehicles tanks or similar machines which may be turned to military use guderian achtung panzer p 133 despite manpower and technical limitations imposed on german army by treaty of versailles several reichswehr officers established a clandestine general staff to study world war i and develop future strategies and tactics although at first concept of tank as a mobile weapon of war met with apathy german industry was encouraged to look into tank design while quiet cooperation was undertaken with soviet union gander tanks armour panzerkampfwagen i ii pp 6 7 there was also minor military cooperation with sweden including extraction of technical data that proved invaluable to early german tank design perett german light panzers 1932 42 p 4 as early as 1926 german companies krupp rheinmetall and daimler benz were contracted to develop prototype tanks armed with a large 75

machineguns was to be developed under cover name leichttraktor light tractor thomas l jentz hillary louis doyle panzer tracts no 1 1 panzerkampfwagen i from kleintraktor to ausf b six produced grosstraktor were later put into service for a brief period with 1 panzer division leichttraktor remained in testing until 1935 in late 1920s and early 1930s german tank theory was pioneered by two figures general oswald lutz and his chief of staff lieutenant colonel heinz guderian guderian became more influential of two and his ideas were widely publicized see achtung panzer first released in german in 1937 like his contemporary sir percy hobart guderian initially envisioned an armored corps panzerkorps composed of several types of tanks this included a slow infantry tank armed with a small caliber cannon and several machine guns infantry tank according to guderian was to be heavily armored to defend against enemy anti tank guns and artillery he also envisioned a fast breakthrough tank similar to british cruiser tank which was to be armoured against enemy anti tank weapons and have a large 75 millimeter 2 95 in main gun lastly germany needed a heavy tank armed with a 150 millimeter 5 9 in cannon to defeat enemy fortifications and even stronger armor such a tank required a weight of 70 to 100 tonnes and was completely impractical given manufacturing capabilities of day guderian achtung panzer pp 169 170 for a detailed look into guderian s theories soon after rising to power in germany adolf hitler approved creation of germany s first panzer divisions simplifying his earlier proposal guderian suggested design of a main combat vehicle which would be developed into panzer iii and a breakthrough tank panzer iv gander tanks armour panzerkampfwagen i ii p 9 no existing design appealed to guderian as a stopgap german army ordered a preliminary vehicle to train german tank crews this became panzer i mccarthy panzerkrieg p 31 panzer i s design history can be traced to british carden loyd tankette of which it borrowed much of its track and suspension design after six prototype kleintraktor were produced cover name was changed to krupp traktor whereas development codename was changed to schlepper la s agricultural tractor la s was intended not just to train germany s panzer troops but to prepare germany s industry for mass production of tanks in near future a

note from generalisimo francisco franco that expressed need for a panzer i or as their spanish crews called them with a 20 millimeter gun ultimately piece chosen was breda model 1935 due to simplicity of design over competitors such as german flak 30 furthermore 20 mm breda was capable of 40 millimeters of armour at 250 meters 1 57 in at 275 yd which was more than sufficient to penetrate frontal armour of t 26 although originally 40 italian cv 35 light tanks were ordered with breda in place of their original armament this order was subsequently canceled after it was thought that adaptation of same gun to panzer i would yield better results prototypes were ready by september 1937 and an order was placed after successful results mounting of breda in panzer i required original turret to be opened at top and then extended by a vertical supplement four of these tanks were finished at armament factory of seville but further production was canceled as it was decided sufficient numbers of republican t 26 tanks had been captured to fulfill nationalist leadership s request for more lethal tanks breda modification was not particularly liked by german crews as unprotected gap in turret designed to allow tank s commander to aim was found to be a dangerous weak point franco panzer i pp 47 49 in late 1938 another panzer i was sent to armament factory of seville in order to mount a 45
