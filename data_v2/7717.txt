battle of trenton was a small but pivotal battle during american revolutionary war which took place on morning of december 26 1776 in trenton new jersey after general george washington s crossing of delaware river north of trenton previous night washington led main body of continental army against hessian auxiliaries garrisoned at trenton after a brief battle almost two thirds of hessian force was captured with negligible losses to americans battle significantly boosted continental army s flagging morale and inspired re enlistments continental army had previously suffered several defeats in new york and had been forced to retreat through new jersey to pennsylvania morale in army was low to end year on a positive note george washington commander in chief of continental army devised a plan to cross delaware river on night of december 25 26 and surround hessians garrison because river was icy and weather severe crossing proved dangerous two detachments were unable to cross river leaving washington with only 2 400 men under his command in assault 3 000 less than planned army marched south to trenton hessians had lowered their guard thinking they were safe from americans army and had no long distance outposts or patrols washington s forces caught them off guard and after a short but fierce resistance most of hessians surrendered and were captured with just over a third escaping across assunpink creek despite battle s small numbers u s victory inspired rebels in colonies with success of ongoing revolution in doubt a week earlier army had seemed on verge of collapse dramatic victory inspired soldiers to serve longer and attracted new recruits to ranks background in early december 1776 u s morale was very low americans had been ousted from new york by british and their hessian auxiliaries and continental army was forced to retreat across new jersey ninety percent of continental army soldiers who had served at long island were gone men had deserted feeling that cause for independence was lost washington commander in chief of continental army expressed some doubts writing to his cousin in virginia i think game is pretty near up at time a small town in new jersey trenton was occupied by four regiments of hessian soldiers numbering about 1 400 men commanded by colonel johann rall washington s force comprised 2 400 men with infantry divisions commanded by major generals nathanael greene and john sullivan and artillery under direction of brigadier general henry knox stanhope p 129 prelude intelligence george washington had stationed a spy named john honeyman posing as a tory in trenton honeyman had served with major general james wolfe in quebec at battle of plains of abraham on september 13 1759 and had no trouble establishing his credentials as a tory honeyman was a butcher and bartender who traded with british and hessians this enabled him to gather intelligence and also to convince hessians that continental army was in such a low state of morale that they would not attack trenton shortly before christmas he arranged to be captured by continental army who had orders to bring him to washington unharmed after being questioned by washington he was imprisoned in a hut to be tried as a tory in morning but a small fire broke out nearby enabling him to escape u s plan thumb 250px u s plan of attack under washington u s plan relied on launching coordinated attacks from three directions general john cadwalader would launch a diversionary attack against british garrison at bordentown new jersey to block off reinforcements from south general james ewing would take 700 militia across river at trenton ferry seize bridge over assunpink creek and prevent enemy troops from escaping main assault force of 2 400 men would cross river north of trenton and split into two groups one under greene and one under sullivan to launch a pre dawn attack brooks p 56 sullivan would attack town from south and greene from north savas p 84 depending on success of operation americans would possibly follow up with separate attacks on princeton and new brunswick brooks p 55 during week before battle u s advance parties began to ambush enemy cavalry patrols capturing dispatch riders and attacking hessian pickets hessian commander to emphasize danger to his men sent 100 infantry and an artillery detachment to deliver a letter to british commander at princeton washington ordered ewing and his pennsylvania militia to try to gain information on hessian movements and technology fischer p 195 ewing instead made three successful raids across river on december 17 and 18 1776 they attacked an outpost of jagers and on 21st they set fire to several houses washington put constant watches on all possible crossings near continental army encampment on delaware as he believed william howe would launch an attack from north on philadelphia if river froze over ketchum p 242 on december 20 1776 some 2 000 troops led by general sullivan arrived in washington s camp savas p 83 they had been under command of charles lee and had been moving slowly through northern new jersey when lee was captured that same day an additional 800 troops arrived from fort ticonderoga under command of horatio gates hessian moves thumb left 250px hessian sketch of battle of trenton on december 14 1776 hessians arrived in trenton to establish their winter quarters fischer p 188 at time trenton was a small town with about 100 houses and two main streets king now warren street and queen now broad street ketchum p 233 carl von donop rall s superior had marched south to mount holly on december 22 to deal with resistance in new jersey and had clashed with some new jersey militia there on december 23 rosenfeld p 177 donop who despised rall was reluctant to give command of trenton to him ketchum p 229 rall was known to be loud and unacquainted with english language but he was also a 36 year soldier with a great deal of battle experience his request for reinforcements had been turned down by british commander general james grant who disdained american rebels and thought them poor soldiers despite rall s experience hessians at trenton did not admire their commander lengel p 183 they believed that he was too nice and not ruthless enough to be successful his officers complained his love of life was too great a thought came to him then another so he could not settle on a firm decision lengel p 185 rall avoided hard work and had little concern for his troops comfort trenton lacked city walls or fortifications which was typical of u s settlements fischer p 189 some hessian officers advised rall to fortify town and two of his engineers advised that a redoubt be constructed at upper end of town and fortifications be built along river engineers went so far as to draw up plans but rall disagreed with them when rall was again urged to fortify town he replied let them come we will go at them with bayonet as christmas approached loyalists came to trenton to report americans were planning action ketchum p 235 u s deserters told hessians that rations were being prepared for an advance across river rall publicly dismissed such talk as nonsense but privately in letters to his superiors he said he was worried about an imminent attack he wrote to donop that he was liable to be attacked at any moment rall said that trenton was indefensible and asked that british troops establish a garrison in maidenhead now lawrenceville close to trenton this would help defend roads from americans his request was denied fischer p 197 as americans disrupted hessian supply lines officers started to share rall s fears one wrote we have not slept one night in peace since we came to this place ketchum p 236 on december 22 1776 a spy reported to grant that washington had called a council of war grant told rall to be on your guard fischer p 203 main hessian force of 1 500 men was divided into three regiments knyphausen lossberg and rall that night they

carried 60 rounds of ammunition and three days of rations mccullough p 274 when army arrived at shores of delaware they were already behind schedule and clouds began to form above them fischer p 212 it began to rain as air s temperature dropped rain changed to sleet and then to snow americans began to cross river with john glover in command men went across in durham boats while horses and artillery went across on large ferries ferling p 176 14th continental regiment of glover manned boats during crossing several men fell overboard including colonel john haslet haslet was quickly pulled out of water no one died during crossing and all artillery pieces made it over in good condition fischer p 219 two small detachments of infantry of about 40 men each were ordered ahead of main columns fischer p 221 they set roadblocks ahead of main army and were to take prisoner whoever came into or left town one of groups was sent north of trenton and other was sent to block river road which ran along delaware river to trenton fischer p 222 thumb left upright 1 2 alt photo shows an 18th century cannon probably a 3 pounder with an old stone building and delaware river in background cannon at washington s crossing historic park terrible weather conditions delayed landings in new jersey until 3 00 am plan was that they were supposed to be completed by 12 00 am washington realized it would be impossible to launch a pre dawn attack another setback occurred for americans as generals cadwalader and ewing were unable to join attack due to weather conditions at 4 00 am soldiers began to march towards trenton fischer p 223 along way several civilians joined as volunteers and led as guides see captain john mott because of their knowledge of terrain fischer p 225 after marching through winding roads into wind they reached bear tavern where they turned right fischer p 226 ground was slippery but it was level making it easier for horses and artillery they began to make better time they soon reached jacobs creek where with difficulty americans made it across fischer p 227 two groups stayed together until they reached birmingham where they split apart soon after they reached house of benjamin moore where family offered food and drink to washington fischer p 228 at this point first signs of daylight began to appear many of troops did not have boots so they were forced to wear rags around their feet some of men s feet bled turning snow to a dark red two men died on trip scheer p 215 as they marched washington rode up and down line encouraging men to continue general sullivan sent a courier to tell washington that weather was wetting his men s gunpowder washington responded tell general sullivan to use bayonet i am resolved to take trenton about outside town main columns reunited with advance parties fischer p 231 they were startled by sudden appearance of 50 armed men but they were american led by adam stephen they had not known about plan to attack trenton and had attacked a hessian outpost fischer p 232 washington feared hessians would have been put on guard and shouted at stephen you sir you sir may have ruined all my plans by having them put on their guard despite this washington ordered advance continue to trenton in event rall thought first raid was attack which grant had warned him about and that there would be no further action that day

a battalion of german speaking infantry to block road that led to princeton they attacked hessian outpost there wiederholdt soon realized that this was more than a raiding party seeing other hessians retreating from outpost he led his men to do same andreas wiederholdt edited by m d learned and c grosse tagebuch des capt wiederholdt vom 7 oktober bis 7 december 1780 macmillan co new york 1862

guard companies on outskirts of town another guard company nearer to delaware river rushed east to their aid leaving open river road into trenton washington ordered escape route to princeton be cut off sending infantry in battle formation to block it while artillery formed at head of king and queen streets ketchum p 256 leading southern u s column general sullivan entered trenton by abandoned river road and blocked only crossing over assunpink creek to cut off hessian escape wood p 68 sullivan briefly held up his advance to make sure greene s division had time to drive hessians from their

grothausen brought 12 of his jagers into action against advanced guard but had only advanced a few hundred yards when he saw a column of americans advancing to hermitage pulling back to hessian barracks he was joined by rest of jagers after exchange of one volley they turned and ran some trying to swim across creek while others escaped over bridge which had not yet been cut off 20 british dragoons also fled as greene and sullivan s columns pushed into town washington moved to high ground north of king and queens streets to see action and direct his troops mccullough p 280 by this time u s artillery from other side of delaware river had come into action devastating hessian positions fischer p 239 with sounding of alarm three hessian regiments began to prepare for battle fischer p

reply rall directed his regiment supported by a few companies of lossberg regiment to clear guns wood p 70 hessians formed ranks and began to advance up street but their formations were quickly broken by u s guns and fire from mercer s men who had taken houses on left side of street breaking ranks hessians fled rall ordered two three pound cannon into action after getting off six rounds each within just a few minutes half of hessians manning their guns were killed by u s cannon after men fled to cover behind houses and fences their cannons were taken by americans wood p 71 following capture of cannon men under command of george weedon advanced down king street on queen street all hessian attempts to advance up street were repulsed by guns under command of thomas forrest after firing four rounds each two more hessian guns were silenced one of forrest s howitzers was put out of action with a broken axle knyphausen regiment became separated from lossberg and rall regiments lossberg and rall fell back to a field outside town taking heavy losses from grapeshot and musket fire in southern part of town americans under command of sullivan began to overwhelm hessians john stark led a bayonet charge at knyphausen regiment whose resistance broke because their weapons would not fire sullivan led a column of men to block off escape of troops across creek hessian resistance collapses hessians in field attempted to reorganize and make one last attempt to retake town so they could make a breakout wood p 72 rall decided to attack u s flank on heights north of town fischer p 246 rall yelled forward advance advance and hessians began to move with brigade s band playing fifes bugles and drums to help hessians spirit ketchum p 262 washington still on high ground saw hessians approaching u s flank he moved his troops to assume battle formation against enemy two hessian regiments began marching toward king street but were caught in u s fire that came at them from three directions some americans had taken up defensive positions inside houses reducing their exposure some civilians joined fight against hessians fischer p 249 despite this they continued to push recapturing their cannon at head of king street knox saw hessians had retaken cannon and ordered his troops to take them six men ran and after a brief struggle seized cannon turning them on hessians fischer p 247 with most of hessians unable to fire their guns attack stalled hessians formations broke and they began to scatter rall was mortally wounded fischer p 248 washington led his troops down from high ground while yelling march on my brave fellows after me most of hessians retreated into an orchard with americans in close pursuit quickly surrounded fischer p 251 hessians were offered terms of surrender to which they agreed although ordered to join rall remains of knyphausen regiment mistakenly marched in opposite direction they tried to escape across bridge but found it had been taken americans quickly swept in defeating a hessian attempt to break through their lines surrounded by sullivan s men regiment surrendered just minutes after rest of brigade wood p 74 casualties and capture thumb engraving george washington at battle of trenton by brothers in 1870 hessian forces lost 22 killed in action 83 wounded and 896 wounded fischer p 254 americans suffered only two deaths from bare feet causing frostbite and five wounded from battle including a near fatal shoulder wound to future president james monroe other losses incurred by patriots due to exhaustion exposure and illness in following days may have raised their losses above those of hessians fischer p 255 captured hessians were sent to philadelphia and later lancaster in 1777 they were moved to virginia fischer p 379 rall was mortally wounded and died later that night at his headquarters all four hessian colonels in trenton were killed in battle lossberg regiment was effectively removed from british forces parts of knyphausen regiment escaped to south but sullivan captured some 200 additional men along with regiment s cannon and supplies they also captured approximately 1 000 arms and much needed ammunition mitchell p 43 last but not least was capture from hessians of their entire store of provisions tons of flour dried and salted meats ale and other liquors but also shoes boots clothing and bedding things that were as much needed by ragtag continental forces as weapons and horses among those captured by patriots was christian later to become a schoolmaster and artist in pennsylvania hessians drinking an officer in washington s staff wrote before battle they make a great deal of christmas in germany and no doubt hessians will drink a great deal of beer and have a dance to night they will be sleepy to morrow morning stryker p 361 popular history commonly portrays hessians as drunk from christmas celebrations however historian david hackett fischer quotes patriot john greenwood who fought in battle and supervised hessians afterward who wrote i am certain not a drop of liquor was drunk during whole night nor as i could see even a piece of bread eaten fischer p 426 military historian edward g lengel wrote germans were dazed and tired but there is no truth to legend claiming that they were helplessly drunk lengel p 186 after effect after hessians surrender washington is reported to have shaken hand of a young officer and said this is a glorious day for our country ferling p 178 on december 28 general washington interviewed lieutenant later colonel andreas who detailed failures of rall s preparation andreas wiederholdt edited by m d learned and c grosse tagebuch des capt vom 7 oktober bis 7 december 1780 macmillan co new york 1862 reprinted by university of michigan library 17 august 2015 washington soon learned however that cadwalader and ewing had been unable to complete their crossing leaving his worn out army of 2 400 men isolated wood p 75 without their 2 600 men washington realized he did not have forces to attack princeton and new brunswick this small but decisive battle as with later battle of cowpens had an effect disproportionate to its size colonial effort was galvanized and americans overturned psychological dominance achieved by british government troops in previous months howe was stunned that patriots so easily surprised and overwhelmed hessian garrison colonial support for rebellion was also buoyed significantly at this time by writings of thomas paine and additional successful actions by new jersey militia fischer p 143 aftermath and legacy thumb painting capture of hessians at trenton december 26 1776 by john trumbull by noon washington s force had moved across delaware back into pennsylvania taking their prisoners and captured supplies with them this battle gave continental congress a new confidence as it proved colonial forces could defeat regulars it also increased re enlistments in continental army forces by defeating a european army colonials reduced fear which hessians had caused earlier that year after fighting in new york two notable u s officers were wounded william washington cousin of general and lieutenant james monroe future president of united states monroe was carried from field bleeding badly after he was struck in left shoulder by a musket ball which severed an artery doctor john riker clamped artery preventing him from bleeding to death hours before battle served as inspiration for painting washington crossing delaware by german american artist emanuel leutze image in painting in which washington stands majestic in his boat as it crosses delaware river is generally believed to be more symbolic than historically accurate waters of river were icy and treacherous and flag monroe holds was not created until six months after battle in addition contrary to painting crossing occurred before dawn on other hand fischer argues that because crossing took place in a storm people may have stood to avoid sitting in icy water in boats fischer p 216 because of its emotional content painting has become an icon of u s history trenton battle monument erected at five points in trenton stands as a tribute to this u s victory burt p 439 crossing of delaware and battle are reenacted by local enthusiasts every year unless weather is too severe
