point is to acknowledge however hard that may be when you have done all and any of above this was in response to an unpublished email from mckinsey which mantshantsha described as making baseless and arrogant claim about there being no evidence presented to support accusations of unethical conduct possibly also thieving and corruption that has financially crippled not only sa s electricity provider eskom but also rail and pipeline firm transnet and possibly others mantshantsha went on to say as is now common cause mckinsey has readily admitted that there is no legal basis on which to
