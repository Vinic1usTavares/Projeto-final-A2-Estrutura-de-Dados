french monarchy and presided over a ceremony of papal absolution that removed excommunication order placed on him by sixtus v spanish faction had previously opposed pope taking these actions but french negotiators had talked about possibility of a schism this along with henry s victories in french wars of religion overcame spanish opposition clement also formed a commission that annulled henry s marriage to marguerite of valois following death of his mistress gabrielle d afterwards clement helped arrange henry s marriage to marie de medici that ensured a catholic succession clement worked to decrease influence of spanish cardinals in college of cardinals he created five french cardinals and italian cardinals he created were considered neutral clement wanted french cardinals he created to be present in rome and to take part in governance of church henry iv likewise demanded that three french cardinals go to rome and they were present at clement s death on 3 march 1605 in addition to secular politics that impacted them papal elections during this period were marked by a strategy by elite families who wanted to acquire prestige and power these strategies often played out over several generations through patronage and accumulation of wealth and bestowing of favours on family members once an individual was elected to papacy was expected when clement died there was an unresolved dispute between society of jesus and dominican order about nature of divine grace and free will cardinals who entered conclave took oaths promising to resolve dispute quickly if they were elected pope participants pope nicholas ii had reserved right to elect pope to cardinal bishops priests and deacons of rome in 1059 in 1586 pope sixtus v mandated that maximum number of cardinals would be seventy of this seventy college of cardinals had sixty nine members at time of clement vii s death but only sixty of these were present for opening of first conclave of 1605 and sixty one electors were present for election of leo xi when it was convened college contained members who had been created by six different popes pius iv sixtus v gregory xiii gregory xiv innocent ix and clement viii of these clement s creations were most numerous numbering thirty eight of cardinal electors innocent ix had created one of conclave s electors gregory xiv had created five sixtus v had created eleven gregory xiii had created four and pius iv had created one pietro aldobrandini cardinal nephew of clement viii was elector who led faction with largest number of votes having twenty two of clement s thirty eight creations following his instructions alessandro peretti di montalto nephew of sixtus v led a faction of eight cardinals thirteen of cardinal electors were loyal to spanish monarchy these electors and faction loyal to montalto were aligned in addition to these groups eight of electors formed a faction that was loyal to french crown conclave thumb conclave took place in apostolic palace in rome alt apostolic palace in rome where election took place sources from time of conclave list up to twenty one possible candidates considered by cardinals but only cesare baronius and alessandro ottaviano de medici both of whom were supported by french but opposed by spanish were seriously discussed during conclave baronius was favourite candidate odds of him being elected were 10 100 according to roman bookmakers who took bets on election despite prohibition of practice by gregory xiv baronius received 23 votes during first scrutiny this was considered good because many electors who supported him had cast their first ballots for friends france favoured baronius who also had backing of french cardinals he was also first choice candidate of pietro aldobrandini nephew of clement viii who sought to elect a cardinal who was created by his uncle as was baronius aldobrondini had reached an agreement with french government through francois de joyeuse to withdraw support from in return aldobrandini demanded that french would not support girolamo and alessandro peretti di montalto french also agreed not to veto aldobrondini s secret candidate in this election after results of first scrutiny cardinal avila philip iii of spain s representative at conclave announced that philip had vetoed baronius who in a volume of his annales that had been published in 1605 had criticized interference of spanish monarchs in ecclesiastical affairs this led spanish monarchy to so intensely dislike baronius that publication of volume was banned in spanish territory some of electors loyal to spain were displeased with s exclusion and filippo spinelli was hostile to it federico and francesco sforza were also thought to be angry with exclusion baronius s exclusion by avila led to a clash with aldobrandini cardinals began raising their voices at each other each stating that he would be willing to make conclave last over a year to elect his preferred candidate avila and aldobrandini fought a second time which led to shouting and pushing crowds outside mistakenly took this as a sign of election by acclamation and opened doors of conclave while it was still in session at this point spanish hoped cardinals colona and would arrive before end of conclave to aid their numbers but they did not arrive likewise aldobrandini hoped for arrival of cardinal who also did not enter conclave before it ended only additional cardinal elector to arrive was franz von dietrichstein anti spanish party attempted to win his support for baronius by reminding him of favours he had received from clement viii ultimately however giovanni andrea doria carlo madruzzo and odoardo farnese all of whom were loyal to spain persuaded him to oppose baronius baronius came within nine votes of election thirty two of electors supported him but he refused to advocate his own election or accept election by acclamation aldobrandini could not persuade some members of his faction to vote for baronius whom they viewed as too strict by 30 march aldobrandini had resigned himself to looking for other candidates election of leo xi election was further complicated by struggles between factions loyal to aldobrandini and montalto whose approximately equal numbers cancelled each other out initial scrutiny on 1 april yielded twenty eight votes for baronius and thirteen for medici french cardinal francois de joyeuse had been seeking medici s election throughout conclave and had secured support of montalto for his candidate montalto was allied with spanish and had previously backed joyeuse had been anticipating aldobrandini s support for election of medici but this did not occur immediately aldobrandini supported but eventually transferred his support to medici aldobrandini was eventually persuaded of need to elect medici switching his vote to medici upon hearing baronius urging his rival s immediate election aldobrondini then went to medici s room where more than two thirds of electors had gathered and they elected medici pope medici was related to marie de medici queen of france french king henry iv had spent significant money on his candidacy after medici s election avila revealed that philip iii had excluded medici as well and protested so loudly he could be heard on street cardinals who had elected medici answered that protesting election was useless once candidate had been elected pope following his election in his room a scrutiny confirming result was held upon his election medici took name leo xi in honour of his great uncle leo x his election made leo fourth cardinal created by gregory xiii in his consistory in 1583 to become pope leo s election was seen as a victory for france because he was a relative of french queen after his election
