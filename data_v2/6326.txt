rowan atkinson described sharing his character s dread of impending death and feeling a knot in pit of my stomach atkinson rowan audio commentary for goodbyeee in blackadder remastered ultimate edition dvd 2 entertain 2009 something that he had never experienced hugh laurie said that filming was sad because even for comic effect we were representing deaths of hundreds of thousands of people regarding guest star geoffrey palmer producer john lloyd said we probably could have given him more attention calling him a wonderful actor who is really just delivering three or four plot lines pieces of dialogue essential to plot slow motion and fade effects at end of episode were not scripted but decision to use them was made in editing after final scene was hastily filmed on an unconvincing polystyrene set ruining poignancy of sequence episode s director richard boden added poppy field image piano version of theme tune was performed by howard goodall and recorded in a gymnasium giving it what lloyd described as a liquid lonely sound episode s end credits were omitted tim mcinnerny did not know about these changes before episode aired and has said that he found ending particularly emotional themes in episode field marshal haig is shown casually sweeping away toy soldiers with a and brush bbc news magazines rohrer called this a visual allusion to his callousness but quoted historian gary sheffield as saying real field marshal haig was certainly not a callous man he was commanding largest british army ever whatever he did you ended up with lots and lots of casualties sheffield also noted that melchett is an amalgam of haig and john french and other generals so haig effectively appears twice series especially storyline of goodbyeee often depicts lions led by donkeys perception of war an element of blackadder goes forth that has been criticised by historians in his book great war ian f w beckett also cited sheffield latter commented that blackadder goes forth was successful because characters and situations needed no explanation so familiar was audience with received version of war beckett noted popularity of episode s final scene and compared it to a similarly popular scene from dad s army he said that this comparison demonstrates observation made by historian a j p taylor that second world war has been regarded as a good war in comparison to first he opined that television producers have much to answer for in perpetuation of image of great war as one in which a generation of lions were needlessly sacrificed by donkeys thumb ending shows a field of poppies to reflect on deaths of soldiers it was inspired by john mccrae s poem in flanders fields alt a tranquil field of red poppies and text blackadder with a copyright notice producer john lloyd cited episode s lack of another major character as reason they had time to explore relationships of five principal people atkinson said that scene involving darling s ghastly realisation of his commission was very sad lloyd commented i love fact that captain darling does have some compassion he s not just a bureaucrat they noted that all comedy just goes away upon darling s arrival in trench and that there are still funny moments but dramatically there is no comic content it is just leading inexorably to end comparing ending scene to those of previous series of blackadder in which main characters were also killed writer curtis commented i think it was by chance that previous series ended with blackadder being killed but series four we did do it very much on purpose he said that he and elton felt they could use first world war as a setting if characters died considering if we did do that it would not be too disrespectful and would actually represent some of tragedy of first world war reception following its original broadcast on bbc1 at 9 30 pm on 2 november 1989 goodbyeee was praised for its powerful and memorable ending one journalist called scene a classy ending to a television classic and sunday times said that it was brave and properly responsible of writers to end series poignantly especially when episode aired close to remembrance day

placed episode second on her list of top 10 tv show endings calling it one of greatest interpretations of madness of war that has ever been put on film reviewing episode for a v club kate described it as a masterpiece a hilarious and painful crystallization of everything blackadder does well it is without a doubt best episode of series and more than that it is one of best series finales in television history she particularly praised it for its masterful balancing of comedy and tragedy both are interspersed throughout with each character given moments of laugh out loud brilliance and poignant reflection concluding that there is no such thing as a perfect television show or episode but goodbyeee comes dang close academic and theatre director mary luckhurst contrasted regular british comedic treatment of second world war with absence of comedies set in first world war until blackadder series which she considered an important british dramatic treatment of war of final episode luckhurst wrote goodbyeee went a good deal further than any other sitcom or comedy by terminally sending pretty much entire cast over top in 1917 into a silence that has endured ever since many millions of viewers were shocked and almost all taken aback by abrupt realization of tragedy amid much loved national television and after riotous laughter to that sudden and bitter end in a poll conducted by channel 4 and observer to determine television s one hundred most memorable moments final scene of goodbyeee came ninth it was one of only two entries in top ten that was not news

as part of a serious commemoration of armistice day for its 80th anniversary in 1998 series overview from website of uktv s channel gold which airs repeats of blackadder calls final episode a seamless blend of gallows humour and rich poignancy and a fitting end to an iconic series in his segment advocating for blackadder to be voted britain s best sitcom broadcaster and journalist john sergeant called final sequence one sitcom moment with claims to immortality some historians of first world war have taken a different view william philpott referred to series by name as and felt it part of a post facto generalisation of nature of their war that sucked in even veterans of conflict in other words first world war soldier had become a victim in public consciousness a circumstance at odds with historical record impact of blackadder on public consciousness was so pervasive that gordon corrigan referenced it in his book cover copy when he published mud blood and which was an attempt to dispel various myths about war google books website copy noted that corrigan s brilliant witty history reveals how out of touch we have become with soldiers of 1914 18 they simply would not recognize way
