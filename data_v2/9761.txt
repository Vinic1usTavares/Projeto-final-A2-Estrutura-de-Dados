tropical depression and on november 22 depression was classified as a tropical storm after resuming a westward course page intensified into a typhoon on november 4 page then entered a period of rapid deepening before plateauing in intensity early on november 26 page turned northwest north and later northeast as it rounded a subtropical ridge because of change in steering page began to encounter stronger wind shear which resulted in a prolonged weakening trend on november 30 page just offshore honshu weakened below typhoon intensity and became an extratropical cyclone on same day after making landfall in central honshu typhoon page was record sixth tropical cyclone to directly affect japan that year it also was latest typhoon to hit country with previous mark set by typhoon agnes of 1948 pacific typhoon season in tokyo 61 homes were damaged and 16 were destroyed elsewhere in mie prefecture 276 homes were damaged and 9 other homes were destroyed overall four fatalities were reported

yen 33 million usd meteorological history origins of typhoon page can be traced back to an area of disturbed weather that was first tracked by joint typhoon warning center jtwc at 06 00 utc on november 5 after forming near international date line disturbance tracked northwest initially before turning west three days later disturbance failed to develop appreciably due to strong easterly wind shear aloft poorly organized disturbance then briefly turned west northwest under influence of a subtropical ridge convection organization improved and on november 17 dvorak classifications reached t1 5 which prompted jtwc to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert low level center became better defined overnight in response to decreased wind shear and on november 19 jtwc upgraded disturbance into a tropical depression depression executed a counterclockwise loop for next two days meanwhile organized deep convection quickly developed over center and on november 21 disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression by japan meteorological agency jma at that time depression was located east southeast of yap at 00 00 utc on november 22 jtwc upgraded depression into tropical storm page several hours later jma followed suit resuming a westward track page began to intensify at a faster pace on november 23 due to decreased wind shear jma upgraded page to a severe tropical storm at 18 00 utc on november 23 following development of a small eye page was upgraded into a typhoon twelve hours later by jtwc with jma following suit on evening of november 24 page then entered a period of rapid deepening jtwc estimated that during a three day period pressure fell to and winds increased by based on appearance of a well defined eye page was declared a super typhoon by jtwc second of month at 06 00 utc on november 26 six hours later jtwc estimated that typhoon attained its highest intensity with 1 minute sustained winds of around this time jma also estimated that page peaked in intensity with 10 minute sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of typhoon page while maintaining peak strength began to turn northwest on evening of november 26 as it approached a break in subtropical ridge next day typhoon turned northward along 125th meridian east then accelerated to northeast as it rounded a ridge as a result of change in steering page began to encounter stronger wind shear a loss in eye definition and a decrease in dvorak estimates led to jtwc downgrading page back to a typhoon at 18 00 utc on november 27 storm continued to gradually deteriorate and on november 30 jma downgraded page to a severe tropical storm six hours later agency declared page an extratropical cyclone as storm passed over central honshu about south of osaka however jtwc did not downgrade page into a tropical storm until 12 00 utc as wind shear continued to take toll on system later that day jtwc issued its last warning based on a combination of land interaction with honshu and extratropical transition jma stopped tracking extratropical remnants of page on december 3 impact typhoon dropped heavy rainfall across much of japanese archipelago highest rainfall total
