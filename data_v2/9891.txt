route into two started in early in 1960s public roads administration felt that it was unnecessary to have a cross fjord service as at time there was a road from vangshylla to levanger which sufficed

langfjaeran and hov 2008 31 38 need for a larger ferry on skarnsund service was also pressing cars often had to wait and if ferry sailed with full capacity there was no room for passengers to leave their vehicles work to procure a new ferry to replace skarnsund started in 1981 this resulted in acquisition of second hand ferry mosvik from bergen with a capacity of 24 cars which entered service
