against terrans and succeeds in getting them to leave planet however in process their own peaceful culture is introduced to mass violence for first time novel carries strongly anti colonial and anti

other awards it received generally positive reviews from reviewers and scholars and was variously described as moving and hard hitting several critics however stated that it compared unfavorably with le guin s other works such as left hand of darkness due to its sometimes polemic tone and lack of complex characters background thumb le guin giving a reading in 2008 le guin s father alfred louis kroeber was an anthropologist and exposure that this gave le guin influenced all of her works many of protagonists of le guin s novels such as left hand of darkness and rocannon s world are also anthropologists or social investigators of some kind le guin uses term for her fictional alliance of worlds a term which she got from her father who derived it from greek oikoumene to refer to eurasian cultures that shared a common origin le guin s interest in taoism influenced much of her science fiction work douglas barbour stated that fiction of hainish universe contains a theme of balance between light and darkness a central theme of taoism she was also influenced by her early interest in mythology and her exposure to cultural diversity as a child her protagonists are frequently interested in cultures they are investigating and are motivated to preserve them rather than conquer them authors that influenced le guin include victor hugo leo tolstoy virginia woolf italo calvino and lao tzu le guin identifies herself with feminism and is interested in non violence and ecological awareness she has participated in demonstrations against vietnam war and nuclear weapons these sympathies can be seen in several of her works of fiction including hainish universe works novels of hainish universe frequently explore effects of differing social and political systems although she displays a preference for a society that governs by consensus a communal cooperation without external government her fiction also frequently challenges accepted depictions of race and gender novel was originally named little green men in reference to common science fiction trope in her introduction to 1976 edition le guin stated that she was concerned at exploitation of natural world by humans particularly in name of financial gain and that this concern drove her story setting word for world is forest is set in fictional hainish universe which le guin introduced in her first novel rocannon s world published in 1966 in this alternative history human beings did not evolve on earth but on hain people of hain colonized many neighboring planetary systems including terra earth and athshe possibly a million years before setting of novels planets subsequently lost contact with each other for reasons that le guin does not explain le guin does not narrate entire history of hainish universe at once instead letting readers piece it together from various works novels and other fictional works set in hainish universe recount efforts to re establish a galactic civilization explorers from hain as well as other planets use interstellar ships taking years to travel between planetary systems although journey is shortened for travelers due to relativistic time dilation as well as through instantaneous interstellar communication using ansible introduced in dispossessed at least two thought experiments are used in each novel background idea of a common origin for all humanoid species and a second idea unique to each novel in word for world is forest second thought experiment is colonization of a pacifist culture on planet athshe by a military controlled logging team from earth known in novel as terra additionally inhabitants of athshe recognize people from terra as human but terrans do not see athsheans who are small and covered in green fur as human athsheans refer to terrans as while terrans tend to use derogatory term creechie most of surface of planet of athshe known to human colonizers as new tahiti is taken up by ocean land surfaces are concentrated in a single half of northern hemisphere and prior to arrival of terran colonists is entirely covered in forest terrans are interested in using this forest as a source of timber because wood has become a highly scarce commodity on earth athshe s plants and animals are similar to those of earth placed there by hainish people in their first wave of colonisation that also settled earth visitor also states categorically that native humans came from same original hainish stock athsheans are physically small only about a meter tall and covered in fine greenish fur they are a very non aggressive people at one point one of terrans observes that rape violent assault and murder virtually don t exist among them they have adopted a number of behaviors to avoid violence including aggression halting postures and competitive singing unlike terrans athsheans follow a polycyclic sleep pattern and their circadian rhythms make them most active at dawn and dusk thus they struggle to adapt to 8 hour terran working day athsheans are able to enter dream state consciously and their dreams both heal them and guide their behavior those individuals adept at interpreting dreams are seen as gods amongst athsheans in internal chronology of hainish universe events of word for world is forest occur after dispossessed in which both ansible and league of worlds are unrealised dreams however novel is located prior to rocannon s world in which terran is seen as a distinct possibility a date of 2368 ce has been suggested by reviewers although le guin provides no direct statement of date plot summary word for world is forest begins from point of view of captain davidson who is commander of a logging camp named smith camp many native athsheans are used as slave labor at camp and also as personal servants novel begins with davidson travelling to centralville headquarters of colony hoping to have a sexual encounter with one of a number of women who have just arrived on predominantly male colony when davidson returns to smith camp he finds entire camp burned to ground and all of humans dead he lands to investigate and while on ground is overpowered by four athsheans he recognizes one of them as selver an athshean who was a personal servant at headquarters of colony and later an assistant to raj lyubov colony anthropologist a few months prior to attack davidson had raped selver s wife thele who died in process prompting an enraged selver to attack davidson davidson nearly kills him before he is rescued by lyubov however he is left with prominent facial scars which render him easily recognizable athsheans allow davidson to leave and carry a message about destruction of camp back to colony headquarters after attack selver roams through forest for five days before coming upon an athshean settlement after recovering from effects of many days of travel selver describes to people of town destruction of his town known as by terrans who then built their headquarters at site he also tells them about enslavement of hundreds of athsheans at various camps he says that terrans are crazy because they do not respect sanctity of life in same way that athsheans do which was why he led attack against camp smith after some discussion people of town send messengers to other towns sharing selver s story while selver himself travels back towards terran headquarters an inquiry into destruction of camp smith is held at centralville in addition to personnel of colony two emissaries from planets of hain and tau ceti also participate lyubov states that colony s mistreatment and enslavement of athsheans led to attack colonel commander of colony blames lyubov s assessment of athsheans as non aggressive emissaries state that rules of terra s colonial administration have changed since colony last heard from it they present colony with an ansible which can communicate instantly with terra and colonial administration communication which would otherwise take 27 years in one direction they also state that terra is now a member of league of worlds of which they are emissaries colony is forced to release all its athshean slaves and minimize contact with them davidson is transferred to a different camp under a higher ranking commander as punishment for a retaliatory raid that he carried out however davidson violates his orders and leads further attacks against athshean towns without knowledge of his superiors following inquiry lyubov visits athshean town he had been studying he meets selver hoping to rebuild their friendship but selver rebuffs him telling him to stay away from town center two nights later selver leads athsheans in a massive attack on centralville although attack deliberately avoids lyubov s house lyubov leaves during attack and is killed by a collapsing building attack kills all of women in colony men that survive are herded into a compound and held prisoner selver tells them that attack was in retaliation for davidson s killings in south which survivors are ignorant of selver states that if terrans agree to restrict themselves to a small area and agree to avoid conflict with athsheans they will be left in peace until next terran ship arrives to take them off colony survivors agree to his terms and order all their remaining outposts to withdraw including one at which davidson lives however davidson disobeys orders and continues to attack athshean towns refusing to return to centralville after a couple of weeks athsheans attack davidson s camp killing or capturing everybody except davidson and two others who escape in a helicopter although others want to return to centralville davidson orders them back to fight athsheans helicopter crashes killing all but davidson who is captured he is taken before selver who says that davidson gave selver gift of murder but that selver would not kill davidson because there was no need instead athsheans abandon davidson on an island that terran logging has rendered barren three years later terran ships return and take surviving colonists off planet commander of ships states that terrans will not return except as observers and scientists as planet has been placed under a ban by league of worlds selver gives lyubov s research which he has saved to one of emissaries who tells him that lyubov s efforts to protect athsheans will not be forgotten and that his work will be given value it deserves selver reflects that although planet may have been won from terrans his people have now learned ability to kill without reason

novella has received significant critical attention since it was published along with vaster than empires and more slow with which it is frequently compared it has gotten generally positive reviews from critics and scholars although several noted that it was not le guin s best work kirkus reviews stated in 1976 that book was lesser le guin but often impressive while carol called it brief but stunning suzanne reid stated that novella was deeply moving and shocking by turns novel contrasts good and evil very explicitly unlike in other hainish cycle works such as left hand of darkness or dispossessed which made word for world is forest less complex than those other works charlotte spivack stated that although novel was deftly written and imaginatively conceived its polemic style made it a lesser literary achievement than many of le guin s other works she says that unlike many other characters that le guin has created such as george orr and dr haber in lathe of heaven several characters in word for world is forest such as davidson exist only as one dimensional stereotypes she described style of novel as moving and hard hitting but said that because it was written in mood of reaction to vietnam war it was not meant to be entertainment primary characters don davidson captain don davidson begins novel as commander of smith camp he is described as being of descent shortly before events of novel davidson rapes thele selver s wife who dies in process after smith is destroyed by selver and his compatriots davidson is relocated to a camp called new java where he leads reprisals against athsheans against orders he is eventually captured and abandoned on an isolated island by athsheans he is portrayed as a relentless and uncompromising figure always planning how to overcome an unfriendly natural environment and conquer natives whom he sees as inferior language used in davidson s internal monologues reveals his hatred and contempt for people different from himself initially this hatred is directed at athsheans whom he sees as nonhuman and refers to as a derivative of creatures however his contempt extends to women in colony and eventually to other members of military who follow colonel s orders not to fight athsheans he has racist feelings towards south asian anthropologist raj lyubov stating that some men especially and hindi types are actually born traitors in contrast to lyubov and selver he is depicted as a person who is not self aware whose self hatred and rigid mental attitude are his undoing he rejects out of hand anything that does not conform to his beliefs dismissing anyone who disagrees with him as going spla insane selver selver is chief athshean protagonist of novel he is training to become a dreamer among athsheans when terrans colonize athshe and selver is enslaved selver referred to as sam by terrans is initially used as a manservant in colony headquarters before lyubov comes across him and takes him on as an interpreter and assistant they quickly form a bond and selver helps lyubov understand both athshean language and their method of dreaming although lyubov is willing to allow selver to escape selver tells him that he will not because his wife thele is also a slave at camp after learning this lyubov allows two to meet secretly in his quarters however thele is raped by davidson and dies in process an enraged selver attacks davidson who nearly kills him before lyubov rescues selver and sets him free against orders in contrast to davidson selver is depicted as a highly sensitive and intuitive individual after he tells his story to other athsheans they begin to see him as a sha ab or god who interprets his own experiences and dreams to mean that terrans must be killed and forced off planet raj lyubov raj lyubov is anthropologist in colony a scholar who holds honorary rank of captain he is depicted as being from an indian heritage selver is initially a servant in central camp lyubov enlists him as an assistant and builds a relationship of trust with him two of them compile a dictionary of athshean and terran languages when selver s wife thele is raped and killed by davidson selver attacks davidson who nearly kills him lyubov rescues selver and nurses him back to health during attack on colony s headquarters selver tells athsheans to leave lyubov s house alone but lyubov leaves his house and is killed by a collapsing building as he dies lyubov warns selver about impact of killings on athshean society in comparison to davidson lyubov reflects a lot upon his actions and tries to analyze them in a detached manner his contradictory position of being a colonial officer despite recognizing damage that colony is doing to athsheans gives him migraines he feels a strong sense of guilt at impacts of colony and is willing to destroy his own reputation in order to protect athshean people he is one of only terrans to treat athsheans as human beings although this loses him respect of his fellow terrans themes hainish universe themes similar to future history works by other authors such as isaac asimov le guin s fictional works set in hainish universe explore idea of human society expanding across galaxy books like dispossessed left hand of darkness and word for world is forest also explore effects of various social and political systems le guin s later hainish novels also challenge contemporary ideas about gender ethnic differences value of ownership and human beings relationship to natural world in comparison to other worlds of hainish universe relationship between athshe and league of worlds is portrayed as ambiguous whereas with planets such as in left hand of darkness integration with hainish planets is seen as a good thing athshe is seen as changed for worse both by loggers and by being taught to kill their own species league eventually decides to isolate athshe and limit all contact with it a decision shown to have ambiguous overtones language and communication language and linguistic barriers are a major theme in word for world is forest something exemplified by title in contrast to other hainish universe novels such as left hand of darkness word for world is forest portrays a communication gap that protagonists are never able to bridge both native athsheans and loggers have languages that reflect their perceptions of reality but they are unable to find a common language in native athshean language word athshe means both forest and world demonstrating close link that athsheans have to forest and their planet it is noted by lyubov that athsheans believe substance of their world was not earth but forest language used by athsheans during conversations similarly show their interconnectedness and dependence on their ecosystem through use of forest related metaphors similarly athshean word for dream is same as word for root athsheans have learned to exert some conscious control over their dreams and their actions are dictated by both their dream experiences and their conscious non dreaming thoughts thus their dreaming makes them rooted something which is demonstrated through their use of language athshean word for god is same as word for translator representing this role that gods have in their society which is to interpret and translate their dreams into actions dreaming and consciousness word for world is forest shares theme of dreaming with later le guin novel lathe of heaven suzanne reid stated that novel examines source and effect of dreams athsheans teach themselves to consciously and actively control their dreams this allows them to access their subconscious in a way that terrans are not able athsheans follow a polycyclic sleep pattern with a period of 120 minutes which makes it impossible for them to adapt to terran eight hour work day their dreaming is not restricted to times when they are asleep with adept dreamers being able to dream while wide awake as well visions they see while dreaming direct and shape their waking behavior which selver describes as balanc ing your sanity on double support fine balance of reason and dream once you have learned that you cannot unlearn it any more than you can unlearn to think leaders among athsheans are best dreamers and they consider individuals able to interpret dreams to be gods athshean word for god is same as word for translator representing this role that gods have in their society spivack writes that selver becomes such a god during events of word for world is forest but his interpretation of dreams is a negative one because it tells athsheans how to kill athsheans perceive terrans as an insane people partly because of disconnect amongst terrans between conscious rational thinking and subconscious drives terrans frequent use of hallucinogens is seen as closest they are able to get to understanding their own subconscious psychological equilibrium which their dreaming gives athsheans is portrayed as reason why they are able to live in balance with their ecosystem reviewer ian watson states that athshean forest itself is a metaphor for consciousness in novel terrans distanced from their own tangled subconscious are afraid of forest and seek to tear it down athsheans in contrast are integrated with it at a subconscious level entire forest is also seen as a collective athshean consciousness although forest in word for world is forest is not actually sentient le guin explores idea of a sentient forest further in short story vaster than empires and more slow which shares many thematic parallels with former colonialism and anti war themes le guin was strongly opposed to and troubled by vietnam war a reaction which played a large part in tone of novel tone of novel is often harsh and hard hitting playing off anger in united states at american military actions in vietnam tension between violence and non violence is a part of dialectic theme in novel of a constant tension between opposites through most of novel terran military is in control of colony despite raj lyubov s good intentions davidson is most prominent example of of military government there are intentional parallels drawn between terran colonizers and us intervention in vietnam anti interventionist tone of novel was in sharp contrast to other science fiction novels about war written around same period for example high use of drugs amongst us troops in vietnam is represented by use of hallucinogens amongst terran soldiers which le guin portrays as norm on colony athsheans in contrast are shown as an innately peaceful and non aggressive people at least at beginning of novel rape and murder are virtually unknown on planet they have adopted a number of behaviors that preempt violence thus when selver has davidson pinned down after attack on smith camp he finds himself unable to kill davidson despite hate he feels towards terran selver spends much of novel reflecting on effect that violence has on his own culture he turns to violence against athshean ethic in order to save his culture as he sees it however unlike davidson who enjoys killing selver sees it as something poisoning his culture this perception is shared by his fellow athsheans one of elders of athsheans says to selver you ve done what you had to do and it was not right word for world is forest also challenges idea of colonialism terran colonists are depicted as being blind to culture of athsheans and convinced that they represent a higher form of civilization le guin also challenges metaphorical preference in western cultures for pure light in contrast to deeper and more complex shadows ecological sensitivity throughout novel le guin draws a contrast between athshean way of integrating with ecology of planet and human tendency to destroy it athsheans are portrayed as having a decentralized society which has not damaged ecosystem to further its own economy in comparison humans are shown as having nearly destroyed their planet by exhausting its natural resources and coming to athshe to plunder its resources terrans on other hand have an instrumentalist view of forest seeing it as wood to be shipped to terra and land to be transformed into farms their dwellings and towns are built in a way that allows them to integrate with their environment this depiction not only links athsheans to their environment but gives primacy to forest over rest of natural ecosystem athsheans clans are named after trees and their highly decentralized social structure is constructed in a way that resembles their ecosystem to athsheans being a mentally healthy person is equivalent to being in touch with their roots which are closely linked to their ecosystem in contrast terrans behavior such as rape and murder is attributed to their leaving their roots behind them in athshean language word for forest is also word for world showing dependence of athshean culture upon forest in contrast terrans ignorance of ecology of planet has already denuded one island in archipelago and is damaging rest of planet davidson sees forest as a waste of space and wishes to turn it into farmland contrast between terran relationship to planet and athshean one is major example of a larger dialectical structure within novel a comparison of opposites throughout athsheans are shown as living in balance with their world while terrans it athsheans are shown as a gentle people in contrast violence and aggression of terrans three main characters of novella selver lyubov and davidson have been described by reviewers as representing three different historical attitudes towards nature davidson represent machismo of some early explorers who feared nature and wanted to overcome it lyubov has a more positive but highly romanticized view of forest while only selver and other athsheans are able to live in harmony with it resemblance to avatar several reviewers have noted that narrative of 2009 film avatar has many similarities to that of word for world is forest specific similarities include notion that earth s resources have been used up extraction of resources in an exploitative manner from another planet a native population on that planet which lives in close harmony with their world and a rebellion by those natives against exploitative human colonizers a key difference lies in roles of benevolent humans in both works raj lyubov in word for world is forest jake sully and human scientists in avatar while lyubov made an impression as a sensible human and did help mediate peace between athshean people and humanity he is not savior of their race and he does not survive to claim any prize from it additionally in word for world is forest militarism is regarded by athsheans especially selver as an unfortunate but necessary addition to athshean culture and one that may destroy their way of life in contrast militarism is seen less critically in avatar in introduction to second volume of hainish novels stories le guin signals similarities with a high budget highly successful film which completely reverses book s moral premise presenting central and unsolved problem of book mass violence as a solution and states i m glad i have nothing at all to do with it style and structure novel has eight chapters narrated by each of three main characters in turn davidson narrates chapters 1 4 and 7 selver narrates chapters 2 6 and 8 and lyubov narrates chapters 3 and 5 this alternation emphasizes both differences between characters and their isolation within their societies lyubov and davidson s chapters are narrated from a limited omniscient point of view making their chapters seem like internal monologues davidson s belief in inferiority of athsheans and his adversarial attitude towards planet are directly presented to reader along with lyubov s struggle to do his job dispassionately while following his personal morality in contrast selver s chapters are written from a truly omniscient point of view allowing le guin to give reader information about planet and its people selver has no extensive monologues instead several other athsheans also feature prominently in his chapters although novel is an anti war novel portraying a military conflict unusually it does not describe most of action planning and strategy instead most of action happens off page and novel focuses on decisions being made about conflict in minds of principal characters language used within each chapter shifts with protagonist revealing way they think about events of book davidson s monologues are filled with derogatory language he uses athsheans are referred to by slang term creechie women in colony are prime human stock and so forth le guin herself later said she was unhappy with strident tone of novel she had been troubled by vietnam war but was living in london when she wrote novel cut off from anti war movement she had been a part of in oregon written in these circumstances word for world is forest became what le guin called a she stated that writing book was like taking dictation from a boss with ulcers she said that she had wanted to write about forests and dreaming but that boss had made her write instead about ecological destruction charlotte spivack stated that book was an angry work that ended on a note of futility and despair references sources
