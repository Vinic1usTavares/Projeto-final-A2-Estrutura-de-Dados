illustrated many elements of pianist s emerging style somber internally shifting chords in introduction punchy twisting phrases in solo and smoldering intensity that always characterized his best work hope s sense of time meant that his note placement was unpredictable falling at various points either side of beat but not exactly on it his use of keyboard dynamics was similarly flexible as listener

1996 wrote that he s dynamically smoother than monk with a spidery spacy touch his harmonic and compositional approach is intricate in design and almost eerie in execution coda critic stuart broomer also commented on hope s touch suggesting that it was unusual and light and created a combination of delicacy and boldness that was all his own broomer stuart january february 1997 elmo hope omission coda volume 271 p 36 leonard feather and ira gitler summarized hope s abilities he had a style that parallels powell and was a pianist and composer of rare harmonic acuity and very personal interpretation compositions new grove dictionary of jazz states that hope composed around 75 pieces of music which range in character from a tortuous nervousness to an introspective semi lyrical romanticism one example minor bertha has an unusual 35 bar form with a nine bar a section that utilizes unconventional rhythms and weakly functional harmonies which obscure its phrases such other pieces as one down barfly and tranquility also offer fine examples of his idiosyncratic creativity penguin jazz guide commented that hope s compositions were strongly melodic with some containing concepts of fugue and canon taken from classical music but retaining foundations in blues cook richard morton brian 2010 penguin jazz guide history of music in 1001 best albums p 144 penguin atkins stated that hope wrote highly structured complex compositions that he played with improvisational flexibility mathieson pointed out that despite originality of hope s compositions they have been taken up by other musicians only rarely as they are tied to hope s idiosyncratic form of expression and remain difficult to play legacy and influence hope powell and monk were considered by their contemporaries to be influences on each other early in their careers and all therefore helped affect development of jazz piano palmer robert august 30 1985 spectrum of jazz piano masters in village

hope way green film dee dee bridgewater september 16 2016 new york amsterdam news several critics have advocated for a reassessment of hope s career one is chuck berg writing for down beat in 1980 who attributed ignoring of hope by most jazz fans and critics largely to uniqueness of his style which differed from that prevalent in jazz generally and in bebop in particular berg chuck march 1980 last sessions hope from rikers island down beat volume 47 3 p 44 berg contrasted aggressive assertiveness massive outpourings of raw energy and displays of technical athleticism that he argued are valued in jazz with hope s more nuanced and intellectual approach and suggested that expansion of what is accepted in jazz since his death meant that his career should be re evaluated seven years later palmer wrote on hope and fellow pianist herbie nichols they were practically categorized out of existence dismissed as second stringers and copyists when they were both prolifically creative and highly original they suffered a neglect that is only now beginning to be dispelled in case of nichols and that still continues in case of hope palmer robert november 22 1987 jazz injustice genius in
