blues and soul records performed by her 1920s 1950s idols including billie holiday otis redding etta james and ella fitzgerald which she viewed as music that really had heart recording and production to create a throwback with elements of old school genres combined with a modern day twist aguilera sent letters to different producers that she hoped could help her with direction she was taking for

gritty and old sounds dj premier questioned if aguilera was familiar with his work though she had known of his jazz influenced work with gang starr in late 1980s and early 1990s in response aguilera wanted her album to draw inspirations from premier s song jazz thing and noted that their collaboration became his first time venturing into pop world for 1920s and 1930s era vibe influenced second
