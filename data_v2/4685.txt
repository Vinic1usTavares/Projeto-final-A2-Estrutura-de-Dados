great eastern highway is a road that links western australian capital of perth with city of kalgoorlie a key route for road vehicles accessing eastern wheatbelt and goldfields it is western portion of main road link between perth and eastern states of australia highway forms majority of national highway 94 although alignment through perth suburbs of guildford and midland and eastern section between coolgardie and kalgoorlie are not included various segments form parts of other road routes including national route 1 alternative national route 94 and state route 51 there are numerous intersections in perth with other highways and main roads including canning albany tonkin and roe highways and graham farmer freeway there are also two rural highways that spur off great eastern highway great southern highway begins near perth s eastern metropolitan boundary linking towns such as york brookton narrogin and katanning near eastern end of highway coolgardie is starting point of coolgardie esperance highway connecting to interstate route eyre highway at norseman as well as coastal town of esperance highway was created in 1930s from an existing system of roads linking perth with goldfields though name great eastern highway was coined to describe route from perth to guildford on northern side of swan river modern day guildford road it was actually used for road through belmont south of river this section was constructed in 1867 using convict labour with road base made from sections of tree trunks over years road has been upgraded with whole highway sealed by 1953 segments reconstructed and widened dual carriageways created in perth and kalgoorlie and grade separated interchanges built at major intersections great eastern highway bypass in perth s eastern suburbs opened in 1988 allowing through traffic to avoid guildford and midland townsites and in 2002 a new bypass diverted highway around northam a future route to replace great eastern highway s current ascent of darling scarp has been identified planned route is a controlled access highway along toodyay road to and then across to wundowie via a new alignment though planning began in 1970s construction of this route has not been scheduled and it is not considered a priority route description great eastern highway commences at causeway a river crossing that connects to perth s central business district

eastern highway between mundaring and northam is state s worst section of national highway in terms of road safety casualty crash rates had decreased since 2007 although royal automobile club of western australia rac still considered it a risky section of road needing close attention from road authorities in 2013 great eastern highway remained as a road of particular concern with australian

highway has existed since convict era of western australia original road is thought to have been constructed in 1867 using convict labour with a road base made of jarrah tree trunks cut into disc shapes use of wooden discs as a road base had been proposed by western australian governor john hampton leading them to be known as hampton s cheeses discs were approximately thick and as large as in diameter and gaps between pieces would have been filled with soil or lime same type of road is known to have existed along stirling highway guildford road albany highway and wanneroo road in 1860s and would have prevented horses and carts from getting bogged in wet weather evidence of this original road was found in belmont in 1948 when widening works uncovered jarrah discs during upgrade works in 2012 more discs were discovered beneath existing asphalt over a stretch highway origins name great eastern highway was coined by perth road board in december 1933 it was suggested for perth to guildford road on north side of swan river now known as guildford road as an alternative to bassendean road board s proposal perth road in february 1934 bassendean road board agreed to name as perth road would be too general and road was considered main artery serving eastern districts all way through to kalgoorlie other local governments in area considered issue over next few months bayswater road board and greenmount road board were in favour of idea but guildford road board was opposed as several local road names would be lost greenmount and public advertising thereafter referred to road as great eastern highway at log cabin great eastern highway greenmount excellent accommodation hotel menu and council wrote to main roads department requesting name change be gazetted this prompted main roads to write to other local governments advising of request and soliciting their views mundaring road board and kellerberrin road board were supportive while kalgoorlie road board suggested great eastern goldfields highway kalgoorlie municipal council agreed that road should be known as a highway but thought name was inadequate for a road that only connected midland junction with coolgardie midland junction municipal council opposed renaming citing sentimental and practical reasons for continuance of use of old name in august 1934 bassendean road board applied to lands department to change portion of perth guildford road within its district to great eastern highway department refused request reasoning that most traffic bound for midland used causeway and travelled on south side of swan river and that therefore perth guildford road should not be part of main highway despite this setback perth road board organised a local government conference to consider renaming road from perth to guildford issue was considered important as losing name to south side of river would divert traffic away from old established centres to north straightening of dangerous bends and replacement of an old bridge between bassendean and guildford were also to be considered conference held on 7 september 1934 was attended by representatives of perth bayswater bassendean and guildford road boards and midland junction council guildford and midland junction were still opposed to renaming but others were supportive motions that passed included submitting a rename proposal to state government urging government to construct a new bridge at bassendean and approaching government to have road declared a main road in november 1934 state government land council contacted local governments on south side of swan river asking them to rename roads that make up causeway midland route as great eastern highway both perth city council and belmont park road board agreed to request this created a peculiar situation as described by rac with roads both north and south of swan river proposed to be renamed as great eastern highway despite name change not being official some residents along road through belmont started describing their properties as located on great eastern highway another conference of local governments north of river was held in december 1934 they decided to continue to pursue renaming perth guildford road to great eastern highway and having it gazetted as a main road a letter from commissioner of main roads had stated that road through belmont was considered principal highway to eastern states he therefore recommended that if name great eastern highway were to be applied west of midland junction it should be to that road as road through bassendean was not considered a main road traffic counts collected by bassendean road board however showed that north of river route through bassendean carried more traffic in both directions than southern route through belmont 54 compared to 46 northern route was also shorter by about and considered by local governments to be natural entrance to city only crossing swan river once and not again at causeway on 8 january 1935 representatives from local governments north of river urged minister for lands michael troy to rename perth guildford road through those areas as great eastern highway despite route being shorter and carrying more traffic he refused he said that it was not gazetted as main road and a previous decision to rename road through belmont as great eastern highway was made after considering facts and at request of main roads board there was resentment and an objection over name being pinched from perth road board minister disregarded objection he advised representatives to see minister for works to get road declared a main road and then approach him with a new name this resolved great eastern highway s route with local governments north of river pursuing other names such as main highway thumb alt historical photograph view of great eastern highway lined by wattle through mahogany creek in 1939 on 14 april 1938 name great eastern highway was gazetted in accordance

dreyer road goldfields road kalgoorlie road woodward street and coolgardie road upgrades and improvements by 1950 highway had been sealed from perth to southern cross and from a few miles west of coolgardie to kalgoorlie traffic in goldfields was light with an average daily traffic of 44 vehicles between southern cross and coolgardie and 33 from coolgardie to kalgoorlie road was completely sealed by 1953 between 1954 and 1956 sections of highway between perth and southern cross were improved works included increasing seal width along of road reconstructing of road and resealing precast concrete structures were used to replace two old narrow wooden bridges in 1950s roundabouts were constructed at each end of causeway to improve flow of traffic on bridges and distribution of traffic

australia s worst accident that year according to police with aftermath described by a witness as like a battlefield this accident led to construction of a truck arrester bed near bottom of hill it has been used in emergencies several times since in 1994 federal government approved a 43 9 million project to upgrade substandard sections of great eastern highway between northam and southern cross that portion of highway was one of oldest sections of national highway in western australia road was susceptible to failure due to poor drainage and frequent flooding further works in 1990s saw a second carriageway constructed from mundaring to sawyers valley and then extended to lakes at edge of perth a dual carriageway was also constructed in kalgoorlie and a long overtaking lane was built near clackline more recent works have improved sections of highway in perth great eastern highway s intersection with roe highway was upgraded to a grade separated interchange design is a diamond interchange with free flowing traffic on roe highway and an additional looped ramp for northbound to eastbound traffic movements construction of 101 5 million project began in late 2010 and interchange was officially opened to traffic on 9 june 2012 another project undertaken was widening of highway through suburbs of rivervale belmont and redcliffe between road just north east of graham farmer freeway interchange and tonkin highway work commenced in june 2011 and was completed in february 2013 nine months earlier than scheduled prime minister julia gillard opened upgraded highway on 28 march 2013 participating in a ribbon cutting ceremony photo and caption archived on 28 march 2013 280 million upgrade included construction of a median strip widening road to three lanes in each direction bus priority lanes at several traffic light controlled intersections and bicycle lanes upgrade was expected to reduce congestion along highway which had been one of perth s worst accident spots in 2011 12 however accidents were usually not serious and roadworks were considered a major contributing factor in october 2013 project was recognised with civil contractors federation national

alignment date back to gordon stephenson and alistair hepburn s 1955 plan for metropolitan region which was precursor of perth s metropolitan region scheme road was constructed in late 1980s and was known as redcliffe highway during construction great eastern highway bypass was opened on 14 may 1988 after 21 months of construction and at a cost of 10 million planning for a bypass around northam began in 1960s original route through town centre functioned as both a local access road and primary traffic route including for heavy vehicles there were particular concerns with amount of traffic congestion frequency of crashes and noise and visual pollution of highway s traffic twelve different alignments were considered for bypass which were narrowed down to three options by 1990s in 1993 environmental protection authority assessed proposal and found that only route that deviated furthest away from townsite would be environmentally acceptable closer routes were not acceptable due to potential impact on avon river project gained minister for environment s conditional approval on 24 june 1994 construction of northam bypass began in january 2001 with new road opened on 17 may 2002 a bypass of clackline was also constructed realigning of great eastern highway north of town works began in january 2007 and were completed in february 2008 project also involved constructing overtaking lanes between clackline and bakers hill upgrading intersections in clackline and constructing a pedestrian underpass for a heritage trail clackline brook was realigned through a large box culvert allowing a safer crossing than narrow clackline bridge on original alignment bypass was originally allocated 2 4 million of funding in 2006 but by january 2007 it was expected to cost almost 11 million final project value was 9 2 million issues and challenges in project s design and construction included extensive rock protection requirements for clackline brook culvert drilling and blasting close to existing highway and protecting heritage and environmentally sensitive areas clackline community welcomed bypass but there were concerns that historic clackline bridge would be lost bridge

for a new highway reservation from mundaring to wooroloo encountered community opposition and environmental protection authority epa requested a more detailed environmental assessment in 1985 a study into primary east west traffic routes in area was commissioned by main roads department metropolitan region planning authority later known as state planning commission now western australian planning commission shire of mundaring and shire of swan it recommended a new alignment known as orange route be selected for perth to adelaide national highway alternative routes were identified using other colours as codenames new national highway would travel north east along toodyay road from roe highway to beyond and then deviate east via proposed orange route to meet great eastern highway near wundowie ultimate design of highway included grade separated interchanges for all of roads that it intersects orange route received environmental approval on 22 november 1989 detailed planning for clackline to wooroloo section of orange route was to begin in 1998 construction of orange route is not a priority for main roads project was not in forward works program there was no indication of expected starting date and a cost benefit analysis had not been performed recently plans are still in development but federal government is responsible for financing project major intersections see
