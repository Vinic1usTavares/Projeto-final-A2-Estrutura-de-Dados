portrait justice william brennan author of unanimous opinion arguments by time appeal was prepared seck had left legal services but was still attorney of record tribe paid to fly him to washington d c to prepare brief with dan israel of narf and bernie becker tribe s attorney who would argue case before supreme court at oral arguments on april 20 1976 becker pointed out that public law 280 gave state jurisdiction over criminal matters and civil causes of actions a legal term for lawsuits since congress had also passed other indian laws at same time such as various indian termination acts which specifically authorized states to collect taxes from indians its silence in this area meant congress did not intend to do so with public law 280 becker brought up leading article on public law 280 by ucla law professor carole goldberg that argued that law was established to address problem of crime on reservations he also noted that tribes which had adequate law and order processes such as red lake band of chippewa were excluded from state jurisdiction in minnesota arguing for state of minnesota was c h luther of state attorney general s office luther argued four points for tax being valid a language of statute b legislative history of public law 280 c prior judicial opinions and d public policy luther conceded that if trailer was a fixed house or real property it would be exempt from taxation luther also stated that other taxes such as gasoline sales income and other taxes of general applicability would apply to indians unanimous opinion justice william j brennan jr delivered unanimous opinion of court on june 14 1976 brennan stated that public law 280 was not designed to eliminate all restrictions on states as they dealt with indian tribes brennan noted that under supreme court s prior decisions of mescalero apache tribe v jones mescalero apache tribe v jones and mcclanahan v arizona state tax comm n mcclanahan v arizona state tax comm n states had no authority to tax indians absent congressional consent since itasca county was claiming public law 280 granted that consent brennan evaluated statute in regards to taxation of indians brennan noted that minnesota supreme court had found that statute did grant right to tax personal property as an inherent power even though law did not specifically mention power to tax he rejected this argument noting that primary purpose of law was to provide for state criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against indians on reservations nothing in legislative history of law provided support for itasca county s interpretation brennan also noted that several tribal termination acts which were considered at same time specifically discussed taxation of indians while public law 280 was silent brennan then noted that principles of statutory construction as regards to indians were very specific any differences in possible interpretation must be resolved in favor of tribe or indian since minnesota s interpretation did not meet any of these tests regarding either consent of congress to tax or of statutory construction brennan stated that supreme court would not follow state s reasoning and reversed lower court s decision subsequent developments thumb right 300px alt lucky dog casino entrance a tribal casino when decision was announced it was reported as a substantial victory for indians
