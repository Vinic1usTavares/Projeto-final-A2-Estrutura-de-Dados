rhodesian mission in lisbon capital of portugal operated from september 1965 to may 1975 it was a diplomatic mission representing rhodesia or southern rhodesia initially as a self governing colony of britain and after unilateral declaration of independence in november 1965 as an unrecognised state rhodesia informed britain of its intent to open a lisbon mission headed by an accredited representative independent from britain embassy in city in june 1965 whitehall refused to endorse idea but rhodesia continued nonetheless and later that month appointed harry reedman to head mission british government attempted unsuccessfully to block this unilateral act rhodesia s first for some months afterwards affair came amid larger dispute between whitehall and salisbury regarding terms under which rhodesia could be granted sovereign independence rhodesia s mostly white government insisted that statehood should come under constitution introduced with britain s approval in 1961 while whitehall insisted that a set timetable for introduction of black majority rule would have to be in place before country could be fully independent rhodesian government s stance on this matter caused it to become isolated within commonwealth which from 1964 excluded it from most of its internal bodies while rhodesian military became unofficially embargoed by its established british and american suppliers rhodesia had run itself as a self governing colony since 1923 but ultimate responsibility for foreign affairs remained with britain rhodesia s staunch opposition to immediate black rule and its disillusionment regarding britain propelled it towards portugal which governed angola and mozambique territories respectively to west and east of rhodesia in their attempt to prove that an independent lisbon mission was legal rhodesians presented an argument based on british legislation conferring on colonial government right to appoint its own diplomatic agents or consular or trade representatives in countries which are willing to receive them british countered that ultimate purview over rhodesian foreign affairs still lay with whitehall they proposed that reedman be integrated into british embassy in lisbon as a rhodesian consul but rhodesia refused to accept a lesser post for reedman than those enjoyed by independent rhodesian representatives in south africa and mozambique following months of abortive anglo rhodesian talks and unsuccessful attempts by britain to deter portugal diplomatically reedman travelled to lisbon in september 1965 to take up his post at head of an independent rhodesian mission portuguese ministry of foreign affairs which insisted it was neutral regarding rhodesia outraged whitehall by accepting reedman s letter of accreditation though lisbon was careful to avoid provoking britain omitting word diplomatic from titles given to both reedman and his mission rhodesians still regarded themselves as victorious saying they had set out to gain an independent diplomatic representative in lisbon and now had one historian j r t wood later called this rhodesia s first independent and indeed unilateral act veritable straw in wind on 11 november 1965 less than two months after reedman s investiture rhodesia went one further and unilaterally declared its independence from britain mission in lisbon operated until 1975 when it was closed following carnation revolution in portugal previous year background responsible government federation and wind of change thumb federation of rhodesia and nyasaland 1953 63 alt a map of rhodesia and nyasaland having been governed and developed by british south africa company since 1890s southern rhodesia became a self governing colony within british empire in 1923 when it was granted responsible government by whitehall southern rhodesian capital salisbury was henceforth empowered to run its own affairs in almost all matters including defence foreign affairs was one of few areas reserved by british government as empire s lone self governing colony southern rhodesia was considered a sui generis case almost on a par with a dominion starting in 1932 imperial conferences included southern rhodesian prime minister alongside those from dominions a unique situation which continued after imperial conferences were superseded by commonwealth prime ministers conferences in 1944 as most of southern rhodesian politicians saw it they were as good as independent if full autonomy were granted in form of only practical difference would be a rise in expenses for foreign representation as salisbury would have to maintain its own embassies abroad believing full dominion status to be effectively symbolic and there for asking prime minister godfrey huggins in office from 1933 to 1953 regarded independence as a non issue he twice refused british overtures hinting at dominion status and instead pursued an initially semi independent federation with directly administered british colonies of northern rhodesia and nyasaland mandated by results of 1953 referendum federation began later that year with southern rhodesia most developed of three territories at its head salisbury doubled as federal capital federation was granted several privileges by britain during its earlier years for example a 1957 british act of parliament empowered it to appoint its own diplomatic agents or consular or trade representatives in countries which are willing to receive them so long as it informed britain when it was doing so most prominent of these appointments was made in 1961 when union of south africa split from commonwealth of nations and became a republic an accredited representative of salisbury was set up in pretoria soon after independent of britain s embassy there an independent office representing federation was also set up in lourenco marques capital of portuguese mozambique while further afield federal officials were set up within british embassies in japan west germany and united states federation ultimately failed because of shifting international attitudes and rising black nationalist ambitions of late 1950s and early 1960s often collectively called wind of change idea of no independence before majority rule gained considerable ground in british political circles as uk france and belgium vastly accelerated their withdrawal from continent amid a flurry of bloody civil wars military coups and other disasters most of new african countries became autocratic one party states within a few years already wary of black nationalism on racial grounds salisbury became increasingly antipathetic towards it as a result of these developments particularly when brutal congo crisis caused thousands of congolese whites to become refugees in northern and southern rhodesia in 1962 with federation in its constitutional death throes amid nyasaland s for secession and immediate black rule federal prime minister roy welensky was horrified and outraged to be told by britain s secretary of state for commonwealth relations duncan sandys that we british have lost will to govern but we haven t retorted julian greenfield welensky s law minister federal dissolution salisbury pushes for independence southern rhodesians presumed that in event of federal dissolution they would be first in line for independence and would receive it without major adjustments to their 1961 constitution indeed intergovernmental correspondence during early 1963 did much to confirm salisbury s belief that this was case while federal break up talks progressed sandys issued a letter of intent in which he said that powers conferred on federal government by british legislation would transfer to southern rhodesia at end of federation it was agreed that salisbury would keep federal overseas missions in pretoria and lourenco marques as well as british embassy desks in bonn tokyo and washington arrangements for federal dissolution concluded in mid 1963 and federation formally ended on 31 december that year northern rhodesia and nyasaland became independent during 1964 respectively renamed zambia and malawi under black majority governments southern rhodesia was denied same on grounds that whites held too dominant a position prompting indignation and fury from governing rhodesian front rf and its supporters prime minister winston field s failure to secure independence from britain during early 1964 led to his forced resignation and replacement by his deputy ian smith in april that year two months into his premiership smith was deeply offended when whitehall informed him that for first time since 1932 southern rhodesia would not be represented at year s commonwealth prime ministers conference as decision had been taken to only include fully independent states in future quarrel over terms for independence caused southern rhodesian military s traditional british and american suppliers to impose an informal embargo and motivated britain to cut off financial aid to salisbury around same time united states promptly followed suit political violence between rival black nationalist movements in rhodesia intensified during mid 1964 leading to jail terms or preventive restriction for several prominent nationalists and concurrent bans for their respective parties when northern rhodesia became zambia in october 1964 southern rhodesia dropped southern from its name and initiated legislation to this effect but britain refused assent saying that colony could not legally rename itself salisbury continued using shortened name anyway rhodesian government was ardently anti communist and opposed immediate black rule which smith said would cause destruction of our country pointing to ongoing events such as congo crisis as evidence parliament remained mostly white but salisbury contended it had close to unanimous support from all races in pursuing independence under 1961 constitution citing various tests of opinion it conducted in late 1964 prime minister stood against any constitutional change he believed was too radical regarding this as a matter of national and regional security according to his memoirs he worked to prevent a mad rush into one man one vote with all resultant corruption nepotism chaos and economic disaster which we had witnessed in all countries around us labour cabinet of british prime minister harold wilson which replaced previous conservative administration in october 1964 did not give credence to rhodesian tests of opinion and insisted on majority rule as a condition for independence commonwealth repeatedly urged britain to intervene directly should rhodesian defiance continue while british liberals worried that if left unchecked salisbury might drift towards south african style apartheid britain portugal and rhodesia thumb portugal p rhodesia rh and south africa sa formed what britain called a defiant and mutually sustaining bloc in southern africa during 1960s alt a map see description british policy makers regarded portugal as a traditional friend anglo portuguese alliance dated back to 1386 and both countries were in north atlantic treaty organisation nato and european free trade association but combined strength of communist bloc and afro asian lobby in united nations forced british to peel back their support for pluricontinental estado novo new state during early 1960s portugal s colonial war starting in angola in 1961 pitted it against a number of guerrilla factions in its african territories most of which subscribed to communist political thinking britain opposed communist encroachment into southern africa but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly opposed general consensus at un which roundly condemned colonialism in all forms and supported communist backed insurgencies across region regarding them as racial liberation movements it therefore attempted an awkward balancing act whereby it would appear to oppose portugal without meaningfully doing so britain s stance towards rhodesia was influenced in a similar way with whitehall unable to back down on policy of no independence before majority rule without causing international uproar also contributory was disproportionate sway over britain s african policy held by julius nyerere president of tanzania who was a fervent proponent for majority rule across africa without delay implemented by military force if need be british politicians deferred to nyerere on almost every proposal they made regarding rhodesia during 1960s and 1970s in immediate post federal period britain forlornly tried to stifle rhodesia s further alignment with south africa and portugal realising that british influence in region was severely limited while three remained so closely linked a 1965 british government memorandum described trio as a defiant and mutually sustaining bloc great personal rapport developed between smith and his portuguese counterpart antonio de oliveira salazar on first meeting in portugal in september 1964 two prime ministers found they shared many common views regarding race relations in their respective countries britain s handling of commonwealth and what smith called complacency of major powers of free world in face of what pair saw as inexorable communist expansionism after hearing smith s argument in favour of rhodesian independence salazar privately pledged portugal s complete support rf called a new general election for may 1965 and campaigning on an election promise of independence won a clean sweep of all 50 a roll seats a week later wilson met with portuguese foreign minister alberto franco nogueira whom he pressed on portugal s secret dealings with rhodesia nogueira categorically denied anything of sort rhodesia seeks british endorsement for a lisbon mission gibbs speech on 9 june following rhodesian front s decisive may 1965 election victory parliament was opened by british appointed governor sir humphrey gibbs on 9 june for first time rhodesia had an official leader of opposition who was black josiah gondo leader of united people s party now sat opposite smith and all white rf in house of assembly though gibbs represented british crown in rhodesia he had been a local resident most of his life and had feet in both camps regarding himself as loyal both to rhodesia and to faraway monarch while opening parliament he told house of assembly that rf s strengthened majority amounted to a mandate to lead country to its full independence later in speech he referred to this as our independence thumb upright rhodesia house was office of colony s high commissioner in london 2006 photograph alt an edwardian building with six floors stands on a moderate day a flag flying atop it gibbs then said that rhodesia wished to have best possible relations with its neighbours and startled british observers by saying government had informed him that it would follow recommendations made by portugal during recent talks and would open its own diplomatic mission in portuguese capital lisbon as soon as was practical evan campbell rhodesia s high commissioner in london asked whitehall same day to endorse appointment of harry reedman as rhodesia s accredited representative to portugal reasoning that 1957 act allowing federation to do so still covered rhodesia under principle of national succession 1963 letter of intent from sandys confirmed this in rhodesia s eyes historian j r t wood calls this rhodesia s first independent and indeed unilateral act veritable straw in wind rhodesian motivations aside from reinforcing luso rhodesian relations lisbon appointment was designed to secure african nation a diplomatic foothold in europe outside of britain s reach and to help salisbury find new trading partners and diplomatic allies on continent among other things rhodesians intended to make up shortfalls in military equipment caused by undeclared anglo american arms embargo reedman former minister for immigration and tourism was also a retired officer of british royal air force where he had been involved in bomber research and an experienced engineer and businessman all right ingredients government thought for someone in position to source european aircraft weapons and other equipment while also representing rhodesian interests in mainland europe lord brockway head of movement for colonial freedom believed that rhodesia was attempting to assert de facto independence in eyes of international community by deliberately defying britain over lisbon issue if salisbury is permitted to claim diplomatic rights in foreign capitals its assertion of sovereignty is accepted he wrote in an article for british democratic socialist weekly tribune britain refuses britain was caught unprepared by campbell s request and issued no response for over a week in meantime campbell whose retirement was due was relieved by rhodesian government on 10 june his replacement brigadier andrew skeen took over campbell s london office at rhodesia house 429 strand six days later bent on securing reedman s investiture quickly rhodesian government made it publicly known on 19 june that pursuant to british and portuguese approval reedman would be appointed within seven days whitehall still took no action wilson and his secretary of state for commonwealth relations arthur bottomley were occupied at chequers official country residence of british prime minister where they were entertaining commonwealth heads of state in bottomley s absence his office explored issue and resolved that rhodesia could retain its representative in south africa but should not be allowed to appoint another in lisbon a consul was acceptable they concluded but only as part of british embassy staff bottomley remained unaware of this progress until a call from his office on 25 june whereupon he still did nothing unwilling to wait rhodesia confirmed reedman s appointment next day much to wilson s fury only now was bottomley finally jolted into action he informed salisbury of his ministry s findings on 29 june offering them consul within embassy but refusing to sanction an independent office early negotiations rhodesian disillusionment britain adopts delaying tactics thumb upright british prime minister harold wilson believed he could bring ian smith to heel by stonewalling him alt a portrait photograph of harold wilson independence talks between britain and rhodesia continued for a fortnight without major reference to reedman appointment with britain more concerned with discussing a possible rhodesian unilateral declaration of independence udi smith delivered an openly defiant speech to his parliament on 30 june attacking britain for its handling of commonwealth s newer members which he said were unduly influencing british policy in africa britain was desperate to avoid international humiliation that would accompany organisation s break up he claimed and was therefore attempting to hold it together by appeasing less prominent members while making clear his disdain prime minister pledged to go on with negotiations saying that he did not believe britain truly endorsed its professed line in dealing with immovable smith wilson s ministers adopted a programme of deliberate frustration and delay britain would interminably stonewall rhodesian prime minister maintaining facade of continued negotiation by very occasionally repeating their stance in hope that either smith would back down or his cabinet would eventually lose faith in his negotiating prowess and replace him with somebody more malleable wood writes that wilson bottomley and their labour contemporaries were distracted by their own political agendas and did not understand extent of rhodesia s considerable disillusionment with britain by this time effectively kicked out of commonwealth as huggins later commented a fortress mentality was developing in salisbury propelling it towards unilateral action wood concludes that britain s maintenance of this stonewalling tactic was misjudged and only exacerbated rhodesian government s feeling of alienation in british house of lords on 26 july brockway pressed lord taylor under secretary of state for colonies on rhodesia s claims arguing that failure to block lisbon appointment would amount to conceding de facto recognition to rhodesia as an independent state taylor s response was that britain remained committed to upholding its ultimate purview over rhodesian overseas relations brockway then asked how rhodesia had attained its independent office in pretoria surely he said this provided a precedent which was rather dangerous taylor replied that pretoria and salisbury had exchanged high commissioners before south africa left commonwealth in 1961 and that britain had granted rhodesia special dispensation to retain pretoria mission thereafter he stressed that in britain s eyes this was no precedent for lisbon britain despatches cledwyn hughes to rhodesia 22 27 july british decided to despatch one of their commonwealth ministers to rhodesia for talks during early july but debated for a while over whether it should be bottomley or his deputy cledwyn hughes who should be sent wilson considered this a matter of urgency as he had heard a rumour that rhodesia might declare independence on its main national holiday rhodes day that year 12 july but this proved false on 15 july britain s high commissioner to rhodesia john baines johnston was instructed to propose a week long round of talks between smith and hughes in salisbury johnston was given permission to cave if rhodesian prime minister insisted on meeting with bottomley but this did not prove necessary smith cabled back on 18th accepting hughes visit british delegation arrived in salisbury four days later discussions proceeded rapidly during week but did not touch on issue of lisbon until fifth day 26 july when hughes and johnston met with smith deputy prime minister clifford dupont and trade and industry minister george rudland dupont opened discussion by referring to sandys statement from 1963 which said rhodesian government would retain any rights previously granted to federation which dupont reasoned surely included ability given in 1957 to appoint its own overseas agents if it informed britain as portugal had indicated its willingness to accept a rhodesian diplomat dupont said rhodesian government was acting perfectly within its rights hughes countered that he did not believe wording of 1957 document gave rhodesia right to devise its own representation overseas without first gaining assent from britain reedman appointment would probably be seen internationally as a major rise in rhodesian diplomatic profile he said and might damage britain s reputation which would in turn make ongoing negotiations for independence more difficult for both sides he repeated bottomley s previous offer of a consul on british embassy staff adding that official would not have to be physically located within embassy and could set up his own office elsewhere so long as he remained nominally affiliated to it smith replied that in his interpretation rhodesia was required to keep whitehall informed but prior british concurrence was not necessary if britain contested this prime minister said then surely 1957 entrustment had never meant anything dupont then spoke again rejecting idea that rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of british embassy hughes replied firmly that 1957 despatch did not give rhodesians free rein over external matters and warned them to be more flexible if they intended to find common ground eager to avoid open confrontation smith told dupont to reconsider his tone and changed subject hughes met with several other rhodesian figures before leaving late on 27 july but lisbon remained off programme most of time just before hughes departed dupont released a statement saying that reedman would take office in lisbon on 1 august and would be warmly welcomed by portuguese government hughes decried this in a brief telephone call to smith but could do little more before leaving rhodesia that evening on 29 july smith fielded questions from press commenting on both lisbon and independence talks in general he expressed belief that rhodesia had made more progress towards independence talking with hughes than it ever had before but qualified this by saying only wilson s reply to proposals given to hughes would show if this were indeed true he said that although he thought whitehall was keen to resolve independence issue he did not believe their line had changed he declared that he and rf would not change their stance in any way moving to subject of lisbon smith stressed that this was separate from independence dispute then overruled dupont s announcement of two days before reedman s appointment would remain provisional until further notice he said anglo rhodesian animosity deepens bottomley tours west africa arousing rhodesian suspicion bottomley toured west africa during early august and in ghana and nigeria gave several speeches reassuring his hosts that immediate majority rule was an unconditional requirement for rhodesian independence he ruled out use of military force in event of a rhodesian udi and pledged to instead end such a rebellion through economic sanctions bottomley s dismissal of use of force drew damning criticism from joshua nkomo imprisoned leader of marxist leninist zimbabwe african people s union who said this showed britain was not serious about decolonising rhodesia as it had its other african possessions meanwhile bottomley s comments increased anti british sentiment in his memoirs smith describes mood in forthright terms accusing britain of resorting to politics of convenience and appeasement we waited and waited but british were not prepared to make a clear decision he writes they were consulting bankrupt and communist dictatorships before replying to us becoming exasperated by lack of progress even more hesitant members of rhodesian government began to see road leading towards udi as only one viable for them lisbon however remained immediate bone of contention and on this issue rhodesians became yet more determined not to give an inch meeting between johnston and smith on 18 august thumb upright rhodesian prime minister ian smith proposed legal arbitration to settle lisbon issue which britain rejected alt a portrait photograph of ian smith smith organised a meeting with johnston starting at 09 00 on 18 august where he informed british high commissioner that he had considered lisbon appointment extensively with help of dupont several legal advisers and a judge of rhodesian high court judge had examined relevant documents and had come to conclusion that dupont s interpretation of them was correct smith therefore felt certain that reedman s appointment was legitimate so long as portugal agreed a long argument ensued with neither man willing to budge smith said that he had always tried to be flexible and civil but that he and his government felt they had to make a stand by making clear to lisbon exact nature of their proposed representative and informing britain of their intent smith said rhodesians had filled every legal obligation johnston dismissed smith s argument asserting that neither federation nor rhodesia had ever made such an appointment this was actually false federal government had opened independent diplomatic missions in south africa and portuguese mozambique and rhodesia retained them both johnston concluded that rhodesia was trying to prematurely advance its international standing previous he said had been made to allow britain and rhodesia to cooperate subject to whitehall s ultimate authority and did not entitle rhodesia to do as it liked in field of external affairs especially if its chosen line ran counter to britain s in an attempt to intimidate smith johnston sternly asked why rhodesian prime minister would risk causing a major international incident by deliberately defying britain smith replied that following britain s several slights against rhodesia over previous year and a half salisbury would not accept another conversation continued in this manner for some time afterwards smith proposed that relevant documents be examined jointly by two judges one british and one rhodesian but johnston refused this meeting ended without agreement bottomley returns to britain rhodesian press reported extensively on lisbon controversy during second half of august generally predicting that neither britain portugal nor rhodesia would back down while most reporters believed that whitehall would take a strong line few could see any way it could actually stop reedman from taking office on 20 august bottomley spoke at his final conference in lagos and repeated all he had previously said regarding britain s stance on rhodesia back in london three days later he reaffirmed his previous stance regarding lisbon saying that he would be pleased to have a rhodesian on staff of british embassy there but would allow no more in same interview he expressed belief that wilson had averted a rhodesian udi in october previous year by warning salisbury of economic consequences speaking in gwelo on 27 august smith derided this statement calling it incredible his administration had not even considered a declaration of independence then he said but it was contemplated now and he believed anglo rhodesian relations were at their all time lowest ebb he urged britain to return to bargaining table quickly britain attempts to block appointment wilson resolves to challenge portugal british continued their policy of stalling smith at end of august 1965 they did not consider a rhodesian udi an immediate threat and therefore focussed on colony s maintained defiance of mother country regarding reedman and lisbon on 30 august johnston summarised britain s stand on issue for bottomley s commonwealth relations office according to his understanding he said rhodesia had been told just before federal dissolution that it would retain federation s former powers regarding external affairs but that this entrustment was subject to british discretion and could not be exercised without extensive prior consultation and conformity to britain s line johnston rued bitterly that rhodesians had apparently made practical arrangements for an independent office in lisbon anyway even going to trouble of renting prospective mission premises he repeated claim he had made in meeting with smith on 18 august saying once more that federal government had not made appointments off its own bat he accepted that there was an independent rhodesian envoy in pretoria but argued that this was result of south africa s enforced withdrawal from commonwealth he did not mention rhodesian formerly federal office in lourenco marques which wood comments could be considered precedent for portugal on 5 september salisbury sunday mail reported that smith was standing firm on reedman s absolute independence in lisbon and that portugal had accepted envoy british foreign secretary michael stewart reacted with alarm convening an urgent meeting same day with hughes and sir archibald ross britain s ambassador to portugal here hughes proposed hauling portugal over coals insisting that lisbon mission represented creeping independence for rhodesia and therefore had to be stopped ross disagreed reasoning this would only damage relations between britain and portugal an undesirable prospect given countries common membership in nato european free trade association and more there was much at stake britain enjoyed an annual ps48 million trade surplus with portugal and portuguese railways was in process of buying 50 diesel locomotives from english electric in azores archipelago portugal provided nato with a strategically key air base which was unprotected by treaty given inclination lisbon might close it hughes insisted that there was nothing more they could do to deter rhodesia directly they had already threatened to expel rhodesia s representative from british embassy in washington with no effect only open course therefore had to be to take a firmer line with portugal two days later on 7 september wilson discussed matter with hughes and stewart and agreed with their conclusions telling them to proceed meeting between johnston and smith on 8 september appointment is confirmed same day bottomley wrote to smith saying that he and wilson were disheartened by lack of progress regarding both independence and lisbon appointment he was willing to visit rhodesia personally but could not come until october because he had to be in blackpool to attend labour party conference due to commence on 26 september next morning on 8 september johnston told smith that if reedman proceeded to portugal in open disregard for britain s wishes it would negatively affect future independence negotiations rhodesia s delay in justifying appointment was also having a detrimental affect johnston asserted finally he threatened to evict rhodesian envoys from washington bonn and tokyo if rhodesia did not desist smith was yet again unmoved any procrastination regarding lisbon was britain s fault he insisted he told johnston to wait for afternoon session in rhodesia s legislative assembly to hear dupont s official announcement of reedman s appointment as well as full rhodesian explanation behind it smith said he understood this would irk british but insisted that he and his government were no longer willing to wait he had repeatedly offered to respect judgement of an impartial arbitration team he reminded johnston but british had shot this idea down each time he therefore felt compelled to follow advice given by his own legal team which was that appointment was legitimate his government would not accept a lesser appointment in lisbon than in pretoria and lourenco marques he dismissed johnston s threat to expel rhodesian representatives in west germany japan and america relations with portugal and south africa were far more important he said as they were rhodesia s two closest neighbours geographically johnston protested that british government could not take part in kind of judicial enquiry smith described as its sovereignty could not be subject to any outside judgement and there was nothing to arbitrate anyway smith was again resolute why he queried was whitehall so adamant to avoid legal arbitration if its ministers were so sure they were right he promised to drop matter if such a panel ruled against him but to no avail johnston said only that he would telegraph whitehall to inform them that reedman s appointment was imminent dupont confirmed it that afternoon telling rhodesian legislative assembly that mission had been accepted by portugal britain mobilises nato

charge d affaires in london jose manuel de villas boas de vasconcellos faria on 8 september nogueira said portuguese were accepting reedman as a rhodesian representative but were not defining his status as they wished to remain neutral in what they regarded as an exclusively anglo rhodesian problem so far as he could see nogueira said portugal had done no harm to british interests stewart firmly told nogueira that britain expected portugal to make a statement within 24 hours saying that it would not deal with reedman while he remained off british embassy staff nogueira replied that his government was not going to accord official diplomatic recognition to reedman and that dupont understood this ross now threatened to involve nato if portugal did not thoroughly explain its conduct unmoved nogueira said this surprised him if british were so keen to have reedman on staff at their embassy he answered that was down to them portugal was totally neutral in affair he insisted britain vigorously rallied other nato countries to take a stand against portugal over reedman france warned that nato pressure was unlikely to yield results in his matter but belgium s nato representative andre de staercke agreed to challenge salazar on 11 september at his meeting with de staercke salazar denied that portugal was giving rhodesia its own diplomatic representation and said there had been some misunderstanding portugal would not obstruct reedman s entry should he arrive salazar said as he was travelling on a rhodesian issued british passport on 14 september nogueira s ministry released a statement saying that if britain challenged portugal over rhodesia at nato lisbon would use greatest firmness to repel any attempt to attribute particular responsibilities or to make criticism of portugal s position britain raised issue formally in north atlantic council nato s most senior political governing body same day here portugal s delegate vasco da cunha argued that given standing existence of independent rhodesian offices in lourenco marques pretoria and london matter was between britain and rhodesia and not portugal s business rhodesia had simply asked to have reedman head a representative office in lisbon and he would not present a letter of accreditation if rhodesia had exaggerated this da cunha said that was not portugal s concern italian belgian danish french and u s delegates in turn sided with britain and collectively asked da cunha to tell his government to publicly declare its non acceptance of reedman while he lacked british approval da cunha refused saying this would only irritate his compatriots because of neglect by their allies of their interests in past meeting broke up without agreement whitehall was pleased with pro british sentiment displayed

reedman flew into lisbon airport on 15 september 1965 he was met there by portuguese foreign ministry s assistant chief of protocol luis bastos and three rhodesian officials who had arrived a fortnight before nobody from british embassy was present bastos told a reporter that he was at airport on nogueira s behalf to accord reedman classic welcome for arrival of heads of mission speaking next day reedman appeared genial and optimistic we portugal and rhodesia have everything in common he said including will for survival an awareness of true situation overseas and a greater feeling towards what we are doing two days later dupont announced that he had issued a letter of accreditation to reedman for presentation to nogueira envoy would not present credentials dupont explained as he was representing rhodesian government and not its head of state queen elizabeth ii deputy prime minister expressed confusion regarding appointment s discussion at nato saying that rhodesia was far outside organisation s geographical area of responsibility he said that letter of accreditation would confer on reedman title of accredited diplomatic representative and that reedman would thereafter head rhodesian diplomatic mission in lisbon which would operate on same level as rhodesian office in pretoria portuguese foreign ministry quickly issued a statement correcting dupont s wording saying that reedman would lead rhodesian mission with no reference to diplomatic status to britain s alarm and indignation portuguese government announced on 21 september that nogueira had accepted a letter of introduction from reedman conferring upon him title chief of rhodesian mission with powers to deal with portuguese foreign ministry in luso rhodesian matters without british interference this followed precedent set by reedman s counterpart in south africa statement said speaking publicly in salisbury same evening dupont told reporters that there had never been any intention to claim ambassadorial status for reedman and that rhodesia had constantly kept britain informed of what was happening regarding appointment so far as he was concerned he said rhodesian government had achieved its objective of attaining an independent diplomatic representative in portugal and had not exceeded its mandate in any way while doing so britain protested strenuously saying portugal was going back on its word portugal insisted that its reception of reedman and his lisbon mission did not prejudice britain s responsibility over rhodesia and was justified because of long standing ties between portugal and rhodesia as well as their common involvement in many southern african issues rhodesia initiates clandestine arms purchases reedman carried instructions from salisbury to spend up to ps3 million on european weapons aircraft and equipment as soon as he could rhodesian government now believed that it would almost certainly declare independence unilaterally and knowing purchase of materiel would be more difficult following this wished to have rhodesian security forces necessary ammunition weapons spare parts and other equipment in place beforehand soon after arriving in portugal reedman contacted lisbon based zoio brothers jose luiz and jean who had recently supplied portuguese armed forces in angola with british made weapons in direct contravention of nato s embargo against arming portugal s african based troops zoios were interested in stocking rhodesia s arsenal and promptly agreed to arrange an order of weapons from a third party on reedman s behalf in

travelled to belgium to buy starter cartridges for rolls royce avon 109 jet engines used by royal rhodesian air force s english electric canberra bombers as well as engines for rhodesia s hawker hunter jet fighters which were produced in belgium under licence from britain reedman speaks on portuguese state radio 24 september on 24 september reedman appeared on portugal s state owned national radio station nacional de addressing portuguese nation as head of rhodesian diplomatic mission to portugal he spoke along lines reminiscent of smith s speech to parliament on 30 june saying afro asian element made a mockery of commonwealth and enabled chinese initiated communist encroachment into africa more than one commonwealth member state hosted training facilities for black communist guerrillas he said which threatened all civilised states in africa he dismissed one man one vote as false trash democracy and said that in present geopolitical climate countries run by black africans inevitably destroyed themselves this your rhodesian neighbour will not in any circumstances allow he pledged we portugal and rhodesia stand together in a common cause because of civilisation ross rebuked nogueira for allowing broadcast saying its content was insidious and goading nogueira agreed that reedman s words were provocative but said portugal could not be blamed as it did not censor public broadcasts britain considered withdrawing ross in protest but its foreign office ruled this out saying britain could not afford to be without an ambassador in lisbon to influence portugal s actions in event of udi british cabinet secretary burke trend rejected this view pointing to lisbon s conduct regarding reedman which he said showed portuguese ha d very clearly made up their minds to support a rhodesian udi british ambassador would not be able to affect matters he surmised and british interests would be better served by immediately taking a firm hand against portugal in hope that this would send a strong message to rhodesia ross then protested to portuguese about reedman s calling himself head of rhodesian diplomatic mission on radio lisbon replied impassively that this was a private expression of views by reedman and not portugal s responsibility aftermath final steps to udi while british remained firmly against separate rhodesian representation in lisbon there was little they could do to stop it ross was nominally put on extended leave but not withdrawn deciding that he could no longer wait for bottomley to fulfil his promise to visit rhodesia during october smith resolved to instead meet with wilson personally in london and arranged to travel on 3 october arriving next day while smith prepared to travel britain continued its frantic efforts to carry international anti rhodesian sentiment among other things urging each nato member government not to deal with reedman in london britons who sympathised with smith came out to support him in large numbers surprising both british and rhodesians two prime ministers talks were largely unproductive and little common ground was found before smith flew home on 12 october two weeks later wilson travelled to salisbury to continue talks british prime minister proposed that future black representation in rhodesian parliament might be safeguarded by revocation of some of salisbury s self governing powers held since 1923 this was a horrific prospect in eyes of his rhodesian opponents and proved final straw for smith s government unilateral declaration of independence was signed by rhodesian cabinet on 11 november 1965 to almost unanimous international acrimony next day united nations security council passed resolution 216 which condemned declaration as an illegal one made by a racist minority and called on all member states to withhold diplomatic recognition portugal s role in rhodesian sanction busting smith was confident that british military would never agree to engage in what he said would be a fratricidal war against rhodesia he was proven correct when a british ministry of defence council convened by wilson and headed by denis healey secretary of state for defence determined such intervention impossible citing various logistical problems danger of provoking a pre emptive rhodesian attack on zambia and psychological issues that would surely accompany any confrontation between british and rhodesian troops wilson therefore put all his eggs in sanctions basket predicting in january 1966 that embargo would bring rhodesia to its knees within a matter of weeks rather than months un embargo proved ineffective largely because both portugal and south africa refused to participate both declared themselves neutral in rhodesian affair and continued to supply rhodesia with vital resources such as oil both at a governmental level and privately portugal provided seaports of mozambique and oil refinery at lourenco marques car stickers marked thank you mozambique quickly became popular with white rhodesian motorists clandestine trade with other nations continued initially at a reduced level among other things portugal illicitly labelled unsold rhodesian tobacco as mozambican product then sold it on salisbury s behalf in europe and asia through this and a series of similar sanction busting operations rhodesia avoided economic cataclysm predicted by wilson and with help of south africa and portugal gradually became more self sufficient aiming to directly cut off main supply lines of oil to rhodesia namely portuguese mozambican ports at beira and lourenco marques wilson set up beira patrol a royal navy squadron based in mozambique channel in march 1966 this blockade was endorsed following month by un security council resolution 221 too small to cover both beira and lourenco marques and unable to legally fire on tankers once they were in portuguese waters patrol met with little success but it endured regardless for nearly a decade thumb belgian fn fal battle rifle was one of rhodesia s primary small arms during bush war alt an fn fal battle rifle with a wooden stock zoios clandestine transaction with turp initially progressed well but fell apart in march 1966 when turp discovered he would actually be arming rhodesia rather than pakistan reacted with alarm and informed british government british board of trade tightened its control over arms transactions and encouraged its nato counterparts to do same while zoios turned their attention to belgian italian and west german arms dealers in october 1966 a huge consignment of army and air force equipment arrived in rhodesia from seaports of mozambique with many of containers bearing metropolitan portuguese markings prominent among european weapons were fn fal battle rifles from belgium which allowed an unofficial rhodesian trade delegation to operate quietly in spite of sanctions carnation revolution ends luso rhodesian cooperation rhodesia s lisbon mission remained open throughout late 1960s and early 1970s providing a key link between rhodesian and portuguese governments which remained close when rhodesia adopted a republican constitution in 1970 portugal bowed to british diplomatic pressure and withdrew its consul general joao de freitas cruz from salisbury but rhodesian office in lisbon remained open with carnation revolution of 1974 portugal s african policy was suddenly reversed by contrast to former authoritarian government which had been committed to a pluricontinental portugal fighting costly wars against independence movements in its african territories to maintain it new leftist administration rapidly initiated moves to withdraw from africa as quickly as possible following hurried negotiations between portugal and nationalist guerrillas in each territory both mozambique and angola became independent under communist governments in 1975 lisbon s stance on rhodesia altered accordingly portuguese government ordered closure of rhodesian mission in april 1975 and simultaneously withdrew its own remaining officials from rhodesia rhodesian mission in lisbon formally closed on 1 may 1975 notes and references
