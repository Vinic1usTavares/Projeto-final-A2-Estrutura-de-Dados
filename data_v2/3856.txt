adoption of tricolor flag by cispadane republic first italian sovereign state to make use of it during napoleonic period three colors acquired a more idealistic meaning for population green represents hope white represents faith and red represents love other less probable conjectures that explain adoption of green hypothesize a tribute that napoleon wanted to give to corsica where he was born or to a possible reference to verdant italian landscape for adoption of greenery there is also so called masonic hypothesis even for freemasonry green was color of nature a symbol of human rights which are naturally inherent in human being as much as of florid italian landscape this interpretation however is opposed by those who maintain that freemasonry as a secret society did not have such an influence at time that inspired italian national colors another hypothesis that attempts to explain meaning of three italian national colors would without historical bases be that green is linked to color of meadows and mediterranean maquis white to that of snows of alps and red to blood spilt in wars of italian independence and unification a more religious interpretation is that green represents
