of them british fishing vessels u boat was also responsible for sinking new british destroyer in 1917 in 1918 ub 16 was converted into a minelayer with replacement of her torpedo tubes with four mine chutes on 10 may 1918 ub 16 was torpedoed by british submarine off british east coast of 16 men on board only ub 16s commander survived attack design and construction after german army s rapid advance along north sea coast in earliest stages of world war i german imperial navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in narrow and shallow seas off flanders miller pp 46 47 karau p 48 project 34 a design effort begun in mid august 1914 produced type ub i design a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled constrained by railroad size limitations ub i design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes a further refinement of design replacing torpedo tubes with mine chutes but changing little else evolved into type uc i coastal minelaying submarine see miller p 458 ub 16 and sister boat comprised an order of two submarines placed on 25 november from ag weser of bremen a little more than three months after planning for class began williamson p 12 ub 16 was laid down by weser in bremen on 21 february 1915 as built ub 16 was long abeam and had a draught of she had a single korting 4 cylinder diesel engine for surface travel and a single siemens schuckert electric motor for underwater travel both attached to a single propeller shaft her top speeds were surfaced and submerged at more moderate speeds she could sail up to on surface before refueling and up to submerged before recharging her batteries like all boats of class ub 16 was rated to a diving depth of and could completely submerge in 33 seconds ub 16 was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes she was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck ub 16s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men karau p 49 after work on ub 16 was complete at weser yard she was readied for rail shipment process of shipping a ub i boat involved breaking submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded onto eight railway flatcars in early 1915 sections of ub 16 were shipped to antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two to three week process after ub 16 was assembled and launched on 26 april she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to bruges where she underwent trials early career

merchant shipping on 29 february tarrant p 26 final ground rules agreed upon by german admiralstab were that all enemy vessels in germany s self proclaimed war zone would be destroyed without warning that enemy vessels outside war zone would be destroyed only if armed and to avoid antagonizing united states that enemy passenger steamers were not to be attacked regardless of whether in war zone or

support of operation ub 16 and five other flanders boats set out at midnight 30 31 may to form a line east of lowestoft other five boats for may action were ub 17 and this group was to intercept and attack british light forces from harwich should they sortie north to join battle unfortunately for germans british admiralty had intelligence reports of departure of submarines which coupled with an absence of attacks on shipping aroused british suspicions a delayed departure of german high seas fleet for its sortie which had been redirected to skagerrak and failure of several of u boats stationed to north to receive coded message warning of british advance caused scheer s anticipated ambush to be a complete and disappointing failure in ub 16s group only ub 10 sighted harwich forces and they were too far away to mount an attack failure of submarine ambush to sink any british capital ships allowed full grand fleet to engage numerically inferior high seas fleet in battle of jutland which took place 31 may 1 june tarrant pp 32 33 ub 16s activities over next two months are not reported but on 2 august submarine was patrolling off mass lightship and torpedoed norwegian steamer john

had been original intention in may german fleet planned to depart late in day on 18 august and shell military targets next morning as in may ub 16 was part of a group intended to attack harwich forces

again british intelligence had given warning of impending attack and ambush causing grand fleet to sortie at 16 00 on 18 august five hours before german fleet sailed faulty intelligence caused scheer initially to divert from sunderland and then to eventually call off whole operation although u boats to north sank two british light cruisers sank and teamed up to sink ub 16 and her group played no part in action later on 24 august ub 16 was again patrolling off mass lightship when hundius stopped velox another norwegian steamer headed for london crewmen from ub 16 boarded 312 ton cargo ship planted explosives and sank vessel and her general cargo velox was last ship sunk by ub 16 for nearly eight months and last sunk by hundius before he was replaced by oblt ernst muller schwarz late in month neither muller schwartz nor his january 1917 replacement oblt hans ewald niemer sank any ships while in command of ub 16 unrestricted submarine warfare by time of so called turnip winter of 1916

16 and three sister boats ub 10 ub 12 and ub 17 had all been converted to minelaying submarines by 1918 conversion involved removing bow section containing pair of torpedo tubes from each u boat and replacing it with a new bow containing four mine chutes capable of carrying two mines each in process boats were lengthened to and displacement increased to on surface and below surface exactly when this conversion was performed on ub 16 is not reported but ub 12 was at dockyard from november 1916 to january 1917 lack of reported successes by ub 16 during this same span makes it a possibility that her conversion was accomplished in a similar timeframe on 13 march ub 16 now under command of oblt rudolf stier was responsible for sinking 895 ton steamer lisette near shipwash lightship one month later on 13 april fishing smack ruth was boarded and sunk by ub 16 ruth was final ship sunk by ub 16 on 28 april british forces attempted to block canal at zeebrugge and bottle up vessels of

submarine spotted ub 16 on surface near harwich although commanding officer lieutenant pulleyne initially believed that ub 16 was a british submarine he submerged out of caution because of ub 16s proximity to harwich after identifying submarine as a german boat pulleyne maneuvered to attack at 19 15 e34 launched two torpedoes at ub 16 from a distance of first hit ub 16s bow and failed to detonate but second hit below conning tower and exploded sinking ub 16 at position in less than five minutes after a further five minutes e34 surfaced near where ub 16 had gone down and rescued von
