some attempts at demolition excavated sections of old bunker complex were mostly destroyed during reconstruction of that area of berlin site remained unmarked until 2006 when a small plaque was installed with a schematic diagram some corridors of bunker still exist but are sealed off from public construction reich chancellery bunker was initially constructed as a temporary air raid shelter for hitler who actually spent very little time in capital during most of war increased bombing of berlin led to expansion of complex as an improvised permanent shelter elaborate complex consisted of two separate shelters vorbunker forward bunker upper bunker completed in 1936 and fuhrerbunker located lower than vorbunker and to west southwest completed in 1944 they were connected by a stairway set at right angles and could be closed off from each other by a bulkhead and steel door vorbunker was located beneath cellar of a large reception hall behind old reich chancellery at wilhelmstrasse 77 fuhrerbunker was located about beneath garden of old reich chancellery north of new reich chancellery building at vossstrasse 6 besides being deeper under ground fuhrerbunker had significantly more reinforcement its roof was made of concrete almost thick about 30 small rooms were protected by approximately of concrete exits led into main buildings as well as an emergency exit up to garden fuhrerbunker development was built by hochtief company as part of an extensive program of subterranean construction in berlin begun in 1940 hitler s accommodations were in this newer lower section and by february 1945 it had been decorated with high quality furniture taken from chancellery along with several framed oil paintings after descending stairs into lower section and passing through steel

room ante room bunker complex was self contained however as fuhrerbunker was below water table conditions were unpleasantly damp with pumps running continuously to remove groundwater a diesel generator provided electricity and well water was pumped in as water supply communications systems included a telex a telephone switchboard and an army radio set with an outdoor antenna as conditions deteriorated at end of war hitler received much of his war news from bbc radio broadcasts and via courier events in 1945 hitler moved into fuhrerbunker on 16 january 1945 joined by his senior staff including martin bormann eva braun and joseph goebbels joined them in april while magda goebbels and their six children took residence in upper vorbunker two or three dozen support medical and administrative staff were also sheltered there these included hitler s secretaries including traudl junge a nurse named erna flegel and telephone switchboard operator sergeant rochus misch initially hitler continued to utilize undamaged wing of reich chancellery where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study afterwards he would have tea with his secretaries before returning to bunker complex for night after several weeks of this routine hitler seldom left bunker except for short strolls in chancellery garden with his dog blondi bunker was crowded atmosphere was oppressive
