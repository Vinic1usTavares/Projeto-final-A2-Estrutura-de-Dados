max martin known for his work with britney spears among other singers would produce loser like me tim stack of entertainment weekly called this a major pop music coup by glee anders also went on to comment thing about max is that he s a huge fan of pop culture and he just loved idea of being part of something that s such a cultural phenomenon so it was actually not hard to convince him at all he was all about it according to anders swedish based martin was in united states at time working on spears then new record and then was exposed to exactly how enormous glee is according to american society of composers authors and publishers database co writers on song include anders peer astrom savan kotecha and johan schuster loser like me and get it right both premiered on on air with ryan

radio single for glee and was sent to radio on march 1 2011 for mainstream and hot ac stations pete cosenza senior vice president of promotion and adult formats for columbia records told billboard we ve promoted glee music to radio for past couple of years and week by week programmers have embraced show and its music more and more adult radio has created weekly and in some cases daily features and played snippets of songs now more have put loser like me into regular rotation glee is one of biggest shows on television and it s a music show what a win for us and radio barb richards director of music for said that cast s introduction of new music prompted station to finally add music from cast richards referenced 21 9 million downloads and 5 2 million albums sold since series since its may 2009 premiere but commented still i believe that people want to hear originals over remakes so up until glee cast s original music it didn t make sense for us to play each latest cover other than to spotlight it day of show however richards complimented original loser like me saying its lyrics would resonate with kids and parents and said that she liked it when she first heard it and when she saw it on show she also commented that it is good on its own and having glee name on it gives it a leg up dave mckay program director at also echoed richards sentiments that glee sales were reason to add them to airplay adding not many artists or songs enjoy type of exposure that glee provides plus audience that watches show is audience we target so fit seems perfect since glee music sells there is definitely an appetite for it responding to song being an original as opposed to their traditional covers mckay said if loser like me were a bad song then it wouldn t matter whether it was original or a cover we wouldn t be playing it that song is good and that it has glee reach makes it an easy song to play keith kennedy program director at wkdd said single made him ponder why they haven t played glee songs prior to loser like me kennedy said how many times have you heard radio programmers claim that they use sales numbers to shape their stations playlists look at itunes every wednesday glee often dominates top 10 kennedy s station wkdd holds a glee o clock segment daily and he said while some of remakes have leaned toward show tunes several probably should have received more airplay composition loser like me is a song that features pop funk chicken scratch guitars and according to jody rosen of rolling stone a hopped up beat song is fronted by lea michele singing lead on chorus and a verse with cory monteith providing an additional verse other glee cast members back two up chorus and a rap breakdown it bears resemblance to then recent max martin produced singles particularly raise your glass which contains a similar guitar intro robert copsey of digital spy even called loser like me a sequel to raise your glass after guitar riffs michele sings about becoming a future superstar yeah you may think that i m a zero but hey everyone you wanna be probably started off like me jason lipshutz of billboard said loser like me is a sunny pop track that finds lea michele and cory monteith railing against conformity and celebrating their individuality in their verses other cast member lyrics include lyric you may think i m a freak show responded to by naya rivera with spoken i don t care song features self empowerment lyrics which revolve around revenge fantasies such as in monteith s lines i could be a superstar i ll see you when you wash my car according to melinda newman of hitfix song is about being a loser now but turning in to a winner now who never ever looks back aly semigran of mtv news said lyrics of peppy pop ditty keep in tune with themes of show critical reception jody rosen of rolling stone gave song four out of five stars and called it predictably fizzy and fiendishly catchy rosen also said that lyric belted out with bright sided earnestness by lea michele and cory monteith distills show s theme mystical power of a good tune and a well choreographed jazz hands routine to turn geeks into gods robert copsey of digital spy wrote max martin and shellback chuck pinks and katy perrys into kitchen sink and add a generous coat of gloss and shimmer and auto tune to create what is ultimately an audacious unabashed and crucially authentic pop stomper that remains true to what glee is all about melinda newman of hitfix liked song but said that it could have had more of an edge newman also said for any kid who s ever been bullied or adult who remembers being bullied it s a bulls eye newman wrote that michele who opens song had a classic voice but it had no grit to it and recommended that pink cover it becky bain of idolator said that song could have been a track for pink or avril lavigne two common artists who work with martin bain said song fit in with raise your glass and better yet kesha s we r who we r christopher rosen of movieline said song had total home run potential and that it sounds like a blend of pink katy perry avril lavigne early mandy moore and kidz bop and that s a good thing on point that song sounds like a cover itself rosen asked who wants to listen to an original song on a television show that relies on covers unless it sounds like a cover itself upon first listen kirsten coachman of seattle post intelligencer said that she was semi horrified at song but since it was a max martin produced track she gave it another chance and commented it s definitely a max martin song it has a good beat and cheesy yet catchy lyrics however coachman said that song should have been sung by mark salling puck and jenna ushkowitz tina rather than monteith and michele coachman liked fact that this song and get it right fit in with episode and wrote i think both songs are pretty good anthems and hopefully they do speak to audience she stated however that she probably won t be singing along to them in my car anytime soon in an album review giving glee music vol 5 a total of two out of five stars andrew leahey of allmusic said that new glee songs aren t good enough to make much of a difference brett berk of vanity fair gave song four stars for its lyrics but said that tune sucked chart performance on week ending march 26 2011 loser like me debuted at number six on us billboard
