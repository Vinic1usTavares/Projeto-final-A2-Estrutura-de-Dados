out of depths i call lord to you is a church cantata by german composer johann sebastian bach it was composed in either 1707 or 1708 which makes it one of bach s earliest cantatas some sources suggest that it could be his earliest surviving work in this form but current thinking is that there are one or two earlier examples cantata was commissioned by minister of one of churches in muhlhausen city where bach worked at time it was possibly written for a special occasion text is based on luther s german version of psalm 130 and also incorporates words of a chorale bach s music integrates melodies from chorale into larger structures bach also shows his interest in counterpoint something which was characteristic of him throughout his career history and words a note on autograph score of cantata indicates that work was commissioned by georg christian eilmar minister of marienkirche st mary s church in muhlhausen this allows work to be dated to 1707 08 which is period when bach was living in muhlhausen bach was employed as organist at city s other main church divi blasii he was also involved to some extent with performances at marienkirche where civic ceremonies were held one service there which bach would have attended was that for city council s inauguration in 1708 during which his cantata gott ist mein konig bwv 71 had its premiere he may have had a closer personal relationship with eilmar than with minister of his own church eilmar was godfather to his daughter catharina dorothea born 1708 has been described as possibly bach s first surviving cantata for it to be first it has to be assumed not only that it predates other cantatas written in muhlhausen we know that he wrote at least one other there but also that there is not a surviving cantata from his previous post at arnstadt it seems likely that bach was composing choral music at arnstadt although bach was only 22 when he took up appointment at muhlhausen performance of a work of his own composition appears to have been part of selection process recent scholarship suggests that another surviving cantata nach dir herr verlanget mich bwv 150 could have been composed at arnstadt libretto is based on psalm 130 one of penitential psalms incipit of psalm aus der tiefen rufe ich herr zu dir gives cantata its name originally a hebrew text incipit has variants in translation while is rendered out of depths in english king james version a closer translation of german text used by bach would be deep rather than depths anonymous librettist possibly eilmar includes in two of movements verses from a lutheran hymn by bartholomaus hymn is also penitential bach later used it as basis for cantata where words form a counterpart to tax collector s prayer in parable of pharisee and publican gospel reading for eleventh sunday after trinity in his bach cantata pilgrimage sir john eliot gardiner performed and recorded work with cantatas for fifth sunday after trinity this was partly for a practical reason paucity of surviving cantatas for that particular sunday see search tool dedicated to live recordings made during bach cantata pilgrimage under sdg label but it is not known for sure when in liturgical year bach performed it and there has been speculation that it was written for a special occasion information based on durr die kantaten and oxford composer companion j s bach publication bach s ability as a composer was recognised by city council of muhlhausen who paid for printing of cantata gott ist mein konig bwv 71 bach johann sebastian kirchen als bey in

composer s lifetime was first published in 1881 as part of bach gesellschaft ausgabe first complete edition of bach s works editor was wilhelm rust who edited many volumes for bach gesellschaft at time of publication of this volume he held position of thomaskantor in leipzig scoring and structure singers bach scored work for tenor and bass soloists and a four part choir bach gives his soloists an arioso and an aria as in other early cantatas there are no recitatives bach later came more under influence of italian music combining recitatives and arias bach did not give a direct indication of how many singers he envisaged in choir cantata can be performed with only four singers as in recording by joshua rifkin who is well known in world of bach performance for his one voice to a part approach however most recordings feature a choir with multiple voices to a part another choice to be made is whether to use women singers bach s original singers were probably all male most recordings of cantata however feature mixed choirs an exception is version conducted by nikolaus harnoncourt which deploys boys voices as top lines of choir recorded in 1981 this version is part of a complete set of cantatas a joint project with gustav leonhardt which mainly uses male voices instruments singers are accompanied by an instrumental group consisting of oboe bassoon violin two violas and basso continuo as in case of singers question arises as to whether bach used one or more players per part oboe and violin are given some important solos suggesting that there may well have been only one of each ton koopman for example uses one oboist and one violinist in his recording role of violas is more to provide accompaniment filling in harmonies and sometimes doubling vocal lines bassoon sometimes supports continuo section doubling its bass line and sometimes plays an independent line musical forms thumb upright alt disputed portrait of young bach with brown curled hair dressed festively portrait of young bach disputed bach used some musical forms which reappear in later cantatas for example two of choral movements have a fugue a style of composition in which bach excelled also two movements for soloists are developed as a type of chorale fantasia with soloist singing psalm text and an upper voice singing chorale in long notes as a cantus firmus craig smith called chorale settings a window on future however he criticised structure of cantata saying that it offers evidence that at this stage in his career composer had difficulty with large forms on other hand musicologist julian mincham regards piece as being different from later cantatas rather than inferior to them structure and scoring bach structured cantata in five movements three choral movements interspersed by an arioso and an aria in both solo movements a chorale stanza sung simultaneously by soprano intensifies psalm text he scored it for two soloist tenor and bass a four part choir and a
