thematically yankovic described record as not a whole lot different than other albums he had recorded calling process even a bit formulaic originals on april 22 1986 yankovic began recording three new original songs for his next album don t wear those shoes one of those days and dog eat dog although don t wear those shoes is an original composition yankovic admitted that intro was inspired by style of kinks lyrically song is a plea by singer to his wife not to not wear certain shoes which he cannot stand one of those days is a song detailing horrible things as if they were everyday annoyances each horrible thing escalates up to global annihilation while more mundane annoyances pop up at different times thumb upright left yankovic s song dog eat dog served as a style parody of talking heads pictured 250px dog eat dog is a style parody of talking heads described as a tongue in cheek look at office life song was inspired by yankovic s past experience of working in mailroom and traffic department at westwood one radio station he noted at first i thought job was kinda cool that i had a phone and a desk and a little cubicle to call my own but after a while i felt like my soul had been sucked out of me song features a line directly parodying talking heads song once in a lifetime sometimes i tell myself this is not my beautiful stapler sometimes i tell myself this is not my beautiful chair this mirrors a similar line in talking heads song you may tell yourself this is not my beautiful house you may tell yourself this is not my beautiful wife on april 23 yankovic recorded christmas at ground zero song a cheery little tune about death destruction and end of world was result of scotti brothers records insistence that yankovic release a christmas record after yankovic presented song to his label they relented because it was a little different from what they were expecting after song s release some radio stations banned record a move that yankovic attributes to most people not wanting to hear about nuclear annihilation during holiday season following september 11 attacks when general term ground zero was co opted as a proper name for world trade center site where two of those attacks took place disturbing lyrics caused this song to be banned largely from radio retrieved april 24 2013 yankovic wanted song to receive a video but due to budget reasons his label did not agree yankovic however directed one himself which was mostly made up of stock footage with a live action finale that was filmed in a run down part of bronx new york that looked like a bomb had fallen on it final original that was recorded was good enough for now a country music pastiche about how singer s lover who while not best will do for now parodies and polka thumb upright left album s lead parody living with a hernia is a parody of james brown s pictured single living in america 250px on august 4 yankovic began recording parodies starting with living with a hernia song a spoof of living in america by james brown which was also theme to 1985 film rocky iv is about hernias when it came time to pick a song to parody as lead single for polka party scotti brothers records had some very strong ideas and wished to have yankovic parody a musician who was signed on same label after living in america became a hit record label insisted that yankovic parody song to which yankovic obliged rabin and yankovic p 77 in order to accurately write song yankovic researched various types of hernias yankovic noted that it was a real thrill to do james brown i m a total non dancer never went to any dances in high school but if i analytically dissect a dance routine i can figure it out a choreographer named chester whitmore was hired to accurately create dance scenes featured in video which was shot on concert set actually used in movie rocky iv second parody recorded was addicted to spuds a pastiche of addicted to love by robert palmer about a man s obsession for potatoes and potato based dishes a music video for song was never made because there was a strict budget for videos for album and yankovic felt that video would be one joke and not really worth its own video a parody of palmer s video however was later inserted into al s uhf video on august 5 yankovic recorded here s johnny a parody of who s johnny by el debarge song a loving ode to tonight show starring johnny carson announcer ed mcmahon features john roarke of television series fridays fame doing an impression of mcmahon s voice according to yankovic peter wolf man who wrote who s johnny enjoyed parody idea so much that he personally brought into studio floppy disc that contained song s programmed synthesizer parts final parody recorded for album was toothless people a play on mick jagger s ruthless people which was recorded on august 29 1986 song about elderly people who are missing their teeth was written after yankovic heard it would be theme to 1986 film ruthless people assuming song would be a hit yankovic requested and received permission from jagger to record a parody version jagger s song however was never a hit but because jagger had approved parody he decided failing to produce it would be an insult to artist album s polka medley titular polka party was recorded on same day as here s johnny this was yankovic s third polka medley and his only medley to bear same name as an album like his other medleys song is a conglomeration of then popular songs in music reception promotion to promote album s release scotti brothers records purchased full page ads in billboard magazine that advertised release as yankovic s biggest bash yet unlike previous albums yankovic did not undertake a tour to promote polka party instead he opened for american rock band monkees yankovic later joked that monkees merely closed for him yankovic explained that while it was a fun tour and that crowds were very enthusiastic tension between monkees was obvious on his website he wrote that while band members are all terrific people individually they didn t seem to get along all that great when they weren t on stage critical response polka party received mixed to negative reviews from critics allmusic reviewer eugene chadbourne gave album three stars and wrote that just about anyone could feel let down by this album chadbourne was largely critical of parody choices noting that many of original versions would be forgotten in fifteen years christopher thelen from daily vault gave polka party an f and described it as an album that seemed like it could well have been last call for yankovic thelen heavily criticized record writing that both parodies and originals were not good and that yankovic was going through motions rolling stone awarded album three and a half stars tying it with 1992 album off deep end and 1999 release running with scissors as yankovic s best rated album although it was not a critical success album was nominated for a grammy award for best comedy recording in 1987 but lost to bill cosby s those of you with or without children you ll understand despite album s lackluster reception many of songs on album such as dog eat dog addicted to spuds and christmas at ground zero went on to become fan favorites and live staples two of album s tracks living with a hernia and addicted to spuds appeared on yankovic s first greatest hits album 1988 christmas at ground zero appeared on second volume 1994 in addition 1994 box set permanent record al in box contained five of album s songs addicted to spuds dog eat dog here s johnny living with a
