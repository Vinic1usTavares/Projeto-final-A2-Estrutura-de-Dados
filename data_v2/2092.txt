on tracks such as slow life over a period of years group visit studio almost every day and play best parts on any of our records i think come out of a couple of us being in our little room in cardiff at three in morning just out and being ecstatic in music according to guitarist huw bunford track had working title miami vice as it featured a drum roll similar to one used in theme tune to 80 s television show of same name band decided not to keep this name as they were keen to avoid links with a particular place bunford gave example of song s use on a travel documentary about miami as something group did not want to see some promotional copies of phantom power featured slow life as first track although it eventually appeared as last track on officially released version of album

forgettable stating that while slow life slides perfectly off phantom power other two tracks are weak motherfokker is a vulgar pez candy up nose with shoddy guest rapping from goldie lookin chain and lost control is barely more than a remix of phantom power track out of control popmatters also dismissed motherfokker and lost control as inessential b sides and during their review of 2007 s hey venus nme suggested that motherfokker is best suppressed slow life itself received generally positive reviews pitchfork media called it a stunning closer to phantom power while popmatters described song as kind of schizophrenic fun we ve come to expect from band but less showy and eager to please as they control themselves enough to make jarring contradicting styles much easier to digest stylus
