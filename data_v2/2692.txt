succumbs to eruption of still active volcano as duo flees from city final scene depicts indiana kissing sophia on top of escape submarine to comfort himself for lack of evidence for their discovery development at time a sequel to indiana jones and last crusade graphic adventure was decided most of staff of lucasfilm games was occupied with other projects such as secret of monkey island and dig designer hal barwood had only created two computer games on his own before but was put in charge of project because of his experience as a producer and writer of feature films company originally wanted him to create a game based on indiana jones and monkey king garden of life a rejected script written by chris columbus for third movie that would have seen indiana looking for chinese artifacts in africa however after reading script barwood decided that idea was substandard and requested to create an original story for game instead along with co worker noah falstein he visited library of george lucas workplace skywalker ranch to look for possible plot devices they eventually decided upon atlantis when they looked at a diagram in some cheap coffee table book on world s unsolved mysteries which depicted city as built in three concentric circles falstein and barwood originally considered mythical sword excalibur as story s plot device but idea was scrapped because it wouldn t have easily given indiana jones a reason to go anywhere except england https www reddit com r comments im noah falstein ive been making games writing story involved extensive research on a plethora of pseudo scientific books inspiration for mythology in game such as description of city and appearance of metal orichalcum was primarily drawn from plato s dialogues timaeus and critias and from ignatius loyola donnelly s book atlantis antediluvian world that revived interest in myth during nineteenth century magical properties of orichalcum and atlantean technology depicted in game were partly adopted from russian spiritualist helena blavatsky s publications on force giant colossus producing gods was based on a power concentrating device called firestone formerly described by american psychic edgar cayce once barwood and falstein completed rough outline of story barwood wrote actual script and team began to conceive puzzles and to design environments atlantean artifacts and architecture devised by lead artist william eaken were made to resemble those of minoan civilization while game in turn implies that minoans were inspired by atlantis barwood intended for atlantean art to have an alien feel to it with machines seemingly operating on as yet unknown physics rather than on magic backgrounds were first pencil sketched given a layer of basic color and then converted and touched up with 256 colors mostly they were mouse drawn with deluxe paint though roughly ten percent were paintings scanned at end of development cycle as a consequence of regular design changes images often had to be revised by artists character animations were fully rotoscoped with video footage of steve purcell for indiana s and collette michaud for sophia s motions main art team that consisted of eaken james dollar and avril harrison was sometimes consulted by barwood to help out with more graphical puzzles in game such as a broken robot in atlantis addition of three different paths was suggested by falstein and added about six more months of development time mainly because of all extra dialogue that had to be implemented for interaction between indiana and sophia altogether game took around two years to finish starting in early 1990 and lasting up to floppy disk release in june 1992 only aspect barwood was not involved in at all was production of voices for enhanced talkie edition released on cd rom in may 1993 which was instead handled by barra voice over recordings for approximately 8000 lines of dialogue took about four weeks and were done with actors from american federation of television and radio artists harrison ford was not available to record indiana jones s voice so a substitute actor doug lee was used talkie version was later included as an extra game mode in wii version of 2009 action game indiana jones and staff of kings and distributed via digital content delivery software steam as a port for windows xp windows vista and mac os x that same year versions on wii and available on steam have improved midi versions of soundtrack along with both voices and text package illustration for fate of atlantis was inspired by indiana jones movie posters of drew struzan it was drawn by eaken within three days following disagreements with marketing department and an external art director over which concept to use clint bajakian peter mcconnell and michael land created soundtrack for game arranging john williams main theme raiders march for a variety of compositions dos version uses sequenced music played back by either an internal speaker fm synthesis of an or sound blaster sound card or sample based synthesis of a roland mt 32 sound module during development of game william messner and dan barry wrote a dark horse comics series based on barwood s and falstein s story then titled indiana jones and keys to atlantis in an interview eaken mentioned hour long meetings of development team trying to come up with a better title than fate of atlantis though staff members could never think of one and always ended up with names such as indiana jones does atlantis final title was barwood s idea who first had to convince company s management and marketing team not to simply call game indy s next adventure lucasarts developed a port of enhanced edition for sega cd but release was eventually canceled because secret of monkey island failed to be much of a commercial success on platform arcade style game indiana jones and fate of atlantis action game designed by attention to detail was released almost simultaneously with its adventure counterpart and loosely follows its plot reception according to rogue leaders story of lucasarts fate of atlantis was a commercial hit noah falstein reported that it was lucasarts all time most successful adventure title by 2009 at which point its lifetime sales had surpassed 1 million units he recalled that game s player audience was 30 female a higher figure than most lucasarts titles had achieved before its release reviewers from game informer computer game review games magazine and game players magazine named fate of atlantis best adventure game of year and it was later labeled a classic by ign patricia hartley and kirk lesser of dragon called it terrific and thought provoking they lauded team wits fists system for increasing game s replay value but believed that team option was best reviewers summarized it as a must buy lim choon wee of new straits times praised game s graphics and arcade style sequences about former he wrote attention to detail is excellent with great colours and brilliant sprite animation he echoed hartley s and lesser s opinion that team was best mode of game wee ended his review by calling fate of atlantis a brilliant game even beating secret of monkey island 2 charles ardai of computer gaming world in september 1992 praised its setting for containing right combination of gravity silliness genuine scholarship and mystical mumbo jumbo and called it a strong enough storyline to hold its own next to any of indy films he highly praised game s team wits fists system about which he wrote never before has a game paid this much attention to what player wants he also enjoyed its graphics and varied locales although he cited pixelated character sprites and lack of voice acting as low points ardai summarized fate of atlantis as an exuberant funny well crafted and clever game that bettered its predecessor last crusade also praised game stating that it is not only best adventure ever done by lucasarts but is also probably nicest graphic adventure ever just about perfect in all areas reviewer wrote atlantis shines in 256 colors and that musicians and sound effects specialists deserve a tip of hat stating that audio completes effect of playing a movie he described puzzles as quite creative and certainly fair and liked multiple solutions reviewer concluded that game was a must buy for all adventurers and gets my vote for best quest of year tied with ultima underworld both of which redefine state of art in their respective genres following year ardai stated that unlike many recent cd rom upgrades which have been embarrassing and amateurish cd rom version has stamp of quality all over it with added dialogue and sound effects like taking a silent film and turning it into a talkie it s hard to go back to reading text off a monitor after experiencing a game like this he concluded that lucasarts has done an impeccable job a must see in april 1994 magazine said that disk version of atlantis is fun but in many ways it s just another adventure game but speech made cd version a fine approximation of an indiana jones film with you as main character concluding if you want a good reason to purchase a cd rom look no further andy of amiga format wrote puzzles are very well thought out with some exquisite subtle elements that give you a real kick when you solve them he noted that game is littered with elements that are genuinely funny his sole complaint was about game s linearity compared to monkey island 2 but he finished by saying it s a minor point anyway and it shouldn t put you off buying what is one of best amiga adventures ever in 2008 retro gamer magazine praised it as a masterful piece of storytelling and a spellbinding adventure in 1992 computer gaming world named fate of atlantis as one of year s four best adventure games it was nominated for an award at 1993 game developers conference in 1994 pc gamer us named cd rom version of fate of atlantis as 38th best computer game ever

achievement for lucasarts this genre s greatest exponent and it remains required playing for adventurers everywhere legacy after release of game a story for a supposed successor in adventure genre was conceived by joe pinney hal barwood bill stoneham and aric wilmunder titled indiana jones and iron phoenix it was set after world war ii and featured nazis seeking refuge in bolivia trying to resurrect adolf hitler with philosophers stone game was in development for 15 months before it was showcased at european computer trade show however when german coordinators discovered how extensively game dealt with neo nazism they informed lucasarts about difficulty of marketing game in their country as germany was an important overseas market for adventure games lucasarts feared that lower revenues would not recoup development costs and subsequently canceled game plot was later adapted into a four part dark horse comics series by lee marrs published monthly from december 1994 to march 1995 in an interview barwood commented that development team should have thought about story more thoroughly beforehand calling it insensitive and not regretting cancellation of title another follow up game called indiana jones and spear of destiny was planned which revolved around spear of longinus development was outsourced to a small studio but eventually stopped as lucasarts did not have experience with supervision of external teams elaine lee loosely reworked story into another four part comic book series released from april to july 1995 see also igor objective uikokahonia references
