catholic recusants and educated by jesuits in flanders his older brother became a franciscan and his two younger brothers were ordained as catholic priests rookwood became a horse breeder he married catholic elizabeth tyrwhitt and had at least two sons he was enlisted into plot in september 1605 by robert catesby a religious zealot whose impatience with james treatment of english catholics had grown so severe that he conspired to blow up house of lords with gunpowder killing king and much of protestant hierarchy with other conspirators he had recruited catesby also planned to incite a rebellion in midlands during which james s nine year old daughter princess elizabeth would be captured and installed as titular queen rookwood s stable of fine horses was essential for uprising to succeed explosion was planned to coincide with state opening of parliament on 5 november 1605 but man left in charge of gunpowder stored beneath house of lords guy fawkes was discovered there and arrested rookwood fled city and informed catesby and others of plan s failure together remaining conspirators rode to holbeche house in staffordshire where on 8 november they were attacked by pursuing sheriff of worcester and his men catesby was killed but rookwood survived and was imprisoned in tower of london rookwood and survivors were arraigned on 27 january 1606 in westminster hall pleading not guilty he claimed to have loved catesby above any worldly man he was convicted his request for mercy was ignored and he was hanged drawn and quartered on 31 january in old palace yard at westminster early life born sometime about 1578 ambrose rookwood was second of four sons born to robert rookwood and his second wife dorothy drury daughter of sir william drury and elizabeth during his first marriage to bridget kemp robert had sired four sons but all predeceased their father rookwood family had lived at in suffolk for 300 years wealthy and staunch catholics authorities viewed them as trouble makers ambrose s papist cousin edward had spent ten years in prison for his faith but in 1578 he entertained queen elizabeth i at his home euston hall it was an expensive visit that made a serious dent in family s finances and which neutered their influence for years thereafter ambrose s parents had been imprisoned for their recusancy and he was indicted on same charge in february 1605 he was apparently happy to advertise his faith in summer of 1605 he commissioned a london cutler john craddock to place a spanish blade into a sword hilt engraved with story of passion of christ as such weapons were generally worn in public it was a potentially dangerous statement of faith ambrose and two of his brothers robert and christopher were educated by jesuits at saint omer then in flanders both brothers became priests ambrose s elder brother henry became a franciscan and his half sisters dorothea and susanna became nuns according to jesuit oswald tesimond rookwood was well built and handsome if somewhat short which he compensated for by his taste in extravagant clothing in author antonia fraser s opinion this affectation was somewhat inappropriate at a time when clothes were supposed to denote rank rather than money marriage inheritance and first treason in or shortly before 1599 he married elizabeth daughter of william tyrwhitt of kettleby in lincolnshire and his wife elizabeth daughter of sir peter of staveley in derbyshire tyrwhitts were another prominent roman catholic family and his wife was possibly a first cousin to his future fellow conspirator robert keyes couple had two sons robert and henry on his father s death in 1600 he inherited coldham hall which subsequently became a refuge for priests following year he joined earl of essex s abortive rebellion against government for which he was captured and held at newgate prison enlisted in august 1605 rookwood joined jesuits henry garnet and john gerard on a pilgrimage to shrine of st winefride s well in holywell late in september he was approached by robert catesby thomas wintour and john wright and invited to join what became known as gunpowder plot english catholics had hoped that persecution of their faith would end when james i came to throne as his attitude appeared to be moderate even tolerant towards catholics in catesby s view james had reneged on his promises he therefore planned to kill king by blowing up house of lords with gunpowder and then inciting a popular revolt to install james s daughter elizabeth as titular queen to this end he had already helped enlist nine catholics into conspiracy but was running out of money and needed to recruit more men rookwood was a horse breeder and his stable of fine mounts at coldham hall was needed for midlands uprising he had been asked to supply them with gunpowder about a year earlier under pretence that it was for william stanley s regiment in flanders no longer an illegal operation due to recent treaty of london but otherwise provided no funds for conspiracy although unverifiable his wife s relationship to robert keyes may mean that rookwood already suspected that something was being planned he was at first concerned for welfare of catholic lords who would be present at explosion but his compunction was alleviated when catesby promised him that they would be tricked out of attending parliament that day any lingering doubts rookwood had were removed by catesby s lie that jesuits had given scheme their approval rookwood had stayed with at huddington court and that month with catholic at hall but at s behest he rented clopton house near stratford and moved there after michaelmas he took with him several catholic religious symbols such as chalices crucifixes vestments latin books and praying beads these were concealed in a cellar built by jesuit nicholas owen left thumb coldham hall toward end of october he joined keyes at his lodgings in london a few days before planned explosion he changed his mind about sword he had ordered john craddock to make and had cutler replace grip with a gold one modified sword which in total probably cost rookwood more than ps20 was delivered on 4 november discovery existence of plot had been revealed in an anonymous letter delivered ten days earlier to william parker 4th baron monteagle warning him to keep away from parliament on evening of 4 november authorities made a search of house of lords where they discovered one of plotters guy fawkes guarding a hoard of explosives he was immediately arrested fawkes had posed as a servant of fellow plotter thomas percy and it was therefore percy s name that appeared on first arrest warrant issued by government news of fawkes s capture soon spread through london prompting christopher wright brother of john to rush to thomas wintour and tell what had happened wintour guessed that government was looking for percy and told wright to travel to percy s lodgings and bid him while wintour lingered christopher wright and percy left city followed by keyes and then rookwood a renowned horseman rookwood covered 30 miles in two hours on a single horse using various steeds he had left along route he passed keyes at highgate and then wright and percy at little brickhill near dunstable he caught up with catesby who had left previous day to prepare uprising and told him what had happened in london group which now included catesby his servant thomas bates both wright brothers percy and rookwood rode on to dunchurch while fawkes was being tortured on 6 november government began to round up anyone they thought might be involved rookwood s servants still in house their master had so hastily departed were questioned on same day his belongings at clopton including several incriminating catholic symbols were also taken and by time plotters had reached catesby s family home at ashby st ledgers rookwood s name was among list of suspects drawn up by lord chief justice fugitives continued on to dunchurch where they met recently recruited conspirator everard digby with his hunting party next day group stole horses from warwick castle although with his fine cortege rookwood avoided town they then collected stored weapons from norbrook and continued on to huddington party tried in vain to expand their number but were shunned no one was prepared to risk being labelled a traitor father garnet contacted at coughton court by bates wrote catesby a letter in which he implored group to stop their wicked actions before himself fleeing fugitive rookwood was proclaimed a wanted man on 7 november he went to confession and with rest of group took sacrament in fraser s opinion a sign that none of them thought they had long to live through pouring rain they rode to hewell grange helping themselves to further arms ammunition and money and finally reached holbeche house on border of staffordshire at about 10 00 pm that night tired from three days of riding they spread in front of fire some of now soaked gunpowder taken from hewell grange to dry out a stray spark landed on powder and rookwood catesby john grant and another man were caught up in resultant conflagration rookwood and catesby were described as reasonably well but grant was blinded several of conspirators disappeared into night but rookwood catesby wright brothers percy and grant stayed on by 11 00 am next day house was surrounded by 200 of sheriff of worcester s men in ensuing battle wintour was shot in shoulder john and christopher wright were killed catesby and percy were reportedly both killed by a single musket ball rookwood was also shot but survived and was quickly captured his belongings should by right have been seized by government but his elaborate sword apparently proved to be too great a temptation for sheriff s men and disappeared without trace rookwood and others were taken first to worcester and then to tower of london those conspirators still at large were rounded up shortly after trial and execution watched in secret by king and his family surviving conspirators were arraigned in westminster hall on 27 january 1606 some of prisoners hung their heads as if their hearts were full of doggedness while others were nonchalant all except digby pleaded not guilty defending himself rookwood claimed that he had been enlisted into plot through his friendship with catesby whom he loved above any worldly man he admitted that he could not expect mercy but asked for it anyway so as not to leave a blemish and blot unto all ages his pleas were in vain jury convicted him and he was sentenced to death three days later digby robert wintour john grant and thomas bates were hanged drawn and quartered at western end of st paul s churchyard following day rookwood thomas wintour robert keyes and guy fawkes were tied to wattled hurdles and dragged by horse from tower to old palace yard at westminster a longer route than had been suffered by their fellow conspirators rookwood had asked to be informed when he passed by his lodgings in strand so that he could open his eyes and see his wife waiting at window he shouted pray for me pray for me according to father gerard who was not then present elizabeth answered i will and be of good courage offer wholly to god i for my part do as freely restore thee to god as he gave thee unto me for rest of journey he kept his eyes closed in prayer thomas wintour was first that day to be hanged and then killed rookwood was next and made a short speech to assembled audience he was repentant asking god to bless king queen and their royal progeny but spoil ed all pottage with one filthy weed by beseeching god to make king a catholic he seems to have been left to hang for longer than others before suffering remainder of
