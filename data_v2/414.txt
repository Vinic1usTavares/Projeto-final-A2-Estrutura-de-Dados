blackmouth catshark galeus melastomus is a species of catshark and part of family scyliorhinidae common in northeastern atlantic ocean from iceland to senegal including mediterranean sea it is typically found over continental slope at depths of on or near muddy bottoms youngest sharks generally inhabit shallower water than older juveniles and adults this slim bodied species is characterized by black interior of its mouth a marbled pattern of pale edged brownish saddles or blotches along its back and tail and a prominent saw toothed crest of enlarged dermal denticles along upper edge of its caudal fin it reaches lengths of with sharks in atlantic growing larger than those in mediterranean slow swimming but active blackmouth catshark is a generalist that preys on a wide variety of crustaceans cephalopods and fishes its visual and electroreceptive systems are adept at tracking moving bioluminescent prey this species is oviparous with females producing batches of up to 13 egg cases throughout year because of its abundance blackmouth catshark forms a substantial part of bycatch of deepwater commercial fisheries across much of its range it has low economic value and is usually discarded though largest sharks may be marketed for meat and leather international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed this species under least concern as there is no indication that its numbers have declined despite fishing pressure taxonomy and phylogeny constantine samuel rafinesque briefly described blackmouth catshark in his 1810 di alcuni e nuove specie di e della sicilia con sopra i wherein he referenced distinctive black interior of its mouth from which specific epithet melastomus is derived no type specimen was designated this species may also be called black mouthed dogfish a 2005 phylogenetic analysis that included five galeus species based on mitochondrial and nuclear dna found that g melastomus forms a clade with g apart from clade of g g gracilis and g oldest documented blackmouth catshark fossils come from northern apennines and date to lower pliocene 5 3 3 6 ma distribution and habitat blackmouth catshark is widely distributed in northeastern atlantic ocean from southwestern iceland and trondheim norway southward to senegal including faroe islands british isles azores and northern portion of mid atlantic ridge it occurs throughout mediterranean sea save for northern waters of adriatic and aegean seas and is absent from black sea this species primarily inhabits continental slope at depths of however it has been documented from water as shallow as in norway and as deep as in eastern mediterranean depths at which it is most common vary between regions for example in bay of biscay off portugal in strait of sicily in catalan sea and in eastern mediterranean water temperature does not appear to be an important factor in determining distribution of this species found on or near bottom blackmouth catshark favors a muddy habitat there is little evidence for segregation by sex a number of studies in northern and western mediterranean have reported that adults occur deeper than juveniles other studies though have found no such pattern it is possible that areas such as waters off southern france offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages another explanation with some scientific support is that adults are most common at intermediate depths while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in deeper water if true age depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling description thumb upright 1 2 left early illustration of a blackmouth catshark showing its ornate dorsal color pattern reported maximum lengths attained by blackmouth catshark varies from for atlantic sharks and for mediterranean sharks a length record of may be dubious females attain a larger ultimate size than males maximum weight on record is this species has a slender firm body with a rather long pointed snout comprising roughly 6 9 of total length anterior rim of each nostril bears a large triangular flap which divides nostril into and excurrent openings eyes are horizontally oval and equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes protective third eyelids beneath each eye is a subtle ridge and behind is a small spiracle mouth forms a short wide arch and bears moderately long furrows around corners upper and lower jaws contain around 69 and 79 tooth rows respectively each tooth is small with a narrow central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side there are five pairs of gill slits with fifth pair over pectoral fin bases two dorsal fins are roughly equal in size and placed far back on body first originates behind midpoint of pelvic fin bases and second behind midpoint of anal fin base pectoral fins are large while pelvic fins are small and low with angular margins anal fin is much larger than either dorsal fin its base measures 13 18 of total length and greatly exceeds distance between pelvic and anal fins or between dorsal fins caudal peduncle is laterally compressed with end of anal fin very close to caudal fin caudal fin comprises around a quarter of total length upper lobe is low with a ventral notch near tip while lower lobe is indistinct skin is very thick and covered by well calcified dermal denticles there is a prominent row of enlarged denticles resembling saw teeth along upper edge of caudal fin body is grayish brown above with 15 18 dark rounded saddles blotches and or spots that run onto tail each marking is highlighted by a paler border underside is white as are tips of dorsal and caudal fins inside of mouth is black biology and ecology within its range blackmouth catshark is one of most abundant sharks over upper and middle continental slope it is nomadic in nature and may be found alone or in groups relatively slow this shark swims with strong eel like undulations of its body it often cruises just above sea floor perhaps taking advantage of ground effect a reduction in drag on a wing when close to ground to save energy it has also been seen resting motionless on bottom known predators of blackmouth catshark include kitefin shark dalatias licha and european flying squid parasites that have been documented from this species include tapeworm and protist eimeria feeding thumb blackmouth catshark has well developed eyes and ampullae of lorenzini for finding prey blackmouth catshark is an active generalist predator that feeds on both bottom dwelling and free swimming organisms its diet is dominated by decapods krill bony fishes including lanternfishes and moras and cephalopods most significant prey species generally reflect what is most available in environment for example shrimps and off southern france and prawns arcticus and robusta off iberian peninsula juveniles consume a greater amount and variety of crustaceans than adults including smaller types such as mysids and hyperiid amphipods adults favor relatively large fish prey and have been known to take other sharks and rays and smaller members of same species importance of cephalopod prey across ages differs between regions stomachs of some blackmouth catsharks have found to contain pieces of animals too large for a single shark to overwhelm suggesting that it may sometimes attack in groups scavenging has been infrequently documented including of human refuse when foraging blackmouth catshark swings its head from side to side to employ its senses more effectively it likely relies mainly on vision and electroreception to find food and less on smell as in most sharks its visual acuity is greatest along median horizontal plane lens and cone cells of its eyes are large allowing smaller or farther objects to be discerned from background rod cells of its eyes are most sensitive to wavelengths emitted by bioluminescence which is exhibited by most of organisms it hunts for electroreception blackmouth catshark has a high number of ampullae of lorenzini that are evenly arranged which enhances spatial resolution and is best suited for localizing fast moving prey life history unlike most members of its genus blackmouth catshark exhibits multiple oviparity in which more than one egg can mature within each oviduct simultaneously females may contain up to 13 developing eggs though 1 4 per oviduct is typical number of eggs laid annually per female has been estimated at between 60 and 100 increasing with female size only right ovary is functional in mature females egg case is vase shaped and bears a slight flange along lateral margins anterior end is squared off with a pair of stubby coiled horns at corners while posterior end is rounded surface of case is somewhat translucent smooth and glossy case is a golden brown color when first laid and becomes dark brown in sea water egg cases produced by atlantic sharks measure long and across those produced by mediterranean sharks tend to be smaller at long and across larger females produce slightly larger egg cases mating and egg laying proceeds year round reproductive activity is highest in winter and summer though not all studies have found such a seasonal pattern eggs are deposited on muddy substrates in relatively shallow water maturation size varies between geographical regions and is generally larger in atlantic than in mediterranean lengths at maturity for males and females have been variously reported from and respectively in atlantic and from and respectively in mediterranean human interactions harmless to humans and of little economic value blackmouth catshark is caught incidentally in large numbers by commercial bottom trawl and longline fisheries in particular it is among most commonly sharks in trawls targeting deepwater lobsters and shrimps nephrops norvegicus and operating off portugal and in mediterranean most captured sharks are discarded probably with heavy mortality some fisheries such as those off portugal and italy retain and utilize a small subset of largest individuals for human consumption fresh or dried and salted and for leather fishing fleet of viareggio tuscany reported landing in 2005 in northeastern atlantic this shark is being increasingly targeted by fishers following decline of other deepwater shark species off corsica sicily and southern portugal and in ionian southern adriatic and aegean seas most of blackmouth catsharks captured are immature suggesting there has been a negative impact of fishing pressure however species remains extremely abundant in a number of areas and survey and fishery data have not shown any evidence of overall population decline wide range of depths it occupies likely afford it some protection against fishing particularly given a 2005 ban on trawling deeper than in mediterranean therefore international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed blackmouth catshark under least concern in waters of european commission fishing for this species is managed as part of total allowable catch tac for deepwater sharks references blackmouth catshark
