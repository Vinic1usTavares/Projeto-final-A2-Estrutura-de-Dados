cockroaches are insects of order blattodea which also includes termites about 30 cockroach species out of 4 600 are associated with human habitats about four species are well known as pests cockroaches are an ancient group dating back at least as far as carboniferous period some 320 million years ago those early ancestors however lacked internal ovipositors of modern roaches cockroaches are somewhat generalized insects without special adaptations like sucking mouthparts of aphids and other true bugs they have chewing mouthparts and are likely among most primitive of living neopteran insects they are common and hardy insects and can tolerate a wide range of environments from arctic cold to tropical heat tropical cockroaches are often much bigger than temperate species and contrary to popular belief extinct cockroach relatives and roachoids such as carboniferous and permian were not as large as biggest modern species some species such as gregarious german cockroach have an elaborate social structure involving common shelter social dependence information transfer and kin recognition cockroaches have appeared in human culture since classical antiquity they are popularly depicted as dirty pests though great majority of species are inoffensive and live in a wide range of habitats around world taxonomy and evolution thumb left a 40 to 50 million year old cockroach in baltic amber eocene cockroaches are members of order blattodea which includes termites a group of insects once thought to be separate from cockroaches currently 4 600 species and over 460 genera are described worldwide name cockroach comes from spanish word for cockroach cucaracha transformed by 1620s english folk etymology into cock and roach scientific name derives from latin blatta an insect that shuns light which in classical latin was applied to not only cockroaches but also mantids historically name was used largely interchangeably with name blattodea but whilst former name was used to refer to true cockroaches exclusively latter also includes termites current catalogue of world cockroach species uses name blattodea for group another name is also sometimes used earliest cockroach like fossils or are from carboniferous period 320 million years ago as are fossil nymphs since 19th century scientists believed that cockroaches were an ancient group of insects that had a devonian origin according to one hypothesis fossil roachoids that lived during that time differ from modern cockroaches in having long external ovipositors and are ancestors of mantises as well as modern as body hind wings and mouthparts are not preserved in fossils frequently relationship of these roachoids and modern cockroaches remains disputed first fossils of modern cockroaches with internal ovipositors appeared in early cretaceous a recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that cockroaches originated at least in jurassic evolutionary relationships of blattodea cockroaches and termites shown in cladogram are based on beccaloni inward 2007 cockroach families and are not shown but are placed within superfamily cockroach families and were previously known as and termites were previously regarded as a separate order isoptera to cockroaches however recent genetic evidence strongly suggests that they evolved directly from true cockroaches and many authors now place them as an epifamily of blattodea this evidence supported a hypothesis suggested in 1934 that termites are closely related to wood eating cockroaches genus cryptocercus this hypothesis was originally based on similarity of symbiotic gut flagellates in termites regarded as living fossils and wood eating cockroaches additional evidence emerged when f a mckittrick 1965 noted similar morphological characteristics between some termites and cockroach nymphs similarities among these cockroaches and termites have led some scientists to reclassify termites as a single family termitidae within order blattodea other scientists have taken a more conservative approach proposing to retain termites as an epifamily within order such measure preserves classification of termites at family level and below description thumb upright left domino cockroach normally found in india most species of cockroach are about size of a thumbnail but several species are bigger world s heaviest cockroach is australian giant burrowing cockroach rhinoceros which can reach in length and weigh more than comparable in size is central american giant cockroach giganteus which grows to a similar length longest cockroach species is megaloblatta longipennis which can reach in length and across a central and south american species megaloblatta has largest wingspan of up to thumb upright head of periplaneta americana cockroaches are generalized insects with few special adaptations and may be among most primitive living neopteran insects they have a relatively small head and a broad flattened body and most species are reddish brown to dark brown they have large compound eyes two ocelli and long flexible antennae mouthparts are on underside of head and include generalized chewing mandibles salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors body is divided into a thorax of three segments and a ten segmented abdomen external surface has a tough exoskeleton which contains calcium carbonate and protects inner organs and provides attachment to muscles it is coated with wax to repel water wings are attached to second and third thoracic segments tegmina or first pair of wings are tough and protective lying as a shield on top of membranous hind wings which are used in flight all four wings have branching longitudinal veins and multiple cross veins three pairs of legs are sturdy with large coxae and five claws each they are attached to each of three thoracic segments front legs are shortest and hind legs longest providing main propulsive power when insect runs spines on legs were earlier considered to be sensory but observations of insect s gait on sand and wire meshes have demonstrated that they help in locomotion on difficult terrain structures have been used as inspiration for robotic legs abdomen has ten segments each with a pair of spiracles for respiration segment ten bears a pair of cerci a pair of anal styles anus and external genitalia males have an aedeagus through which they secrete sperm during copulation and females have for storing sperm and an ovipositor through which ootheca is laid distribution and habitat cockroaches are abundant throughout world and live in a wide range of environments especially in tropics and subtropics cockroaches can withstand extremely cold temperatures allowing them to live in arctic some species are capable of surviving temperatures of 188 degf 122 degc by manufacturing an antifreeze made out of glycerol in north america 50 species separated into five families are found throughout continent 450 species are found in australia only about four widespread species are commonly regarded as pests cockroaches occupy a wide range of habitats many live in leaf litter among stems of matted vegetation in rotting wood in holes in stumps in cavities under bark under log piles and among debris some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive without access to water sources others are aquatic living near surface of water bodies including bromeliad phytotelmata and diving to forage for food most of these respire by piercing water surface with tip of abdomen which acts as a snorkel but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge others live in forest canopy where they may be one of main types of invertebrate present here they may hide during day in crevices among dead leaves in bird and insect nests or among epiphytes emerging at night to feed behavior thumb upright a cockroach soon after ecdysis cockroaches are social insects a large number of species are either gregarious or inclined to aggregate and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care it used to be thought that cockroaches aggregated because they were reacting to environmental cues but it is now believed that pheromones are involved in these behaviors some species secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved while others use glands located on their mandibles pheromones produced by cuticle may enable cockroaches to distinguish between different populations of cockroach by odor behaviors involved have been studied in only a few species but german cockroaches leave fecal trails with an odor gradient other cockroaches follow such trails to discover sources of food and water and where other cockroaches are hiding thus cockroaches have emergent behavior in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactions daily rhythms may also be regulated by a complex set of hormonal controls of which only a small subset have been understood in 2005 role of one of these proteins pigment dispersing factor pdf was isolated and found to be a key mediator in circadian rhythms of cockroach pest species adapt readily to a variety of environments but prefer warm conditions found within buildings many tropical species prefer even warmer environments cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and run away when exposed to light an exception to this is asian cockroach which flies mostly at night but is attracted to brightly lit surfaces and pale colors collective decision making gregarious cockroaches display collective decision making when choosing food sources when a sufficient number of individuals a quorum exploits a food source this signals to newcomer cockroaches that they should stay there longer rather than leave for elsewhere other mathematical models have been developed to explain aggregation dynamics and conspecific recognition cooperation and competition are balanced in cockroach group decision making behavior cockroaches appear to use just two pieces of information to decide where to go namely how dark it is and how many other cockroaches there are a study used specially scented roach sized robots that appear to roaches as real to demonstrate that once there are enough insects in a place to form a critical mass roaches accepted collective decision on where to hide even if this was an unusually lit place social behavior when reared in isolation german cockroaches show behavior that is different from behavior when reared in a group in one study isolated cockroaches were less likely to leave their shelters and explore spent less time eating interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them and took longer to recognize receptive females because these changes occurred in many contexts authors suggested them as constituting a behavioral syndrome these effects might have been due either to reduced metabolic and developmental rates in isolated individuals or fact that isolated individuals hadn t had a training period to learn about what others were like via their antennae individual american cockroaches appear to have consistently different personalities regarding how they seek shelter in addition group personality is not simply sum of individual choices but reflects conformity and collective decision making gregarious german and american cockroaches have elaborate social structure chemical signalling and social herd characteristics and his fellow researchers stated sounds some species make a hissing noise while other cockroaches make a chirping noise madagascar hissing cockroach produces its sound through modified spiracles on fourth abdominal segment several different hisses are produced including disturbance sounds produced by adults and larger nymphs and aggressive courtship and copulatory sounds produced by adult males has a stridulatory organ between its thorax and abdomen but purpose of sound produced is unclear several australian species practice acoustic and vibration behavior as an aspect of courtship they have been observed producing hisses and whistles from air forced through spiracles furthermore in presence of a potential mate some cockroaches tap substrate in a rhythmic repetitive manner acoustic signals may be of greater prevalence amongst perching species particularly those that live on low vegetation in australia s tropics biology digestive tract cockroaches are generally omnivorous american cockroach periplaneta americana for example feeds on a great variety of foodstuffs including bread fruit leather starch in book bindings paper glue skin flakes hair dead insects and soiled clothing many species of cockroach harbor in their gut symbiotic protozoans and bacteria which are able to digest cellulose in many species these symbionts may be essential if insect is to utilize cellulose however some species secrete cellulase in their saliva and wood eating cockroach panesthia is able to survive indefinitely on a diet of crystallized cellulose while being free of micro organisms similarity of these symbionts in genus cryptocercus to those in termites are such that these cockroaches have been suggested to be more closely related to termites than to other cockroaches and current research strongly supports this hypothesis about their relationships all species studied so far carry obligate mutualistic bacterium with exception of nocticola australiensise an australian cave dwelling species without eyes pigment or wings which recent genetic studies indicate is a very primitive cockroach it had previously been thought that all five families of cockroach were descended from a common ancestor that was infected with b it may be that n australiensise subsequently lost its symbionts or alternatively this hypothesis will need to be re examined tracheae and breathing like other insects cockroaches breathe through a system of tubes called tracheae which are attached to openings called spiracles on all body segments when carbon dioxide level in insect rises high enough valves on spiracles open and carbon dioxide diffuses out and oxygen diffuses in tracheal system branches repeatedly finest bringing air directly to each cell allowing gaseous exchange to take place while cockroaches do not have lungs as do vertebrates and can continue to respire if their heads are removed in some very large species body musculature may contract rhythmically to forcibly move air in and out of spiracles this may be considered a form of breathing reproduction cockroaches use pheromones to attract mates and males practice courtship rituals such as posturing and stridulation like many insects cockroaches mate facing away from each other with their genitalia in contact and copulation can be prolonged a few species are known to be parthenogenetic reproducing without need for males female cockroaches are sometimes seen carrying egg cases on end of their abdomens german cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long thin eggs in a case called an ootheca she drops capsule prior to hatching though live births do occur in rare instances egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color eggs are hatched from combined pressure of hatchlings gulping air hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air becoming harder and darker within about four hours their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches development from eggs to adults takes three to four months cockroaches live up to a year and female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime in favorable conditions she can produce 300 to 400 offspring other species of cockroaches however can produce far more eggs in some cases a female needs to be impregnated only once to be able to lay eggs for rest of her life female usually attaches egg case to a substrate inserts it into a suitably protective crevice or carries it about until just before eggs hatch some species however are ovoviviparous keeping eggs inside their body with or without an egg case until they hatch at least one genus is fully viviparous cockroaches have incomplete metamorphosis meaning that nymphs are generally similar to adults except for undeveloped wings and genitalia development is generally slow and may take a few months to over a year adults are also long lived and have survived for as much as four years in laboratory hardiness cockroaches are among hardiest insects some species are capable of remaining active for a month without food and are able to survive on limited resources such as glue from back of postage stamps some can go without air for 45 minutes japanese cockroach periplaneta japonica nymphs which hibernate in cold winters survived twelve hours at 5 degc to 8 degc in laboratory experiments experiments on decapitated specimens of several species of cockroach found a variety of behavioral functionality remained including shock avoidance and escape behavior although many insects other than cockroaches are also able to survive decapitation and popular claims of longevity of headless cockroaches do not appear to be based on published research severed head is able to survive and wave its antennae for several hours or longer when refrigerated and given nutrients it is popularly suggested that cockroaches will inherit earth if humanity destroys itself in a nuclear war cockroaches do indeed have a much higher radiation resistance than vertebrates with lethal dose perhaps six to 15 times that for humans however they are not exceptionally radiation resistant compared to other insects such as fruit fly cockroach s ability to withstand radiation better than human beings can be explained through cell cycle cells are most vulnerable to effects of radiation when they are dividing a cockroach s cells divide only once each time it molts which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach since not all cockroaches would be molting at same time many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation although lingering radioactive fallout would still be harmful relationship with humans thumb cockroaches in research periplaneta americana in an electrophysiology experiment in research and education because of their ease of rearing and resilience cockroaches have been used as insect models in laboratory particularly in fields of neurobiology reproductive physiology and social behavior cockroach is a convenient insect to study as it is large and simple to raise in a laboratory environment this makes it suitable both for research and for school and undergraduate biology studies it can be used in experiments on topics such as learning sexual pheromones spatial orientation aggression activity rhythms and biological clock and behavioral ecology research conducted in 2014 suggests that humans fear cockroaches most even more than mosquitoes due to an evolutionary aversion as pests blattodea include some thirty species of cockroaches associated with humans these species are atypical of thousands of species in order they feed on human and pet food and can leave an offensive odor they can passively transport pathogenic microbes on their body surfaces particularly in environments such as hospitals cockroaches are linked with allergic reactions in humans one of proteins that trigger allergic reactions is these allergens are also linked with asthma about 60 of asthma patients in chicago are also sensitive to cockroach allergens studies similar to this have been done globally and all results are similar cockroaches can live for a few days up to a month without food so just because no cockroaches are visible in a home does not mean they are not there approximately 20 48 of homes with no visible sign of cockroaches have detectable cockroach allergens in dust cockroaches can burrow into human ears causing pain and hearing loss they may be removed with forceps possibly after first drowning with olive oil control many remedies have been tried in search for control of major pest species of cockroaches which are resilient and fast breeding household chemicals like sodium bicarbonate baking soda have been suggested without evidence for their effectiveness garden herbs including bay mint cucumber and garlic have been proposed as repellents poisoned bait containing or fipronil and boric acid powder is effective on adults baits with egg killers are also quite effective at reducing cockroach population alternatively insecticides containing deltamethrin or are very effective in singapore and malaysia taxi drivers use pandan leaves to repel cockroaches in their vehicles li j and ho s h pandan leaves pandanus as a natural cockroach repellent proceedings of 9th national undergraduate research opportunities programme 13 september 2003 few parasites and predators are effective for biological control of cockroaches parasitoidal wasps such as wasps sting nerve ganglia in cockroach s thorax temporarily paralyzing victim allowing wasp to deliver an incapacitating sting into cockroach s brain wasp clips antennae with its mandibles and drinks some hemolymph before dragging prey to a burrow where an egg rarely two is laid on it wasp larva feeds on subdued living cockroach another wasp which is considered a promising candidate for biological control is ensign wasp which attacks cockroach to lay a single egg inside ongoing research is still developing technologies allowing for mass rearing these wasps for application releases cockroaches can be trapped in a deep smooth walled jar baited with food inside placed so that cockroaches can reach opening for example with a ramp of card or twigs on outside an inch or so of water or stale beer by itself a cockroach attractant in jar can be used to drown any insects thus captured method works well with american cockroach but less so with german cockroach a study conducted by scientists at purdue university concluded that most common cockroaches in us australia and europe were able to develop a cross resistance to multiple types of pesticide this contradicted previous understanding that animals can develop resistance against one pesticide at a time scientists suggested that cockroaches will no longer be easily controlled using a diverse spectrum of chemical pesticides and that a mix of other means such as traps and better sanitation will need to be employed as food although considered disgusting in western culture cockroaches are

species but protecting their natural habitats may prevent their extinction in former soviet union cockroach populations have been declining at an alarming rate this may be exaggerated or phenomenon may be temporary or cyclic one species of roach is considered extinct in wild cultural depictions thumb madagascar hissing cockroaches kept as pets cockroaches were known and considered repellent but useful in medicines in classical times an insect named in greek silphe silphe has been identified with cockroach it is mentioned by aristotle saying that it sheds its skin it is described as foul smelling in aristophanes play peace called it a pest of book collections being page eating destructive black bodied in his virgil named cockroach one that avoids light pliny elder recorded use of

insectivorous pets a few cockroach species are raised as pets most commonly giant madagascar hissing cockroach whilst hissing cockroaches may be most commonly kept species there are many species that are kept by cockroach enthusiasts there is even a specialist society blattodea culture group bcg which was a thriving organisation for about 15 years although now appears to be dormant bcg provided a
