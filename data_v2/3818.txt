was first episode to air which was executive produced by mike scully sam simon pitched an episode for one of first seasons which saw homer getting a gun and nobody wanting him to have it episode concluded with homer foiling a robbery and stating that although guns bring destruction it worked for him however this episode was pitched by scully for either season seven or eight before being used for season nine this provided basic outline and john swartzwelder wrote script a lot of lines in episode put guns in a positive light as staff felt that they could not just make an episode about how bad they were several of staff including swartzwelder are pro gun although others such as matt groening are completely against them episode was designed to be non biased and to portray each side of argument equally scully noted that if there is any message in episode it is that a man like homer should not own a gun censors were nervous about some of episode s subject matter such as homer pointing gun in marge s face and bart aiming gun at milhouse with apple in his mouth but ultimately let it go opening sequence where soccer is portrayed as most boring sport imaginable was intended to show that soccer was more boring on television than live but both michels and groening enjoy game referee at game is a caricature of janitor at film roman who supplied director pete michels with every piece of soccer information he needed to design episode pele also makes an appearance at match although he is voiced by hank azaria episode closes with music from avengers after music had been recorded scully felt that it did not suit ending and so wished to change it to something else however it was too late in production to get full orchestra back to do a recording and union rules meant that previous recordings could not be reused cultural references chalkboard gag references richard gere gerbil urban legend gun shop is based on shop that los angeles police department went to during
