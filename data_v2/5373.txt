for twenty poor and old distressed people as blind and lame as it shall seem best to them of towne of monmouth where it shall be bestowed jones was born at newland gloucestershire and brought up in monmouth leaving to make a sizeable fortune as a london merchant engaged in cloth trade with continent motivations for his bequest appear partly philanthropic and partly evangelical county of monmouthshire in early 17th century had a significant catholic presence and local historian keith kissack noted priority given to preacher illustrates jones s concern to convert an area in marches which was still when school opened in 1614 strongly recusant order for establishment of school was made retrospectively by james i in 1616 and decreed for ever in town of monmouth one almshouse and one free grammar school haberdashers purchased four fields as site for school before jones s death paying sum of ps100 royal permission for this charitable purchase was required under statute of mortmain which was granted in 1614 by jones s death in hamburg in 1615 almshouses and schoolroom and headmaster s house had been completed although nothing now remains of original school buildings bulk of jones s considerable bequest was used for purchase of lands at new cross in south east london and rent rolls from that estate provided money for salaries and running costs associated with school as well as payment of pensions to residents of almshouses first headmaster was john owen m a of queens college cambridge appointed on a salary of ps60 per annum neither owen nor many of his

century school buildings mid twentieth century historian of school h a ward described its early history as precarious years continuing religious controversy coupled with english civil war made town of monmouth a divided and uncertain setting for school divisions between staff and financial instability and remoteness of haberdashers company which was compelled to make substantial loans to parliamentary government that went unpaid for decades and was then required to finance rebuilding of their livery hall which was destroyed during great fire of london contributed to internal weaknesses these difficulties continued well into 18th century and at one point during headship of morose and tyrannical john crowe who was removed from his post after becoming insane school roll fell to just three boys a source for information regarding school in mid 17th century is diary of school s usher more pye diary extracts from which were published in monmouthshire beacon in 1859 but which

less parochial entry for november 11 1647 records pye s monarchist sympathies ye king s majesty made an escape from hampton court out of ye s power vivat vivat in years of controversy 1800 1850 ward described early 19th century period of school s history as years of controversy these focused mainly on three issues relations between school and town relations between school town and haberdashers company and court of chancery which together were responsible for school s funding and oversight and attempts to expand school s curriculum beyond traditional study of latin and greek first issue saw school perceived as part of faction of dukes of beaufort premier landowners in county and directors of town s politics from their regional base at troy house early 19th century monmouth had a strong radical tradition led by burgesses such as thomas thackwell and fuelled by liberal positions of local newspapers monmouthshire beacon and monmouthshire merlin school s leadership was perceived in town to be too close to beauforts and thackwell ran an almost fifty year campaign against their attempts to defend established order second controversy related to governance of school and another long campaign of attrition saw school s lecturer lose responsibility for preparing an annual report on school this being transferred by court of chancery to a board of visitors last area of conflict arose between school s leadership which wanted to maintain tradition of a curriculum that involved study solely of latin and greek and court and haberdashers who wanted expansion to cover such areas as writing and arithmetic in a damming report in 1827 they condemned present masters though so liberally paid and having so little to do consider themselves engaged only to teach latin and greek a school teaching those branches of learning only will never be useful to a place of such confined population as monmouth reforms introduced by john oakley hill in 1852 saw establishment of upper and lower schools former continuing to provide a classical education while latter had a curriculum focused on writing and arithmetic william coxe who undertook extensive tours of wales in very late 18th and early 19th centuries in company of his friend sir richard colt hoare recorded his impressions of school in second volume of his an historical tour in monmouthshire published in 1801 describing school as enjoying a high reputation under care of headmaster rev john powell coxe retells mythical story of school s establishment and records a portrait of founder habited in costume of age of james first with an inscription walter william jones haberdasher and merchant of london etc is preserved in school room years of expansion 1851 1914 in early 1850s court of chancery insisted on appointment of an external examiner his report of 1852 was not encouraging many of boys appear so ignorant as to be a disgrace to their parents still more than to their teachers if academic outlook remained bleak financial position of school was transformed in this period sale of part of new cross estate to railway developers and vastly increased rents accruing from development and expansion of london saw haberdashers fortunes dramatically increase availability of funds led to complete rebuilding of school on its original site between 1864 school s 250th anniversary and end of century school s expansion was undertaken during long reign of rev charles manley roberts headmaster for 32 years from 1859 to 1892 during roberts s time monmouth became an early member of prestigious headmaster s conference created by edward thring of uppingham in 1869 a mark of its increasing reputation and status as a public school school s reputation for sporting prowess also rose its rugby teams and rowers enjoying particular success as a result of rising revenues from rents and investments by mid 19th century monmouth s endowment was one of largest of any school in england and wales to use resulting surpluses original foundation was reorganised in 1891 to support a new girls school and an elementary school in town as well as a boys grammar school west monmouth school in pontypool as importantly for school s development rule that limited applications to boys from monmouthshire and neighbouring counties was set aside and applications were opened to entirety of wales and england years of war

edward vi five ways school birmingham who were evacuated due to german bombing of midlands modern era 1945 2018 internal conflict within school s management continued in mid twentieth century with governors sacking two headmasters within three years this led to school s expulsion from headmasters conference and to that body s advising any of its members against applying for vacant headship impasse was resolved in 1959 with appointment of robert glover reorganisation of haberdashers endowments also occurred at this time elementary school founded with haberdashers funds in 1891 was transferred to county council control in 1940 with west monmouth school at pontypool following in 1955 this left william jones s schools foundation responsible for monmouth school and haberdashers monmouth school for girls also known as hmsg both of which joined direct grant scheme in 1946 another significant development for school s location was building of a40 which severed monmouth ruthlessly from river on which in past it had depended and cut off school from its historic frontage onto river wye this led to permanent closure of school s ceremonial entrance wye bridge gate constructed by henry stock in 1890s direct impact on school was perhaps less significant ward had recorded an early comment on entrance that ancient gate which never opened is but thrice a year on notable occasions such as when coal cart comes in 1976 with ending of direct grant system school returned to full independence having argued strongly against ending of grant system headmaster at time robert glover gave a warning as to likely consequences if direct grant goes school which has served boys of monmouth for four hundred years will suddenly become for many families financially prohibitive in response a committee of old monmothian club headed by lord brecon and sir derek ezra undertook a campaign to raise funding for scholarships which accumulated ps100 000 in ten weeks during his tenure glover also secured re admittance to headmasters conference to mark school s four hundredth anniversary a service of thanksgiving was held at st paul s cathedral on 19 march 2014 attended by some 2 200 pupils and staff from school and from haberdashers monmouth school for girls as well as haberdashers and friends of schools in 2018 haberdashers rebranded their group of schools in town as haberdashers monmouth schools and renamed senior schools as monmouth school for boys and monmouth school for girls respectively histories of school monmouthshire antiquarian charles heath described traditional and almost certainly inaccurate story of school s foundation in his accounts of ancient and present state of town of monmouth published in 1804 heath records that william jones now established as a successful and wealthy merchant returned to his home town of newland disguised as a beggar receiving a hostile reception he travelled to monmouth where he was more warmly received and where as a consequence he funded construction of school and associated almshouses story is taken from an earlier oral tradition also recorded in archdeacon coxe s an historical tour in monmouthshire published three years earlier in 1899 rev w m warlow published his history of charities of william jones at monmouth and newland his fellow cleric and master rev k m pitt wrote a more
