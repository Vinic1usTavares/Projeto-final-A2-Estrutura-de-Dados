incarnations of her spiritual practices from yogi prophet queen to freak and pole dancer publication was a worldwide success leading to a number of exhibitions in new york london paris dusseldorf berlin and florence after exhibition was over madonna was inspired by images from exhibitions and decided to incorporate them into her then unplanned tour and asked klein to help her with task poster released for tour used one of images from installation project it featured madonna in a seventeenth century style dress crawling on all fours towards camera klein later commented that thing is i always saw madonna as a performance artist and i think what i wanted to portray was process about how a performer arrives at their work and thing is what she had talked about as well is that before a concert what she finds very interesting is rehearsals and straining and maybe she would like to injure and she said that process of making concert became more intriguing than final result main intention of tour was to transform madonna s old hits musically and display her capacity for transformation and self reflection tour was initially known as whore of babylon world tour although madonna later denied using this name idea was to portray madonna as whore of babylon an evil figure from book of revelation however it was later changed to re invention world tour a self confident dig at all critics and people who have expressed their views about madonna re inventing her image over years official tour poster displayed madonna in a vintage bolero gown and a large french renaissance like hair bun air conditioning was turned off during tour on madonna s request as she claimed it dried up her throat during singing development thumb madonna performing nobody knows me during opening

dance floor 2005 while former was included in her eleventh studio album hard candy 2008 ray of light was also rehearsed during initial phases but madonna later decided to eliminate it as performing song at beginning of show would hurt her voice beforehand finally twenty four of thirty rehearsed songs ended up on being official setlist for show costumes for tour were created by designer arianne phillips before show started usa today reported that madonna would be making five costume changes in tour phillips commented that since madonna was revisiting her old songs for this tour hence that was main philosophy and inspiration behind designing costumes however she also noted that madonna has always pooh concept of reinvention and doesn t strategize or premeditate her new look in a boardroom so this is greatest ironic statement of all t shirts were designed by jean paul gaultier and shoes used were provided by clothing line hosiery miu miu opening dress was created by french designer christian lacroix and incorporated baroque look second part of displayed military themed outfits inspired from american life album and designed by phillips third ensemble emphasized on

installations once introduction had finished madonna appeared onstage on a rising platform in a golden corset for some european shows she wore a lilac one striking yoga poses to perform vogue it was followed by energetically performed nobody knows me on a conveyor belt with some of words to song appearing on screens then frozen during which a video of a naked male and a naked female wrestling caressing and intertwining in water their faces and genitals darkened by shadows so as to preserve their androgyny were displayed on backdrops this video was directed by chris cunningham who directed madonna s original music video to song military segment started with sound of a helicopter in background as madonna s backup dancers dressed as soldiers crawled on their bellies as though in middle of battle then hugged each other as if saying goodbye madonna appeared onstage on top of a structure made up of tv sets wearing camouflage pants an olive army jacket and black beret she started performing american life as war footage of death and destruction flashed on screens behind her at end of song it showed a george w bush look alike lovingly resting his head on shoulder of a saddam hussein look alike as though pair were waiting for a marriage license during performance madonna ran down a lengthy v shaped catwalk that descended from ceiling and allowed her to reach middle of stadium she also twirled army rifles during a march like express yourself before strapping on a guitar for rock versions of burning up and material girl during latter s performances backdrops

performances consisted of music and show closer holiday which was backed by a montage of morphing flags on backdrops show ended with cannon shots of confetti and phrase reinvent yourself appearing onscreen critical response thumb madonna performing die another day on third cabaret themed segment of tour show received critical acclaim david segal from washington post noted that difference between this show and last drowned world tour of 2001 was striking that show seems standoffish compared with this one in part because madonna has finally worked through whatever issues prevented her from performing her earliest hits madonna has created a new performance hybrid segal s view was shared by elizabeth smith from new york times who also commented that unlike 2001 s drowned world tour which was dark often hostile re invention returns madonna to light she looks as if she is having a good time edna gunderson of usa today gave concert four out of four stars and said madonna seems to be having a jolly good time whereas her last outing had technical strengths but lacked warmth reinvention finds madonna reinvested emotionally show doesn t have degree of flesh carnal content or shock value that past outings delivered but this time madonna is opting for more heart than cleavage and more personality than profanity joshua klein from chicago tribune commented that madonna s show displayed more spectacle than substance sal cinquemani from slant magazine commented on theme of concert and said that best thing that can come out of madonna revisiting and reinventing past is that she and we will be reminded of what she does best making us forget about bad times come together release pressure and have a holiday kelefa sanneh from new york times said that concert was a dense dizzying often incoherent sometimes exhilarating night starring a great performer who often found herself shadowboxing with her own past lives dan aquilante from new york post said that concert razzle dazzled her way into hearts of devoted audience with an entertaining theatrical revue that was elaborately staged costumed and cast with a full dance troupe thea singer of boston herald said that madonna brought jewish mysticism on tour john hand from bbc noted that re invention tour happily d past and present madonna it is a far more rounded concert experience for dedicated fan however robert hilburn from los angeles times felt that show eventually took on a darker more political tone and condemned weakly political re invention concert as unsexy and uninspiring commercial reception left

s me off her fucking christmas card list but do i give a toss no madonna s publicist liz rosenberg rejected john s allegations by saying madonna does not lip sync nor does she spend her time trashing other artists she sang every note of her re invention tour live and is not ashamed that she was well paid for her hard work elton john remains on her christmas card list whether he is nice or naughty john later released a statement to entertainment weekly saying that he would like to apologize to madonna for his comments he said i don t want to escalate it because i like madonna she s been to my house for dinner it was something that was said in heat of moment and probably should not have been said would i apologize to her if i saw her yeah because i don t want to hurt any artist s feelings

jonas akerlund s 2005 kinetic yet personable documentary of madonna s 2004 re invention tour lacks dishy delights of diva s 1991 truth or dare doc instead a more worldly madge struggles to become a less sound bite reliant more sincere person bonus live cd proves that she s a better singer stephen thomas erlewine from allmusic complimented release saying as madonna s first live cd i m going to tell you a secret is strong and entertaining and even if excessive minutiae on accompanying dvd means only hardcore fans will sit through its two hours it s also quite well done release debuted at
