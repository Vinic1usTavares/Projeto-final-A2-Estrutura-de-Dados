thumbnail 300px structure of an alpha amino acid in its un ionized form amino acids are organic compounds that contain amine nh2 and carboxyl cooh functional groups along with a side chain r group specific to each amino acid key elements of an amino acid are carbon c hydrogen h oxygen o and nitrogen n although other elements are found in side chains of certain amino acids about 500 naturally occurring amino acids are known though only 20 appear in genetic code and can be classified in many ways they can be classified according to core structural functional groups locations as alpha a beta b gamma g or delta d amino acids other categories relate to polarity ph level and side chain group type aliphatic acyclic aromatic containing hydroxyl or sulfur etc in form of proteins amino acid residues form second largest component water is largest of human muscles and other tissues beyond their role as residues in proteins amino acids participate in a number of processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis in biochemistry amino acids having both amine and carboxylic acid groups attached to first alpha carbon atom have particular importance they are known as 2 alpha or a amino acids generic formula in most cases proline is an exception to this general formula it lacks nh2 group because of cyclization of side chain and is known as an imino acid it falls under category of special structured amino acids where r is an organic substituent known as a side chain often term amino acid is used to refer specifically to these they include 22 proteinogenic protein building amino acids which combine into peptide chains polypeptides to form building blocks of a vast array of proteins these are all l left handed isomers although a few d amino acids right handed occur in bacterial envelopes as a d serine and in some antibiotics twenty of proteinogenic amino acids are encoded directly by triplet codons in genetic code and are known as standard amino acids other two non standard or non canonical are selenocysteine present in many prokaryotes as well as most eukaryotes but not coded directly by dna and pyrrolysine found only in some archaea and one bacterium pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons for example selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and secis element modeling electrostatic contributions to protein folding and binding tjong p 1 in drug design and discovery ed atta ur rahman others p 299 n formylmethionine which is often initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria mitochondria and chloroplasts is generally considered as a form of methionine rather than as a separate proteinogenic amino acid codon trna combinations not found in nature can also be used to expand genetic code and form novel proteins known as incorporating non proteinogenic amino acids many important proteinogenic and non proteinogenic amino acids have biological functions for example in human brain glutamate standard glutamic acid and gamma amino butyric acid gaba non standard gamma amino acid are respectively main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters hydroxyproline a major component of connective tissue collagen is synthesised from proline glycine is a biosynthetic precursor to porphyrins used in red blood cells carnitine is used in lipid transport nine proteinogenic amino acids are called essential for humans because they cannot be produced from other compounds by human body and so must be taken in as food others may be conditionally essential for certain ages or medical conditions essential amino acids may also differ between species for example ruminants such as cows obtain a number of amino acids via microbes in first two stomach chambers because of their biological significance amino acids are important in nutrition and are commonly used in nutritional supplements fertilizers feed and food technology industrial uses include production of drugs biodegradable plastics and chiral catalysts history first few amino acids were discovered in early 19th century hansen sabine die entdeckung der von 1805 in paris bis 1935 in illinois berlin im mai 2015 link in 1806 french chemists louis nicolas vauquelin and pierre jean isolated a compound in asparagus that was subsequently named asparagine first amino acid to be discovered was discovered in 1810 although its monomer cysteine remained undiscovered until 1884 glycine and leucine were discovered in 1820 last of 20 common amino acids to be discovered was threonine in 1935 by william cumming rose who also determined essential amino acids and established minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth unity of chemical category was recognized by wurtz in 1865 but he gave no particular name to it p dictionnaire de chimie une et historique de boeck bruxelles link first use of term amino acid in english language dates from 1898 while german term was used earlier proteins were found to yield amino acids after enzymatic digestion or acid hydrolysis in 1902 emil fischer and franz hofmeister independently proposed that proteins are formed from many amino acids whereby bonds are formed between amino group of one amino acid with carboxyl group of another resulting in a linear structure that fischer termed peptide general structure thumb right upright 2 0 21 proteinogenic a amino acids found in eukaryotes grouped according to their side chains pka values and charges carried at physiological ph 7 4 in structure shown at top of page r represents a side chain specific to each amino acid carbon atom next to carboxyl group which is therefore numbered 2 in carbon chain starting from that functional group is called a carbon amino acids containing an amino group bonded directly to alpha carbon are referred to as alpha amino acids these include amino acids such as proline which contain secondary amines which used to be often referred to as imino acids alpha amino acids are most common form found in nature but only when occurring in l isomer alpha carbon is a chiral carbon atom with exception of glycine which has two indistinguishable hydrogen atoms on alpha carbon therefore all alpha amino acids but glycine can exist in either of two called l or d amino acids relative configuration which are mirror images of each other see also chirality while l amino acids represent all of amino acids found in proteins during translation in ribosome d amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme posttranslational modifications after translation and translocation to endoplasmic reticulum as in exotic sea dwelling organisms such as cone snails they are also abundant components of peptidoglycan cell walls of bacteria and d serine may act as a neurotransmitter in brain d amino acids are used in racemic crystallography to create centrosymmetric crystals which depending on protein may allow for easier and more robust protein structure determination l and d convention for amino acid configuration refers not to optical activity of amino acid itself but rather to optical activity of isomer of glyceraldehyde from which that amino acid can in theory be synthesized d glyceraldehyde is l glyceraldehyde is in alternative fashion s and r designators are used to indicate absolute configuration almost all of amino acids in proteins are s at a carbon with cysteine being r and glycine non chiral cysteine has its side chain in same geometric position as other amino acids but r s terminology is reversed because of higher atomic number of sulfur compared to carboxyl oxygen gives side chain a higher priority by cahn ingold prelog rules whereas atoms in other side chains give them lower priority compared to carboxyl group side chains thumb right lysine with carbon atoms labeled by position in amino acids that have a carbon chain attached to a carbon such as lysine shown to right carbons are labeled in order as a b g d and so on in some amino acids amine group is attached to b or g carbon and these are therefore referred to as beta or gamma amino acids amino acids are usually classified by properties of their side chain into four groups side chain can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base and a if side chain is polar or a if it is nonpolar chemical structures of 22 standard amino acids along with their chemical properties are described more fully in article on these proteinogenic amino acids phrase branched chain amino acids or refers to amino acids having aliphatic side chains that are non linear these are leucine isoleucine and valine proline is only proteinogenic amino acid whose side group links to a amino group and thus is also only proteinogenic amino acid containing a secondary amine at this position in chemical terms proline is therefore an imino acid since it lacks a primary amino group although it is still classed as an amino acid in current biochemical nomenclature and may also be called an n alkylated alpha amino acid zwitterions thumb right an amino acid in its 1 un ionized and 2 zwitterionic forms a carboxylic acid group of amino acids is a weak acid meaning that it releases a such as a proton at moderate ph values in other words carboxylic acid groups can be deprotonated to become negatively charged carboxylates co2 negatively charged carboxylate ion predominates at ph values greater than pka of carboxylic acid group typically around 2 2 for 20 common amino acids see table of amino acid structures above in a complementary fashion a amine of amino acids is a weak base meaning that it accepts a proton at moderate ph values in other words a amino groups nh2 can be protonated to become positively charged a ammonium groups positively charged a ammonium group predominates at ph values less than pka of a ammonium group mean for 20 common a amino acids is about 9 4 because all amino acids contain amine and carboxylic acid functional groups they share properties below ph 2 2 predominant form will have a neutral carboxylic acid group and a positive a ammonium ion net charge 1 and above ph 9 4 a negative carboxylate and neutral a amino group net charge 1 at a ph between 2 2 and 9 4 an amino acid typically contains both a negative carboxylate and a positive a ammonium group as shown in structure 2 on right and exhibits a net zero charge this molecular state is known as a zwitterion from german meaning hermaphrodite or hybrid fully neutral form structure 1 on left is a very minor species in aqueous solution throughout ph range less than 1 part in 107 altogether amino acids exist as zwitterions in solid phase and crystallize with salt like properties unlike typical organic acids or amines isoelectric point thumb right 360px composite of titration curves of twenty proteinogenic amino acids grouped by side chain category variation in titration curves when amino acids can be grouped by category with exception of tyrosine using titration to distinguish among hydrophobic amino acids is problematic at ph values between two pka values zwitterion predominates but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions at exact midpoint between two pka values trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance so that average net charge of all forms present is zero this ph is known as isoelectric point pi so pi 1 2 pka1 pka2 individual amino acids all have slightly different pka values and therefore have different isoelectric points for amino acids with charged side chains pka of side chain is involved thus for asp or glu with negative side chains pi 1 2 pka1 pkar where pkar is side chain pka cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pkar 8 14 so pi should be calculated as for asp and glu even though side chain is not significantly charged at physiological ph for his lys and arg with positive side chains pi 1 2 pkar pka2 amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids in particular with non polar side chains can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting ph to required isoelectric point occurrence and functions in biochemistry proteinogenic amino acids amino acids are structural units monomers that make up proteins they join together to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins these polymers are linear and unbranched with each amino acid within chain attached to two neighboring amino acids process of making proteins encoded by dna rna genetic material is called translation and involves step by step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a that is called a ribosome order in which amino acids are added is read through genetic code from an mrna template which is an rna copy of one of organism s genes twenty two amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are called proteinogenic or natural amino acids of these 20 are encoded by universal genetic code remaining 2 selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms selenocysteine is incorporated when mrna being translated includes a secis element which causes uga codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a stop codon pyrrolysine is used by some methanogenic archaea in enzymes that they use to produce methane it is coded for with codon uag which is normally a stop codon in other organisms this uag codon is followed by a downstream sequence non proteinogenic amino acids aside from 22 proteinogenic amino acids many non proteinogenic amino acids are known those either are not found in proteins for example carnitine gaba levothyroxine or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery for example hydroxyproline and non proteinogenic amino acids that are found in proteins are formed by post translational modification which is modification after translation during protein synthesis these modifications are often essential for function or regulation of a protein for example carboxylation of glutamate allows for better binding of calcium cations and collagen contains hydroxyproline generated by hydroxylation of proline another example is formation of in translation initiation factor through modification of a lysine residue such modifications can also determine localization of protein e g addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a phospholipid membrane some non proteinogenic amino acids are not found in proteins examples include 2 aminoisobutyric acid and neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid non proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in metabolic pathways for standard amino acids for example ornithine and occur in urea cycle part of amino acid catabolism see below a rare exception to dominance of a amino acids in biology is b amino acid beta alanine 3 acid which is used in plants and microorganisms in synthesis of pantothenic acid vitamin b5 a component of coenzyme a d amino acid natural abundance although d isomers are uncommon in live organisms is a polypeptide made up from mixture of d and l amino acids other compounds containing d amino acids are and these compounds disrupt bacterial cell walls particularly in gram positive bacteria only 837 d amino acids were found in swiss database out of a total of 187 million amino acids analysed non standard amino acids 20 amino acids that are encoded directly by codons of universal genetic code are called standard or canonical amino acids a modified form of methionine n formylmethionine is often incorporated in place of methionine as initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria mitochondria and chloroplasts other amino acids are called non standard or non canonical most of non standard amino acids are also non proteinogenic i e they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation but two of them are proteinogenic as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in universal genetic code two non standard proteinogenic amino acids are selenocysteine present in many non eukaryotes as well as most eukaryotes but not coded directly by dna and pyrrolysine found only in some archaea and one bacterium incorporation of these non standard amino acids is rare for example 25 human proteins include selenocysteine sec in their primary structure and structurally characterized enzymes employ sec as catalytic moiety in their active sites pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons for example selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and secis element in human nutrition thumb right 380px share of amino acid in different human diets and resulting mix of amino acids in human blood serum glutamate and glutamine are most frequent in food at over 10 while alanine glutamine and glycine are most common in blood alt diagram showing relative occurrence of different amino acids in blood serum as obtained from different diets when taken up into human body from diet 20 standard amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy oxidation pathway starts with removal of amino group by a transaminase amino group is then fed into urea cycle other product of is a keto acid that enters citric acid cycle glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis of 20 standard amino acids nine his ile leu lys met phe thr trp and val are called essential amino acids because human body cannot synthesize them from other compounds at level needed for normal growth so they must be obtained from food in addition cysteine tyrosine and arginine are considered semiessential amino acids and a semiessential acid in children metabolic pathways that synthesize these monomers are not fully developed amounts required also depend on age and health of individual so it is hard to make general statements about dietary requirement for some amino acids dietary exposure to non standard amino acid bmaa has been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases including als non protein functions in humans non protein amino acids also have important roles as metabolic intermediates such as in biosynthesis of neurotransmitter gamma amino butyric acid gaba many amino acids are used to synthesize other molecules for example tryptophan is a precursor of neurotransmitter serotonin tyrosine and its precursor phenylalanine are precursors of catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine epinephrine and norepinephrine and various trace amines phenylalanine is a precursor of phenethylamine and tyrosine in humans in plants it is a precursor of various which are important in plant metabolism glycine is a precursor of porphyrins such as heme arginine is a precursor of nitric oxide ornithine and s are precursors of aspartate glycine and glutamine are precursors of nucleotides however not all of functions of other abundant non standard amino acids are known some non standard amino acids are used as defenses against herbivores in plants for example is an analogue of arginine that is found in many legumes and in particularly large amounts in sword bean this amino acid protects plants from predators such as insects and can cause illness in people if some types of legumes are eaten without processing non protein amino acid is found in other species of legume in particular this compound is an analogue of tyrosine and can poison animals that graze on these plants uses in industry amino acids are used for a variety of applications in industry but their main use is as additives to animal feed this is necessary since many of bulk components of these feeds such as soybeans either have low levels or lack some of essential amino acids lysine methionine threonine and tryptophan are most important in production of these feeds in this industry amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve absorption of minerals from supplements which may be required to improve health or production of these animals food industry is also a major consumer of amino acids in particular glutamic acid which is used as a flavor enhancer and aspartame phenylalanine 1 methyl ester as a low calorie artificial sweetener similar technology to that used for animal nutrition is employed in human nutrition industry to alleviate symptoms of mineral deficiencies such as anemia by improving mineral absorption and reducing negative side effects from inorganic mineral supplementation chelating ability of amino acids has been used in fertilizers for agriculture to facilitate delivery of minerals to plants in order to correct mineral deficiencies such as iron chlorosis these fertilizers are also used to prevent deficiencies from occurring and improving overall health of plants remaining production of amino acids is used in synthesis of drugs and cosmetics similarly some amino acids derivatives are used in pharmaceutical industry they include 5 htp 5 used for experimental treatment of depression l dopa l for parkinson s treatment and drug that inhibits ornithine decarboxylase and used in treatment of sleeping sickness expanded genetic code since 2001 40 non natural amino acids have been added into protein by creating a unique codon recoding and a corresponding transfer rna aminoacyl trna synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploring protein structure and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins nullomers nullomers are codons that in theory code for an amino acid however in nature there is a selective bias against using this codon in favor of another for example bacteria prefer to use cga instead of aga to code for arginine this creates some sequences that do not appear in genome this characteristic can be taken advantage of and used to create new selective cancer fighting drugs and to prevent cross contamination of dna samples from crime scene investigations chemical building blocks amino acids are important as low cost these compounds are used in chiral pool synthesis as pure building blocks amino acids have been investigated as precursors chiral catalysts e g for asymmetric hydrogenation reactions although no commercial applications exist biodegradable plastics amino acids have been considered as components of biodegradable polymers which have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and construction of prosthetic implants an interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate a water soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions polyaspartate is also being used as a anti scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor in addition aromatic amino acid tyrosine has been considered as a possible replacement for phenols such as a in manufacture of synthesis thumb 400px right strecker amino acid synthesis alt for steps in reaction see text chemical synthesis commercial production of amino acids usually relies on mutant bacteria that overproduce individual amino acids using glucose as a carbon source some amino acids are produced by enzymatic conversions of synthetic intermediates 2 4 carboxylic acid is an intermediate in one industrial synthesis of l cysteine for example aspartic acid is produced by addition of ammonia to fumarate using a lyase biosynthesis in plants nitrogen is first assimilated into organic compounds in form of glutamate formed from alpha ketoglutarate and ammonia in for other amino acids plants use transaminases to move amino group from glutamate to another alpha keto acids for example aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and to alpha ketoglutarate and aspartate other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis too nonstandard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids for example homocysteine is formed through pathway or by demethylation of methionine via intermediate metabolite s adenosyl methionine while hydroxyproline is made by a posttranslational modification of proline microorganisms and plants synthesize many uncommon amino acids for example some microbes make 2 aminoisobutyric acid and which is a sulfide bridged derivative of alanine both of these amino acids are found in peptidic such as however in plants 1 1 carboxylic acid is a small cyclic amino acid that is a key intermediate in production of plant hormone ethylene reactions amino acids undergo reactions expected of constituent functional groups types of these reactions are determined by groups on these side chains and are therefore different between various types of amino acid peptide bond formation thumbnail right 400px condensation of two amino acids to form a dipeptide through a peptide bond alt two amino acids are shown next to each other one loses a hydrogen and oxygen from its carboxyl group cooh and other loses a hydrogen from its amino group nh2 this reaction produces a molecule of water h2o and two amino acids joined by a peptide bond co nh two joined amino acids are called a dipeptide as both amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids can react to form amide bonds one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage this polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins this condensation reaction yields newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water in cells this reaction does not occur directly instead amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer rna molecule through an ester bond this aminoacyl trna is produced in an atp dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl trna synthetase this aminoacyl trna is then a substrate for ribosome which catalyzes attack of amino group of elongating protein chain on ester bond as a result of this mechanism all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their n terminus and moving toward their c terminus however not all peptide bonds are formed in this way in a few cases peptides are synthesized by specific enzymes for example glutathione is an essential part of defenses of cells against oxidative stress this peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids in first step gamma synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between side chain carboxyl of glutamate gamma carbon of this side chain and amino group of cysteine this dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione in chemistry peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions one of most used in solid phase peptide synthesis uses aromatic derivatives of amino acids as activated units these are added in sequence onto growing peptide chain which is attached to a solid resin support ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying types and order of amino acids using combinatorial chemistry has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through high throughput screening combination of functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal amino acid multiple side chains of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions catabolism thumb 300px catabolism of proteinogenic amino acids amino acids can be classified according to properties of their main products as either of following m h 2006 biochemical physiological molecular aspects of human nutrition 2 ed saunders elsevier glucogenic with products having ability to form glucose by gluconeogenesis ketogenic with products not having ability to form glucose these products may still be used for ketogenesis or lipid synthesis amino acids into both glucogenic and ketogenic products amino acids must first pass out of organelles and cells into blood circulation via amino acid transporters since amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized degradation of an amino acid occurring in liver and kidneys often involves deamination by moving its amino group to alpha ketoglutarate forming glutamate this process involves transaminases often same as those used in during synthesis in many vertebrates amino group is then removed through urea cycle and is excreted in form of urea however amino acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead for example serine converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia after removal of one or more amino groups remainder of molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or citric acid cycle as detailed in image at right amino acids are ligands forming transition metal amino acid complexes 420 px physicochemical properties of amino acids ca 20 canonical amino acids can be classified according to their properties important factors are charge or hydrophobicity size and functional groups these properties are important for protein structure and protein protein interactions water soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues leu ile val phe and trp buried in middle of protein whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to aqueous solvent note that in biochemistry a residue refers to a specific monomer within polymeric chain of a polysaccharide protein or nucleic acid integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into lipid bilayer in case part way between these two extremes some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto membrane in similar fashion proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and aspartate while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and arginine there are different hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues some amino acids have special properties such as cysteine that can form covalent disulfide bonds to other cysteine residues proline that forms a cycle to polypeptide backbone and glycine that is more flexible than other amino acids many proteins undergo a range of posttranslational modifications when additional chemical groups are attached to amino acids in proteins some modifications can produce hydrophobic or hydrophilic glycoproteins these type of modification allow reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane for example addition and removal of fatty acid palmitic acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes table of standard amino acid abbreviations and
