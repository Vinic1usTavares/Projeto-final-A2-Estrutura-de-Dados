hip 78530 b is an object that is either a planet or a brown dwarf in orbit of star hip 78530 it was observed as early as 2000 but object was not confirmed as one in orbit of star hip 78530 until a direct imaging project photographed star in 2008 image caught attention of project s science team so team followed up on its initial observations hip 78530 b orbits a young hot bright blue star in upper scorpius association planet itself is over twenty three times more massive than jupiter orbiting eighteen times further from its host star than pluto does from sun by estimates published in its discovery paper in this predicted orbit hip 78530 b completes an orbit every twelve thousand years discovery between 2000 and 2001 adonis system at eso 3 6 m telescope in chile detected a faint object in vicinity of hip 78530 this object was reported in 2005 and 2007 although astronomers investigating star were not able to tell based on their observations if faint object was an orbiting companion or not team did not follow up on this left thumb 250px north telescope of gemini observatory which directly imaged hip 78530 system random selection of ninety one stars in upper scorpius association provided a sample of stars to be observed using near infrared imager and spectrometer niri and altitude conjugate adaptive optics for infrared altair adaptive optics system at gemini observatory among ninety stars selected for direct imaging was star hip 78530 which was first imaged by camera on may 24 2008 this initial image revealed presence of same faint object within vicinity of hip 78530 follow up imaging took place on july 2 2009 and august 30 2010 using same instruments as astronomers hoped to reveal this companion object s proper motion or rate that it moves over time additional follow up data was recovered in spring and summer of 2010 but large errors in data s astrometry led investigating astronomers to disregard it observations over three years was compiled with data used to filter out pixelated portions of images and improve images quality result suggested not only that faint object in image was nearby star hip 78530 but that it was a brown dwarf or planet in size further study would be needed to prove its true nature on july 2 2009 july 3 2009 and august 8 2009 use of integral field spectrograph with altair allowed astronomers to collect data on spectrum of faint object and its star analysis of spectra and objects astrometry how star and faint object change position in sky led to confirmation of companion hip 78530 b confirmation of hip 78530 b was reported on january 24 2011 in imaging ninety one stars hip 78530 b and were discovered discoveries of these two orbiting bodies allowed astronomers to predict that bodies with such low planet brown dwarf to star mass ratios below 0 01 orbiting at a distance of hundreds of au exists in orbits of 2 2 of all stars however this number is a lower limit as astronomers have been unable to detect smaller low mass planets that fit this scenario host star hip 78530 is a bright blue b type main sequence star in upper scorpius association a loose star cluster composed of stars with a common origin star is estimated to be approximately 2 5 times mass of sun ages of upper scorpius group have been quoted at 5 million years however a more recent estimate suggests that group is somewhat older approximately 11 million years old its effective temperature is estimated at k less than twice effective temperature of sun hip 78530 has an apparent magnitude of 7 18 it is incredibly faint if visible at all as seen from unaided eye of an observer on earth characteristics hip 78530 b is most likely a brown dwarf a massive object that is large enough to fuse deuterium something that planets are too small to do but not large enough to ignite and become a star because hip 78530 b s characteristics blend line between whether or not it is a brown dwarf or a planet astronomers have tried to determine what hip 78530 b is by predicting whether it was created in a planet like or star like how brown dwarves are formed manner its estimated mass is over 23 04 times that of jupiter additionally hip 78530 b orbits its host star at an estimated average distance of 710 au which is 710 times average distance between earth and sun assuming brown dwarf has a circular orbit average distance between dwarf planet pluto and sun is 39 482 au meaning that hip 78530 b orbits its host star nearly eighteen times further than pluto orbits sun in accordance with data hip 78530 b would complete an orbit approximately every 12 000 years although actual orbital motion of hip 78530 b is most likely smaller than 710 au but it has not been directly observed long enough to know definitively references category exoplanets discovered in 2011 category scorpius constellation category b type main sequence stars category exoplanets detected by direct imaging category upper scorpius
