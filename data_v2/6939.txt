61 cygni is a binary star system in constellation cygnus consisting of a pair of k type dwarf stars that orbit each other in a period of about 659 years of apparent magnitude 5 20 and 6 05 respectively they can be seen with binoculars in city skies or with naked eye in rural areas without 61 cygni first attracted attention of astronomers when its large proper motion was first demonstrated by giuseppe piazzi in 1804 in 1838 friedrich bessel measured its distance from earth at about 10 4 light years very close to actual value of about 11 4 light years this was first distance estimate for any star other than sun and first star to have its stellar parallax measured among all stars or stellar systems listed in modern hipparcos catalogue 61 cygni has seventh highest proper motion and highest among all visible stars or systems by convention limiting visual magnitude of 6 catalogues millennium star atlas top 20 high proper motion european space agency retrieved 2019 06 27 over course of twentieth century several different astronomers reported evidence of a massive planet orbiting one of two stars but recent high precision radial velocity observations have shown that all such claims were unfounded no planets have been confirmed in this stellar system to date name 61 cygni is relatively dim so it does not appear on ancient star maps nor is it given a name in western or chinese systems name 61 cygni is part of flamsteed designation assigned to stars according to this designation scheme devised by john flamsteed to catalog his observations stars of a particular constellation are numbered in order of their right ascension not in greek letters as bayer designation does star does not appear under that name in flamsteed s historia coelestis britannica although it has been stated by him that 61 cygni actually corresponds to what he referred to as 85 cygni in 1712 edition it has also been called bessel s star or piazzi s flying star observation history early observations first well recorded observation of star system using optical instruments was made by james bradley on 25 september 1753 when he noticed that it was a double star william herschel began systematic observations of 61 cygni as part of a wider study of binary stars his observations led to conclusion that binary stars were separated enough that they would show different movements in parallax over year and hoped to use this as a way to measure distance to stars thumb left 61 cygni showing proper motion at one year intervals alt gif showing proper motion of stellar system taken about in an interval of an year in 1792 giuseppe piazzi noticed high proper motion when he compared his own observations of 61 cygni with those of bradley made 40 years earlier this led to considerable interest in 61 cygni by contemporary astronomers and its continual observation since that date piazzi s repeated measurements led to a definitive value of its motion which he published in 1804 it was in this record he christened system as flying star piazzi noted that this motion meant that it was probably one of closest stars and suggested it would be a prime candidate for an attempt to determine its distance through parallax measurements along with two other possibilities delta eridani and mu cassiopeiae parallax measurement a number of astronomers soon took up task including attempts by francois arago and claude louis mathieu in 1812 who recorded parallax at 500 milliarcseconds mas and christian heinrich friedrich peters used arago s data to calculate a value of 550 mas peters calculated a better value based on observations made by bernhard von lindenau at seeburg between 1812 and 1814 he calculated it to be 470 510 mas von lindenau had already noted that he had seen no parallax and as friedrich georg wilhelm von struve pointed out after his own test series between 1818 and 1821 all of these numbers are more accurate than accuracy of instrument used friedrich wilhelm bessel made a notable contribution in 1812 when he used a different method to measure distance assuming orbital period of two stars in binary to be 400 years he estimated distance between two this would require and then measured angular distance between stars this led to a value of 460 mas he then followed this up with direct parallax measurements in a series of observations between 1815 and 1816 comparing it with six other stars two sets of measurements produced values of 760 and 1320 mas all of these estimates like earlier attempts by others retained inaccuracies greater than measurements when joseph von fraunhofer invented a new type of bessel carried out another set of measurements using this device in 1837 and 1838 at konigsberg he published his findings in 1838 with a value of 369 0 19 1 mas to a and 260 5 18 8 to b and estimated center point to be at 313 6 13 6 this corresponds to a distance of about 600 000 astronomical units or about 10 4 light years this was first direct and reliable measurement of distance to a star other than sun his measurement was published only shortly before similar parallax measurements of vega by friedrich georg wilhelm von struve and alpha centauri by thomas henderson that same year bessel continued to make additional measurements at konigsberg publishing a total of four complete observational runs last in 1868 best of these placed center point at 360 2 12 1 mas made during observations in 1849 this is close to currently accepted value of 287 18 mas yielding 11 36 light years only a few years after bessel s measurement in 1842 friedrich wilhelm noted that groombridge 1830 had an even larger proper motion and 61 cygni became second highest known it was later moved further down list by kapteyn s star and barnard s star 61 cygni has seventh highest proper motion of all stellar systems listed in modern hipparcos catalogue but retains title of highest proper motion among visible stars binary observations due to wide angular separation between 61 cygni a and b and correspondingly slow orbital motion it was initially unclear whether two stars in 61 cygni system were a gravitationally bound system or simply a juxtaposition of stars von struve first argued for its status as a binary in 1830 but matter remained open however by 1917 refined measured parallax differences demonstrated that separation was significantly less see table i page 326 binary nature of this system was clear by 1934 and orbital elements were published on page 19 authority is listed as zagar 1934 in 1911 benjamin boss published data indicating that 61 cygni system was a member of a comoving group of stars this group containing 61 cygni was later expanded to include 26 potential members possible members include beta columbae pi mensae 14 tauri and 68 virginis space velocities of this group of stars range from 105 to 114 km s relative to sun gives space velocity components of u 94 v 53 and w 7 for hd 201091 2 observations taken by planet search programs show that both components have strong linear trends in radial velocity measurements amateur observation an observer using binoculars can find 61 cygni two binocular fields southeast of bright star deneb angular separation of two stars is slightly greater than angular size of saturn 16 20 so under ideal viewing conditions binary system can be resolved by a telescope with a 7 mm aperture per rayleigh criterion mm this is well within capability for aperture of typical binoculars though to resolve binary these need a steady mount and some 10x magnification with a separation of 28 arc seconds between component stars 10x magnification would give an apparent separation of 280 arc seconds above generally regarded eye resolution limit of 4 arc minutes or 240 arc seconds properties although it appears to be a single star to naked eye 61 cygni is a widely separated binary star system composed of two k class orange main sequence stars brighter 61 cygni a and fainter 61 cygni b which have apparent magnitudes of 5 2 and 6 1 respectively both appear to be old disk stars with an estimated age that is older than sun at a distance of just over 11 light years it is 15th nearest known star system to earth not including sun 61 cygni a is fourth nearest star that is visible to naked eye for mid latitude northern observers after sirius epsilon eridani and procyon a this system will make its closest approach at about 20 000 ce when separation from sun will be about 9 light years smaller and dimmer than sun 61 cygni a has about 70 percent of a solar mass 72 percent of its diameter and about 8 5 percent of its luminosity and 61 cygni b has about 63 percent of a solar mass 67 percent of its diameter and 3 9 percent of its luminosity 61 cygni a s long term stability led to it being selected as an anchor star in morgan keenan mk classification system in 1943 serving as k5 v anchor point since that time starting in 1953 61 cygni b has been considered a k7 v standard star johnson morgan 1953 keenan mcneil 1989 left thumb upright 1 a size comparison between sun left 61 cygni a bottom and 61 cygni b upper right alt diagram showing size comparison between two stars of 61 cygni binary system and sun 61 cygni a is a typical by draconis variable star designated as v1803 cyg while 61 cygni b is a flare type variable star named hd 201092 with their magnitudes varying 5 21 v and 6 03 respectively two stars orbit their common barycenter in a period of 659 years with a mean separation of about 84 au 84 times separation between earth and sun relatively large orbital eccentricity of 0 48 means that two stars are separated by about 44 au at periapsis and 124 au at apoapsis at periapsis apoapsis au leisurely orbit of pair has made it difficult to pin down their respective masses and accuracy of these values remain somewhat controversial in future this issue may be resolved through use of asteroseismology 61 cygni a has about 11 more mass than 61 cygni b system has an activity cycle that is much more pronounced than solar sunspot cycle this is a complex activity cycle that varies with a period of about 7 5 1 7 years activity combined with rotation and chromospheric activity is a characteristic of a by draconis variable because of differential rotation this star s surface rotation period varies by latitude from 27 to 45 days with an average period of 35 days right thumb orbital motion of component b relative to component a as seen from earth as well as true appearance from face on view time steps are approximately 10 years alt diagram showing trajectory of 61 cygni b relative to a as seen from earth and from above outflow of stellar wind from component a produces a bubble within local interstellar cloud along direction of star s motion within milky way this extends out to a distance of 30 au or roughly orbital distance of neptune from sun this is lower than separation between two components of 61 cygni and so two most likely do not share a common atmosphere compactness of is likely due to low mass outflow and relatively high velocity through local interstellar medium 61 cygni b displays a more chaotic pattern of variability than a with significant short term flares there is an 11 7 year periodicity to overall activity cycle of b both stars exhibit stellar flare activity but chromosphere of b is 25 more active than for 61 cygni a as a result of differential rotation period of rotation varies by latitude from 32 to 47 days with an average period of 38 days there is some disagreement over evolutionary age of this system kinematic data gives an age estimate of about 10 gyr or age determination of a star based on its rotation and color results in an average age of ages based on chromospheric activity for a and b are 2 36 gyr and 3 75 gyr respectively finally age estimates using method which involve fitting stars to evolutionary models yield upper limits of 0 44 gyr and 0 68 gyr however a 2008 evolutionary model using code from cote d azur observatory gives an age estimate of for pair claims of a planetary system on different occasions it has been claimed that 61 cygni might have unseen low mass companions planets or a brown dwarf kaj strand of sproul observatory under direction of peter van de kamp made first such claim in 1942 using observations to detect tiny but systematic variations in orbital motions of 61 cygni a and b these perturbations suggested that a third body of about 16 jupiter masses must be orbiting 61 cygni a reports of this third body served as inspiration for hal clement s 1953 science fiction novel mission of gravity in 1957 van de kamp narrowed his uncertainties claiming that object had a mass of eight times that of jupiter a calculated orbital period of 4 8 years and a semi major axis of 2 4 au where 1 au is average distance from earth to sun in 1977 soviet astronomers at observatory near saint petersburg suggested that system included three planets two giant planets with six and twelve jupiter masses around 61 cyg a and one giant planet with seven jupiter masses around 61 cygni b in 1978 wulff dieter of sproul observatory proved that these claims were spurious as they were unable to detect any evidence of such motion down to six percent of sun s mass equivalent to about 60 times mass of jupiter habitable zone for 61 cygni a defined as locations where liquid water could be present on an earth like planet is 0 26 0 58 au for 61 cygni b habitable zone is 0 24 0 50 au refining planetary boundaries since no certain planetary object has been detected around either star so far mcdonald observatory team has set limits to presence of one or more planets around 61 cygni a and 61 cygni b with masses between 0 07 and 2 1 jupiter masses and average separations spanning between 0 05 and 5 2 au because of proximity of this system to sun it is a frequent target of interest for astronomers both stars were selected by nasa as tier 1 targets for proposed optical space interferometry mission this mission is potentially capable of detecting planets with as little as 3 times mass of earth at an orbital distance of 2 au from star measurements of this system appeared to have detected an excess of far infrared radiation beyond what is emitted by stars such an excess is sometimes associated with a disk of dust but in this case it lies sufficiently close to one or both of stars that it has not been resolved with a telescope a 2011 study using keck interferometer nuller failed to detect any exozodiacal dust around 61 cygni a see table 5 p 58 see also list of nearest stars 61 cygni in fiction stars and planetary systems in fiction barnard s star notes references external links category
