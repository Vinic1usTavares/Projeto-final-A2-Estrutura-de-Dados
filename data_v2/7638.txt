on throne of anglo saxon kings wolf warriors like geri and freki were not mere animals but mythical beings as woden s followers they bodied forth his might and so did wolf warriors bernd heinrich theorizes that geri and freki along with odin and his ravens huginn and muninn reflect a symbiosis observed in natural world among ravens wolves and humans on hunt in a biological symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of other s as in such a symbiosis odin father of all humans and gods though in human form was imperfect by himself as a separate entity he lacked depth perception being one eyed and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful but his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens mind and memory who were part of him they perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered to ends of earth each day to return in evening and tell him news he also had two wolves at his side and man god raven wolf association was like one single organism in which ravens were eyes mind and memory and wolves providers of meat and nourishment as god odin was ethereal part he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry i wondered if odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance it would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists to whom ravens act as competitors heinrich 2006 1999 355
