derived from one original set of names earliest of lists appears in i 66 124 38 and appears to have been used with minor variations in these lists are of two types in first type names of various forms of ganesha are given with a clear cut pairing of a named shakti for that form second type as found in ii iv 44 63 76 and commentary of on i 115 gives fifty or more names of ganesha collectively in one group with names of shaktis provided collectively in a second group second type of list poses problems in separating and properly connecting names into pairs due to ambiguities in formation of

and vermilion is smeared on its leaves she is then placed on a decorated pedestal and worshipped with flowers sandalwood paste and incense sticks kola bou is set on ganesha s right side along with other deities for most who view her new sari indicates her role as a new bride and many bengalis see it as symbolizing wife of ganesha a different view is that kola bou represents durga herself who in bengal is considered mother of ganesha those who know of that tradition do not consider ganesha s association with kola bou as a marital one haridas mitra says that kola bou is intended to serve as a symbolic summary for nine types of leaves nava patrika that together form a sacred complex on durga puja mitra haridas ganapati visva bharati annals 8 n d 246 cited by cohen lawrence wives of brown p
