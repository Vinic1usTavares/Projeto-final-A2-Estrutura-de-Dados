progress m1 5 was progress spacecraft which was launched by russia in 2001 to deorbit fifteen year old mir space station before it naturally fell from orbit potentially landing in a populated area russian aviation and space agency rosaviakosmos was responsible for mission launched in january 2001 after a short delay due to a problem with mir on 27 january progress m1 5 became last spacecraft to dock with station it spent two months attached to kvant 1 module before deorbiting station on 23 march 2001 mir re entered atmosphere with progress m1 5 still docked disintegrating over pacific ocean with debris falling into ocean at around 06 00 gmt during early stages of unmanned progress m1 5 mission a manned soyuz was placed on standby to launch in order to complete mission if a problem occurred decision to deorbit mir attracted both praise and criticism for rosaviakosmos while several campaigns to save station were conducted background left thumb alt picture of a space station backdropped against earth mir in orbit photo taken in 1998 from on last shuttle mir mission a progress spacecraft is attached on side nearest viewer mir was seventh and last manned space station to be launched as part of soviet space programme and was first true modular space station to be launched first component core module was launched by a proton k rocket on 19 february 1986 this had been followed by six more modules launched between 1987 and 1996 all using proton k rockets except one which was launched aboard following dissolution of soviet union mir became property of russian government and newly established russian aviation and space agency it supported 28 long duration crews visited by 40 manned soyuz and shuttle missions whilst 64 unmanned progress spacecraft were launched to support it it was visited by 125 cosmonauts and astronauts who performed 75 spacewalks during shuttle mir programme a series of american space shuttle missions visited mir between 1995 and 1998 in preparation for construction of international space station after construction of international space station began in 1998 russian resources were split between two stations in 2000 rosaviakosmos signed an agreement with mircorp to lease station for commercial use with soyuz tm 30 mission intended to prepare station for future use and conduct some commercial research being flown in later that year this was to have been followed by more missions including flights with space tourists however due to russian government being concerned about mircorp s ability to fund these missions rosaviakosmos decided against funding continued operation of mir in november 2000 rosaviakosmos decided to deorbit mir and next month prime minister mikhail signed an order to do so by this stage mir was well past end of its design life and rosaviakosmos general director yuri koptev believed that any of its systems could well fail at any time therefore it was decided to deorbit it whilst it was still functioning rather than risk it falling back to earth out of control like skylab in 1979 and salyut 7 in 1991 potentially dropping debris over a populated area at time mir was largest spacecraft ever to reenter earth s atmosphere and there were concerns that sizeable pieces of debris particularly from docking assemblies gyrodynes and external structure could survive reentry progress m1 5 which had originally been built to resupply and refuel either mir or international space station was selected to perform deorbit manoeuvre its mission earned it nickname hearse it was a progress m1 spacecraft with serial number 254 an uninhabited area of southern pacific ocean was selected for station to be deorbited into as had been done with five earlier salyut spacecraft launch and docking right thumb alt picture of a rocket launch ground near launch pad is covered in snow launch of progress m1 5 on a soyuz u rocket from baikonur cosmodrome progress m1 5 was launched by a soyuz u carrier rocket from baikonur cosmodrome kazakhstan it was originally scheduled for launch on 16 january 2001 but by first week of january it was targeting 18 january it was rolled out to launch pad on 16 january with rocket departing assembly facility at site 2 of cosmodrome at 02 00 gmt and was erected at launch pad site 1 5 within two hours of start of rollout launch was set for 06 56 26 gmt on 18 january on 18 january a problem with computers aboard mir developed shortly before fuelling of soyuz u rocket was scheduled to commence about five and a half hours before launch was due to occur launch attempt was scrubbed or cancelled and launch was expected to be delayed by four or five days on 19 january launch was rescheduled for 24 january giving controllers time to restart computer and station s gyroscopes which had shut down when computer failed preparations for launch resumed on 22 january and launch occurred successfully at 04 28 42 gmt on 24 january following launch progress m1 5 spent three days in free flight before docking with rear port of kvant 1 module of mir at 05 33 31 gmt on 27 january docking port had previously been occupied by progress m 43 which departed at 05 19 49 on 25 january and subsequently remained in orbit until progress m1 5 had docked with mir progress m 43 which had originally been launched to carry supplies and raise mir s orbit in anticipation of manned flights which were never launched was subsequently deorbited at 02 12 gmt on 29 january burning up during re entry at 02 58 free flights of progress spacecraft typically lasted two days from launch to docking with mir however progress m1 5 took three days to reach mir in order to conserve fuel for deorbit burn if it had launched on 18 january it would have spent four days in free flight after docking left thumb alt picture of front of a spacecraft identical progress m1 4 spacecraft approaching international space station progress m1 5 spent two months docked to mir before deorbit burn occurred gap between docking and deorbit was in order to allow spacecraft to dock whilst mir was still in a stable orbit but then to allow some natural decay or decrease in altitude to occur in order to conserve progress fuel controllers determined that they should wait for station s orbital altitude to reach before deorbiting it in addition rkk energia wanted to wait until after fifteenth anniversary of launch of core module on 19 february following docking mir s attitude control system was used to spin station to provide spin stabilisation in order to further conserve fuel as station had descended to an altitude at which its gyroscopes could not be used for attitude control station would remain in this spin until deorbit manoeuvres began on 20 february mir was predicted to descend to 250 kilometres within five days of 9 march by 1 march it was at an altitude of and descending at a rate of per day on 7 march russian space agency opted to delay deorbit burn until station reached as a result of natural decay in order to allow more fuel for burn giving a greater range of options in event of an anomaly during deorbit manoeuvre it was predicted that without intervention station would have naturally entered atmosphere on 28 march on 12 march computers aboard mir were reactivated ahead of deorbiting along with control system on 13 march on 14 march it was announced that procedure would be conducted on 22 march on 19 march it was delayed one day further due to a lower than expected descent rate with start of first deorbit burn being set for 00 31 gmt deorbit left thumb upright alt picture of debris burning up backdropped against sky progress m1 5 and mir disintegrate over pacific ocean progress m1 5 carried of fuel with which to perform manoeuvres to deorbit mir these were completed on 23 march when three deorbit burns were made first two using just docking and attitude control thrusters and third using main engine as well as thrusters first burn began at 00 32 28 gmt and lasted 21 5 minutes leaving mir in an orbit with a perigee of and an apogee of second burn which began at 02 24 gmt and lasted 24 minutes placed mir into a by orbit final deorbit burn began at 05 07 36 it was scheduled to last 20 minutes however flight controllers decided to let progress burn to depletion to ensure that station re entered as expected last signals from mir were received at 05 30 gmt as it passed out of range of its ground station right thumb alt map of pacific ocean with a trail running from top left corner to bottom right corner with a cross near end path taken by mir as it entered atmosphere mir re entered atmosphere over southern pacific with progress m1 5 still docked at 05 44 gmt it began to disintegrate at 05 52 beginning with detachment of solar panels followed by other peripheral structures modules then buckled before detaching completely debris came down in ocean at around 06 00 gmt debris was intended to fall at around an official statement announced that mir ceased to exist at 05 59 24 gmt final tracking of mir was conducted by a united states army site on kwajalein atoll european space agency german federal ministry of defence and us national aeronautics and space administration also assisted with tracking mir during its final orbit and reentry former cosmonaut vladimir solovyov who had been a member of first crew to visit mir led mission control team which was on station during deorbit contingency planning left thumb alt picture of back of a spacecraft soyuz tm 32 spacecraft which would have been used for an emergency mission to mir should a problem have developed like all progress spacecraft m1 5 carried two docking systems kurs and toru automated kurs system was primary docking system with toru which required manual input as backup because mir was unmanned at time of its docking and a cosmonaut aboard station would have been required to perform a toru docking or to troubleshoot any other problems during docking soyuz tm 32 spacecraft was made ready for a flight to mir should human intervention be required soyuz may also have been launched if flight control system aboard mir failed cosmonauts and pavel vinogradov were originally scheduled to have been on standby for this mission with and yuri crew who eventually flew tm 32 to international space station as backup crew however in december 2000 they were replaced by gennady and nikolai a crew which became known as expedition zero these cosmonauts were chosen because of their training for a similar emergency mission to international space station previous year which would have been launched if zvezda module had failed to dock if a manned flight had been launched controllers would have waited until after it had landed to begin deorbit of mir progress m 43 which had been launched in 2000 undocked from mir day after progress m1 5 launched and was kept in orbit until progress m1 5 docked in event that progress m1 5 had been unable to dock progress m 43 would have returned to station and provide supplies of food and oxygen for soyuz crew progress m 43 was deorbited after progress m1 5 docked successfully if progress m1 5 had launched on 16 january soyuz launch would have occurred on 10 february if it had been required it was stood down around 22 february after decaying altitude of mir made it too dangerous to send a crew to it if mir s main computer had failed after progress m1 5 had docked then flight plan would have been modified to use either station s rendezvous system or progress for control under this plan third deorbit burn would have been conducted 24 hours after first two burns with station being spin stabilised again between second and third burns controllers also planned for a failure of mir s power system which would have resulted in deorbit being delayed one day with all guidance and control functions being handled by progress spacecraft it was reported that rosaviakosmos had taken out an insurance policy worth 200 million us dollars to cover damage caused by falling debris risk of debris from station reaching land was estimated to be 3 countries located near target zone monitored events surrounding deorbit to determine whether precautions should be taken in new zealand satellite reentry committee was responsible for this whilst emergency management australia handled preparations in australia head of japanese defense agency saito postponed a trip to united states in case any debris fell on japan as station was scheduled to pass over several japanese islands on its final orbit residents of okinawa were warned to stay indoors as station passed overhead members of south pacific forum requested assurance from russia that they would not be hit by falling debris chan sek keong attorney general of singapore called for greater regulation of space debris reaction reaction to russia s announcement and subsequent execution of its plan to deorbit mir was mixed several cosmonauts expressed regrets at loss of station but support for decision to end programme vladimir titov described station as a good ship but said that he agreed with decision to prioritise international space station while vladimir said that he felt sad about mir but we have to look into future in november 2000 shortly after plans to deorbit mir were announced members of liberal democratic party of russia passed a resolution in duma lower house of russian parliament aimed at preventing it on 8 february 2001 a protest against deorbiting of station was held in moscow and a petition was subsequently sent to russian president vladimir putin gennady zyuganov first secretary of communist party of russian federation described deorbiting station to be incorrect and harmful and act of a helpless weak willed inefficient and not very responsible government iran attempted to buy space station with president mohammad khatami offering to fund it for two to three years in return for russian assistance with cosmonaut training however by this stage it was too late for such a transaction to be completed major russian ort tv station organised a national televised debate as to what should be done with station former cosmonaut georgi grechko suggested that it should be kept in orbit long enough to salvage any useful equipment from it for transfer to international space station or other spacecraft however konstantin argued that it would cost more to retrieve equipment than to replace it anatoly argued that mir should be kept because he believed that once it had been deorbited us would try to marginalise russian involvement in iss an online opinion poll showed 67 support worldwide for keeping it in orbit rosaviakosmos and rkk energia responded to criticism of decision in an open letter in mid february which explained that actual condition of onboard systems does not make possible safe and reliable operation of mir and that attempts to prolong its life may lead to loss of control of mir and as a result to catastrophic consequences not only for russia but for whole world us government welcomed decision to deorbit mir as it freed up russian resources for international space station programme space frontier foundation however criticised russian government for yielding to what it claimed was pressure from american government sff co founder rick tumlinson claimed that mir was bulldozed to make way for international space station it had previously run a campaign called keep mir alive which aimed to either secure continued operation of mir or to have it placed into a higher orbit allowing it to be stored until its operation became viable in anticipation of reentry of mir owners of taco bell towed a target measuring 12 by 12 metres 40 ft x 40 ft out into pacific ocean off coast of australia if target was hit by a falling piece of mir every person in continental united states would be entitled to a free
