antiochus xii dionysus epiphanes philopator callinicus between 124 and 109 bc 82 bc was a hellenistic seleucid monarch who reigned as king of syria between 87 and 82 bc youngest son of antiochus viii and most likely his egyptian wife tryphaena antiochus xii lived during a period of civil war between his father and his uncle antiochus ix which ended with assassination of antiochus viii in 96 bc antiochus xii s four brothers laid claim to throne eliminated antiochus ix as a claimant and waged war against his heir antiochus x by 87 bc only two claimants remained both brothers of antiochus xii demetrius iii and philip i realm of demetrius iii was initially centered in damascus but later extended over most of syria demetrius iii was defeated by philip i and went into exile in parthia allowing antiochus xii to gain control of damascus while philip i remained in syrian capital antioch antiochus xii consolidated his territory within inner syria and did not seek to expand into territories of philip i who attempted to annex damascus but was repulsed antiochus xii focused his attention on syria s southern reaches into which judaeans and nabataeans sought to expand antiochus xii reinforced his southern frontier and warred with his neighbors conducting two campaigns against nabataea that included engagements with judea after several victories in his first campaign antiochus xii was killed towards end of his second campaign against nabateans at battle of cana in 82 bc damascus was captured by forces of nabatean king aretas iii and syrian throne was claimed by

seleucid dynasty s founder seleucus i named capital of syria antioch in honor of his father antiochus antiochus xii was fifth and youngest son of antiochus viii and his ptolemaic egyptian wife tryphaena who married in 124 bc in 109 bc tryphaena was killed by antiochus viii s half brother antiochus ix who fought with antiochus viii from 113 bc for throne of syria antiochus xii s brothers were seleucus vi antiochus xi philip i and demetrius iii following antiochus viii s assassination in 96 bc his second wife tryphaena s sister cleopatra selene married antiochus ix and then his son antiochus x who fought with antiochus xii s four brothers for throne by 88 bc only demetrius iii and philip i remained demetrius iii was originally based in damascus before extending his authority to most of syria he was defeated by philip i and his parthian allies in 87 bc and exiled to parthia where he died of an unknown illness philip i took control of capital while cleopatra selene now a widow took shelter in ptolemais with her sons by antiochus x reign departure of demetrius iii left a power vacuum in damascus that was filled by antiochus xii coins minted during reign of demetrius iii are dated to seleucid year se 225 88 87 bc while earliest coins minted during reign of antiochus xii have date 226 se 87 86 bc suggesting there was a rapid assumption of power by antiochus xii monarchs of hellenistic period did not use regnal numbers which is a more modern practice but instead used epithets to distinguish themselves from similarly named monarchs three of antiochus xii s four epithets epiphanes illustrious previously used by his father philopator father loving and callinicus nobly victorious served to emphasize ancestry of his grandfather demetrius ii in contrast to line of latter s brother antiochus vii which was represented by antiochus ix and his descendants callinicus may have been an echo of demetrius ii s epithet victorious he likely used his other epithet dionysus to associate himself with greek god of wine in his role as conqueror of east antiochus xii was depicted on coinage with an exaggerated hawked nose in likeness of his father as a means of strengthening legitimacy of his succession policies and territory thumb 300px alt a coin of king antiochus xii on its reverse semitic god hadad is depicted while obverse shows king s bust tetradrachm of antiochus xii depicting semitic deity hadad on reverse according to historian alfred bellinger antiochus xii may have received assistance from ptolemaic egypt to gain his throne this view is reflected in antiochus xii s policies which were targeted at south in nabataea and judaea but not towards expansion within kingdom of syria his dominion was limited to inner syria centered on damascus which served as his capital and primary mint antiochus xii also ruled over town of gadara governed by an official named philotas in 100 bc gadara had been conquered by hasmonean king of judea alexander jannaeus who partially destroyed its walls but it was recaptured by seleucids in 93 bc gadara held great strategic importance for syria as it served as a major military hub for operations in south controlling it was vital to war effort against judaeans which led antiochus to rebuild city s defenses in 228 se 85 84 bc historian aryeh kasher suggested that antiochus xii dug what first century historian josephus called trench of antiochus or valley of antiochus to protect damascus from nabataeans trench was probably located in hula valley seleucid coins often had depictions of their greek deities but silver coinage of antiochus xii depicted supreme semitic god hadad on reverse possibly in recognition of shrinking borders of kingdom which convinced monarch of importance of local cults by promoting indigenous deities seleucid kings hoped to gain support of their non greek subjects according to bellinger use of hadad indicated that antiochus xii placed focus on his intention of being first and foremost king of damascus during his reign demetrius iii had also depicted a semitic deity atargatis on his currency in view of historian change of coin imagery from atargatis to hadad probably served two goals to imply that antiochus xii had a different policy focus than his predecessor and to demonstrate his intention of maintaining a good relationship with semitic population of damascus who comprised majority of inhabitants to avoid tension with greek settlers seleucid kings presented themselves as protectors of hellenism and patronized intellectuals and philosophers but antiochus xii may have adopted a different attitude he ordered expulsion of such scholars military campaigns alt a map depicting syria and its neighbours in 87 bc showing limits of antiochus xii and his opponents territories 300px thumb syria in 87 bc early in his reign antiochus xii attacked nabataeans and judaeans whose territories both lay south of his own this conflict was recorded by josephus although he made no mention of name of nabataean king josephus mentioned two campaigns against nabataeans but did not explain motives leading syrian king to attack them modern scholars presented several theories in view of israel shatzman antiochus xii may have feared growing power of nabataeans who were expanding into southern syria zayn suggested that antiochus xii wanted to take control over nabataeans crude oil industry while alexander and oren tal suggested that nabataeans actively supported philip i in his attempts to take control over antiochus xii s realm first nabataean campaign and incursions of philip i antiochus xii s first nabataean campaign was launched in 87 bc and might have included a battle near motho modern in region of hauran as proposed by historian hans peter roschinski who drew on writings of stephanus of byzantium byzantine historian preserved in his book ethica fragments from a lost work by historian uranius of apamea who wrote a book titled arabica which has been dated to 300 ad in account of uranius king antigonus i bc is killed at motho by a king of arabs named rabbel name motho could refer to a northern city in hauran or a southern city in moab name of antigonus was regularly corrected to antiochus by different scholars who believed that uranius was referring to antiochus xii roschinski considered it conceivable that stephanus was conflating two events taking place during reign of nabataean king rabbel i a battle of antiochus xii s first nabataean campaign at motho in north and battle from second nabataean campaign in which antiochus xii was killed shatzman on other hand noted that nowhere in his work did stephanus indicate that battle of motho took place in north taking advantage of his brother s absence philip i seized damascus aided by governor of city s citadel milesius who opened gates to him according to josephus milesius received no reward from philip i who attributed betrayal to general s fear leading milesius to betray philip i who had left city to attend an event in nearby hippodrome general closed gates locking philip i out and awaited return of antiochus xii who had hastily ended his campaign when he heard of his brother s occupation of city modern scholars noted that seleucid currency struck during campaigns against a rival or usurper portrayed king sporting a beard during his first two years antiochus xii s visage appeared beardless but this changed in 228 se 85 84 bc this is possibly related to philip i s attack on damascus but this supposition has little support as antiochus xii failed to take any action against his brother no coins were minted during period that philip i held damascus indicating only a brief occupation of city second nabataean campaign war in judea and death although his territory directly abutted nabataean territory for his second nabataean campaign antiochus xii instead chose to march his forces through judaea along coast probably to attack nabataean dominated negev which would have cut off port city of gaza threatened nabataean mediterranean trade and curbed nabataean ambitions in transjordan this route would have allowed antiochus xii to keep alexander jannaeus at bay according to josephus judaean king feared antiochus xii s intentions and ordered yannai line to be built which consisted of a trench that fronted a defensive wall dotted with wooden towers trench stretched from to sea near joppa antiochus xii leveled trench burned fortifications and continued his march into nabataean territory account of campaign written by josephus is subject to some debate historian wrote that antiochus xii s forces defeated those of alexander jannaeus but eighth century historian george syncellus mentioned a defeat suffered by antiochus xii at hands of judaean king existence of yannai line has been questioned by several historians and josephus explanation of alexander jannaeus attempt to stop march of antiochus xii because of his fears of latter s intentions is unsatisfactory both nabataeans and syrians were enemies of judea and it would have been to alexander jannaeus benefit if those two powers were in conflict syncellus may have been referring to an earlier confrontation between syrian king and alexander jannaeus thus statement of syncellus supports notion that antiochus xii s second nabataean campaign was also aimed at judea perhaps antiochus xii sought to annex coastal cities of alexander jannaeus as a retribution for defeat mentioned by syncellus another objective would be subduing judaeans to keep them from attacking syria while antiochus xii was busy in nabataea final engagement between forces of antiochus xii and nabataeans occurred near village of cana location of which is unknown but is generally assumed by modern scholars to be southwest of dead sea historian siegfried considered it to be synonymous with qina modern day horvat as mentioned by josephus in book 15 of his antiquities details of battle as written by josephus spoke of nabataeans employing a feigned retreat then counterattacking syrian forces before their ranks could be ordered antiochus xii managed to rally his troops and weathered attack but he fought in front lines jeopardizing his life and he eventually fell year of antiochus xii s death is debated but his last coins struck in damascus are dated to 230 se 83 82 bc aftermath and legacy alt a coin of king antiochus xii on its reverse greek god zeus is depicted while obverse have king s bust thumb 300px a coin of antiochus xii with zeus depicted on reverse according to josephus death of king resulted in a rout of syrian forces with many being killed in field or during retreat survivors of rout sheltered in cana where most died of starvation antiochus xii was last energetic seleucid king little is recorded of philip i after his attempt at annexing damascus which was left without a protector after death of antiochus xii fearing ruler ptolemy of chalcis people of damascus invited aretas iii of nabataea to take city numismatist oliver d hoover suggested that aretas iii did not hold damascus for long before city returned to seleucid possession identity of antiochus xii s wife remains unknown but according to sixth century historian john malalas whose work is considered generally unreliable by scholars king had two daughters cleopatra and antiochis cleopatra selene who went into hiding after death of antiochus x in 224 se 89 88 bc took advantage of antiochus xii s death and declared her son antiochus xiii king with herself as queen regent and regnant coins struck during her regency show marks of damascus mint archeologist nicholas l wright suggested that cleopatra selene s takeover of damascus took place after 80 bc josephus called antiochus xii last seleucid king and malalas according to translation of historian glanville downey followed suit last seleucid king was in fact antiochus xiii who was dethroned in 64 bc after antioch
