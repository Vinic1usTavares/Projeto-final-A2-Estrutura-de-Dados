introduced compsognathus and pteranodon as well as new designs for game s tyrannosaurus rex and velociraptor matching their original appearance in first film reception critics praised dinosaurs featured in game sam loveridge of gamesradar liked variety as well as cutscene that was displayed when a dinosaur is released from incubation center she enjoyed being able to control jeep and acu helicopter from a third person perspective a mechanic she applauds for allowing players to relate to dinosaurs she added that she lost entire evenings to game without even thinking due to its relaxing nature game revolutions paul tamburro praised dinosaurs design in particular frontier s attention to detail and dinosaurs animation james swinbanks of gamespot agreed praising dinosaurs he also enjoyed need to learn each dinosaur s personality requirements and behaviors adding process is surprisingly satisfying game informer s daniel tack liked that players can experiment with different genes though he commented that it was not a freeform experience dan stapleton of ign disagreed and felt that unlocking genes was tedious describing process as a series of mandatory robotic actions while he liked dinosaur variety he lamented lack of pterosaurs and aquatic prehistoric reptiles at launch destructoids dam roemer commended inclusion of lesser known dinosaurs species singling out giganotosaurus and deinonychus simulation aspect of game received mixed reviews loveridge held a positive opinion regarding dinosaur management as each species has their own needs and niches that players must fulfill he felt park management aspect including construction of facilities and utilities was minimal tamburro compared simulation to rollercoaster tycoon and zoo tycoon he enjoyed chaos created when dinosaurs break out but he was disappointed that dinosaurs did not attack park s staff carrying out maintenance inside enclosures philippa warr of pc gamer praised dinosaurs but criticized lack of attention to missions and individual guests views and happiness ratings on park she also noted simulation lacked depth as buildings looked largely same and environment soon became stale swinbanks felt dealing with natural disasters and dinosaur breakout was exciting initially but soon became repetitive he also lamented lack of new challenges presented in later stage of game tack criticized tiresome aspect of simulation and constant need to wait for objectives to be completed comparing them to a mobile game describing simulation as shallow roemer criticized lack of time constraints cleanliness ratings and a full day night cycle he was also disappointed by small size of each island which made park building unfulfilling stapleton agreed saying that small islands limited players creativity he noted that players cannot speed up time in game a signature feature in many other simulators and builders and criticized its exclusion as it forced players to wait aimlessly to get enough cash to perform an action game s contracts garnered mixed opinions loveridge believed they helped introduced a structure to game though he commented that these missions did not form a cohesive narrative tamburro enjoyed process of progressing from one island to next as each island has its own unique layout and landscape prompting players to create a new park that is different from previous ones he noted that contracts helped players to unlock new items but he felt they were not exciting warr criticized lack of variety featured in missions with different scenarios only presenting minor modifications and adjusting difficult slightly he also disliked contracts for occasionally forcing players to complete missions that do not make sense such as releasing a dinosaur to kill guests swinbanks also criticized three contract factions adding that players need to satisfy and balance all three parties demands as arbitrary roemer praised goldblum s performance though he noted overarching plot goes nowhere he described game s progression system as awful and wished to skip them entirely game s tutorial and guidance to players was criticized loveridge noted that certain missions were confusing with some late game objectives being presented too early forcing him to dismiss them to progress he singled out tutorial section for being incompetent failing to inform players about key aspects of game such as power distribution and landscaping tools which often create obstruction and terrain errors that prevent players from constructing certain buildings and modifying landscape warr noted pacing errors with tutorials saying that some of them showed up way too late reviewers had mixed opinions of game as a whole loveridge called it an intricate simulation game that fans of series would enjoy and he commended many references to film featured in game tamburro agreed and called it best jurassic park themed game though he noted that game had more constraints than frontier s previous park builder planet coaster initially impressed by game warr was disappointed after extended play time feeling game was lacking depth swinbanks noted that despite its shortcomings game was faithful to franchise he felt that it was a good park management sim in its own right roemer felt that game s development was rushed and lack of depth was problematic stapleton called it a bad game for being largely boring sales five weeks after its initial release game had sold one million copies through digital and physical sales seven months after game s initial release frontier declared game its biggest launch and revealed that more than 2 million copies were sold accolades game was nominated for best audio design at 2018 golden joystick awards losing to god
