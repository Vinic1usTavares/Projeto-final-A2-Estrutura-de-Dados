tennessee new orleans louisiana louisville kentucky las vegas nevada and san diego california before settling on move to memphis at end of season first four grizzlies seasons had given average attendance in middle third of league however last two seasons saw a reduction to among league s lowest attendances participating reasons were team s poor performance and 1998 99 nba lockout contributing to conditions for relocation were a weak canadian dollar unwillingness of some u s players to live in canada and lack of local ownership background memphis has previously hosted a major professional basketball team in american basketball association aba founded as new orleans buccaneers in 1967 franchise moved to memphis in 1970 becoming known as pros team changed its name to tams

canada grizzlies were owned by vancouver canucks owner arthur griffiths his company was in process of building general motors place gm place for canucks and saw grizzlies as an additional tenant both canadian teams vancouver grizzlies and toronto raptors were hampered by nba s decision to deny them one of top five picks in first draft and teams would not be allowed a top draft pick in following three seasons even if they should win lottery teams were also hindered from using their full salary cap first two seasons for all six seasons in vancouver grizzlies had a terrible record they finished seventh of seven in five seasons and claimed one sixth place in midwest division never close to reaching playoffs team won 101 games and lost 359 giving a winning percentage of 220 change of ownership on march 7 1995 six months before grizzlies began play majority of holding company was sold from griffiths to seattle based john mccaw jr on november 12 1996 mccaw bought rest of company he stated that he was committed to retaining team in vancouver griffiths was forced to sell canucks and grizzlies following cost overruns that occurred on gm place and expansion fees to start grizzlies had made his company illiquid in 1999 mccaw started attempts to sell either orca bay or grizzlies and at first negotiated an agreement with dennis washington owner of who had a large portion of his operations in vancouver washington initially agreed to purchase 50 of orca bay with intent of keeping teams in vancouver instead mccaw used washington s bid to leverage a higher sales price with bill laurie who offered us 148 million for grizzlies and a us 52 million bonus if team ultimately relocated to st louis announcement was made in september 1999 one month after laurie had bought nhl team st louis blues and their home venue kiel center now enterprise center st louis had not been home of an nba franchise since hawks franchise relocated to atlanta in 1968 kiel center had annual sell out for 15 to 17 basketball games for saint louis university billikens after deal was announced nba commissioner david stern stated that he was opposed to a relocation as no nba franchise had moved since 1985 when kansas city kings relocated to sacramento california he stated that his goal was that grizzlies remain in vancouver and succeed there nba board of governors finance committee also made negative statements as purchase agreement was structured with incentives to move team deal was then renegotiated before board could vote on issue on january 21 2001 laurie announced that he had paid mccaw an undisclosed amount to walk away from deal four days later on january 25 it was announced that grizzlies was sold to chicago based michael heisley for us 160 million at a press conference he stated that he had support of stern that he was committed to keeping franchise in vancouver to making it a winning team and that he was an owner that was committed to market reasons for relocation thumb upright former commissioner of nba david stern initially opposed team s planned relocation from vancouver dick versace grizzlies president of basketball operations stated in final vancouver season that company was losing us 40 million per season these numbers were questioned by richard peddie ceo of raptors as grizzlies had a salary cap of us 48 million retrospectively heisley stated that he lost us 87 million on owning grizzlies although that included a us 30 million relocation fee to nba versace stated that he felt that team did not get sufficient support from business community colin jones university of victoria professor in sports economics stated that it was difficult to attract corporate sponsors as long as team was losing so many games grizzlies lack of good draft picks lead to team failing to win thus losing revenue he also noted that team never sought help in general business community regarding management issues stu jackson general manager for first five seasons made several non optimal player selection decisions this included selecting bryant reeves in 1995 draft and signing him to a us 65 million six year contract extension in 1997 putting grizzlies in a salary cap squeeze from then he consequently drafted point guards including antonio daniels who failed to develop jackson traded a 2003 first round pick for otis thorpe who hated vancouver he signed free agent tony massenburg for us 1 5 million just to sign isaac austin for us 5 5 million and leave massenburg on bench griffiths retrospectively stated that draft conditions from nba did not allow franchise to build a winning team in years and that nba had asked too high a price for not providing means of a suitable income however he did draft shareef abdur rahim and his hands were tied when top pick steve francis refused to play for vancouver on other hand raptors succeeded in drafting vince carter reached playoffs in 1999 2000 season and played consistently in front of sell out crowds location of team in canada was a major contributor at time exchange rate was 67 u s cents to canadian dollar because revenue was collected in canadian dollars but player and coach salaries were paid in u s dollars team ended up spending an undue amount of its revenue on salaries 1998 99 lockout was pivoting point for home game attendance while whole league experienced a drop in attendance after lockout vancouver experienced an even larger fall average attendance in 1997 98 was 16 108 ranking 16th in league while it fell to 13 899 in 1999 00 ranking 27th retrospectively griffiths stated that heisley intentionally ran team financially aground by alienating people running insufficient marketing and claiming basketball did not work in vancouver while running team griffiths had not lost millions and millions and he stated that vancouver had a better fan base than most nba teams statements were denied by heisley proposed cities thumb left memphis pyramid then known as pyramid arena was home venue for grizzlies from 2001 to 2004 with public announcement in mid february of possible relocation of team heisley and representatives for grizzlies set out on a road trip to consider several u s cities which wanted to have franchise relocate to their city originally heisley had until march 1 to apply to nba for a relocation but deadline was later extended to march 26 a similar deadline was also awarded to charlotte hornets who was also considering a relocation in february 2001 louisville board of aldermen contacted grizzlies in an attempt to relocate team to louisville kentucky city lacked a suitable venue but state and local officials agreed to build a new us 200 million arena if nba franchise relocated to city in addition tricon global restaurants now yum brands would offer heisley us 5 million per year for 20 years to locate team in louisville ultimately while grizzlies did not move there city built its own nba suitable arena in 2010 called kfc yum center it houses university of louisville s basketball program memphis relocation effort was led by autozone founder pitt hyde who promised to purchase 50 of team city had a venue pyramid arena completed in 1991 which could be used as a temporary home until a new us 250 million venue was ready for use in 2004 venue would be publicly financed through sales tax rebates government backed bonds and hotel and car rental taxes memphis efforts to get an nba team had started in 1997 following relocation of tennessee titans of national football league to nashville new orleans mayor marc morial stated that he had approached heisley in an attempt to attract grizzlies to his city city had opened us 114 million new orleans arena now smoothie king center in 1999 and offered it as a home to franchise area s economic development chamber stated that they had secured guarantees for purchasing suites season tickets and club seating from businesses to extent that there was a waiting list for suites also a relocation to st louis under same conditions as with laurie was considered thumb arrowhead pond of anaheim home of anaheim ducks was considered as a relocation site another option was to relocate to anaheim in greater los angeles area houston rockets had looked into relocation to anaheim previous season with arrowhead pond of anaheim now honda center as home venue however nhl team then was known as mighty ducks of anaheim had an agreement that any other tenant at pond should share revenues with their then owner walt disney company although disney stated they were willing to negotiate terms there are also two existing clubs in los angeles lakers and clippers which would make media market small and limit revenue buffalo new york announced interest in attracting grizzlies city had an appropriate venue in hsbc arena now keybank center home of buffalo sabres nhl ice hockey franchise mayor anthony a former college basketball star stated that attempt was a long shot but worth try city previously hosted an nba franchise in buffalo braves from 1970 to 1978 which was only dismantled because paul snyder who owned team from 1971 to 1976 was feuding with other teams that used buffalo s only arena at time buffalo memorial auditorium some of those conflicts were no longer issues with new arena and snyder was still active in business at time of grizzlies bid braves became san diego clippers in 1978 and moved to los angeles in 1984 san diego was also mentioned as a potential site for grizzlies although city lacked a suitable venue heisley visited las vegas nevada where he negotiated with mayor oscar goodman city offered team free land for a new arena but would not pay for construction other issue was stern s demand that casinos stop accepting bets on nba games as a precondition of placing a team in las vegas strongest bids were memphis louisville anaheim and new orleans as latter two had venues in place they were seen as having an edge on other two both memphis and louisville needed public funding for a new venue and in either city team would have to play in a sub optimal location for several seasons however construction of a new venue was seen as an advantage by grizzlies as it could be tailor made for basketball and team would be able to control all revenue team also expected highest local radio and television broadcasting rights in louisville and memphis and that two cities lacked other big four major league teams granting team preferred air times and increased attention from fans and media a 2000 report from pricewaterhousecoopers concluded that small cities often had higher attendance than larger cities because of team s professional league exclusivity it also pointed to strong support for college basketball in tennessee and kentucky relocation in vancouver organization save grizzlies was established to find a local investor to purchase team led by among others peter ufford they had a plan to create a public entity which could take over ownership of team ufford retrospectively stated that had attempt been given more time they may have been able to secure a deal to keep team in town but that relocation decision came too quickly for any plan to be finalized heisley stated that he had been willing to sell team with a 30 discount to a vancouver investor if he could secure a guarantee that team would remain in town thumb right a ticket from grizzlies final home game in vancouver on march 26 2001 heisley announced that he had selected memphis memphis and louisville were most promising cities with heisley selecting memphis because it offered a better deal and because of poor local executive leadership in louisville choice would still have to be studied by a five member nba group before permission was granted from league team s final game at gm place was a 100 95 loss against houston rockets on april 14 team s final game as a vancouver based franchise was a road 95 81 win against golden state warriors on april 18 nba relocation committee gave its approval for move to memphis in late june and on july 3 board of governors unanimously approved relocation this also permitted hyde to purchase a minority share of franchise by then team administration had already relocated and day before final decision team set up its rookie camp at rhodes college a relocation party was held on july 7 a week before move grizzlies traded away two of top players shareef abdur rahim and guard mike bibby who therefore never played for memphis unlike all other major professional sports teams that moved from canada to u s grizzlies did not adopt a new nickname a factor in this decision was that memphis already had a history with grizzlies name and one which had a canadian connection toronto northmen of ill fated world football league who had faced legal obstacles in their bid to play american football in canada moved to memphis before playing a game and were officially rebranded memphis southmen southmen name was so unpopular with fans that team became known during its brief existence as grizzlies on a semi official basis aftermath move to memphis did not solve grizzlies financial problems and as of 2011 team s cumulative loss was us 100 million team did manage a 50 win season and reach playoffs four times but failed to advance in playoffs until 2010 11 season as of 2011 grizzlies remain according to forbes third least valuable nba franchise at us 266 million attendance did not exceed vancouver levels for more than a decade after move grizzlies averaged 13 737 spectators in their first season in memphis first season in which they exceeded vancouver attendance levels was 2012 13 when they averaged 16 624 grizzlies were first nba relocation since kansas city kings relocated to sacramento california and became sacramento kings in 1985 it was followed by two others in same decade first was relocation of original charlotte hornets to new orleans in 2002 with team becoming new orleans hornets now pelicans that relocation is no longer treated by league as such after 2013 14 season franchise then known as charlotte bobcats reclaimed hornets name and also received sole rights to history of hornets in charlotte second was in 2008 when seattle supersonics relocated to become oklahoma city thunder in nhl two teams were moved from canada to u s during mid 1990s quebec nordiques became colorado avalanche in 1995 and winnipeg jets became phoenix coyotes in 1996 and were rebranded as arizona coyotes in 2014 a new winnipeg jets team returned to city by relocation of atlanta thrashers in 2011 in 2005 one of canada s two major league baseball teams montreal expos relocated to washington d c and became washington nationals failure of vancouver franchise was part of reason nba changed expansion drafting rules following return of charlotte to league as bobcats in 2005 bobcats were allowed to pick fourth in their first draft and were later not restricted from first picks thumb left fedexforum has been grizzlies home venue since 2004 in a major change from 2001 when one unnamed former nba executive stated that a franchise would not return to vancouver in his lifetime stern revealed in february 2011 that vancouver was being considered along with pittsburgh tampa and kansas city reasons for considering vancouver are strengthening of canadian dollar which for several years in early 2010s was roughly at par with u s dollar influx of international players who would be more willing to play in canada sell outs for pre season exhibition games at rogers arena current name of what was once general motors place vancouver having a state of art venue and an increased realization among nba executives that vancouver failure was not predominantly because of lack of interest for basketball in vancouver note also that nba executive who stated that league would not return to vancouver in his lifetime was still alive at time of this story city has also been through a resurrection in professional sports with creation of vancouver giants in junior hockey 2010 winter olympics and vancouver whitecaps fc joining major league soccer however location of city also allows for more varied sports experiences such as skiing hunting fishing and golf which could partially limit interest for spectator sports in addition canadian dollar dramatically weakened against its u s counterpart later in decade dropping as low as 68 u s cents during 2016 nhl commissioner gary bettman cited this as a major reason why league deferred quebec city s bid to rejoin nhl in 2011 ownership group of canucks now owned by francesco aquilini announced they were considering purchasing hornets in december 2010 hornets were bought by league and there was potential for relocation due to club s financial difficulties however a hornets move was effectively taken off table in 2012 when tom benson a new orleans native who already owned nfl s new orleans saints purchased team one year later aquilini denied rumours that he wanted to purchase sacramento kings from maloof family aquilini expressed that while rogers arena is ready for basketball having nba in vancouver comes down to market support which his company assesses to see if it has improved since grizzlies left see also relocation of professional sports teams list of relocated
