constitution was ratified congress and many government offices came to be housed in philadelphia including newborn mint of united states adam eckfeldt built first screw press for new facility in 1792 same year that mint act of 1792 was passed by congress authorizing a mint and cut obverse die for experimental birch cent of that year he also built other machinery for mint and helped early coining thumb eckfeldt s 1792 press displayed beneath dunsmore painting depicting him in 1792 mint acquired three balances from eckfeldt who also lent mint his lathe used for turning dies eckfeldt is believed to have made die from which 1792 half disme considered by some first official u s coin was struck in 1829 a visitor to mint met eckfeldt and later described him as an artist who made first die used in it other later accounts document eckfeldt s role in this striking an 1863 auction sold a half disme supposedly given by eckfeldt to demonstrate his work eckfeldt is given as source for tradition that half dismes were struck at request of president george washington to be used as presents eckfeldt operated his screw press to strike these roughly 1 500 pieces on july 13 1792 since first philadelphia mint was still under construction at time these coins were produced in cellar of john harper saw maker at sixth and cherry streets in philadelphia in his annual message to congress late that year washington noted ongoing construction of a mint building and stated there has also been a small beginning in coinage of half dismes want of small coins in circulation calling first attention to them thumb left obverse of 1792 half disme eckfeldt also produced a pattern disme of which only a few were struck when mint s first cents produced in 1793 were found to be excessively crude and attracted public ridicule eckfeldt was called upon to design replacements he placed a wreath on back of cent instead of original chain and placed a trefoil under liberty s head on obverse he also engraved first half cent dies later same year eckfeldt continued to work intermittently for philadelphia mint in 1793 he built a device for automatically feeding planchets into die collar and ejecting struck coins and mint s records reveal that he did there in july 1795 by october 1795 he was on mint s payroll as a die forger and turner at a salary of 500 per year on january 1 1796 mint director elias boudinot appointed him as assistant coiner with consent of president washington his duties in that capacity were broad in 1805 at boudinot s request eckfeldt eliminated a security problem for mint by renting two houses adjacent to its operations allowing it to shut an internal alley to public access following year new mint director robert patterson requested a pay increase of 200 for eckfeldt writing to president thomas jefferson that eckfeldt had management of whole coining department when dies used proved too brittle and cracked easily eckfeldt came up with idea of spraying water on face of die so steel would temper evenly as a boy inventor george sellers knew eckfeldt as sellers s father was partner in a firm which sold machinery to mint bureau eckfeldt often dined at his house in final years both of 19th century and of sellers s life he published his memoirs including memories of first philadelphia mint he recalled in 1812 peering through a window to see cents coined and eckfeldt coming into room to stop work at end of day seeing young sellers he had boy come in had him place a cent planchet on press and struck it for him sellers nearly dropped it because it was so hot and eckfeldt reminded him it had been cold when placed in press eckfeldt bade him keep coin until he learned why cent had become hot and then he could spend it on candy chief coiner thumb left silver replica of

quarter century during his tenure he continued to improve machinery at philadelphia mint eckfeldt set aside master coins coins struck with extra care using new dies and polished planchets he also put aside interesting foreign coins sent to mint as bullion these pieces became mint s cabinet or coin collection to fill gaps in this collection he used old dies to strike postdated coins specialists have discovered that some dies he chose for this purpose had not been used together to strike coins for commerce thus creating unique specimens among pieces acquired for mint was a brasher doubloon of which only six are known today eckfeldt often spent from his own funds to acquire coins for mint collection eventually evolved into smithsonian institution s national numismatic collection in 1828 eckfeldt again became involved in real estate transactions to expand operations at philadelphia mint for 1 000 he purchased one of lots he had rented in 1805 after mint moved to new premises in 1830s eckfeldt discovered that lot he had purchased had a cloud or irregularity on its title he was able to clear it and sold it in 1837 for same sum for which he had bought it new mint building was at juniper and chestnut streets only six blocks from eckfeldt s home at juniper and vine sellers in his memoirs described eckfeldt as a man of staunch integrity a cautious careful orderly and painstaking man he was not one of dashing pushing inventive mechanics though under his care many apparently slight improvements were gradually adopted that in aggregate amounted to a great deal in economy of working he was by no means deficient in inventive ability nevertheless as eckfeldt aged in service of mint in late 1820s and into 1830s he was reluctant to adopt innovations being proposed by his fellow mint officer melter and refiner franklin peale peale like eckfeldt of a mechanical bent had many suggestions for improvements to coinage machinery some of which eckfeldt adopted eckfeldt stated to sellers if mr peale had full swing he would turn everything upside down according to sellers giving up of almost life long pets that had been mr eckfeldt s constant care would naturally go hard and still harder coming from another department but as improvements gradually crept in and proved their efficiency mr eckfeldt gave full credit where it belonged and i remember him becoming quite enthusiastic over labor saving in use of contamin portrait lathe in duplicating working dies thumb left actual gold medal presented to eckfeldt in 1839 in 1833 peale was sent on a tour of european mints and came home with ideas for new machines and innovations including introduction of steam power used at britain s royal mint since 1810 on equipment purchased from firm of boulton watt although eckfeldt would have preferred to apply steam to existing coin presses a new one was built for steam power and commemorative medals were first pieces struck by steam at philadelphia mint in early 1836 in 1839 eckfeldt retired after 25 years as chief coiner and over forty as a mint employee his fellow officers at mint presented him with a gold medal with silver and bronze duplicates also struck obverse was designed by philadelphia engraver moritz fuerst who sometimes did work for mint reverse may be by fuerst or by peale eckfeldt recommended peale as his successor and peale was appointed nevertheless eckfeldt continued to perform functions of chief coiner without pay until a few days before his death on february 6 1852 after eckfeldt s death peale wrote what taxay terms a frantic letter to mint director george n eckert seeking appointment of an assistant peale had spent freed up time designing and selling medals for private gain private and family life thumb right reverse of
