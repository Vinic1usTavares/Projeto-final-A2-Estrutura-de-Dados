sms zieten was first torpedo armed aviso built for imperial german navy kaiserliche marine she was built in britain in 1875 1876 and was last major warship built for germany by a foreign shipyard ordered as a testbed for new whitehead torpedo zieten was armed with a pair of torpedo tubes and was capable of a top speed of making her fastest ship in german fleet at time zieten was first torpedo armed vessel in a series of avisos that ultimately developed into first light cruisers in addition to her impact in german warship design zieten also influenced numerous other navies who built dozens of similar avisos and torpedo vessels of their own zieten served for first two decades of her career with torpedo boat flotilla in 1878 1880 she was captained by alfred von tirpitz future architect of high seas fleet in 1882 she cruised mediterranean sea with several other german warships and was present during british bombardment of alexandria where she protected german interests zieten was used as a fishery protection ship from 1899 until 1914 when outbreak of world war i necessitated her mobilization as a coastal patrol ship she served in this capacity for duration of war and was stricken from naval register in december 1919 ship was finally sold for scrapping in august 1921 after forty five years of service design in 1869 prussian navy sent then korvettenkapitan alexander von monts to austria to examine new whitehead torpedoes then being developed there albrecht von stosch commander in chief of new imperial german navy approved a plan to develop a torpedo arm for german fleet and placed monts in charge of program in 1873 that year stosch s naval construction program called for a tender for new torpedo boats gottschall p 48 tender was ordered from british firm thames iron works and named zieten she was to be last major warship purchased by german navy from a foreign shipyard dunlap p 957 in addition to planned role as a tender for torpedo boats she was also intended to serve as a test platform for new self propelled torpedo up to mid 1870s german navy had only experimented with a handful of torpedo ships all of which were equipped with old spar torpedo sondhaus p 115 ship s design provided basis for both later german avisos and all subsequent light cruisers gardiner p 249 but also to numerous foreign designs such as several classes of french italian and austrian avisos and torpedo craft ropp pp 130 131 136 general characteristics zieten was long at waterline and long overall she had a beam of and a draft of forward she displaced as designed and up to at full combat load hull was constructed with transverse iron frames and contained eight watertight compartments initially zieten had only a small bridge forward but in 1899 a new superstructure was built it included a conning tower with a compass platform a chart house was also added forward of funnel groner pp 88 89 zieten was a good sea boat with a gentle motion but she was very crank she was very maneuverable but she handled poorly in a head sea in bad weather she took on considerable amounts of water and was very dangerous ship had a crew of 6 officers and 88 enlisted men though later in her career figure rose to 7 and 99 respectively during her career as a fishery protection ship it rose further to 7 officers and 104 sailors zieten carried a number of smaller boats one picket boat one cutter two yawls and one dinghy later in her career picket boat was removed and two barges were added machinery ships propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 2 cylinder double expansion engines manufactured by john penn and sons engines drove two 3 bladed propellers that were wide in diameter steam was provided by six coal fired cylindrical boilers also manufactured by john penn and sons which were trunked into a single funnel amidships boilers were replaced with new models in 1891 during a refit at kaiserliche werft shipyard in kiel as built zieten was fitted with a schooner rig with a sail area of to supplement her steam engines but this was later reduced to only an auxiliary gaff sail engines were rated at but only managed to reach at maximum power with new boilers engines reached her top speed as designed was to have been but with her original boilers she could make at full power this speed nevertheless made zieten fastest ship in german fleet with new boilers she could steam at up to zieten could carry up to of coal which allowed her to steam for at a cruising speed of groner p 88 during refit she also had one electricity generator with an output of at 67 volts installed armament primary armament consisted of a pair of torpedo tubes both were submerged in hull one in bow and one in stern they were supplied with a total of ten whitehead torpedoes these powerful weapons coupled with ship s high speed and maneuverability made her a formidable vessel for period in 1878 forward torpedo tube was relocated to a swivel launched mounted on deck and two guns were installed gottschall p 53 she was also equipped with six machine guns later in her career torpedo tubes were removed due to their obsolescence and she was rearmed with six sk l 40 guns though two were later removed guns were supplied with a total of 864 rounds of ammunition and could engage targets out to she was also equipped to lay naval mines and she could carry 49 of them service history zieten was built by thames iron works in london she was laid down in 1875 and was launched on 9 march 1876 she was completed on 15 july 1876 gardiner p 256 and commissioned into german fleet on 1 august she was thereafter used in experiments with early torpedoes and as a tender for torpedo boats groner p 89 in 1876 otto von diederichs served aboard ship as her executive officer in her first crew in august ship conducted sea trials in north sea before arriving in wilhelmshaven on 11 august for fitting out work diederichs supervised installation of ship s torpedo tubes along with magazine for storing torpedoes work lasted until september which prevented zieten from participating in annual august september fleet exercises as a result she was placed in reserve on 17 september for winter in march 1877 diederichs returned to ship and prepared her for service in training season that year gottschall p 50 ship was ready for active duty by 11 june and thereafter conducted further sea trials and torpedo training gottschall pp 51 52 after zieten entered service in june 1877 diederichs was replaced by alfred von tirpitz who took over torpedo testing while he was assigned to torpedo school at kiel diederichs meanwhile readied old gunboat as a tender for zieten on 18 september zieten and scorpion participated in first major test of new whitehead torpedoes in german navy during exercises zieten scored three hits on a stationary target which was deemed a great success after conclusion of maneuvers zieten was placed in reserve on 2 october for winter gottschall p 52 analysis of testing showed that bow mounted torpedo tube was not satisfactory and so diederichs was tasked with redesigning her armament in january 1878 diederichs moved bow tube to a swivel mount on her deck and added two 12 cm guns to improve her defense against small warships refit work was completed by 16 april 1878 permitting tirpitz to take command of ship on 6 may he served as ship s commander until august 1880 kelly pp 50 52 tirpitz as commander of germany s torpedo boat flotilla staunchly advocated development of torpedo craft rather than a fleet of battleships ropp p 134 in july 1880 during maneuvers with fleet zieten torpedoed and sank old paddle steamer sondhaus p 141 in 1882 zieten joined a cruising squadron that consisted of corvettes and steamer and a gunboat for operations in mediterranean sea ships were present during british bombardment of alexandria in august 1882 they sent men ashore to protect german embassy along with a german run hospital sondhaus p 143 in july zieten joined a squadron of ships to take newly crowned kaiser wilhelm ii for a tour of baltic ports which included a visit to tsar alexander iii of russia sondhaus p 177 ship was assigned as dispatch vessel for reserve squadron in north sea in 1898 along with coastal defense ships and journal of royal united service institution 1898 p 484 starting in 1899 zieten was used intermittently as a fishery protection ship in september 1902 zieten participated in final exercises during annual fleet maneuvers journal of royal united service institution 1902 p 1610 her career as a fishery protection ship lasted until 1914 when she was mobilized at outbreak of world war i in august she was used as a coast guard ship for duration of conflict after germany s defeat zieten was stricken from naval register on 6 december 1919 ship was sold on 18 august 1921 for 655 000 marks and broken up in wilhelmshaven notes references category 1876 ships category avisos of imperial german navy
