repetition of sevens and threes has inspired many interpretations engravings upon which carvings are based were commonplace in scotland at time and were frequently used in art of memory a mnemonic memory technique associated with freemasonry art of memory had become a feature throughout scottish culture from court of queen anne danish consort of james vi to lodges of operative stonemasons potential influence of danish astronomer tycho brahe s symbolic garden at which was visited by james iv of scotland in 1590 has also been noted glendinning et al p 59 sir david lindsay would have been well aware of symbolic allusions of carvings in correspondence with his brother lord menmuir he discusses relationship of planets to metals which he had employed hans ziegler to search for on his land sir david s nephew david lindsay 1st lord balcarres was noted for his interest in alchemy and rosicrucians historian adam mclean has suggested that garden is associated with rosicrucians and should be seen as an early 17th century mystery temple mclean adam quoted in mcintosh christopher 1998 rosicrucians history mythology and rituals of an esoteric order weiser p 45 mclean describes garden as a place of instruction and remarks that whole structure is reminiscent of eliphas levi s description of ancient tarot of egyptians carved into walls of their initiation temples to which candidate was taken to contemplate sequence of symbols mclean adam a rosicrucian alchemical mystery centre in scotland hermetic journal vol 4 no 11 1979 he backs up this suggestion with observation that mantegna tarocchi a set of 15th century engravings formerly thought to be a tarocchi or tarot deck includes all these images amongst its symbols references notes bibliography brown marilyn patron and garden
