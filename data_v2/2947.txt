indium is a chemical element with symbol in and atomic number 49 indium is softest metal that is not an alkali metal it is a silvery white metal that resembles tin in appearance it is a post transition metal that makes up 0 21 parts per million of earth s crust indium has a melting point higher than sodium and gallium but lower than lithium and tin chemically indium is similar to gallium and thallium and it is largely intermediate between two in terms of its properties indium was discovered in 1863 by ferdinand reich and hieronymous theodor richter by spectroscopic methods they named it for indigo blue line in its spectrum indium was isolated next year indium is a minor component in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement it is most notably used in semiconductor industry in low melting point metal alloys such as solders in soft metal high vacuum seals and in production of transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide ito on glass indium is considered a technology critical element indium has no biological role though its compounds are toxic when injected into bloodstream most occupational exposure is through ingestion from which indium compounds are not absorbed well and inhalation from which they are moderately absorbed properties physical thumb left indium wetting glass surface of a test tube indium is a silvery white highly ductile post transition metal with a bright luster it is so soft mohs hardness 1 2 that like sodium it can be cut with a knife it also leaves a visible line on paper it is a member of group 13 on periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between its vertical neighbours gallium and thallium like tin a high pitched cry is heard when indium is bent a crackling sound due to crystal twinning like gallium indium is able to wet glass like both indium has a low melting point 156 60 degc 313 88 degf higher than its lighter homologue gallium but lower than its heavier homologue thallium and lower than tin boiling point is 2072 degc degf higher than that of thallium but lower than gallium conversely to general trend of melting points but similarly to trends down other post transition metal groups because of weakness of metallic bonding with few electrons delocalized greenwood and earnshaw p 222 density of indium 7 31 g cm3 is also greater than gallium but lower than thallium below critical temperature 3 41 k indium becomes a superconductor indium crystallizes in body centered tetragonal crystal system in space group i4 mmm lattice parameters a 325 pm c 495 pm this is a slightly distorted face centered cubic structure where each indium atom has four neighbours at 324 pm distance and eight neighbours slightly further 336 pm greenwood and earnshaw p 252 indium has greater solubility in liquid mercury than any other metal more than 50 mass percent of indium at 0 degc indium displays a ductile response found to be size independent in tension and compression however it does have a size effect in bending and indentation associated to a length scale of order 50 100 um significantly large when compared with other metals chemical indium has 49 electrons with an electronic configuration of kr in compounds indium most commonly donates three outermost electrons to become indium iii in3 in some cases pair of 5s electrons are not donated resulting in indium i in stabilization of monovalent state is attributed to inert pair effect in which relativistic effects stabilize 5s orbital observed in heavier elements thallium indium s heavier homolog shows an even stronger effect causing oxidation to thallium i to be more probable than to thallium iii whereas gallium indium s lighter homolog commonly shows only 3 oxidation state thus although thallium iii is a moderately strong oxidizing agent indium iii is not and many indium i compounds are powerful reducing agents while energy required to include s electrons in chemical bonding is lowest for indium among group 13 metals bond energies decrease down group so that by indium energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining 3 state is not always enough to outweigh energy needed to involve 5s electrons greenwood and earnshaw p 256 indium i oxide and hydroxide are more basic and indium iii oxide and hydroxide are more acidic a number of standard electrode potentials depending on reaction under study are reported for indium reflecting decreased stability of 3 oxidation state 0 40 in2 e in 0 49 in3 e in2 0 443 in3 2 e in 0 in3 3 e in 0 14 in e in indium metal does not react with water but it is oxidized by stronger oxidizing agents such as halogens to give indium iii compounds it does not form a boride silicide or carbide and hydride has at best a transitory existence in ethereal solutions at low temperatures being unstable enough to spontaneously without coordination indium is rather basic in aqueous solution showing only slight amphoteric characteristics and unlike its lighter homologs aluminium and gallium it is insoluble in aqueous alkaline solutions greenwood and earnshaw p 255 isotopes indium has 39 known isotopes ranging in mass number from 97 to 135 only two isotopes occur naturally as primordial nuclides indium 113 only stable isotope and indium 115 which has a half life of 4 41 years four orders of magnitude greater than age of universe and nearly 30 000 times greater than that of natural thorium half life of 115in is very long because beta decay to is spin forbidden indium 115 makes up 95 7 of all indium indium is one of three known elements others being tellurium and rhenium of which stable isotope is less abundant in nature than long lived primordial radioisotopes stablest artificial isotope is indium 111 with a half life of approximately 2 8 days all other isotopes have half lives shorter than 5 hours indium also has 47 meta states among which indium half life about 49 51 days is most stable more stable than ground state of any indium isotope other than primordial all decay by isomeric transition indium isotopes lighter than 115in predominantly decay through electron capture or positron emission to form cadmium isotopes while other indium isotopes from 115in and greater predominantly decay through beta minus decay to form tin isotopes compounds indium iii thumb right upright 1 incl3 structure pictured is a common compound of indium indium iii oxide in2o3 forms when indium metal is burned in air or when hydroxide or nitrate is heated in2o3 adopts a structure like alumina and is amphoteric that is able to react with both acids and bases indium reacts with water to reproduce soluble indium iii hydroxide which is also amphoteric with alkalis to produce iii and with acids to produce indium iii salts in oh 3 3 hcl incl3 3 h2o analogous sesquichalcogenides with sulfur selenium and tellurium are also known greenwood and earnshaw p 286 indium forms expected trihalides chlorination bromination and iodination of in produce colorless incl3 and yellow compounds are lewis acids somewhat akin to better known aluminium trihalides again like related aluminium compound is polymeric greenwood and earnshaw pp 263 7 direct reaction of indium with pnictogens produces gray or semimetallic iii v semiconductors many of them slowly decompose in moist air necessitating careful storage of semiconductor compounds to prevent contact with atmosphere indium nitride is readily attacked by acids and alkalis greenwood and earnshaw p 288 indium i indium i compounds are not common chloride bromide and iodide are deeply colored unlike parent trihalides from which they are prepared fluoride is known only as an unstable gaseous compound greenwood and earnshaw pp 270 1 indium i oxide black powder is produced when indium iii oxide decomposes upon heating to 700 degc other oxidation states less frequently indium forms compounds in oxidation state 2 and even fractional oxidation states usually such materials feature in in bonding most notably in halides and 2 and various such as greenwood and earnshaw p 287 several other compounds are known to combine indium i and indium iii such as cl3 2 organoindium compounds organoindium compounds feature in c bonds most are in iii derivatives but i is an exception it was first known organoindium i compound and is polymeric consisting of zigzag chains of alternating indium atoms and cyclopentadienyl complexes perhaps best known organoindium compound is trimethylindium in ch3 3 used to prepare certain semiconducting materials history in 1863 german chemists ferdinand reich and hieronymous theodor richter were testing ores from mines around freiberg saxony they dissolved minerals pyrite galena and sphalerite in hydrochloric acid and distilled raw zinc chloride reich who was color blind employed richter as an assistant for detecting colored spectral lines knowing that ores from that region sometimes contain thallium they searched for green thallium emission spectrum lines instead they found a bright blue line because that blue line did not match any known element they hypothesized a new element was present in minerals they named element indium from indigo color seen in its spectrum after latin indicum meaning of india greenwood and earnshaw p 244 richter went on to isolate metal in 1864 an ingot of was presented at world fair 1867 reich and richter later fell out when latter claimed to be sole discoverer occurrence thumb right 400 px alt yellow squares with red and blue arrows s process acting in range from silver to antimony indium is created by long lasting up to thousands of years s process slow neutron capture in low to medium mass stars range in mass between 0 6 and 10 solar masses when a silver 109 atom captures a neutron it transmutes into silver 110 which then undergoes beta decay to become cadmium 110 capturing further neutrons it becomes cadmium 115 which decays to indium 115 by another beta decay this explains why radioactive isotope is more abundant than stable one stable indium isotope indium 113 is one of p nuclei origin of which is not fully understood although indium 113 is known to be made directly in s and r processes rapid neutron capture and also as daughter of very long lived cadmium 113 which has a half life of about eight quadrillion years

crust at approximately 50 ppb this is similar to crustal abundance of silver bismuth and mercury it very rarely forms its own minerals or occurs in elemental form fewer than 10 indium minerals such as are known and none occur at sufficient concentrations for economic extraction instead indium is usually a trace constituent of more common ore minerals such as sphalerite and chalcopyrite from these it can be extracted as a by product during smelting while enrichment of indium in these deposits is high relative to its crustal abundance it is insufficient at current prices to support extraction of indium as main product different estimates exist of amounts of indium contained within ores of other metals however these amounts are not extractable without mining of host materials see production and availability thus availability of indium is fundamentally determined by rate at which these ores are extracted and not their absolute amount this is an aspect that is often forgotten in current debate e g by group at yale in their criticality assessments explaining paradoxically low depletion times some studies cite production and availability thumb world production s geological survey historical statistics for mineral and material commodities in united states indium statistics usgs april 1 2014 indium is produced exclusively as a by product during processing of ores of other metals its main source material are sulfidic zinc ores where it is mostly hosted by sphalerite minor amounts are probably also extracted from sulfidic copper ores during roast leach process of zinc smelting indium accumulates in iron rich residues from these it can be extracted in different ways it may also be recovered directly from process solutions further purification is done by electrolysis greenwood and earnshaw p 247 exact process varies with mode of operation of smelter its by product status means that indium production is constrained by amount of sulfidic zinc and copper ores extracted each year therefore its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential supply potential of a by product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions i e technology and price reserves and resources are not relevant for by products since they cannot be extracted independently from main products recent estimates put supply potential of indium at a minimum of 1 300 t yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t yr from sulfidic copper ores these figures are significantly greater than current production 655 t in 2016 thus major future increases in by product production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price average indium price in 2016 was 240 kg down from 705 kg in 2014 china is a leading producer of indium 290 tonnes in 2016 followed by south korea 195 t japan 70 t and canada 65 t teck resources refinery in trail british columbia is a large single source indium producer with an output of 32 5 tonnes in 2005 41 8 tonnes in 2004 and 36 1 tonnes in 2003 primary consumption of indium worldwide is lcd production demand rose rapidly from late 1990s to 2010 with popularity of lcd computer monitors and television sets which now account for 50 of indium consumption increased manufacturing efficiency and recycling especially in japan maintain a balance between demand and supply according to unep indium s end of life recycling rate is less than 1 applications thumb right a magnified image of an lcd screen showing rgb pixels individual transistors are seen as white dots in bottom part in 1924 indium was found to have a valued property of stabilizing non ferrous metals and that became first significant use for element first large scale application for indium was coating bearings in high performance aircraft engines during world war ii to protect against damage and corrosion this is no longer a major use of element new uses were found in fusible alloys solders and electronics in 1950s tiny beads of indium were used for emitters and collectors of pnp alloy junction transistors in middle and late 1980s development of indium phosphide semiconductors and indium tin oxide thin films for liquid crystal displays lcd aroused much interest by 1992 thin film application had become largest end use indium iii oxide and indium tin oxide ito are used as a transparent conductive coating on glass substrates in panels indium tin oxide is used as a light filter in low pressure sodium vapor lamps infrared radiation is reflected back into lamp which increases temperature within tube and improves performance of lamp indium has many semiconductor related applications some indium compounds such as indium antimonide and

temperature indium does not stress germanium thumb ductile indium wire indium wire is used as a vacuum seal and a thermal conductor in cryogenics and ultra high vacuum applications in such manufacturing applications as gaskets that deform to fill gaps indium is an ingredient in gallium indium tin alloy galinstan which is liquid at room temperature and replaces mercury in some thermometers other alloys of indium with bismuth cadmium lead and tin which have higher but still low melting points between 50 and 100 degc are used in fire sprinkler systems and heat regulators indium is one of many substitutes for mercury in alkaline batteries to prevent zinc from corroding and releasing hydrogen gas indium is added to some dental amalgam alloys to decrease surface tension of mercury and allow for less mercury and easier amalgamation indium s high neutron capture cross section for thermal neutrons makes it suitable for use in control rods for nuclear reactors typically

forty times as toxic when injected measured by quantity of indium introduced radioactive indium 111 in very small amounts on a chemical basis is used in nuclear medicine tests as a radiotracer to follow movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in body indium compounds are mostly not absorbed upon ingestion and are only moderately absorbed on inhalation they tend to be stored temporarily in muscles skin and bones before being excreted and biological half life of indium is about two weeks in humans people can be exposed to indium in workplace by inhalation ingestion skin
