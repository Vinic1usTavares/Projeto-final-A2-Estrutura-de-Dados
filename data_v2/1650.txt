saravanan discovered that ganesan accepted us 26 667 in 1968 for one of a p nagarajan s latest films since thiruvilaiyadal 1965 nagarajan s films were made in eastmancolor and because uyarndha was made in black and white and costume designing for film was less as compared to those of nagarajan s films m saravanan decided to pay us 20 000 in 1968 to ganesan filming song en was re shot as meiyappan was not pleased with earlier sequence that was shown to him by production unit song paal polave was initially meant to be shot at kodaikanal but due to unfavourable weather conditions shoot had to be called off film s art director a k sekhar constructed a specially erected set at avm studios in chennai that resembled kodaikanal s misty ambience and song was shot here it was speculated that a production company bought remake rights of parent trap 1961 in hindi and titled it as avm productions had already acquired rights to film which they were making under title do kaliyaan 1968 to avoid a clash with that film avm production stalled production of uyarndha manithan for eight months to focus on do kaliyaan ganesan who thought that project had been shelved went to inform avm productions that he would commence filming with another technical crew however avm productions convinced him that shooting was only delayed and paid him us 6 667 in 1968 in advance after release of do kaliyaan filming was resumed and completed final length of film s prints were long themes in his 2015 book madras studios narrative genre and ideology in tamil cinema swarnavel eswaran pillai notes that title uyarndha manithan meaning a honourable man epitomises contradiction within character of raju and in trajectory of rebel in 1952 as he finally ends up a meek reactionary family man who had
