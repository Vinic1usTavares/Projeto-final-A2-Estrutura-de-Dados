review aggregator metacritic clock tower ii was met with generally unfavorable reviews gameplay was found to be flawed due to dual personality mechanic and poor storytelling methods joe fielder of gamespot described puzzles as counter intuitive like being stuck on a rubik s cube and coming back later to find cube solved in same vein he noted how sometimes events are triggered or areas become accessible only after spending time exploring other unrelated areas mark macdonald writing for official u s playstation magazine shared these sentiments saying player spends most of their time wandering around hoping to trigger next event point and click interface was also criticized as slow and inaccurate fielder criticized graphics as pure first generation playstation and believed sound design was also poor marc nix of ign argued sound design was good and graphics were clear and sharp but scenery was ultimately lifeless story was criticized by some but macdonald found it to be more adult and out there spooky than any other playstation title yet mark kanarick of allgame heavily criticized voice acting describing it as worst aspect of game ultimately fielder could not recommend clock tower ii as an adventure or horror game saying leave this one for antique collectors nix felt game fell considerably short of its potential he found rumble feature sole perfect feature of game macdonald called game seriously flawed but unique he described it as a terrible game in a conventional sense but like a cult film it is redeemed by its willingness to take risks and stand apart from mainstream and therefore is strictly for hardcore niche gamers kanarick called it a poor attempt at a survival horror game but that fans of clock tower 1996 may enjoy it electric playground presented clock tower ii with its 1999 console adventure game of year award editors called it decidedly best of few challengers in its field despite competition from playstation release of broken sword ii
