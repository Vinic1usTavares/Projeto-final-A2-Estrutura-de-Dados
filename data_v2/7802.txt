is rated tv pg on television in united states during pre production for episode cast and crew realized that halloween concept would allow various cast members to wear costumes rather than their usual realistically plain suits b j novak called dress up experience fun noting that seeing most serious of our plotlines play out alongside such silly and bizarre visuals was i think one of most inspired ideas of episode s writer greg daniels idea for pam to be dressed as a cat was inspired by several unused stories created by gene stupnitsky in which pam beesley must disguise herself as a cat plot lines were vetoed by shows writers but stupnitsky successfully petitioned to allow pam to wear a cat costume halloween marks last appearance of devon in an episode until series finale seven seasons later although devon was only a background character he is mentioned during dundies seen in background of fire and is seen in a deleted scene during diversity day devon is later seen in a deleted scene on valentine s day when michael passes by a homeless devon in new york devon then chases michael presumably still angry over events of halloween guest stars in this episode included devon abner hugh dane george gaus annabelle kopack ava nisbet and alec zbornak cultural references due to presence of halloween many of employees costumes reflect movie and literary characters kelly is dressed as dorothy gale but michael makes an insensitive remark about bend it like beckham dwight is dressed as a sith one of characters in star wars universe capable of using dark side of force phyllis however confuses him for some sort of monk kevin is dressed as a dunder mifflin super hero with a costume design similar to mr incredible creed is dressed like a vampire and devon is dressed like a hobo pam phyllis and angela are all dressed up as cats oscar is dressed in drag and michael asks him if he is flying his true colors to which oscar reacts defensively reception halloween was originally

felt that plot revolving around downsizing was fitting because episode takes place on halloween and that this plot returned michael to role of villain adams also felt that director paul feig and credited writer greg daniels had a lot of fun dressing show up for halloween framing dwight like a shrouded emperor palpatine and making john krasinski step into steve carell s shoes for a couple of great punchlines episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics michael sciannamea of tv squad gave episode a relatively positive review and noted that he could certainly relate to
