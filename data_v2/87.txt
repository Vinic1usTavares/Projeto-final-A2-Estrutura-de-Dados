january 1649 at climax of english civil war parliament of scotland proclaimed charles ii king on 5 february 1649 however england entered period known as english interregnum or english commonwealth and country was a de facto republic led by oliver cromwell cromwell defeated charles ii at battle of worcester on 3 september 1651 and charles fled to mainland europe cromwell became virtual dictator of england scotland and ireland charles spent next nine years in exile in france dutch republic and spanish netherlands a political crisis that followed death of cromwell in 1658 resulted in restoration of monarchy and charles was invited to return to britain on 29 may 1660 his 30th birthday he was received in london to public acclaim after 1660 all legal documents were dated as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649 charles s english parliament enacted laws known as clarendon code designed to shore up position of re established church of england charles acquiesced to clarendon code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance major foreign policy issue of his early reign was second anglo dutch war in 1670 he entered into treaty of dover an alliance with his cousin king louis xiv of france louis agreed to aid him in third anglo dutch war and pay him a pension and charles secretly promised to convert to catholicism at an unspecified future date charles attempted to introduce religious freedom for catholics and protestant dissenters with his 1672 royal declaration of indulgence but english parliament forced him to withdraw it in 1679 titus oates s revelations of a supposed popish plot sparked exclusion crisis when it was revealed that charles s brother and heir presumptive james duke of york was a catholic crisis saw birth of pro exclusion whig and anti exclusion tory parties charles sided with tories and following discovery of rye house plot to murder charles and james in 1683 some whig leaders were executed or forced into exile charles dissolved english parliament in 1681 and ruled alone until his death in 1685 he was received into catholic church on his deathbed charles was one of most popular and beloved kings of england known as merry monarch in reference to both liveliness and hedonism of his court and general relief at return to normality after over a decade of rule by cromwell and puritans charles s wife catherine of braganza

and henrietta maria sister of french king louis xiii charles was their second child their first son was born about a year before charles but died within a day england scotland and ireland were respectively predominantly anglican presbyterian and catholic charles was baptised in chapel royal on 27 june by anglican bishop of london william laud he was brought up in care of protestant countess of dorset though his godparents included his maternal uncle louis xiii and his maternal grandmother marie de medici dowager queen of france both of whom were catholics at birth charles automatically became duke of cornwall and duke of rothesay along with several other associated titles at or around his eighth birthday he was designated prince of wales though he was never formally invested during 1640s when charles was still young his father fought parliamentary and puritan forces in english civil war charles accompanied his father during battle of edgehill and at age of fourteen participated in campaigns of 1645 when he was made titular commander of english forces in west country by spring 1646 his father was losing war and charles left england due to fears for his safety setting off from falmouth after staying at pendennis castle he went first to isles of scilly then to jersey and finally to france where his mother was already living in exile and his first cousin eight year old louis xiv was king charles i surrendered into captivity in may 1646 in 1648 during second english civil war charles moved to hague where his sister mary and his brother in law william ii prince of orange seemed more likely to provide substantial aid to royalist cause than his mother s french relations however royalist fleet that came under charles s control was not used to any advantage and did not reach scotland in time to join up with royalist engager army of duke of hamilton before it was defeated at battle of preston by parliamentarians at hague charles had a brief affair with lucy walter who later falsely claimed that they had secretly married her son james crofts afterwards duke of monmouth and duke of buccleuch was one of charles s many illegitimate children who became prominent in british society despite his son s diplomatic efforts to save him king charles i was beheaded in january 1649 and england became a republic on 5 february covenanter parliament of scotland proclaimed charles ii king of great britain france and ireland at mercat cross edinburgh but refused to allow him to enter scotland unless he accepted imposition of presbyterianism throughout britain and ireland when negotiations with scots stalled charles authorised general montrose to land in orkney islands with a small army to threaten scots with invasion in hope of forcing an agreement more to his liking montrose feared that charles would accept a compromise and so chose to invade mainland scotland anyway he was captured and executed charles reluctantly promised that he would abide by terms of a treaty agreed between him and scots parliament at breda and support solemn league and covenant which authorised presbyterian church governance across britain upon his arrival in scotland on 23 june 1650 he formally agreed to covenant his abandonment of episcopal church governance although winning him support in scotland left him unpopular in england charles himself soon came to despise villainy and hypocrisy of covenanters thumb cast gold coronation medal of charles ii dated 1651 on 3 september 1650 covenanters were defeated at battle of dunbar by a much smaller force led by oliver cromwell scots forces were divided into royalist engagers and presbyterian covenanters who even fought each other disillusioned by covenanters in october charles attempted to escape from them and rode north to join with an engager force an event which became known as start but within two days presbyterians had caught up with and recovered him nevertheless scots remained charles s best hope of restoration and he was crowned king of scotland at scone abbey on 1 january 1651 with cromwell s forces threatening charles s position in scotland it was decided to mount an attack on england with many of scots including lord argyll and other leading covenanters refusing to participate and with few english royalists joining force as it moved south into england invasion ended in defeat at battle of worcester on 3 september 1651 after which charles eluded capture by hiding in royal oak at boscobel house through six weeks of narrow escapes charles managed to flee england in disguise landing in normandy on 16 october despite a reward of ps1 000 on his head risk of death for anyone caught helping him and difficulty in disguising charles who at over was unusually tall thumb right a king in exile charles ii painted by philippe de c 1653 under instrument of government passed by parliament cromwell was appointed lord protector of england scotland and ireland in 1653 effectively placing british isles under military rule impoverished charles could not obtain sufficient support to mount a serious challenge to cromwell s government despite stuart family connections through henrietta maria and princess of orange france and dutch republic allied themselves with cromwell s government from 1654 forcing charles to turn for aid to spain which at that time ruled southern netherlands charles made treaty of brussels with spain in 1656 this gathered spanish support for a restoration in return for charles s contribution to war against france charles raised a ragtag army from his exiled subjects

at first seemed slim as cromwell was succeeded as lord protector by his son richard however new lord protector had little experience of either military or civil administration in 1659 rump parliament was recalled and richard resigned during civil and military unrest that followed george monck governor of scotland was concerned that nation would descend into anarchy monck and his army marched into city of london and forced rump parliament to re admit members of long parliament who had been excluded in december 1648 during pride s purge long parliament dissolved itself and for first time in almost 20 years there was a general election diary of samuel pepys 16 march 1660 outgoing parliament defined electoral qualifications so as to ensure as they thought return of a presbyterian majority restrictions against royalist candidates and voters were widely ignored and elections resulted in a house of commons that was fairly evenly divided on political grounds between royalists and parliamentarians and on religious grounds between anglicans and presbyterians new so called convention parliament assembled on 25 april 1660 and soon afterwards welcomed declaration of breda in which charles promised and tolerance there would be liberty of conscience and anglican church policy would not be harsh he would not exile past enemies nor confiscate their wealth there would be pardons for nearly all his opponents except regicides above all charles promised to rule in cooperation with parliament english parliament resolved to proclaim charles king and invite him to return a message that reached charles at breda on 8 may 1660 in ireland a convention had been called earlier in year and had already declared for charles on 14 may he was proclaimed king in dublin thumb left alt seascape

50 people were specifically excluded in end nine of regicides were executed they were hanged drawn and quartered others were given life imprisonment or simply excluded from office for life bodies of oliver cromwell henry ireton and john bradshaw were subjected to indignity of posthumous decapitations english parliament granted him an annual income to run government of ps1 2 million generated largely from customs and excise duties grant however proved to be insufficient for most of charles s reign for most part actual revenue was much lower which led to attempts to economise at court by reducing size and expenses of royal household and raise money through unpopular innovations such as hearth tax in latter half of 1660 charles s joy at restoration was tempered by deaths of his youngest brother henry and sister mary of smallpox at around same time anne hyde daughter of lord chancellor edward hyde revealed that she was pregnant by charles s brother james whom she had secretly married edward hyde who had not known of either marriage or pregnancy was created earl of clarendon and his position as charles s favourite minister was strengthened clarendon code thumb coronation

prayer compulsory conventicle act 1664 prohibited religious assemblies of more than five people except under auspices of church of england and five mile act 1665 prohibited expelled non conforming clergymen from coming within five miles 8 km of a parish from which they had been banished conventicle and five mile acts remained in effect for remainder of charles s reign acts became known as clarendon code after lord clarendon even though he was not directly responsible for them and even spoke against five mile act restoration was accompanied by social change puritanism lost its momentum theatres reopened after having been closed during protectorship of oliver cromwell and bawdy restoration comedy became a recognisable genre theatre licences granted by charles required that female parts be played by their natural performers rather than by boys as was often practice before and restoration literature celebrated or reacted to restored court which included libertines such as john wilmot 2nd earl of rochester of charles ii wilmot supposedly said to which charles is reputed to have replied that matter was easily accounted for for that his discourse was his own his actions were ministry s great plague and great fire in 1665 charles was faced with a great health crisis great plague of london death toll reached a peak of 7 000 per week in week of 17 september charles with his family and court fled london in july to salisbury parliament met in oxford plague cases ebbed over winter and charles returned to london in february 1666 after a long spell of hot and dry weather through mid 1666 what later became known as great fire of london started on 2 september 1666 in a bakehouse on pudding lane fanned by a strong easterly wind and fed by stockpiles of wood and fuel that had been prepared for coming colder months fire eventually consumed about 13 200 houses and 87 churches including st paul s cathedral charles and his brother james joined and directed fire fighting

braganza began during his father s reign and upon restoration queen luisa of portugal acting as regent reopened negotiations with england that resulted in an alliance on 23 june 1661 a marriage treaty was signed england acquired catherine s dowry of tangier in north africa and seven islands of bombay latter having a major influence on development of british empire in india together with trading privileges in brazil and east indies religious and commercial freedom in portugal and two million portuguese crowns about ps300 000 while portugal obtained military and naval support against spain and liberty of worship for catherine catherine journeyed from portugal to portsmouth on 13 14 may 1662 but was not visited by charles there until 20 may next day couple were married at portsmouth in two

conflict began well for english with capture of new amsterdam renamed new york in honour of charles s brother james duke of york and a victory at battle of lowestoft but in 1667 dutch launched a surprise attack on england raid on medway when they sailed up river thames to where a major part of english fleet was docked almost all of ships were sunk except for flagship royal charles which was taken back to netherlands as a trophy second dutch war ended with signing of treaty of breda as a result of second dutch war charles dismissed lord clarendon whom he used as a scapegoat for war clarendon fled to france when impeached for high treason which carried penalty of death power passed to five politicians known collectively by a whimsical acronym as cabal clifford arlington buckingham ashley afterwards earl of shaftesbury and lauderdale in fact cabal rarely acted in concert and court was often divided between two factions led by arlington and buckingham with arlington more successful in 1668 england allied itself with sweden and with its former enemy netherlands to oppose louis xiv in war of devolution louis made peace with triple alliance but he continued to maintain his aggressive intentions towards netherlands in 1670 charles seeking to solve his financial troubles agreed to treaty of dover under which louis xiv would pay him ps160 000 each year in exchange charles agreed to supply louis with troops and to announce his conversion to catholicism as soon as welfare of his kingdom will permit louis was to provide him with 6 000 troops to suppress those who opposed conversion charles endeavoured to ensure that treaty especially conversion clause remained secret it remains unclear if charles ever seriously intended to convert for doubts over his intention to convert before 1685 see for example for doubts over his intention to convert on his deathbed see for example meanwhile by a series of five charters charles granted east india company rights to autonomous government of its territorial acquisitions to mint money to command fortresses and troops to form alliances to make war and peace and to exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction over its possessions in indies earlier in 1668 he leased islands of bombay to company for a nominal sum of ps10 paid in gold portuguese territories that catherine brought with her as a dowry proved too expensive to maintain tangier was abandoned in 1684 in 1670 charles granted control of entire hudson bay drainage basin to hudson s bay company by royal charter and named territory rupert s land after his cousin prince rupert of rhine company s first governor conflict with parliament although previously favourable to crown cavalier parliament was alienated by king s wars and religious policies during 1670s in 1672 charles issued royal declaration of indulgence in which he purported to suspend all penal laws against catholics and other religious dissenters in same year he openly supported catholic france and started third anglo dutch war cavalier parliament opposed declaration of indulgence on constitutional grounds by claiming that king had no right to arbitrarily suspend laws passed by parliament charles withdrew declaration and also agreed to test act which not only required public officials to receive sacrament under forms prescribed by church of england but also later forced them to denounce certain teachings of catholic church as superstitious and idolatrous clifford who had converted to catholicism resigned rather than take oath and died shortly after possibly from suicide by 1674 england had gained nothing from anglo dutch war and cavalier parliament refused to provide further funds forcing charles to make peace power of cabal waned and that of

june 1669 charles s heir presumptive was therefore his unpopular catholic brother james duke of york partly to assuage public fears that royal family was too catholic charles agreed that james s daughter mary should marry protestant william of orange in 1678 titus oates who had been alternately an anglican and jesuit priest falsely warned of a popish plot to assassinate king even accusing queen of complicity charles did not believe allegations but ordered his chief minister lord danby to investigate while danby seems to have been rightly sceptical about oates s claims cavalier parliament took them seriously people were seized with an anti catholic hysteria judges and juries across land condemned supposed conspirators numerous innocent individuals were executed later in 1678 danby was impeached by house of commons on charge of high treason although much of nation had sought war with catholic france charles had secretly negotiated with louis xiv trying to reach an agreement under which england would remain neutral in return for money danby had publicly professed that he was hostile to france but had reservedly agreed to abide by charles s wishes unfortunately for him house of commons failed to view him as a reluctant participant in scandal instead believing that he was author of policy to save danby from impeachment trial charles dissolved cavalier parliament in january 1679 new english parliament which met in march of same year was quite hostile to charles many members feared that he had intended to use standing army to suppress dissent or impose catholicism however with insufficient funds voted by parliament charles was forced to gradually disband his troops having lost support of parliament danby resigned his post of lord high treasurer but received a pardon from king in defiance of royal will house of commons declared that dissolution of parliament did not interrupt impeachment proceedings and that pardon was therefore invalid when house of lords attempted to impose punishment of exile which commons thought too mild impeachment became stalled between two houses as he had been required to do so many times during his reign charles bowed to wishes of his opponents committing danby to tower of london in which he was held for another five years later years charles faced a political storm over his brother james a catholic being next in line to throne prospect of a catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by anthony ashley cooper 1st earl of shaftesbury previously baron ashley and a member of cabal which had fallen apart in 1673 shaftesbury s power base was strengthened when house of commons of 1679 introduced exclusion bill which sought to exclude duke of york from line of succession some even sought to confer crown on protestant duke of monmouth eldest of charles s illegitimate children abhorrers those who thought exclusion bill was abhorrent were named tories after a term for dispossessed irish

charles s hopes for a more moderate parliament were not fulfilled within a few months he had dissolved parliament yet again after it sought to pass exclusion bill when a new parliament assembled at oxford in march 1681 charles dissolved it for a fourth time after just a few days during 1680s however popular support for exclusion bill ebbed and charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty lord shaftesbury was prosecuted albeit unsuccessfully for treason in 1681 and later fled to holland where he died for remainder of his reign charles ruled without parliament charles s opposition to exclusion bill angered some protestants protestant conspirators formulated rye house plot a plan to murder him and duke of york as they returned to london after horse races in newmarket a great fire however destroyed charles s lodgings at newmarket which forced him to leave races early thus inadvertently avoiding planned attack news of failed plot was leaked protestant politicians such as arthur capell 1st earl of essex algernon sydney lord william russell and duke of monmouth were implicated in plot lord essex slit his own throat while imprisoned in tower of london sydney and russell were executed for high treason on very flimsy evidence and duke of monmouth went into exile at court of william of orange lord danby and surviving catholic lords held in tower were released and king s catholic brother james acquired greater influence at court titus oates was convicted and imprisoned for defamation death charles suffered a sudden apoplectic fit on morning of 2 february 1685 and died aged 54 at 11 45 am four days later at whitehall palace suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison in minds of many including one of royal doctors however a more modern medical analysis has held that symptoms of his final illness are similar to those of uraemia a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction in days between his collapse and his death charles endured a variety of torturous treatments including bloodletting purging and cupping in hopes of effecting a recovery on his deathbed charles asked his brother james to look after his mistresses be well to portsmouth and let not poor nelly starve he told his courtiers i am sorry gentlemen for being such a time a dying and expressed regret at his treatment of his wife on last evening of his life he was received into catholic church in presence of father john huddleston though extent to which he was fully conscious or committed and with whom idea originated is unclear he was buried in westminster abbey

ascribed to divine providence charles himself seems to have delighted most in his ability to sustain his disguise as a man of ordinary origins and to move unrecognised through his realm ironic and cynical charles took pleasure in retailing stories which demonstrated undetectable nature of any inherent majesty he possessed charles had no legitimate children but acknowledged a dozen by seven
