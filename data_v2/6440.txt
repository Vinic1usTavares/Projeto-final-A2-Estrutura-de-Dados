brean down is a promontory off coast of somerset england standing high and extending into bristol channel at eastern end of bridgwater bay between weston super mare and burnham on sea made of carboniferous limestone it is a continuation of mendip hills two further continuations are small islands of steep holm and flat holm cliffs on northern and southern flanks of brean down have large quantities of fossils laid down in marine deposits about 320 350 million years ago site has been occupied by humans since late bronze age and includes remains of a romano celtic temple at seaward end is brean down fort which was built in 1865 and then re armed in second world war brean down is now owned by national trust and is rich in wildlife history and archaeology it is a site of special scientific interest due to both geology and presence of nationally rare plants including white rock rose it has also been scheduled as an ancient monument geology thumb an aerial view of brean down thumb cliffs on south side showing fractures in limestone mendip hills of which brean down forms most westerly part are most southerly carboniferous limestone upland in britain these rock strata were laid down during early carboniferous period about 320 350 million years ago subsequently much of northwestern europe underwent continental collision throughout late paleozoic era culminating in final phases of variscan orogeny near end of carboniferous period 300 million years ago this tectonic activity produced a complex suite of mountain and hill ranges across what is now southern ireland south western england brittany and elsewhere in western europe as a result of variscan mountain building mendip area now comprises at least four anticlinal fold structures with an east west trend each with a core of older devonian sandstone and silurian volcanic rocks west of main mendip plateau carboniferous limestone continues in bleadon hill and brean down and on islands of steep holm and flat holm brean down is just over long and runs in an east west direction near mouth of river axe opposite uphill cliff flat area on top of peninsula may represent a raised bench laid down when sea level was much higher than it is today as highest point of promontory is approximately above sea level cliffs on north and south faces are rich in fossils that include corals seashells and crinoids which supports theory of marine deposition of rocks 13 separate layers have been identified in sand cliff on south side lowest five dating to millennia of last glaciation history thumb left brean down fort human occupation dates back to beaker culture of late bronze age there is also evidence of an iron age hill fort and prehistoric barrows and field systems there is evidence of a shrine dating from pre roman times which was re established as a romano celtic temple in mid 4th century according to at least one source it is extremely likely this was succeeded by a small late 4th century christian oratory several roman finds including gold coins of augustus nero and drusus two silver denarii of vespasian and a roman carnelian ring were found at site during quarrying brean down fort was built on headland between 1864 and 1871 on recommendations of 1859 royal commission it was most southerly of a chain of defences across bristol channel protecting access to bristol and cardiff four acres of land at end of brean down were requisitioned in 1862 with construction beginning in 1864 and completed in 1871 in 1860s plans were laid for a deep water harbour on northern shore of brean down it was intended that this harbour would replace bristol as a port on embarkation for transatlantic crossings and export of minerals and agricultural produce from mendip hills and rest of somerset foundation stones of pier were laid but project was later abandoned after a large storm destroyed foundations in 1897 following wireless transmissions from lavernock point in wales and flat holm guglielmo marconi moved his equipment to brean down and set a new distance record of for wireless transmission over open sea in 1912 brean down was leased by royal society for protection of birds as a bird sanctuary acquiring shooting rights to stop others shooting on promontory thumb concrete arrow on outbreak of world war ii fort was rearmed with two 6 inch 15 centimetre ex naval guns and machine gun posts were built on down birnbeck pier was taken over by admiralty in 1941 as an outpost of department of miscellaneous weapons development it was commissioned as hms birnbeck and was used for secret weapons development and storage with testing bouncing bomb was tested at brean down fort on opposite side of weston bay in 1954 former axbridge rural district council gave of down to national trust to celebrate festival of britain major aldermen and burgesses of borough of weston super mare gave in 1963 and a further at brean down cove was acquired from m d and m matthews in 2000 after restoring fort which covers sedgemoor district council gave this to trust as well in 2002 various proposals have been put forward to construct a severn barrage for tidal electricity production from brean down to lavernock point in south wales proposals which go back over 100 years have never been successful so far however peter hain and others are still working on further proposals and trying to persuade government to fund either barrage or tidal lagoons ecology thumb white rock rose helianthemum on south cliff of brean down in addition to geological interest of site range of plants growing on brean down has led to it being designated as a site of special scientific interest nationally rare white rock rose helianthemum is a common species at site occurring in abundance on upper reaches of grassy south facing slopes some of growing here which were originally thought to be broomrape orobanche artemisiae are now no longer believed to be this species but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape orobanche other plants on southern slopes include somerset hair grass wild thyme horseshoe vetch and birds foot trefoil northern side is dominated by bracken bramble privet hawthorn cowslips and bell heather birds seen on brean down include peregrine falcon jackdaw kestrel collared and stock doves common common linnet dunnock rock pipit and in 2007 britain s first and only atlantic yellow nosed albatross there are also several species of butterfly including chalkhill blue dark green fritillary meadow brown marbled white small heath and common blue see also list of national trust properties
