reclaiming role kieswetter played first three odis of series scoring 24 not out 18 and 0 before he was dropped and replaced by buttler dobell described kieswetter as perhaps a little unfortunate but cited his inability to adjust his game and number of balls he blocked as reasons for his removal he played scoring at an average of 30 11 later domestic career competition between kieswetter and buttler for england s one day wicket keeping role also caused conflict at somerset for 2013 season both players wanted to fulfil role for county kieswetter began season as wicket keeper in county

more of a responsible player rather than just power blazing he scored a late season century against warwickshire in county championship but in a season in which somerset struggled against relegation he scored a relatively modest 606 first class runs at an average of 31 89 at end of season buttler whose contract with somerset had expired announced that he was joining lancashire leaving kieswetter

july 2014 kieswetter suffered a broken nose and fractured cheek bone while batting for somerset against northamptonshire in a county championship match bowler david willey delivered a bouncer which went through gap between grille and visor on kieswetter s helmet and struck him in face injuries were initially described by somerset s chairman andy nash as serious but non career threatening he

squad kieswetter revealed that he was still suffering vision problems he announced that he would not play in 2015 season and would seek further treatment following june he announced his retirement from professional cricket saying that although he was still capable of playing he could not play to standard he wanted in end i just thought there are too many mediocre players in county cricket and good luck to them but i don t want to be another one he found batting in floodlit conditions particularly difficult and described vision in his right eye as being only at 80 or 85 percent he finished his career with similar statistics in first class and one day cricket in both he averaged just under 40 and had scored eleven centuries in twenty20 cricket his highest score was 89 not out and he averaged just over 30 in an interview with espncricinfo shortly after his retirement kieswetter said that he would be interested in working in media perhaps as part of a commentary team for twenty20 matches although rare injury to kieswetter was followed by another high profile case when phillip hughes died after being struck on head by a cricket ball while batting these incidents led ecb to make wearing of helmets mandatory for professional cricketers in england from start of 2016 season and banned them from wearing helmets with adjustable grilles specifying that gap between grille and cap should be no more than playing style kieswetter s confident and attacking batting style was compared to that of kevin pietersen another england batsman of south african origin although kieswetter favoured off side he was also strong behind square on both sides and stood with a typical south african stance his bat held high he played with what wisden described as an attractive uncomplicated front foot technique he began his career playing in front of his stumps but once bowlers had worked out his technique he moved his batting stance to outside leg stump to give himself more space to drive ball this move had some success on flat subcontinental pitches but was less effective in england where ball tended to change direction more kieswetter admitted that change had not worked saying that i wasn t really moving my feet i was staying leg side and playing with my hands my technique just wasn t strong enough to cope after being dropped by england kieswetter worked on his batting which had been described by steve james as a frenzy at crease as manic as a teenager on a night out he moved back in front of his stumps and maintained a calmer mentality aiming to construct an innings he was generally more highly regarded for his batting than his wicket keeping often drawing criticism for quality of his despite this he was at times considered to be a better wicket keeper than two of his rivals for england bairstow and buttler nonetheless playing in an era when international teams did not play specialist wicket keepers kieswetter s selection was based primarily upon his batting ability rather than his keeping ability for a couple of matches during 2012 he was used as an off spin bowler by somerset collecting three wickets somerset experimented with kieswetter throughout order trying to find most effective place for him he began as a middle order batsman but by end of 2007 season although he remained in middle order in first class cricket kieswetter regularly found himself opening batting alongside marcus trescothick in one day cricket a role he would also take up in opening six matches of 2009 twenty20 cup although he later dropped back into middle order to improve balance of side on his international call up england chose to use kieswetter as an opening batsman he was selected because of his proven ability to pierce field in powerplay overs particularly with his booming drives up and over covers he later moved down order for england to accommodate kevin pietersen as opener golf career after kieswetter s retirement from cricket his father suggested that he take a break and play some golf he had done so during his youth in south africa playing in provincial tournaments after some lessons with david leadbetter who suggested that he try to become a professional golfer kieswetter began to enter amateur tournaments after performing well in those events he set himself a target of becoming a professional and playing regularly on european tour in late 2016 he took part in a couple of pga tour tournaments and one on mena golf tour in early 2017 he turned professional and in march played in mena golf tour qualifying school in morocco finishing tied for 31st place and earning a card for 2017 season he played regularly on tour during 2017 and in september won his biggest prize of season winning us 360 in dubai creek open
