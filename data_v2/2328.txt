yellow faced honeyeater caligavis chrysops is a small to medium sized bird in honeyeater family meliphagidae it takes both its common name and scientific name from distinctive yellow stripes on sides of its head its loud clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn it is widespread across eastern and south eastern australia in open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high altitude subalpine areas and woodlands along creeks and rivers comparatively short billed for a honeyeater it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies spiders and beetles as well as nectar and pollen from flowers of plants such as banksia and grevillea and soft fruits it catches insects in flight as well as gleaning them from foliage of trees and shrubs some yellow faced honeyeaters are sedentary but hundreds of thousands migrate northwards between march and may to spend winter in southern queensland and return in july and august to breed in southern new south wales and victoria they form socially monogamous pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate cup shaped nest success rate can be low and pairs nest several times during breeding season honeyeaters preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to effects of land clearing grazing and weeds as it is common and widespread yellow faced honeyeater is considered by international union for conservation of nature iucn to be of least concern for conservation it is considered a pest in orchards in some areas taxonomy yellow faced honeyeater was first described and placed in genus sylvia by ornithologist john latham in his 1801 work supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae french ornithologist louis jean pierre vieillot described it as melithreptus in 1817 and english zoologist george robert gray as in 1869 specific name chrysops is derived from ancient greek words chrysos meaning gold and meaning face in reference to stripe of yellow feathers yellow faced honeyeater was classified in genera meliphaga and then lichenostomus until 2011 delineating latter genus had been systematically contentious and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in genus using dense taxon and nucleotide sampling confirmed previous findings that lichenostomus is not monophyletic five species have previously been described as comprising caligavis subgroup but studies using mitochondrial dna identified yellow faced honeyeater as most closely related to black throated honeyeater c and obscure honeyeater c obscurus of new guinea they were therefore grouped into genus caligavis bridled honeyeater b and honeyeater b were sufficiently different to be placed in a separate genus as a 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear dna found ancestor of yellow faced honeyeater diverged from common ancestor of other two caligavis species around seven million years ago there are three subspecies two described by gregory mathews in 1912 there are only very slight differences between nominate race and c c samueli found in mount lofty ranges in south australia and c c from clarke range and atherton tableland in queensland latter race is described as poorly differentiated and possibly not worthy of recognition by handbook of birds of world surgeon general to first fleet john white caught a specimen in may 1788 calling it a yellow faced flycatcher in his journal of a voyage to new south wales which was published in 1790 latham called it black cheeked warbler john gould called it yellow faced honeyeater in 1848 which has become its official name it is also known as yellow honeyeater or quitchup in reference to its call description thumb right alt yellow faced honeyeater with body partially turned towards camera a distinctive yellow stripe runs below eye appearance yellow faced honeyeater is a medium small greyish brown bird that takes its common name from distinctive yellow stripes on sides of head yellow feathers form a narrow stripe above gape which broadens and curves below eye to end in a small white patch of feathers on ear coverts above yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off white patch behind eye and below is another distinct black stripe running length of yellow line chin throat and breast are a pale greyish brown streaked with slightly darker grey and abdomen is light grey upper body is a dark greyish brown to olive brown olive green outer edges on remiges combine to form an olive panel on folded wing bill is black and slightly down curved and gape is cream legs and feet are grey brown iris is a dusky blue in adult birds and brown in juveniles juvenile is very similar to adult with slightly less streaking on breast an orange brown tip on bill and a yellower gape male and female birds are also similar with male being slightly larger on average heavier and in field there are no visible differences between subspecies yellow faced honeyeater averages in length with a wingspan of and a weight of with an average of vocalizations one of first birds heard in morning yellow faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud and extremely varied male sings from a roost for up to an hour beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick up chick up from which its common name of quitchup is derived counter singing repeating first bird s song by neighbouring birds is common territorial call also given by opponents during fights is a long preet with an upward inflection alarm call is a loud trilling whistle common calls thought to be contact calls are animated two note calls variously described as terric terric cr rook cr rook or put put put put distribution and habitat thumb left alt honeyeater balancing on a bottlebrush flower yellow faced honeyeater can be seen feeding on garden shrubs habitat across its range yellow faced honeyeater is found in a range of habitats in open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high altitude subalpine areas and often in riparian woodlands it most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum corymbia maculata with and such as narrow leaved ironbark eucalyptus and silver leaved ironbark e with a light shrubby understorey and less often in dry open forests and woodlands dominated by angophora acacia banksia casuarina or callitris or in high altitude tall open forests of alpine ash eucalyptus delegatensis and woodlands dominated by snow gum e pauciflora or white box e it has been recorded in coastal heath when banksias are blooming and among flowering mangroves it occupies areas infested with weeds such as scotch broom and blackberries and developed areas including orchards and parks and gardens where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers it can be found in forests regenerating after fire or logging though it is more common in mature forests where it is found in woodland it is usually woodland near forest or with an understory of sclerophyll plants range yellow faced honeyeater ranges across a broad arc generally along coastline from near cooktown in far north queensland south west between a line from charters towers to albury and coast and then west to fleurieu peninsula and mount lofty ranges in south australia population densities have been recorded from 0 01 birds per hectare 2 5 acres near armidale in new south wales to 7 8 birds per hectare at victoria during winter months of june and july numbers are generally lower in victoria and higher in queensland following northward migration migration there are resident populations of yellow faced honeyeater throughout its range but it is for most part a seasonal latitudinal daytime migrant during autumn march to may it migrates north along highlands and coastal fringe of eastern australia to southern queensland to return in spring august to october of same year birds commonly move in flocks of 10 to 100 birds but occasionally in larger groups of up to 1 000 or more birds groups can include other species such as white naped honeyeater fuscous honeyeater noisy friarbird and silvereye they move in successive flocks at a rate of up to several thousand birds an hour over 100 000 birds were recorded passing hastings point in new south wales over course of a single day in may 1965 species is able to detect geomagnetic fields and uses them to navigate while migrating experiments where vertical component of magnetic field was reversed indicate that magnetic compass of yellow faced honeyeater is based on inclination of field lines and not on polarity meaning they distinguish between direction of equator and poles rather than north and south their flight is in one general direction but is not in a straight line as flocks stay in vegetated areas negotiate gaps in mountain ranges and detour around cities migration of many birds in australia including honeyeaters has generally been described as occurring mainly in response to external environmental stimuli such as food availability or an influx of water yellow faced honeyeater has been found to have a broad range of characteristics that are more often associated with northern hemisphere migrants these are an annual cycle of migratory restlessness seasonally appropriate orientation based on magnetic solar and polarised light cues and a migration program based on magnetic inclination compass behaviour thumb piercing base of a mountain devil lambertia formosa flower to feed on nectar yellow faced honeyeater is usually seen singly in pairs or in small family groups when not migrating they forage as individuals as pairs or as small groups of up to ten birds and during migration in larger groups they sometimes feed in large mixed species foraging flocks composed predominately of insectivorous birds feeding comparatively short billed for a honeyeater yellow faced honeyeater is thought to have adapted to a mixed diet its diet consists of nectar pollen fruit seeds honeydew and insects it is arboreal foraging primarily among foliage and flowers of trees shrubs and mistletoes less often on branches and tree trunk and rarely on ground yellow faced honeyeaters feed on nectar around 40 of time and on insects around 60 of time yellow faced honeyeater feeds on insects by gleaning and by sallying or catching insects in flight or probing in bark crevices insects eaten are primarily diptera flies mosquitoes maggots gnats and midges beetles and spiders a study of pollen on bills and foreheads of captured birds found that 70 carried pollen from silver banksia banksia marginata 61 from heath leaved banksia banksia ericifolia and 22 carried pollen from other plants in area including fern leaved banksia banksia oblongifolia mountain devil lambertia formosa and green spider flower grevillea in april and may before autumn migration yellow faced honeyeater increases its nectar consumption which increases its body mass average body mass in late autumn of is 13 higher than average recorded between january and april and yellow faced honeyeater begins migration with healthy fat reserves breeding thumb alt a yellow faced honeyeater feeding its chicks in a nest in a rose bush three chicks are raised in a flimsy nest in a garden shrub yellow faced honeyeater breeds in monogamous pairs in a breeding season that extends from july to march with migrating birds nesting later than sedentary birds they nest solitarily in all purpose territories that both parents defend against conspecifics and other species including thornbills and silvereyes although male is involved in more aggressive interactions than female within a breeding season females lay two or three clutches of eggs re nesting with same partner in same territory banded birds have been identified in same territory for periods of up to five years nest is built in understorey shrubs relatively close to ground nests have been recorded in prickly coprosma coprosma cassinia tea trees melaleuca eucalypts and acacias as well as in garden shrubs nest is a fragile cup shaped structure swollen at sides and narrower at rim female builds nest but is often accompanied by male as she gathers nesting material most nests are built of greenish material which varies with location in coastal areas grass is primary material in mountain forests nest is often covered with moss one bird was recorded repeatedly flying between nest and a koala away and plucking long hair near its ears to incorporate in nest nests are very fine with eggs visible through gauze like walls and they sometimes fall apart they have been known to disintegrate with eggs and nestlings falling through bottom female undertakes incubation alone eggs are oval approximately long and wide and pinkish white in colour with spots and blotches of dark reddish brown clutch size varies from one to three eggs and eggs take around two weeks to hatch upon hatching both parents feed nestlings and remove faecal pellets chicks fledge after thirteen days and leave parental territory after a further two weeks success rate can be as low as 16 of eggs developing into fledged young with nest failure hot weather heavy rain human activity including fungicide spraying and nest damage egg destruction by brood parasites and predation by brown snakes cats and currawongs all recorded as contributing to brood failure among species that parasitize nests of yellow faced honeyeaters are fan tailed cuckoos brush cuckoos pallid cuckoos shining bronze cuckoos and horsfield s bronze cuckoos yellow faced honeyeater promptly nests again after both successful and failed breeding attempts a paternity analysis of yellow faced honeyeater nestlings found that 10 of 18 nestlings were fathered by male of nesting pair with clear evidence for extra pair paternity in case of remaining 44 this conflicts with usual pattern where genetic monogamy is linked to characteristics of strong social pairing essential paternal contributions to brood rearing and to sexual characteristics exhibited by yellow honeyeater conservation status several ectoparasites which can affect both survival and reproductive fitness have been found on yellow faced honeyeater mites ptilonyssus and ptilonyssus and ixodes species ticks in general honeyeaters require extensive corridors of mature trees along their migratory routes and flowering woodlands for nesting so they are vulnerable to effects of land clearing grazing and weed infestation woodland habitat they prefer is considered an endangered ecological community as it is common and widespread yellow faced honeyeater is considered by iucn to be of least concern for conservation a field experiment to determine whether yellow faced honeyeater nests were less successful in fragmented habitats found nests closer to forest margins actually had a higher success rate than those deeper within forest yellow faced honeyeater tends to nest away from edge of forest remnants experiments with natural and artificial nests at varying distances from open areas showed no increase in number of avian predators at forest edge experiment results do not support ecological trap and predator influx theories and contribute to a belief that fragmented habitats may not be as problematic as previously thought in some areas species is considered a pest because of its intrusion into orchards and urban gardens where it damages fruit references bibliography external links xeno canto audio recordings of yellow faced honeyeater yellow faced honeyeater category birds of
