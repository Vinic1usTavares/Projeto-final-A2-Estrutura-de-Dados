creation and development i ve done a number of interviews and i ve told a number of people this and i don t know if it s flattering or what to my father because it s i base a lot of you know character s based a lot on my father i lost my dad about a year and a half ago and i loved him a lot he was very very important in my life but he was a man in a position very much like mr skinner is mitch pileggi talking about his character s development role of walter skinner was played by actor mitch pileggi who had unsuccessfully auditioned for two or three other characters on x files before getting part at first fact that he was asked back to audition for recurring role slightly puzzled him until he discovered reason he had not previously been cast in those roles chris carter had been unable to envision pileggi as any of those characters due to fact that actor had been shaving his head when actor had attended audition for walter skinner he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow back pileggi s attitude fit well with walter skinner s character causing carter to assume that actor was only pretending to be grumpy after successfully auditioning for role pileggi thought he had been lucky that he had not been cast in one of earlier roles as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed opportunity to play recurring role of walter skinner lowry brian stegall sarah and carter chris 1995 pp 145 pileggi himself thought he got role because of gillian anderson s who portrayed dana scully pregnancy during second season saying producers felt they needed to take show in a different direction while she was pregnant so pileggi felt at start that he compensated for situation of show and after a while character started to grow on producers and fellow cast as pileggi puts it character just started kind of clicking and working at end of second season producers wanted pileggi to return in future episodes so he signed a six year contract with them in an interview with x files fan site host robin pileggi commented once that he felt david duchovny s portrayed fox mulder semi departure in season eight and introduction of robert patrick s john doggett and fact that he started to believe in aliens at end of season seven skinner was given opportunity to grow further stating new avenues had been opened while pileggi stated that he missed duchovny s presence in x files he continued saying that he did not have opportunity to work with him during seventh season he even went as far as saying that there was no interaction between two characters he was positive to new storyline conceived during duchovny s departure saying it gave show a shot in arm which reinvented show i want to believe as writers carter and frank spotnitz aimed to avoid complicating storyline of x files i want to believe with superfluous appearances of characters from television series skinner is only returning character in movie he was included in film s plot only when a fitting opportunity to involve him arose and spotnitz and carter were very happy to write skinner into story hurwitz knowles 2008 pp 231 scenes of x files i want to believe that include skinner were filmed very late in movie s filming schedule and particular scene that acts as character s introduction in movie was filmed for reasons of time in two different locations reception character received critical acclaim from fans and critics alike and since became a fan s favourite of show mitch pileggi received acclaim for his portrayal of character while not winning or getting nominated for any of his work alone in x files mitch pileggi and several other cast members were nominated in category outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series by screen actors guild awards in 1997 1998 and 1999 but did not win following broadcast of one breath in which skinner recalls serving as a us marine during vietnam war pileggi received several fan letters from vietnam veterans lowry brian stegall sarah and carter chris 1995 pp 142 ben rawson jones named character of skinner a spy cult icon in 2008 describing him as corporate middle man george avalos and michael liedtke from contra costa times both reacted positively to death of alex krycek at hands of skinner saying it was best scene of eighth season finale existence another review
