connors rob morgan as turk barrett rachael taylor as voice of trish walker danny johnson as benjamin donovan stephen rider as blake tower production development thumb upright mike colter stars as luke cage after first doing so in jessica jones in october 2013 marvel and disney announced that marvel television and abc studios would provide netflix with live action series centered around daredevil jessica jones iron fist and luke cage leading up to a miniseries based on defenders in december 2014 mike colter was cast as cage which was envisioned as a recurring role on jessica jones before headlining his own series netflix and marvel announced that cheo hodari coker would be showrunner for marvel s luke cage in late march 2015 after he pitched series to netflix as an examination of harlem like what wire did for baltimore season consists of 13 hour long episodes writing each episode of season is named after a gang starr song with coker wanting full season to feel like an album of music explaining when prince put out an album you would shut things out and listen to whole thing similarly to modern binge watching of television series coker was inspired to name episodes based on music by television producer shonda rhimes who names each episode of grey s anatomy after a pop song coker chose gang starr songs ahead of his first pitch meeting with marvel television head jeph loeb to help organize his planned story arcs he chose songs based on their titles only so each episode s events does not necessarily reflect respective song s lyrics loeb described season as a fugitive story and a story of redemption and said it was about luke cage s story and where he came from and most importantly where he s going after telling an early part of middle of his story on jessica jones colter noted that series uses flashbacks to tell elements of story like previous marvel netflix shows coker described series as a powerful fusion of dark drama hip hop and classic superhero action and wire of marvel television more specifically coker felt season was a hip hop western comparing it to sergio leone s dollars trilogy of films with cage man with no name coming to a town harlem where he is convinced to fight injustice coker further compared characters cottonmouth and misty knight to resident villain and local law enforcement respectively of western genre and described harlem s paradise nightclub as town s saloon season picks up a few months after jessica jones with luke cage trying to stay off radar end of second episode get s this series into forward action mode by making cage see that he couldn t just sit back and do nothing coker said arc for cage in season was hero and felt this was a more natural way of introducing character than telling a traditional origin story as other marvel properties have done this also differentiated show from rest of mcu coker had plotted story of first four episodes before show s writers room began work but had initially done so over two or three episodes with event at end of second episode originally taking place at end of first loeb and marvel s karim zreik told coker to slow pace of show down which led to an approach that coker compared to unforgiven set in harlem rather than hell s kitchen of previous marvel netflix series colter described season as a completely different world marvel comics editor in chief joe quesada said that unlike fictionalized version of hell s kitchen depicted in daredevil and jessica jones which was more inline with how it was when comics were first written harlem of luke cage represents harlem of today and is truer to real life modern new york however colter admitted that show s version of harlem does resemble harlem of maybe ten years ago coker said that harlem was a world for series but also about legacy he wanted to replicate experience of walking through harlem and hearing different music coming from cars driving past and open windows which he felt was unique to neighborhood coker further described harlem s paradise nightclub as series iron throne and wanted it to invoke history of harlem it s crime politics music really whole cornucopia of black creative existence in one place cage is seen wearing a black hoodie throughout series which beyond being practical for a character trying to lie low was a nod to trayvon martin and black lives matter colter said it was meant to invoke idea that a black man in a hoodie isn t necessarily a threat he might just be a hero series also features a political campaign with slogan keep harlem black in face of gentrification that threatens to homogenize harlem s cultural history discussing these racial undertones coker asked how does presence of a bulletproof black man change ecosystem of a neighborhood not just in terms of street level crime how do cops react to someone like that what are ripple effects of doing that that s one of things i wanted to explore on show he did caution comparisons to recent headlines involving racial tension given when they had begun working on show stating that his focus had been on identity which he saw as a common element in all black art casting main cast for season includes colter as cage mahershala ali as cornell cottonmouth stokes simone missick as misty knight theo rossi as hernan shades alvarez erik laray harvey as willis stryker diamondback whose involvement was not officially announced by marvel prior to season s release as he agreed not to do any publicity for show to not ruin twist of stryker being season s main villain rosario dawson as claire temple reprising her role from daredevil and jessica jones and alfre woodard as mariah dillard in september 2015 frank whaley was cast as rafael scarfe sean ringgold and karen pittman were revealed to be involved in series in march 2016 playing sugar and priscilla ridley respectively also recurring throughout season are ron cephas jones as bobby fish jacob vargas as domingo colon darius kaleb as lonnie wilson jade wu as connie lin deborah ayorinde as candace miller justin swain as mark bailey jaiden kaine as zip dawn lyen gardner as megan mclaren jeremiah richard craft as d w griffith michael kostroff as noah burstein tijuana ricks as thembi wallace and john clarence stewart as alex wesley several other actors also reprise roles from other marvel netflix shows parisa fitz henley returns as cage s former wife reva connors from jessica jones rob morgan reprises role of turk barrett from daredevil rachael taylor provides voice of trish walker who she plays in jessica jones for a radio talk show and danny johnson and stephen rider reprise their roles of benjamin donovan and blake tower from second season of daredevil design costume designer stephanie maslansky returned from same role on daredevil and jessica jones like main characters of those shows cage has his own wardrobe evolution throughout season after his initial look of t shirts jeans leather jackets or an army jacket was introduced in jessica jones series opted to depict cage in a trayvon martin inspired hoodie but introduces character s classic costume for a brief flashback colter said that costume designed in era is not made for serious moments but series was able to poke fun at it in brief scene in looking to pay homage to cage s original costume with his updated clothing maslansky and coker considered having him wear gold clothing but thought that would be too on nose and impractical for someone trying not to draw attention instead maslansky lined insides of cage s hoodies with yellow so color could frame character s face in close ups in contrast to cage s hoodie with jeans and t shirts many of series villains wear well tailored suits stokes does this because he wants to present himself as a wealthy successful businessman and wears a lot of suits from dolce gabbana and zegna one of his suits for show was custom made to pay homage to comics maslansky dressed ali in a green suit for his introduction using a subtle shade of green to avoid being flamboyant character subsequently is always wearing something green like emerald earrings for one costume designer noted that many of these elements would not be noticed by audience but they made a difference to ali when he was getting into character for character shades brands such as hugo boss helmut lang prada and ferragamo were used because he wasn t trying to hide who he was while misty knight in her final shot of season is shown wearing a version of her own iconic comic costume that look includes leather pants and an interesting cold shoulder shaped top a cream colored top that fit that shape was found and dyed red for scene sets were designed and dressed to consist of strong colors that could be emphasized by series cinematography to help differentiate show from noir look and tone of jessica jones nightclub harlem s paradise was intended to invoke real life harlem nightclubs cotton club and lenox lounge with production designer loren weeks also returning from that capacity on daredevil and jessica jones taking specific inspiration from apollo and smalls paradise because of series filming schedule and coker s desire to film live musical performances in club it was decided that filming in an actual nightclub would be unrealistic a set was built for location with weeks using an art deco style to give club a very distinctive look and giving it an historical anchor and indicate that it had been a successful club around 1920s and 1930s and was now being refurbished as part of stokes and dillard s new harlem renaissance weeks felt building could be a metaphor for political undercurrents of series set decorator alison whom weeks worked with on other marvel netflix series furbished harlem s paradise set with contemporary furniture finishes and lighting fixtures to contrast older architectural design lounge side of club features two murals by archibald j motley an artist from original harlem renaissance coker insisted that set for pop s barbershop be at street level to connect it both visually and geographically with harlem street for budget reasons dressing an actual location as barbershop was not going to work but building a set to be at street level was also problematic since they would not be able to show people or cars driving past window that you would see on an actual street it was decided that a real location be found that is below street level so that scenes could be filmed on street there but would not have to match inside scenes filmed on set because of obstructed view of street to emphasize this set was built even lower than actual store and a fake wall was added to location coker instructed series prop master to carefully choose a selection of books to appear in cage s bedroom including ralph ellison s invisible man filming thumb left filming took place on location in harlem which was important for showrunner cheo hodari coker to accurately depict neighborhood marvel announced in february 2014 that series would be filmed in new york city with quesada stating in april that show would be filming on location in addition to sound stage work in july 2015 loeb stated that luke cage was prepping to begin filming and by september 2015 production had begun under working title tiara filming concluded in march 2016 filming took place in harlem including lenox avenue and areas where american gangster was shot mount olivet baptist church st nicholas park jackie robinson park riverside park and riverside drive viaduct in washington heights including at united palace cortlandt alley in chinatown in areas of queens for when cage escapes seagate prison and puts on classic power man costume roosevelt island steam plant and queens detention facility for interiors of seagate music hall of williamsburg for exterior of harlem s paradise former fulton correctional facility in bronx for crispus attucks complex and long island city portion of newtown creek it was important to coker for series to film in harlem only place in city where you see those wide boulevards we really wanted to capture color rhythm of streets for example production had opportunity to film at a barbershop in greenwich village which would have been much easier for production but coker said opportunity to film it in harlem was irresistible i didn t want us to talk about harlem and then not film there soundstage filming took place at broadway stages in greenpoint brooklyn for church that cage and temple visit in savannah georgia an abandoned church in bronx was found that was being sold and production was able to graffiti up and sort of ruin it they also had to spend two days carting snow from site before filming after a recent blizzard manuel billeter served as director of photography for series after doing same for jessica jones he worked with director paul mcguigan to establish look of show in first two episodes with coker hiring mcguigan based on his direction of sherlock episode a scandal in belgravia coker was delighted to learn how little cgi mcguigan used to craft visuals of that episode and wanted same approach for luke cage just old school camera stuff he brought a very analogue perspective analogue feel to show mcguigan coker explained directed every scene as long takes from multiple takes over and over again we would run an entire eight page scene almost like a play so when it comes together it s seamless mcguigan was inspired by works of photographers gordon parks tony ray jones and jack garofalo billeter looked to differentiate look of luke cage from jessica jones using modified gels on lights and saturating and warming colors in color correction to give harlem a more glowing look coker noted that series has a color scheme of yellow brown amber and gold in contrast to violet tint billeter gave jessica jones to reflect that series villain purple man series was shot on netflix s standard 4k cameras with billeter pairing them with panavision primo lenses that were custom treated with a reflective coating in between glass elements in interior of lens causing more flares and bringing down contrast in addition to very slightly de focusing them in order to add something magic less controlled and more cinematic billeter filmed colter with a lot of low angles to make him look even more heroic and kept camera close to him with harlem in background so that cage is always dominant force in his shots but he also remains a part of terrain shots aren t of him alone they re of him in his home cage s fight style in series was called smack fu by coker referring to way he tried not to punch anybody since that would probably kill them with his super strength to film effect of bullets bouncing off of cage remote controlled devices were attached to colter and operated by somebody behind cameras devices could burn his skin if not attached properly and colter almost lost hearing in one ear after forgetting to insert required ear pieces third episode begins with a couch coming out of window of fictional crispus attucks complex in harlem this was a tease of a large fight scene series version of superhero hallway fight made famous in daredevil filming for fight was influenced by arnold schwarzenegger s invading police station in terminator and was one of toughest sequences for crew to shoot it took a 14 hour day and colter attributed successful completion of sequence including couch shot to director guillermo navarro colter also called fourth episode particularly difficult to film taking around 12 or 13 days to shoot episode was written by executive producer charles murray who looked to organically transition character s origin story from original comics into modern world of series for episode this involved flashbacks with colter in makeup and different costumes scenes shot at united palace theater created new challenges for series stunt team due to not being able to drill holes in historic building for creating anchors for wire rigs and other complex stunts crew had to find other ways to weigh down equipment to remain safe for actors and stunt doubles for explosion at restaurant genghis connie s a practical explosion was created in storefront on location which was extended with visual effects to show destruction of building a set showing inside of rubble of destroyed building was then created on a soundstage while a lot was found that feels similar to original location where rubble could by piled and fire trucks could be brought to show exterior lot was previously being used to store vehicles that had been seized as evidence with production having to negotiate with nypd to have vehicles moved elsewhere looking back on filming style of season and comparing it to previous marvel netflix series weeks said that crew members working on each of shows wanted them all to feel like they are set in same city but also for world of each character to be distinct and for this series they embraced harlem for exactly what it is to differentiate visual identity some of that is lighting and of course some of that is production design and location work color life activity on streets there s so much character to neighborhood i think it was important to feel that these characters were rooted in real place series production sound mixer joshua anderson who worked on daredevil and jessica jones as well worked to capture as much sound on set with boom mics over to ground unbelievable elements of series in naturalistic sound he noted that ali s cottonmouth laugh and many of colter s lines in particular sounded incredible on boom anderson also talked about luke cage adding a new layer of sound that other series did not music captured sound had to be clear to be properly mixed in with music later and live performances in harlem s paradise had to be recorded for which anderson and his team had experience after working on musical series smash visual effects fusefx provided 867 visual effects shots for season with a team of 15 to 20 members under fusefx new york s production head and senior visual effects supervisor greg anderson anderson explained that series challenging schedule was made easier by company s catalog of previously used digital assets and effect elements that can be reused or partially reused where appropriate in new projects several effects shots were created to show cage s abilities including a slow motion shot of a thug s fist collapsing into a compound fracture while punching cage in face a standout effects sequence for season was when stokes fires a missile at a building which took fusefx 130 days to complete it involved creating a cg building and integrating it into footage of a real new york city block matching up with different camera angles and sources of light throughout sequence effects team then had to digitally destroy building and create a complex array of fireballs and falling debris music in april 2016 coker revealed that adrian younge and ali shaheed muhammad were composing series score describing it as a confluence of multiple genres a bit of 90s hip hop soul psychedelic rock and classical younge and muhammad composed score as if they were creating 13 albums one for each episode with music inspired by wu tang clan ennio morricone and muhammad s group a tribe called quest duo composed around twenty minutes of music for each episode composing entire season s score in nine months younge and muhammad were encouraged to push sound of score as far as they could and were allowed use of a full 30 piece orchestra for recording they also arranged an original rap single bulletproof love which features method man who performs it in show songs from mahalia jackson nina simone john lee hooker it serves you right to suffer and i m bad like jesse james dusty springfield son of a preacher man and wu tang clan bring da ruckus are used in season it also features onscreen performances by various artists as live performances in harlem s paradise nightclub which coker wanted to use to help capture vibe of neighborhood coker wanted prince to perform at nightclub for season finale before his death in april 2016 swear jar that appears in season was designed by coker in hopes of convincing artist to make cameo appearance as he was known to have a swear jar himself since he was a devout jehovah s witness role was ultimately filled by sharon jones dap kings which coker said was better choice because that sequence is about mariah being crowned a soundtrack album for season was released on october 7 digitally and pressed on yellow vinyl by mondo coker said that one of things that s really cornerstone of 90s hip hop is sampling so we have a lot of influences that we wear openly which he compared to style of quentin tarantino he continued i think what makes it feel new is fact that we re showing you can be both we re showing that you can do ralph ellison at same times as you re doing chester himes coker was as specific with his choices of music in season as martin scorsese is with rock n roll references like in casino or in goodfellas rather than just adding hip hop music for sake of it he highlighted use of i m bad like jesse james in seventh episode which he had been trying to use in something for 20 years that builds up and coincides with explosion that happens on screen and it s so subtle that s kind of stuff i geek out over marvel cinematic universe tie ins part of series takes place simultaneously with events of second season of daredevil throughout season villains use hammer industries weapons to counter cage s abilities justin hammer and his company were introduced in iron man 2 and hammer was last seen incarcerated in seagate prison in marvel one shot all hail king seagate is depicted in luke cage as prison where carl lucas was sent and where there are rumored millionaires hidden in basement series references events of avengers and members of that team as well as future defenders and their own series specific mentions of latter include madame gao s operations in daredevil widely known villains wilson fisk and frank castle and a flier for colleen wing s martial arts class to then be introduced in iron fist release first season of luke cage was released on september 30 2016 on streaming service netflix

79 out of 100 based on 30 critics indicating generally favorable reviews reviewing first seven episodes of season allison keene of collider awarded it 5 stars out of 5 describing episodes as an intimate portrait of harlem culture and noting that each character had distinct personalities and memorable moments keene specifically praised colter mike cecchini of den of geek spoke positively of season particularly cast atmosphere and willingness to go places that other marvel studios productions can t he found simone missick to be standout performer praised soundtrack which has most active role in a superhero production since guardians of galaxy and was equally impressed with original score by younge and muhammad however cecchini felt season repeated some issues from previous marvel netflix series such as use of archetypes and monologues deadline hollywood dominic patten called luke cage one of most socially relevant and smartest shows on small screen you will see this year series reaches both back and forward into culture of heroes and an america looking for a true game changer david milner for digital spy was also positive about season s exploration of african american history but felt ali s cottonmouth did not reach heights of previous marvel netflix villains maureen ryan of variety felt season has a more than adequate supply of pleasures with a strong cast that could overcome some of its issues including a somewhat clunky pilot and a notable tendency to sprawl merrill barr writing for forbes called season another winner for marvel and netflix that shouldn t be missed praising its story twists and 70s stylings that shake things up real well giving season 4 5 stars out of 5 cinema blend s eric eisenberg felt luke cage has a unique flavor that could very well lead it to being called best netflix marvel series so far by time its first season is over a sentiment also shared by helen o hara of daily telegraph eisenberg also praised members of supporting cast including missick whaley frankie faison as pop and rossi as well as ali and woodard as main villains despite weak exposition delivery in pilot repetitive narrative structures and individual arcs that are cut short too soon eisenberg concluded that luke cage presented an area of mcu unlike any previous films or television series and had done so with a compelling vision and atmosphere david betancourt for washington post concluded that luke cage is netflix s best marvel show to date when given chance to bring to life one of most well known heroes of color around marvel and netflix produced something that is undeniably and unapologetically black and beautiful tv guides alexander zalban called season one of 2016 s most vital important and timely television series saying it had incredibly layered and iconic performances from cast matt webb mitovich of tvline who gave season a b felt harlem was a wonderfully utilized character in season and a welcome change from hell s kitchen setting of previous marvel netflix shows he also praised strong performances from colter bringing a needed intensity and ali compelling and threatening but felt some of its moments and pacing were issues entertainment weeklys jeff jensen awarded season a b calling it a meaningful attempt at developing a new model black hero as entertaining drama it s trapped in a not so marvelous trapped cage he criticized season as one more piece of marvel pop that expresses its shared world premise so poorly it s jarring when it even happens and also took issue with elements of season s logic pacing and thinly stretched plot reviewing entire season terri schwartz of ign awarded it an 8 4 out of 10 saying marvel s luke cage doesn t reach heights of daredevil and jessica jones and its flawed second half ends up diminishing what was otherwise a fantastic season but with something important to say and interesting new characters luke cage is another win for marvel s netflix shows analysis keene highlighted use of race in season and how it did not just study crime but also beleaguered police sleazy politicians and young people in community who see guns and drugs as an easy way to make money zalban felt that just like jessica jones sucked fans in by being a superhero detective story set in marvel universe while actually being one of most powerful and thorough explorations of sexual assault ever committed to film so too would luke cage with racial aspects it covered lorraine ali at los angeles times praised season for giving an alternative perspective on black america to that provided by donald trump depicting a nuanced black and latino community of professionals and working class people trees and cityscapes complex conversations and shorthand street slang ali felt that cage s focus on teaching others about culture of harlem rather than always using his abilities made him one of more interesting and relevant modern superheroes but also noted that he could be old fashioned in his earnestness at times such as in his sensitivity towards use of word nigger reed ramsey highlighted nods to black lives matter movement in season for odyssey especially depiction of police brutality against black civilians and use of hoodies covered in bullet holes as a symbol for standing up against system ramsey also praised fact that all main characters in season were not white and that characters in positions of power were women writing for study breaks aliyah thomas found some of season s symbolism to be hackneyed but still felt it was one of most promising narratives i have yet to come across on black experience and unapologetically black thomas highlighted humanity of cage as well as use of music to evoke blaxploitation era of films in which comics were originally written which she felt accurately encompassed both culture of harlem and exploitation that cage and other black americans have endured in past commenting on overall response to season for screenprism rae helford claimed that season is both progressive and regressive in its race politics with coker actively trying to avoid stereotypes of blaxploitation era by featuring an anti gun hero strong black female characters and other characters from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences however season was unable to completely avoid this because it also embraces music that was made famous to general audiences through blaxploitation films and because it features a significant amount of crime and violence helford found a generally positive response to show s use of word nigger and cage s dislike of it but also detailed criticisms that some had regarding cage s conservative personality and fact that his political ideologies did not make him a true representation of past civil rights leaders as some may have expected for daily fandom rachel a questioned why cage was right character to be first black headliner of an mcu project finding contrasting interpretations of his abilities cage could represent fantasy of african americans who face very real prospect of that harm and find escapism in imagining a state of immunity from it or he could represent stereotype of african americans having a body that can endure endless abuse and exploitation and still produce economic value she also felt that cage s apparent inability to be killed absolved marvel from certain political issues saying white audiences did not have to question whether cage s life mattered as in black lives matter because they would know that he is safe from harm tomi obaro specifically highlighted season s women of color for buzzfeed finding season to be a rare example of nuanced women of color who were not main character obaro gave especial praise to complex depictions of dillard knight and temple but noted that even minor female characters were given exposition to add depth to their portrayals and found many of these characters to be even more interesting than cage and other leading men of season feeling that cage was boring and most of male characters fit into simple archetypes veronica of essence and charles pulliam moore of splinter news agreed with latter calling season s portrayal of women its real strength and praising it for expanding scope of mcu to include black women as both major heroes and villains in response to these comments coker said black women are most passionate commentators and even as black female geeks and nerds they are rarely acknowledged so this show is kind of a love letter to them contrasting some of these opinions noah berlatsky of quartz discussed some of complexities of male characters in season and how it questions toxic black male stereotypes of masculinity and criminality using examples of cage s intelligence and vulnerability pop s philosophy of peace and deescalation and stokes love of music and unwillingness to become a criminal however berlatsky felt season failed to follow through with these questions as from moment pop first appears on screen it s clear ideology he represents is going to be discarded luke cage recognizes young cornell s gentleness and vulnerability but it still has to turn him into cottonmouth accolades luke cage was included on multiple best top tv shows of 2016 lists ranking on african american film critics association s 5th npr s 6th and hidden remote s 7th it was also
