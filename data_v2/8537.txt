states secretary of agriculture earl butz in sea tunt part ii and cia experimental program project mkultra in liquid lunch exact period is intentionally vague this according to art director neal holman allowed producers freedom to cherry pick stuff they like and ignore elements that they don t in archer subsequent years reed developed new settings and character arcs often with self contained stories as he explored new concepts for comedy much like an anthology these seasons see group attempt to complete a number of laborious tasks in highly unusual circumstances generally to no avail that involve sustaining an illegal cocaine operation to keep afloat contract work for cia and running a private los angeles based detective agency after being blacklisted from espionage by us government

20th century fox production development thumb upright adam reed creator of archer before creation of archer adam reed worked on animated comedies with executive producer and longtime collaborator matt thompson pair became renowned for their work on a number of adult swim television projects chiefly sealab 2021 and their follow up frisky dingo which aired for several years after cancellation of frisky dingo in 2008 reed took a vacation to spain to brainstorm ideas for a new project his experience traversing via de la plata and people watching in plaza mayor in nearby salamanca enabled him to conceptualize his vision of archer reed recalled in an interview so i sat on plaza mayor for three days drinking either coffee or beer or gin depending on time of day surrounded by these spanish women who seemed both unaware and completely aware of their beauty occasionally they would glance over and catch me gaping at them and just smile at me like i know right and for three days i couldn t even splutter buenos dias to any of them not once and thus was sterling archer born he would ve absolutely sauntered over to a table full of those women and sat down and ordered an entire case of cava or whatever nevertheless he believed developing a sitcom with theme of global espionage was inevitable given his proclivity for adventure driven comedy james bond franchise oss 117 cairo nest of spies 2006 and pink panther franchise were reed s inspiration as series then under working title duchess began taking definite form by august 18 2009 following reed s pitch to fx network commissioned six episodes for archer fx initially commissioned project as a companion series for their situational comedy it s always sunny in philadelphia but network ultimately delayed archer premiere to following january because of demanding production schedule and league became philadelphia companion show instead despite this pilot mole hunt aired as a test screening on september 17 2009 following season five premiere of philadelphia pilot was not featured in program listings or otherwise promoted by fx rather network merely informed select television critics of broadcast fx moved archer to fxx s broadcast lineup in 2017 as part of an aggressive strategy to increase network s output of animated programming fx had planned move before show s seventh season in conjunction with debut of cassius and clay but decided against it after clay abrupt cancellation tenth season premiered on may 29 2019 writing scriptwriting an episode consumes three weeks of production schedule as comedy s main writer reed typically creates first draft during pre production which he submits to his team of producers and art directors from there they analyze script for each character cast guest stars and create basic concept designs before reed develops a final script to submit to fxx a typical archer episode goes through a page of dialogue per minute archer uses standard setup of a workplace comedy where subversively unlikeable characters play off bawdy reference heavy humor rapid fire dialogue and interaction based drama early episodes parody spy film and routinely mock cliches of genre by end of fourth season however reed questioned longevity of comedy s spy premise and began contemplating a new direction for archer impelled by then growing associations of isis with identically fundamentalist jihadist group newer seasons experiment with standard format of an anthology each with their own self contained arc new settings a disparate set of personae for each character even distinct humor reed said once we started making them and having a good time making them we thought what are some other things we can do now that boundaries have sort of been passed cultural references on archer cover a wide spectrum of society and human condition in film literature and music for example some chiefly references to literature are obscure and audience often may not notice them in a single viewing reed cites his time as a university english major as primary forebear for show s literary references archer also develops a unique self referentiality through character based jokes catchphrases and running gags that evolve over multiple episodes for example sterling or another character may yell phrasing in response to any sexually suggestive remark neil genzlinger of new york times argues that archer uses a caustic brand of humor that isn t for everybody but that has brought show a dedicated fan base animation thumb left 375px archer characters are composed in adobe illustrator using referential material such as photos of models and actors in costume pictured above archer animation style mirrors aesthetic of mad men and mid century comic art in style of jack kirby and steve ditko among others line work is pronounced by thick bold outlines in contrast to very fine thin line work characteristic of prime time comedies such as simpsons and family guy production of comedy involves a workforce of 150 crew members from reed and thompson s atlanta based company floyd county productions quadrupling number that worked on its freshman season archers production process uses adobe software photoshop illustrator and after effects as well as visual effects programs such as toon boom harmony and cinema 4d for compositing and animation this begins with storyboarding typically after a script has been approved and lasts around 11 13 weeks per episode four episodes are produced in tandem at any given session generally in staggered phases in initial stages of animation art director chad hurd and producer neal holman storyboard set pieces with a team of artists based on specifications in script after a series of design revisions and reviews these skeletal designs are then rendered as 3d models in autodesk 3ds max employing a variety of animation and special effects techniques illustration team takes various screenshots of 3d models once they have been completed and resulting images are enhanced by specialized artists in after effects characters are composed in illustrator using referential material among them photos of models and actors in costume because archer is produced using limited animation characters are rendered as digital puppets and not hand drawn on paper and digitally composited for traditional cel animation costumes may or may not be reproduced depending on their animatability too much detail can hurt a character s animatability these body pieces are then separated into basic components and layers much like an action figure and rigged in after effects consequently one given pose can turn into a range of others which according to producer bryan fordney creates illusion of more animation on screen than what is actually present a similar technique is used in animation of a character s face head illustrations are divided into basic components that can be turned off and on in sequence lending appearance of facial movement and expression source code is often implemented to ensure better automation and a more fluid range of motion once compositing begins compositors enhance visual palette of artwork from three or four departments until it looks like it was made by a single artist for elaborate scenes like action sequences artists develop several composites which are then superimposed on stock footage using special effects title sequence and music holman cited catch me if you can 2002 incredibles 2004 kiss kiss bang bang 2006 and work of saul bass as strong stylistic influences in creation of archer title sequence when he was developing original sequence rough draft version consisted of style frames with roiling flame silhouettes of characters coalesced on a charred black background crew initially struggled to develop an opening theme they believed was compatible with premise of archer but once show s eponymous theme song had been completed holman felt his idea was too melodramatic and went in a different direction he created finalized version of sequence from several segments each reviewed by producers because of demanding production schedule standard opening of archer has gone through six iterations a replacement of shots at start of show s sixth season and brand new sequences for its fifth seventh eighth ninth and tenth seasons archer did not employ a composer to develop a soundtrack in its first four seasons but instead used a compilation of needle drop stock music by season five musician jg thirlwell was hired as composer for comedy s jazz influenced score brought to producers attention for his work on venture bros voice actors thumb right from left to right tyler reed benjamin parnell greer and nash archer has a principal cast of eight actors h jon benjamin jessica walter aisha tyler judy greer

voices cyril figgis yates portrays dr algernop krieger and reed plays ray gillette reed was expected to play titular role in original pilot but was recast because producers felt his voice over did not service character s dialogue well when benjamin received offer he was surprised since he did not believe his voice was suitable for part at one point benjamin used a british accent for character but reed insisted he use his normal speaking voice walter was first significant casting choice on archer producers contracted her shortly after they sent out character descriptions to talent agencies and they promoted her involvement to recruit actors for project greer agreed to archer because of her wish to break into voice acting although she initially believed series was too provocative for network tv nash did not audition for her part rather actress was approached by reed and thompson whom she had previously collaborated with in frisky dingo while she was recording dvd extras for their program yates was brought onto archer at nash s request after krieger was given a more prominent speaking role in addition to main cast episodes often feature guest voices from a range of professions major supporting roles in archer are played by george coe until his death in 2015 jeffrey tambor christian slater jon hamm allison tolman dave willis ona grauer keegan michael key bryan cranston and j k simmons among others some stars appear as themselves or portray fictionalized caricatures of themselves such as slater kenny loggins as well as late anthony bourdain and burt reynolds archer cast members record their lines individually rather than at group recording sessions to accommodate their work schedules producers therefore do not host table reads or rehearsals reed or another producer may be present at a session or direct actors over phone in event they are not together recording sessions can take place anywhere but are typically held at studios in atlanta los angeles and new york

archer has been well received by media a number of tv critics have complimented work of voice actors often singling out benjamin for further praise tim goodman from hollywood reporter for example viewed benjamin s acting as bedrock of archer mixing rants mumbling whining and a stop and start delivery style that is note perfect for comedy other reviewers cited writing crude sensibility and characterization among show s most satisfying attributes main characters have been described as exceedingly well defined chris barton of los angeles times called archer smartest strangest animated show on tv this side of rick and morty and entertainment weekly journalist ken tucker praised series for its solid plotting vividly distinct characters and some of most unexpected punchlines and sight gags in prime time archer willingness to experiment with anthologized tropes is a principal topic of discussion among critics some journalists felt these arcs provide show greater creative license to explore deeper within itself while comedy received positive feedback for staying true to form in service of something much grimier and at once totally fresh in early seasons later archer episodes have been subjected to criticism as tone and emphasis of show evolves by eighth and ninth seasons some critics believed that despite having greater visual appeal archer too often sacrifices narrative continuity and humor through increasingly predictable and uninspired writing series has been included on a number of best of lists tv guide ranked archer among 60 greatest tv cartoons of all time and
