b class was a class of 11 submarines built by vickers in barrow in furness for royal navy and launched in 1904 06 one boat was sunk by a collision in 1912 but remainder served in world war i three boats protected transfer of british expeditionary force to france in 1914 but were soon relegated to local defence and training duties six submarines were in mediterranean when war began and were quickly sent to dardanelles to prevent a breakout by german battlecruiser and light cruiser into eastern mediterranean b11 ventured into dardanelles in december 1914 and sank elderly turkish ironclad arrival of more modern submarines to blockade dardanelles made b class boats redundant and they were mostly withdrawn to malta in 1915 they were transferred to venice after italy entered war where b10 became first submarine to be sunk by air attack in 1916 b class submarines were transferred back to malta in late 1916 as they were no longer deemed suitable for combat in mid 1917 they were converted to surface patrol boats and sent to patrol otranto barrage they proved to be unreliable and were soon sent back to malta where they were finally paid off only b3 was still in commission when war ended and that was only because it was being used for experimental work and serving as a target to train anti submarine forces all surviving boats were sold for scrap in 1919 21 design and description b class boats were similar in design to preceding a class and intended for coastal patrol work boats had a petrol engine for surface propulsion and batteries for underwater propulsion design was intended to overcome limitations of speed endurance and seakeeping that affected boats of a class and boats were substantially larger than earlier class b class submarines were long overall they had a beam of and a draught of they displaced on surface and submerged boats were over longer slightly wider and displaced more than more than older boats their additional size increased their buoyancy and made them far less liable to unexpectedly plunge beneath surface in bad weather addition of a deck casing above hull also improved their seakeeping abilities akermann pp 120 123 24 diving planes were initially only fitted at stern but additional planes were mounted on conning tower during construction of b1 b2 and b3 b4 was not fitted with them and it is uncertain if remaining boats received them during construction these greatly improved boats depth keeping surfacing and diving abilities compared to a class boats these were later exchanged for bow planes last boat to receive them was b6 which did not get hers until january 1916 b class submarines lacked any internal bulkheads which exposed crew to petrol engine s exhaust fumes mice were used to detect any concentrations of carbon monoxide inside hull wilson pp 40 44 ventilation was provided for batteries but none for crew s living area no accommodations were provided for crew and they were forced to improvise while at sea wilson p 44 in recognition of this issue crew s endurance was only expected to be four days during summer and three days during winter akermann p 124 submarines hulls were tested to a nominal depth of by filling hull with water and subjecting it to a pressure of but maximum operational depth was considered to be nonetheless several boats safely dived to during world war i it took about three minutes to dive boat due to shape of boat and that it could dive out of control if water was pumped into ballast tanks too quickly wilson p 40 submerged endurance was officially considered to be 10 hours but several boats were submerged for 16 hours during war propulsion b class submarines had a single 16 cylinder petrol engine that had a designed output of and drove a single propeller this engine was developed by vickers from wolseley engine used in a class submerged submarine used an electric motor powered by 159 battery cells at a working voltage of only 100 volts this originally lasted only three hours and 45 minutes at full speed but this time was continually increased over career of boats as more powerful batteries were fitted on surface petrol engine gave a top speed of while maximum speed submerged was this was about same speed surfaced as older submarines but b class boats were about slower underwater they carried a maximum of of petrol that provided a range of at a speed of akermann pp 120 123 armament b class boats were armed with a pair of 18 inch 457 mm torpedo tubes side by side in bow and angled slightly downwards space was provided for a pair of reloads but addition of extra equipment over years meant that they could only be carried if an equivalent weight of fuel was discarded wilson p 43 by start of world war i boats could carry 18 inch mark viii torpedo which had two speed and range settings at torpedo had a range of but a range of at it had a warhead that consisted of of tnt history each submarine was built by vickers at their barrow in furness shipyard b1 was originally ordered as a14 in 1903 04 naval programme but it was cancelled and reordered as first boat of new class remaining 10 boats were ordered as part of 1904 05 programme ship launched

1916 by aircraft later raised and sold 24 february 1906 11 july 1906 sold for scrap 1919 in mid 1912 most of b class submarines were transferred to mediterranean b6 b7 and b8 were sent to gibraltar while b9 b10 and b11 sailed for malta b1 b2 b3 b4 and b5 remained in united kingdom latter four assigned to 3rd submarine flotilla during exercises in october 1912 off dover with 6th and 7th torpedo boat flotillas was rammed amidships by german passenger liner ss amerika on 4 october 1912 cut nearly in half she sank almost immediately and only one man was rescued by submarine wilson pp 74 75 world war i home waters by beginning of world war i b3 b4 and b5 were at dover and were deployed on a line between calais and goodwin sands to protect passage of british expeditionary force to france each submarine would sail from dover before dawn to be secured at buoy marking their billet at dawn idea being that they would be able to slip from buoy when they spotted an enemy ship and manoeuvre to attack that this was not a good tactic was proved when b3 narrowly avoided a torpedo from a german u boat on morning of 2 october nonetheless scheme was successful and bef crossed to france without loss wilson pp 74 75 b1 remained at portsmouth for local defence and training duties through 1916 before being paid off b3 and b4 were transferred to ardrossan by end of 1915 to relieve two even more obsolescent a class boats on local defence duties in firth of clyde b3 was transferred to leith during mid 1916 where she was fitted with an experimental hull mounted directional hydrophone system and later sent to rosyth in 1917 where she was used as either a target to train anti submarine forces or experimental work for rest of war b4 was paid off before end of 1916 b5 moved to portsmouth during 1915 where she too was paid off before end of 1916 akermann p p 75 mediterranean waters left thumb a scale model of b11 in holbrook new south wales australia three malta based boats were sent to dardanelles in mid september 1914 to prevent a sortie by german battlecruiser and light cruiser into eastern mediterranean entrance to dardanelles was patrolled from dawn to dusk by these boats as well as four french submarines which arrived later neither british nor french submarines had enough battery power or underwater speed to combat south flowing currents in dardanelles to reach sea of marmara but b11 was selected for a sortie that would attempt to penetrate as far as town of chanak halfway up dardanelles because she had newest and thus most powerful batteries special guards were fitted over forward diving planes to make sure that any mooring wires of mines would not get entangled and dragged down to boat wilson pp 75 76 on 13 december 1914 b11 commanded by lieutenant norman douglas holbrook entered dardanelles in early morning shortly after departure one of guards broke and began banging against hull making a lot of noise and vibration lieutenant holbrook ordered boat to surface in an attempt to cut guard loose even though boat was in full view of turkish guns defending entrance they succeeded before dawn revealed their presence to turks and proceeded up dardanelles at a depth of to avoid turkish minefields two and a half hours later b11 came to periscope depth and holbrook spotted elderly turkish ironclad mesudiye he fired one torpedo that struck ship which settled by stern and then capsized before sinking mesudiye spotted b11 and fired on her periscope which revealed her position to shore batteries attempting to leave area b11 briefly grounded herself breaking surface but was able to get herself off b11s compass became fogged and prevented submarine from navigating at depth instead holbrook had to con boat at periscope depth which meant he had to go through minefields not below them nevertheless boat made it back safely holbrook was awarded victoria cross his first lieutenant distinguished service order and every enlisted man distinguished service medal wilson p 76 b6 and b8 arrived from gibraltar in mid february 1915 as did b7 a month later other more modern submarines followed and several attempts were made to reach sea of marmara british submarine ran aground in april during one of these attempts and had to be abandoned b6 was sent to destroy her with torpedoes to prevent turks from salvaging her one of torpedoes hit a barge alongside and other torpedo missed after running out of fuel it drifted down dardanelles and was recovered by destroyer which returned it to b6 b11 attempted again following day but was thwarted by fog wilson pp 76 77 b class boats were deemed redundant once more capable submarines arrived in early 1915 and most returned to malta b6 and b11 however were sent to alexandria where they conducted patrols along libyan coast to prevent arms deliveries to rebellious tribesmen during one incident on 16 august 1915 a party of arabs and officers in european uniforms were spotted displaying a flag of truce two submarines anchored and lieutenant holbrook was rowed ashore to talk to them they opened fire killing one man and wounding three including holbrook submarines were soon withdrawn from this task as they were totally unsuitable for this duty lacking any deck armament at all wilson p 77 adriatic waters in september 1915 after italian declaration of war on central powers transfer of b class boats to adriatic was suggested by admiralty originally they were to be based at brindisi but this was changed to venice as there were already 14 british and french submarines based at brindisi b4 b7 and b9 were first to arrive but b4 collided en route with italian tug escorting them and required immediate docking upon her arrival b9 made first patrol on 18 october and a total of 81 patrols were made by b class submarines before they ceased in october 1916 nothing of note was directly accomplished by submarines but they fulfilled ultimate goal of keeping austro hungarians from attacking italian coast wilson pp 77 78 b11 now commanded by lieutenant gravener encountered an austro hungarian seaplane on 11 november that had been forced down by engine trouble b11 attempted to engage seaplane with one maxim gun she had aboard but it jammed almost immediately and gravener attempted to ram aircraft austrians managed to restart their engine however and flew off easily avoiding gravener s ramming attempt on 17 january b11 encountered another seaplane with engine trouble this time austrians were unable to repair their engine and were captured b9 was spotted by an austrian seaplane on 29 march and eventually forced to dive after both sides failed to damage each other with machine gun fire b7 had a narrow escape off austrian naval base at pola three months later when she was damaged by another seaplane that jammed her diving planes in hard to rise position which meant she could not submerge until they were repaired both b8 and b11 were missed by torpedoes fired by austrian submarines in early 1916 on one patrol gear teeth of b11s steering mechanism were stripped which made rudder loose and boat relieving tackles were rigged despite heavy seas but they parted under strain after 15 minutes slowly boat began to drift towards enemy coast but a northwesterly breeze sprang up before dawn and seas moderated which allowed her to make about by going astern by this time she was overdue and italians began to search for her she was towed back to venice by an italian destroyer that found her about mid morning wilson pp 78 79 b10 became first submarine sunk by air attack when she was sunk on 9 august 1916 after a near miss during an austrian air raid bomb blew a hole about in diameter in her pressure hull she was re floated but a fire gutted her while she was under repair and she was sold for scrap wilson p 79 b class boats had reached limits of their usefulness and survivors were withdrawn to malta on 30 october where they were paid off pending a decision on their fate in august 1917 boats were converted at malta to surface patrol boats with a raised wheelhouse given a 12 pounder gun and renamed s6 to s9 and s11 they were assigned to patrol otranto barrage but their age and small size worked against them and they were soon paid off at malta where they were sold after war notes references external links b class subs on net b class submarine
