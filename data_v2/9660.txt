cyclone forrest also referred to as tropical storm forrest was a powerful tropical cyclone that prompted evacuation of 600 000 people in bangladesh in late november 1992 originating from an area of disturbed weather near caroline islands on november 9 forrest was classified as a tropical depression three days later over south china sea tracking generally west system steadily organized into a tropical storm passing vietnam to south before striking thailand along malay peninsula on november 15 once over bay of bengal forrest turned northward on november 17 and significantly intensified it reached its peak intensity on november 20 as a category 4 equivalent cyclone on saffir simpson hurricane scale with winds of 230 km h 145 mph hostile environmental conditions soon affected cyclone as it turned abruptly east northeastward forrest made landfall in northwestern myanmar as a weakening system on november 21 before dissipating early next day majority of deaths associated with forrest resulted from a plane crash on november 14 in vietnam which killed 30 of 31 occupants in thailand system produced significant storm surge damaged or destroyed 1 700 homes and killed two people agricultural losses in hardest hit areas were estimated at bh 800 million us 32 million on november 20 as forrest reached its peak intensity fears arose across bangladesh that a repeat of catastrophic april 1991 cyclone would take place as a result mass evacuation plans were enacted across coastal areas of country with plans to relocate up to 2 million people but storm abruptly turned eastward and successful evacuation of 600 000 residents spared countless lives only two deaths were recorded and overall damage was light though half of all homes on st martin s island were damaged meteorological history second of four notable tropical cyclones in western pacific in early november 1992 forrest was first identified as an area of disturbed weather over western caroline islands on november 9 moving generally west northwest convection associated with system steadily organized and joint typhoon warning center jtwc subsequently issued a tropical cyclone formation alert tcfa on november 10 development into a tropical depression was not anticipated until system cleared philippines however organization was slower than forecast and a second tcfa was issued late on november 11 once west of palawan island and over south china sea on november 12 convective structure rapidly consolidated disturbance was designated tropical depression at 12 00 utc when it was 940 km 585 mi east southeast of ho chi minh city vietnam japan meteorological agency jma followed suit six hours later moving toward west southwest system steadily organized later that day it attained gale force winds and was assigned name forrest by jtwc as storm approached vietnam it turned southwest and moved parallel to coast before resuming its westerly track forrest made its closest approach to nation on november 14 passing 110 km 70 mi south of ca mau province storm s proximity to land inhibited intensification and it attained winds of 100 km h 65 mph as it moved over gulf of thailand on november 14 next day storm made landfall in nakhon si thammarat province of thailand while crossing malay peninsula forrest lost most of its convection though its circulation remained well defined failing to reorganize system continued to weaken as it moved across andaman sea at 06 00 utc on november 16 india meteorological department imd began tracking system as depression bob 08 although agency quickly upgraded it to a deep depression and later a cyclonic storm two days later a subtropical ridge over southeast asia nudged forrest toward north and it regained organized convection early on november 18 storm attained hurricane force winds as favorable outflow and upper level winds aided intensification strengthening continued through early on november 20 at which time forrest reached its peak intensity with winds of 230 km h 145 mph a category 4 equivalent cyclone on saffir simpson hurricane scale imd assessed three minute sustained winds to have been 185 km h 115 mph making it a modern day extremely severe cyclonic storm and its barometric pressure was estimated at 952 mbar hpa 28 11 inhg forrest maintained its peak intensity for six hours before increasing wind shear disrupted it unexpectedly storm turned sharply northeast later on november 20 sparing most of bangladesh from a direct hit more dramatic weakening ensued on november 21 as forrest neared landfall with its eye becoming obscure cyclone made landfall along northern coast of rakhine state in myanmar between 06 00 and 12 00 utc with winds of 155 175 km h 100 110 mph imd estimated forrest to have been far weaker as it moved ashore reporting peak three minute winds to be 85 km h 50 mph at that time once onshore high terrain of northern myanmar further eroded cyclone s circulation forrest dissipated early on november 22 over magway region throughout storm s existence in bay of bengal it was monitored by ers 1 satellite it became first north indian ocean cyclone to be observed by scatterometer instruments providing data necessary to calibrate device for minimizing directional ambiguity of its measurements preparations and impact on november 14 vietnam airlines flight 474 leaving ho chi minh city vietnam heading to nha trang crashed after encountering rough conditions produced by tropical storm forrest after descending below a safe altitude on approach to nha trang yakovlev yak 40 aircraft deviated from runway and impacted trees at top of a ridge before crashing away of 6 crew and 25 passengers 31 occupants 30 were killed in accident only survivor was annette nine of passengers were foreigners four from taiwan two from netherlands and one each from france sweden and united kingdom search and rescue efforts were conducted with two helicopters two planes fitted with cameras and two warships over nearby waters it took rescuers eight days to find wreckage of plane across gulf of thailand all oil platforms were evacuated and no injuries were reported during storm s passage damage if any that took place in myanmar is unknown thailand thumb right 190px tropical storm forrest making landfall on thailand on november 15 prior to storm s arrival in thailand officials initially evacuated 3 000 people from coastal areas evacuations were soon increased to 20 000 following risk of greater damage tropical storm forrest struck nakhon si thammarat province of thailand on november 15 and was regarded as worst in region since tropical storm harriet in 1962 winds estimated up to and torrential rains battered areas along malay peninsula widespread blackouts were reported throughout affected areas across nakhon si thammarat province two people were killed and 1 700 homes were damaged hardest hit area was tha sala district where 1 000 homes were damaged or destroyed in pak district storm surge destroyed at least 100 homes and damaged 400 more at least of rubber plantations and of shrimp farms were damaged as well between two districts damage amounted to bh 800 million us 32 million offshore waves were estimated to have reached in height minister of interior traveled to affected areas on november 16 to oversee relief operations bangladesh on april 29 of previous year a catastrophic category 5 equivalent cyclone had struck bangladesh killing an estimated 140 000 people on november 20 1992 entire coast of bangladesh was placed on red alert highest level of cyclone warning and deputy director of bangladesh red crescent society harun ur rashid advised thorough and efficient evacuations amid forecasts that forrest s intensity at landfall would be greater than that of april 1991 cyclone officials and volunteers scrambled to warn residents in its path of impending danger an estimated 21 000 volunteers traveled to outlying islands and rural areas to urge residents to move to mainland for safety following 1991 cyclone red cross planned to construct 3 000 shelters across coastline however by this time only 44 had been completed of greatest concern was lack of shelters on where 30 000 were killed in earlier cyclone additionally 21 makeshift camps housing 265 000 muslim refugees from myanmar were in forecast path an emergency meeting was called by united nations high commissioner for refugees to discussion muslim refugee situation scramble to protect residents was noted by one foreign relief official as an attempt to not get caught with our pants down like last year plans were made to evacuate 2 million people along immediate coastline including 300 000 in cox s bazar district alone harun ur rashid stated if necessary volunteers have orders to use force to evacuate people residents were readily willing to leave their homes in district in stark contrast to complacency seen prior to 1991 cyclone some people traumatized by events of earlier storm left at slightest hint of calamity by late on november 20 approximately 500 000 people had been evacuated following a change in cyclone s course focus of evacuations shifted closer to bangladesh myanmar border relocations in this new area included 200 000 in chittagong 55 000 in 51 000 in and 40 000 on upazila an emergency cabinet meeting was convened by prime minister khaleda zia to discuss storm government officials were similarly placed on emergency alert despite day being a weekly holiday bangladesh television cancelled all entertainment programs and relayed announcements on cyclone non stop relief minister rahman khan also convened an unscheduled high level meeting concerning allocation of relief goods for eight districts overall 600 000 people evacuated inland or to one of 238 shelters during evacuations one person was killed in a stampede at a crowded shelter cyclone ultimately spared country a direct hit turning due east weakening and striking myanmar on november 21 meteorologists regarded storm s change of course and weakening as a miracle as large cyclones have historically caused tremendous loss of life and damage in bangladesh off st
