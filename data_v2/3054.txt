further went on to describe its production as skittering blaring keeping in with most prominent theme of beyonce drunk in love explores female sexuality its lyrics express unbridled lust and love making with a wholly committed lover as she sings about how much she likes sex with her partner beyonce uses several double entendres including line on that wood where she is supposedly referencing a

100 times better than that description allows for julia leconte from now praised singer s perfect growling vocals chris kelly of fact magazine dubbed song as requisite duet with jay z whose ike turner referencing verse caps off a year of cringeworthy efforts pitchfork media s carrie battan felt that lines in which beyonce ad libbed surfboard were some of most infectious snippets of pop music in 2013 elaborating single word serving as both shorthand for woman on top and a neat summation of an entire era of trends in rap cadence greg kot of chicago tribune described track as a frisky reverie likewise evan rytlewski of a v club wrote d angelo indebted grind session rocket and frisky drunk in love are similarly sexy but they re not sexy like a glamour shot or a steamy video they re sexy like an overeager pre shower quickie or a hushed morning make out session before baby wakes up these are most unapologetically raunchy songs she s ever sung and in many ways also most romantic philip matusavage of musicomh noted that though drunk in love does not have a chorus it absolutely manages to be thrilling further writing that it is packed with ideas and touches which listeners would understand after repeated listens anupa mistry of spin considered song to be one of beyonces elbows up boom trap anthems ready to soundtrack both dive bar antics and bottle service quasi sophistication philip cosores of paste highlighted that track was highly evocative but found its lyrics to be half baked at best ryan dennehy of absolutepunk wrote that unconditional love has to be

i m ike turner turn up baby no i don t play now eat cake anna mae i said eat cake anna mae which alludes to tina turner s abusive relationship with her former husband ike turner lyric specifically refers to a scene from tina turner s biopic in which ike forced tina to eat cake by pushing a piece of cake in her face that particular scene was fabricated but film is loosely based on tina turner s real life experience with a volatile husband rolling stones rob sheffield described reference as tasteless in his review of song and guardian writer tshepo mokoena called song s lyrics disturbing and
