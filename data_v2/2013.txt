command economy established under mao zedong was replaced by socialist market economy current economic system on basis that practice is sole criterion for truth since collapse of eastern european communist governments in 1989 1990 and dissolution of soviet union in 1991 cpc has emphasised its party to party relations with ruling parties of remaining socialist states while cpc still maintains party to party relations with non ruling communist parties around world since 1980s it has established relations with several non communist parties most notably with ruling parties of one party states whatever their ideology dominant parties in democracies whatever their ideology and social democratic parties history founding and early history 1921 1927 thumb site of first cpc congress in former shanghai french concession cpc has its origins in may fourth movement of 1919 during which radical western ideologies like marxism and anarchism gained traction among chinese intellectuals other influences stemming from bolshevik revolution and marxist theory inspired communist party of china li dazhao was first leading chinese intellectual who publicly supported leninism and world revolution in contrast to chen duxiu li did not renounce participation in affairs of republic of china both of them regarded october revolution in russia as groundbreaking believing it to herald a new era for oppressed countries everywhere cpc was modeled on vladimir lenin s theory of a vanguard party study circles were according to cai rudiments of our party several study circles were established during new culture movement but by 1920 skepticism about their suitability as vehicles for reform had become widespread founding national congress of cpc was held on 23 31 july 1921 with only 50 members in beginning of 1921 cpc organization and authorities grew tremendously while it was originally held in a house in shanghai french concession french police interrupted meeting on 30 july and congress was moved to a tourist boat on south lake in zhejiang province only 12 delegates attended congress with neither li nor chen being able to attend latter sending a personal representative in his stead resolutions of congress called for establishment of a communist party as a branch of communist international and elected chen as its leader communists dominated left wing of kmt a party organized on leninist lines struggling for power with party s right wing when kmt leader sun yat sen died in march 1925 he was succeeded by a rightist chiang kai shek who initiated moves to marginalize position of communists fresh from success of northern expedition to overthrow warlords chiang kai shek turned on communists who by now numbered in tens of thousands across china ignoring orders of wuhan based kmt government he marched on shanghai a city controlled by communist militias although communists welcomed chiang s arrival he turned on them massacring 5000 with aid of green gang chiang s army then marched on wuhan but was prevented from taking city by cpc general ye ting and his troops chiang s allies also attacked communists in beijing 19 leading communists were killed by zhang zuolin while in changsha he jian s forces machine gunned hundreds of peasant militiamen that may tens of thousands of communists and their sympathizers were killed by nationalists with cpc losing approximately of its members cpc continued supporting wuhan kmt government but on 15 july 1927 wuhan government expelled all communists from kmt cpc reacted by founding workers and peasants red army of china better known as red army to battle kmt a battalion led by general zhu de was ordered to take city of nanchang on 1 august 1927 in what became known as nanchang uprising initially successful they were forced into retreat after five days marching south to shantou and from there being driven into wilderness of fujian mao zedong was appointed commander in chief of red army and led four regiments against changsha in autumn harvest uprising hoping to spark peasant uprisings across hunan his plan was to attack kmt held city from three directions on 9 september but fourth regiment deserted to kmt cause attacking third regiment mao s army made it to changsha but could not take it by 15 september he accepted defeat with 1 000 survivors marching east to mountains of jiangxi chinese civil war and world war ii 1927 1949 thumb upright 0 8 flag of chinese workers and peasants red army near destruction of cpc s urban organizational apparatus led to institutional changes within party party adopted democratic centralism a way to organize revolutionary parties and established a politburo to function as standing committee of central committee result was increased centralization of power within party at every level of party this was duplicated with standing committees now in effective control after chen duxiu s dismissal li lisan was able to assume de facto control of party organization by 1929 30 li lisan s leadership was a failure leaving cpc on brink of destruction comintern became involved and by late 1930 his powers had been taken away by 1935 mao had become party s politburo standing committee member and informal leader with zhou enlai and zhang formal head of party serving as his informal deputies conflict with kmt led to reorganization of red army with power now centralized in leadership through creation of cpc political departments charged with supervising army second sino japanese war caused a pause in conflict between cpc and kmt second united front was established between cpc and kmt to tackle invasion while front formally existed until 1945 all collaboration between two parties had ended by 1940 despite their formal alliance cpc used opportunity to expand and carve out independent bases of operations to prepare for coming war with kmt in 1939 kmt began to restrict cpc expansion within china this led to frequent clashes between cpc and kmt forces but which subsided rapidly on realisation on both sides that civil war was not an option yet by 1943 cpc was again actively expanding its territory at expense of kmt thumb mao zedong declared establishment of people s republic of china on 1 october 1949 mao zedong became chairman of communist party of china in 1945 from 1945 until 1949 war had been reduced to two parties cpc and kmt this period lasted through four stages first was from august 1945 when japanese surrendered to june 1946 when peace talks between cpc and kmt ended by 1945 kmt had three times more soldiers under its command than cpc and initially appeared to be prevailing with cooperation of americans and japanese kmt was able to retake major parts of country however kmt rule over reconquered territories would prove unpopular because of endemic party corruption notwithstanding its huge numerical superiority kmt failed to reconquer rural territories which made up cpc s stronghold around same time cpc launched an invasion of manchuria where they were assisted by soviet union second stage lasting from july 1946 to june 1947 saw kmt extend its control over major cities such as yan an cpc headquarters for much of war kmt s successes were hollow cpc had tactically withdrawn from cities and instead attacked kmt authorities by instigating protests amongst students and intellectuals in cities kmt responded to these events with heavy handed repression in meantime kmt was struggling with factional infighting and chiang kai shek s autocratic control over party which weakened kmt s ability to respond to attacks third stage lasting from july 1947 to august 1948 saw a limited counteroffensive by cpc objective was clearing central china strengthening north china and recovering northeast china this policy coupled with desertions from kmt military force by spring of 1948 kmt military had lost an estimated 2 of its 3 million troops and declining popularity of kmt rule result was that cpc was able to cut off kmt garrisons in manchuria and retake several lost territories last stage lasting from september 1948 to december 1949 saw communists take initiative and collapse of kmt rule in mainland china as a whole on 1 october 1949 mao declared establishment of prc which signified end of chinese revolution as it is officially described by cpc single ruling party 1949 present thumb right flag of communist party of china from 17 june 1951 to 21 july 1996 on 1 october 1949 chairman mao zedong announced 21 september 1949 establishment of prc before a massive crowd at beijing square by end of year cpc became major ruling party in china party was called of china official standard name in wade giles transliteration prior to adoption of pinyin in 1958 ambassador in china hurley to secretary of state office of historian during 1960s and 1970s cpc experienced a significant ideological separation from communist party of soviet union by that time mao had begun saying that continued revolution under dictatorship of proletariat stipulated that class enemies continued to exist even though socialist revolution seemed to be complete leading to cultural revolution in which millions were persecuted and killed thumb upright 0 95 left chinese communists celebrate joseph stalin s birthday 1949 following mao s death in 1976 a power struggle between cpc chairman hua guofeng and vice chairman deng xiaoping erupted deng won struggle and became paramount leader in 1978 deng alongside hu yaobang and zhao ziyang spearheaded reform and opening policy and introduced ideological concept of socialism with chinese characteristics opening china to world s markets in reversing some of mao s leftist policies deng argued that a socialist state could use market economy without itself being capitalist while asserting political power of party change in policy generated significant economic growth new ideology however was contested on both sides of spectrum by maoists as well as by those supporting political liberalization with other social factors conflicts culminated in 1989 tiananmen square protests protests having been crushed deng s vision on economics prevailed and by early 1990s concept of a socialist market economy had been introduced in 1997 deng s beliefs deng xiaoping theory were embedded in cpc constitution cpc general secretary jiang zemin succeeded deng as paramount leader in 1990s and continued most of his policies as part of jiang zemin s nominal legacy cpc ratified three represents for 2003 revision of party s constitution as a guiding ideology to encourage party to represent advanced productive forces progressive course of china s culture and fundamental interests of people theory legitimized entry of private business owners and bourgeois elements into party hu jintao jiang zemin s successor as general secretary took office in 2002 unlike mao deng and jiang zemin hu laid emphasis on collective leadership and opposed one man dominance of political system insistence on focusing on economic growth led to a wide range of serious social problems to address these hu introduced two main ideological concepts scientific outlook on development and harmonious socialist society hu resigned from his post as cpc general secretary and chairman of cmc at 18th national congress held in 2012 and was succeeded in both posts by xi jinping since taking power xi has initiated most concerted anti corruption effort in decades while centralizing powers in office of cpc general secretary at expense of collective leadership because of that foreign commentators have likened him to mao governance collective leadership collective leadership idea that decisions will be taken through consensus is ideal in cpc concept has its origins back to vladimir lenin and russian bolshevik party at level of central party leadership this means that for instance all members of politburo standing committee are of equal standing each member having only one vote a member of politburo standing committee often represents a sector during mao s reign he controlled people s liberation army kang sheng security apparatus and zhou enlai state council and ministry of foreign affairs this counts as informal power despite this in a paradoxical relation members of a body are ranked hierarchically despite fact that members are in theory equal to each others informally collective leadership is headed by a leadership core that is paramount leader person who holds offices of cpc general secretary cmc chairman and president of prc before jiang zemin s tenure as paramount leader party core and collective leadership were indistinguishable in practice core was not responsible to collective leadership however by time of jiang party had begun propagating a responsibility system referring to it in official pronouncements as core of collective leadership democratic centralism cpc s organizational principle is democratic centralism which is based on two principles democracy synonymous in official discourse with socialist democracy and inner party democracy and centralism this has been guiding organizational principle of party since 5th national congress held in 1927 in words of party constitution party is an integral body organized under its program and constitution and on basis of democratic centralism mao once quipped that democratic centralism was at once democratic and centralized with two seeming opposites of democracy and centralization united in a definite form mao claimed that superiority of democratic centralism lay in its internal contradictions between democracy and centralism and freedom and discipline currently cpc is claiming that democracy is lifeline of party lifeline of socialism but for democracy to be implemented and functioning properly there needs to be centralization goal of democratic centralism was not to obliterate capitalism or its policies but instead it is movement towards regulating capitalism while involving socialism and democracy democracy in any form cpc claims needs centralism since without centralism there will be no order according to mao democratic centralism is centralized on basis of democracy and democratic under centralized guidance this is only system that can give full expression to democracy with full powers vested in people s congresses at all levels and at same time guarantee centralized administration with governments at each level exercising centralized management of all affairs entrusted to them by people s congresses at corresponding level and safeguarding whatever is essential to democratic life of people multi party cooperation system multi party cooperation and political consultation system is led by cpc in cooperation and consultation with eight parties which make up united front consultation takes place under leadership of cpc with mass organizations united front parties and representatives from all walks of life these consultations contribute at least in theory to formation of country s basic policy in fields of political economic cultural and social affairs cpc s relationship with other parties is based on principle of long term coexistence and mutual supervision treating each other with full sincerity and sharing weal or woe this process is institutionalized in chinese people s political consultative conference cppcc all parties in united front support china s road to socialism and hold steadfast to leadership of cpc despite all this cppcc is a body without any real power while discussions do take place they are all supervised by cpc

anniversary of communist party of china in 2011 according to article 53 of cpc constitution party emblem and flag are symbol and sign of communist party of china at beginning of its history cpc did not have a single official standard for flag but instead allowed individual party committees to copy flag of communist party of soviet union on 28 april 1942 central politburo decreed establishment of a sole official flag flag of cpc has length to width proportion of 3 2 with a hammer and sickle in upper left corner and with no five pointed star political bureau authorizes general office to custom make a number of standard flags and distribute them to all major organs according to people s daily standard party flag is 120 centimeters cm in length and 80 cm in width in center of upper left corner a quarter of length and width to border is a yellow hammer and sickle 30 cm in diameter flag sleeve pole hem is in white and 6 5 cm in width dimension of pole hem is not included in measure of flag red color symbolizes revolution hammer and sickle are tools of workers and peasants meaning that communist party of china represents interests of masses and people yellow color signifies brightness in total flag has five dimensions sizes are no 1 388 cm in length and 192 cm in width no 2 240 cm in length and 160 cm in width no 3 192 cm in length and 128 cm in width no 4 144 cm in length and 96 cm in width no 5 96 cm in length and 64 cm in width on 21 september 1966 cpc general office issued regulations on production and use of cpc flag and emblem which stated that emblem and flag were official symbols and signs of party ideology it has been argued in recent years mainly by foreign commentators that cpc does not have an ideology and that party organization is pragmatic and interested only in what works party itself however argues otherwise for instance hu jintao stated in 2012 that western world is threatening to divide us and that international culture of west is strong while we are weak ideological and cultural fields are our main targets cpc puts a great deal of effort into party schools and into crafting its ideological message before practice is sole criterion for truth campaign relationship between ideology and decision making was a deductive one meaning that policy making was derived from ideological knowledge under deng this relationship was turned upside down with decision making justifying ideology and not other way around lastly chinese policy makers believe that soviet union s state ideology was rigid unimaginative ossified and disconnected from reality and that this was one of reasons for dissolution of soviet union they therefore believe that their party ideology must be dynamic to safeguard party s rule formal ideology thumb left a monument dedicated to karl marx left and friedrich engels right in shanghai marxism leninism was first official ideology of communist party of china according to ccp marxism leninism reveals universal laws governing development of history of human society to ccp marxism leninism provides a vision of contradictions in capitalist society and of inevitability of a future socialist and communist societies according to people s daily mao zedong thought is marxism leninism applied and developed in china mao zedong thought was conceived not only by mao zedong but by leading party officials while non chinese analysts generally agree that ccp has rejected orthodox marxism leninism and mao zedong thought or at least basic thoughts within orthodox thinking ccp itself disagrees certain groups argue that jiang zemin ended ccp s formal commitment to marxism with introduction of ideological theory three represents however party theorist leng rong disagrees claiming that president jiang rid party of ideological obstacles to different kinds of ownership he did not give up marxism or socialism he strengthened party by providing a modern understanding of marxism and socialism which is why we talk about a socialist market economy with chinese characteristics attainment of true communism is still described as ccp s and china s ultimate goal while ccp claims that china is in primary stage of socialism party theorists argue that current development stage looks a lot like capitalism alternatively certain party theorists argue that capitalism is early or first stage of communism some have dismissed concept of a primary stage of socialism as intellectual cynicism according to robert lawrence kuhn a china analyst when i first heard this rationale i thought it more comic than clever a wry caricature of hack propagandists leaked by intellectual cynics but 100 year horizon comes from serious political theorists deng xiaoping theory was added to party constitution at 14th national congress concepts of socialism with chinese characteristics and primary stage of socialism were credited to theory deng xiaoping theory can be defined as a belief that state socialism and state planning is not by definition communist and that market mechanisms are class neutral in addition party needs to react to changing situation dynamically to know if a certain policy is obsolete or not party had to seek truth from facts and follow slogan practice is sole criterion for truth at 14th national congress jiang reiterated deng s mantra that it was unnecessary to ask if something was socialist or capitalist since important factor was whether it worked three represents jiang zemin s contribution to party s ideology was adopted by party at 16th national congress three represents defines role of chinese communist party and stresses that party must always represent requirements for developing china s advanced productive forces orientation of china s advanced culture and fundamental interests of overwhelming majority of chinese people selected works of jiang zemin eng ed beijing 2013 vol iii p 519 certain segments within ccp criticized three represents as being un marxist and a betrayal of basic marxist values supporters viewed it as a further development of socialism with chinese characteristics jiang disagreed and had concluded that attaining communist mode of production as formulated by earlier communists was more complex than had been realized and that it was useless to try to force a change in mode of production as it had to develop naturally by following economic laws of history theory is most notable for allowing capitalists officially referred to as new social strata to join party on grounds that they engaged in honest labor and work and through their labour contributed to build ing socialism with chinese characteristics 3rd plenary session of 16th central committee conceived and formulated ideology of scientific outlook on development sod it is considered to be hu jintao s contribution to official ideological discourse sod incorporates scientific socialism sustainable development social welfare a humanistic society increased democracy and ultimately creation of a socialist harmonious society according to official statements by cpc concept integrates marxism with reality of contemporary china and with underlying features of our times and it fully embodies marxist worldview on and methodology for development economics deng did not believe that fundamental difference between capitalist mode of production and socialist mode of production was central planning versus free markets he said a planned economy is not definition of socialism because there is planning under capitalism market economy happens under socialism too planning and market forces are both ways of controlling economic activity jiang zemin supported deng s thinking and stated in a party gathering that it did not matter if a certain mechanism was capitalist or socialist because only thing that mattered was whether it worked it was at this gathering that jiang zemin introduced term socialist market economy which replaced chen yun s planned socialist market economy in his report to 14th national congress jiang zemin told delegates that socialist state would let market forces play a basic role in resource allocation at 15th national congress party line was changed to make market forces further play their role in resource allocation this line continued until 3rd plenary session of 18th central committee when it was amended to let market forces play a decisive role in resource allocation despite this 3rd plenary session of 18th central committee upheld creed maintain dominance of public sector and strengthen economic vitality of state owned economy ccp views world as organized into two opposing camps socialist and capitalist they insist that socialism on basis of historical materialism will eventually triumph over capitalism in recent years when party has been asked to explain capitalist globalization occurring party has returned to writings of karl marx despite admitting that globalization developed through capitalist system party s leaders and theorists argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity globalization as with market economy therefore does not have one specific class character neither socialist nor capitalist according to party insistence that globalization is not fixed in nature comes from deng s insistence that china can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism because of this there is considerable optimism within ccp that despite current capitalist dominance of globalization globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism party to party relations communist parties cpc continues to have relations with non ruling communist and workers parties and attends international communist conferences most notably international meeting of communist and workers parties delegates of foreign communist parties still visit china in 2013 for instance general secretary of portuguese communist party pcp jeronimo de sousa personally met with liu a member of central politburo in another instance pierre laurent national secretary of french communist party fcp met with liu yunshan a politburo standing committee member in 2014 xi jinping cpc general secretary personally met with gennady zyuganov first secretary of communist party of russian federation cprf to discuss party to party relations while cpc retains contact with major parties such as pcp fcp cprf communist party of bohemia and moravia communist party of brazil communist party of nepal and communist party of spain party retains relations with minor communist and workers parties such as communist party of australia workers party of bangladesh communist party of bangladesh marxist leninist barua communist party of sri lanka workers party of belgium hungarian workers party dominican workers party and party for transformation of honduras for instance in recent years noting self reform of european social democratic movement in 1980s and 1990s cpc has noted increased marginalization of west european communist parties ruling parties of socialist states cpc has retained close relations with remaining socialist states still espousing communism cuba laos and vietnam and their respective ruling parties as well as north korea and its ruling party which officially abandoned communism in 2009 it spends a fair amount of time analyzing situation in remaining socialist states trying to reach conclusions as to why these states survived when so many did not following collapse of eastern european socialist states in 1989 and dissolution of soviet union in 1991 in general analyses of remaining socialist states and their chances of survival have been positive and cpc believes that socialist movement will be revitalized sometime in future ruling party which cpc is most interested in is communist party of vietnam cpv in general cpv is considered a model example of socialist development in post soviet era chinese analysts on vietnam believe that introduction of doi moi reform policy at 6th cpv national congress is key reason for vietnam s current success while cpc is probably organization with most access to north korea writing about north korea is tightly circumscribed few reports accessible to general public are those about north korean economic reforms while chinese analysts of north korea tend to speak positively of north korea in public in official discussions they show much disdain for north korea s economic system cult of personality which pervades society kim family idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state security state use of scarce resources on korean people s army and general impoverishment of north korean people there are those analysts who compare current situation of north korea with that of china during cultural revolution over years cpc has tried to persuade workers party of korea or wpk north korea s ruling party to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in china for instance in 2006 cpc invited wpk general secretary kim jong il to guandong province to showcase success economic reforms have brought china in general cpc considers wpk and north korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state there is a considerable degree of interest in cuba within cpc fidel castro former first secretary of communist party of cuba pcc is greatly admired and books have been written focusing on successes of cuban revolution communication between cpc and pcc has increased considerably since 1990s hardly a month going by without a diplomatic exchange at 4th plenary session of 16th central committee which discussed possibility of cpc learning from other ruling parties praise was heaped on pcc when wu a central politburo member met with fidel castro in 2007 he gave him a personal letter written by hu jintao facts have shown that china and cuba are trustworthy good friends good comrades and good brothers who treat each other with sincerity two countries friendship has withstood test of a changeable international situation and friendship has been further strengthened and consolidated non communist parties since decline and fall of communism in eastern europe cpc has begun establishing party to party relations with non communist parties these relations are sought so that cpc can learn from them for instance cpc has been eager to understand how people s action party of singapore pap maintains its total domination over singaporean politics through its low key presence but total control according to cpc s own analysis of singapore pap s dominance can be explained by its well developed social network which controls constituencies effectively by extending its tentacles deeply into society through branches of government and party controlled groups while cpc accepts that singapore is a liberal democracy they view it as a guided democracy led by pap other differences are according to cpc that it is not a political party based on working class instead it is a political party of elite it is also a political party of parliamentary system not a revolutionary party other parties which cpc studies and maintains strong party to party relations with are united malays national organisation which has ruled malaysia 1957 2018 and liberal democratic party in japan which dominated japanese politics since 1955 cpc has since jiang zemin s time made friendly overtures to its erstwhile foe kuomintang cpc emphasizes strong party to party relations with kmt so as to strengthen probability of reunification of taiwan with mainland china however several studies have been written on kmt s loss of power in 2000 after having ruled taiwan since 1949 kmt officially ruled mainland china from 1928 to 1949 in general one party states or dominant party states are of special interest to party and party to party relations are formed so that cpc can study them for instance longevity of syrian regional branch of arab socialist ba ath party is attributed to personalization of power in al assad family strong presidential system inheritance of power which passed from hafez al assad to his son bashar al assad and role given to syrian military in politics thumb xi jinping second from left with enrique pena nieto second from right former president of mexico and a leading member of social democratic institutional revolutionary party in recent years cpc has been especially interested in latin america as shown by increasing number of delegates sent to and received from these countries of special fascination for cpc is 71 year long rule of institutional revolutionary party pri in mexico while cpc attributed pri s long reign in power to strong presidential system tapping into machismo culture of country its nationalist posture its close identification with rural populace and implementation of nationalization alongside of economy cpc concluded that pri failed because of lack of inner party democracy its pursuit of social democracy its rigid party structures that could not be reformed its political corruption pressure of globalization and american interference in mexican politics while cpc was slow to recognize pink tide in latin america it has strengthened party to party relations with several socialist and anti american political parties over years cpc has occasionally expressed some irritation over hugo chavez s anti capitalist and anti american rhetoric despite this in 2013 cpc reached an agreement with united socialist party of venezuela psuv which was founded by chavez for cpc to educate psuv cadres in political and social fields by 2008 cpc claimed to have established relations with 99 political parties in 29 latin american countries social democratic movements in europe have been of great interest to cpc since early 1980s with exception of a short period in which cpc forged party to party relations with far right parties during 1970s in an effort to halt soviet expansionism cpc s relations with european social democratic parties were its first serious efforts to establish cordial party to party relations with non communist parties cpc credits european social democrats with creating a capitalism with a human face before 1980s cpc had a highly negative and dismissive view of social democracy a view dating back to second international and marxist leninist view on social democratic movement by 1980s that view had changed and cpc concluded that it could actually learn something from social democratic movement cpc delegates were sent all over europe to observe by 1980s most european social democratic parties were facing electoral decline and were in a period of self reform cpc followed this with great interest laying most weight on reform efforts within british labour party and social democratic party of germany cpc concluded that both parties were re elected because they modernized replacing traditional state socialist tenets with new ones supporting privatization shedding belief in big government conceiving a new view of welfare state changing their negative views of market and moving from their traditional support base of trade unions to entrepreneurs young
