adams river is a tributary to thompson and fraser rivers in british columbia canada beginning in monashee mountains to north upper adams river flows mainly southward and eventually reaches adams lake lower adams river begins at southern end of lake and flows into extreme western end of shuswap lake river is one of most important sockeye salmon breeding areas in north america run occurs in mid october and can bring millions of fish to a concentrated area near river mouth excavations of secwepemc villages on river have shown a long tradition of habitation and salmon fishing in area river also served as an important transportation route for early logging operations in watershed course thumb 300px drainage basin of adams river headwaters of adams are several unnamed glaciers at roughly elevation in north east region of monashee range of columbia mountains upper portion of river flows roughly south and southwest through wetlands and passes through two small lakes tumtum and mica it has sections of rapids and whitewater and flows over cataracts below tumtum lake its flow drops by per kilometre in certain sections after travelling for and entering shuswap highland it enters northern end of adams lake adams lake is roughly along its north south axis and reaches a maximum depth of making it 24th deepest lake in world lower adams issues from extreme southern end of lake and travels through a narrow valley it empties into shuswap lake near community of from adams lake to shuswap lower adams drops in elevation tributaries tributaries of upper adams include oliver creek dudgeon creek sunset creek fisher creek adams lake and lower adams are fed by cayenne creek creek river bear creek gold creek history secwepemc secwepemc people have lived in adams river valley for millennia a 1977 study by provincial government along lower river found sixty six sites with evidence of habitation dating to 2000 bce abundance of salmon run made river an important food source and trade commodity for first nations people in region ethnographer james records that people of adams river area formed a sub group of secwepemc called sxste lln now known as adams lake indian band sxste lln moved between summer and winter camps at outlet of lower river and little river area near chase river s namesake chief sel ken baptized as adam by oblate missionaries was a sxste lln leader in 1860s like more than 200 of his people he died in 1862 smallpox epidemic adams river lumber company thumb 300px bear creek flume c 1910 although prospectors surveyors and trappers had travelled region in 1800s first large scale activity in river valley by europeans was logging j p mcgoldrick an experienced lumberman from spokane established adams river lumber company in 1909 he licensed large tracts of timber along both upper and lower rivers as well as surrounding plateau mcgoldrick s company is described as first major industrial operation in british columbia interior a camp was built on upper river and logging operations began at tumtum lake cut logs were run down river then towed in booms by company owned sternwheeler helen down adams lake logs then were run down lower river to mill at chase in 1908 adams river logging constructed a splash dam at outlet of lower adams this dam allowed operators to raise water level of adams lake when sufficient logs had been collected above dam gates were opened and resulting flood carried logs to shuswap lake this proved to be destructive to salmon run as it damaged gravel beds fish use to spawn in order to move logs from plateau above lower river adams river lumber constructed several flumes flumes were elevated wooden troughs filled with water that floated logs down to valley bottom largest of these was at bear creek it incorporated trestles up to high and was capable of moving of logs per month it was largest flume in north america at its peak structures were dismantled after areas became logged out although logging continues in region adams is no longer used for log transport ecology thumb left logger falling a western red cedar on upper adams c 1910 flora much of ecology of watershed has been affected by wildfires and forestry and is considered to be in a seral phase river travels through several different vegetation zones in its upper reaches adams flows through interior cedar hemlock zone these forests are similar to coastal forests of british columbia and contain old growth trees up to 1000 years in age old growth stands along river also contain rare species of lichen likely isolated by last ice age floodplain of upper adams contains wetland species of deciduous trees such as black cottonwood as well as a dense layer of shrubs including black red osier dogwood and thimbleberry lower river is dominated by drier interior douglas fir vegetation zone other conifer species present are ponderosa pine engelmann spruce and alpine fir area around river mouth has been altered by human activities such as farming and livestock grazing fauna sockeye salmon adams river sockeye travel from their spawning grounds to south thompson river then into fraser river and enter pacific from strait of georgia they spend three years in open ocean following arctic currents to alaska and aleutian islands they then retrace their route to adams completing a round trip of over they complete arduous trip upstream including navigating swift waters and rapids of fraser canyon in just seventeen days they do not eat during this period instead they rely on fat reserves stored up from heavy feeding in strait of georgia in late summer it is at this point that salmon take on their distinctive red hue with male fish also developing large humped backs and aggressive hooked mouths how they are able navigate back to their natal river is not fully understood but a highly developed olfactory system is believed to play a part alluvial gravel deposits that form adams river bottom are ideal for development of salmon roe and temperature and neutral ph of water is also well suited to sockeye shuswap lake below river is called a nursery lake by biologists due to its high concentration of a food source for young salmon thumb 320px alt video of sockeye salmon sockeye spawn in a side channel of adams river dominant runs adams river run occurs every year but every fourth year called a dominant year numbers are much higher 2018 was most recent dominant run according to canada s department of fisheries and oceans fraser river sockeye run of 2010 was largest since 1913 numbering an estimated 34 million fish at least 3 866 000 of these fish returned to adams river to spawn there is no clear consensus as to why adams stock has rebounded so remarkably 1991 saw an estimated return of 718 fish in globe and mail simon fraser university biologist john reynolds said predicting salmon numbers is massively complex even for a scientist other fauna adams river valley supports large populations of mule deer with smaller herds of white tail deer black bears are common in watershed bear population grows substantially during fall as they gather from adjacent valleys to feed on spawning salmon in upper river valley moose are common and headwaters of river contain grizzly bear habitat several species of aquatic mammals are found on river including beaver mink and river otter river s mouth has populations of canada geese and swans other waterfowl include mallards green winged teal and goldeneye river supports bald eagle and osprey populations whose can be seen high up in black cottonwood and dead conifers grouse especially ruffed grouse are numerous throughout valley protected areas adams passes through 5 733 hectare upper adams river provincial park and 1 076 hectare tsutswecw provincial park which provides trails and platforms for salmon viewing human visitors to tsutswecw provincial park were estimated at 160 000 in 2010 conservation in watershed owes much to
