development studio galaxytrail games although it is an original intellectual property freedom planet was first developed as a sonic fangame it contained rings and doctor eggman was villain diduro decided that sonic affiliation would hold back game and attempted without success to design his own characters afterward he received permission from chinese artist ziyo ling whom he had found on art website deviantart to use her character sash lilac and later carol and milla in his game soundtrack was composed by diduro in collaboration with shane blue warrior ellis and user leila wilson early on diduro got encouraged to separate it further from sonic so he replaced rings with red leaves and altered characters abilities ziyo had drawn lilac as a hedgehog but diduro redesigned character to be a dragon lilac s wall bouncing was based on a similar game mechanic from originally her level of energy was to be dependent on her speed but this proved too difficult to control while freedom planet was developed in denmark and united states its art direction was influenced by medieval east asian art particularly that of china game s visuals reference modern science fiction and fantasy as well much of text in game world is written in chinese characters and title text is subtitled in japanese katakana as but game originally did not support japanese language freedom planet was first released as a

reacted positively about demo for freedom planet and commented that it was nice to see a well established style or formula applied to a new world with original characters similarly eurogamer s jeffrey matulef described game s preview as an indie sonic esque platformer done right and enjoyed redesigned health system dominic tarison of complimented game s new and unfamiliar configuration of elements from classic 16 bit games but criticised amount of viewable gameplay area john polson of indiegames com believed that spectacles like loops and wall runs are not as magical to do or watch as in sonic games but he encouraged platformer fans to download demo nathan grayson of kotaku praised demo for its balance of genesis sonic elements and original content he described product as a love letter to classic sonic except when it s not he praised game s enemies but experienced minor control issues pacing was remarked to be slower than that of genesis sonic games because of added combat sequences though grayson felt that this gave player time to explore and appreciate level design grayson was critical of voice acting ponce strongly praised visuals though criticized bland foreground design polson noted minor audio and visual flaws most notably recycling of sound effects from genesis sonic games but he lauded game s music tarison praised music and visuals as well as varied designs of environments and playable characters post release reviewing full version khan of hardcore gamer felt that it was a worthy successor to 1994 game sonic 3 knuckles which he considered series pinnacle and that it was perhaps most sonic game to have come out since 1994 one that feels like a true evolution and more importantly a resounding step forward jonatan allin of danish version of eurogamer who had not enjoyed any sonic games since genesis era concurred with khan polygon s griffin mcelroy argued that freedom planet successfully performs a difficult balancing act borrowing and transforming elements from games like sonic hedgehog and rocket knight adventures without coming off as derivative mcelroy and pablo taboada of spanish language website meristation both compared game to work of developer treasure taboada lamented game s obscurity and suggested that had treasure obtained rights to sonic and released freedom planet as an official sequel it would have been more popular khan commented that levels never feel like they re over too soon nor do they drag on unnecessarily and he appreciated setpiece moments such as explosive chase escape sequences maze like labyrinths traps and even shoot em up style shooting segments taboada was mixed on game s brevity he thought it was suitable for speedrunning but unsatisfying for those seeking a deeper experience by contrast japanese website 4gamer stated that game s quirks allowed one to play extensively without boredom and taboada enjoyed large metroidvania style levels regarding game s visuals taboada said es technically it is excellent he praised colorful and detailed backgrounds expressive character animations sound effects and music khan agreed he commented that every inch of it es artistic diversity with high resolution sprites that resemble quality of yesteryear he called audio a nice mix of catchy chiptune style melodies with infectious synthetic beats both khan and 4gamer were intrigued by game s east asian visual style taboada believed that each character was likeable and interesting to play allin found himself unexpectedly captivated by story which he guessed many players would miss due to impatience with cutscenes sequel on december 25 2015 galaxytrail announced freedom planet 2 was in development in contrast to original title it is being built using unity framework and has higher pixel art resolution than its predecessor with goal of ing freedom planets identity as a franchise all characters from game received a design overhaul by tyson tan while early concept artworks on game s official website
