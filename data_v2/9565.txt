critical reaction when episode originally aired in 1982 fred rothenberg of associated press called it an introduction to a new wise cracking comedy a warm and wacky companion of a television show a delightful place to spend idle time and a five star watering hole known as cheers television and radio critic mike drew said it was not great but funnier with cute lines than any other sitcom even those like archie bunker s place on tv and duffy s tavern on radio set in bars fred l smith of news and courier found this episode similar to taxi both are set in a place of business cheers at a boston bar taxi at a new york taxi company both have a sensible guy and a pretty preppy girl as main characters ted danson and shelley long in cheers and judd hirsch and henner in taxi and both are wacky comedies he found it amusing some jokes funny many others forced and number of weird characters in show greater than their real life bar counterparts in 2009 lex walker on just press play website found this episode sadder and more sentimental than funny episode focuses less on character development and more on diane restarting her life as a waitress after loss of love and he said it contradicts what cheers will grow to be nevertheless he called episode a true introduction to series and considered intertwining stories of sam and his friends series premise in 2010 robin raven from
