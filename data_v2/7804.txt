not let him listen to jazz and soul music on radio at his day job calling it nigger shit watt favored complex and abstract lyrical themes exemplified by songs such as glory of man and my heart and real world influenced by james joyce s novel ulysses subject of june 16th and stream of consciousness literary technique in general watt s lyrics were often complex and philosophical on take 5 d boon

say i don t get it what s so funny about that and we couldn t tell them because it was our whole angle on rock roll our worldview on music scene imagery album was named double nickels on dime as a
