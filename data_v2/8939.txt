many sidedness refers to jain doctrine about metaphysical truths that emerged in ancient india it states that ultimate truth and reality is complex and has multiple aspects anekantavada has also been interpreted to mean non absolutism intellectual ahimsa religious pluralism as well as a rejection of fanaticism that leads to terror attacks and mass violence some scholars state that modern revisionism has attempted to reinterpret anekantavada with religious tolerance and pluralism according to jainism no single specific statement can describe nature of existence and absolute truth this knowledge kevala jnana it adds is comprehended only by other beings and their statements about absolute truth are incomplete and at best a partial truth all knowledge claims according to anekantavada doctrine must be qualified in many ways including being affirmed and denied anekantavada is a fundamental doctrine of jainism origins of anekantavada can be traced back to teachings of mahavira 599 527 bce 24th jain dialectical concepts of syadvada conditioned viewpoints and nayavada partial viewpoints arose from anekantavada in medieval era providing jainism with more detailed logical structure and expression details of doctrine emerged in jainism in 1st millennium ce from debates between scholars of jain buddhist and hindu schools of philosophies etymology word anekantavada is a compound of two sanskrit words anekanta and vada word anekanta itself is composed of three root words an not eka one and anta end side together it connotes not one ended sided many sidedness or grimes john 1996 p 34 word vada means doctrine way speak thesis monier monier williams 1899 sanskrit english dictionary with etymology oxford university press pages 939 940 term anekantavada is translated by scholars as doctrine of many sidedness non or many pointedness term anekantavada is not found in early texts considered canonical by svetambara tradition of jainism however traces of doctrines are found in comments of mahavira in these svetambara texts where he states that finite and infinite depends on one s perspective word anekantavada was coined by acharya to significant teaching of mahavira that truth can be expressed in infinite ways earliest comprehensive teachings of anekantavada doctrine is found in tattvarthasutra by acharya and is considered to be authoritative by all jain sects in digambara tradition texts two truths theory of kundakunda also provides core of this doctrine philosophical overview in fact jain doctrine of anekantavada emerges to be a social attempt at equality and respect to all diverse views and ideologies through philosophical elucidation of truth or reality idea of reality gets enrichment in jainism as it proposes that reality cannot be one and ultimate it can have multi dimensional form so what is reality for one individual may not be reality for others brings forth a synthesis a happy blend and proposes that reality has many forms as seen by various individuals and all must respect reality perceived by one another this is way society can progress and this is way to resolve conflicts and to aim at peace in society jain doctrine of anekantavada also known as states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects reality can be experienced but it is not possible to totally express it with language human attempts to communicate is naya or partial expression of truth language is not truth but a means and attempt to express truth from truth according to mahavira language returns and not other way around one can experience truth of a taste but cannot fully express that taste through language any attempts to express experience is syat or valid in some respect but it still remains a perhaps just one perspective incomplete jain philosophy iep mark owen webb texas tech university in same way spiritual truths are complex they have multiple aspects language cannot express their plurality yet through effort and appropriate karma they can be experienced anekantavada premises of jains is ancient as evidenced by its mention in buddhist texts such as samannaphala sutta jain agamas suggest that mahavira s approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a qualified yes syat these texts identify anekantavada doctrine to be one of key differences between teachings of mahavira and those of buddha buddha taught middle way rejecting extremes of answer it is or it is not to metaphysical questions mahavira in contrast taught his followers to accept both it is and it is not with perhaps qualification and with reconciliation to understand absolute reality syadvada predication logic and nayavada perspective epistemology of jainism expand on concept of anekantavada syadvada recommends expression of anekanta by prefixing epithet syad to every phrase or expression describing nature of existence jain doctrine of anekantavada according to matilal states that no philosophic or metaphysical proposition can be true if it is asserted without any condition or limitation for a metaphysical proposition to be true according to jainism it must include one or more conditions syadvada or limitations nayavada standpoints syadvada syadvada is theory of conditioned predication first part of which is derived from sanskrit word syat which is third person singular of optative tense of sanskrit verb as to be and which becomes syad when followed by a vowel or a voiced consonant in accordance with sandhi optative tense in sanskrit formerly known as potential has same meaning as present tense of subjunctive mood in most indo european languages including hindi latin russian french etc it is used when there is uncertainty in a statement not it is but it may be one might etc subjunctive is very commonly used in hindi for example in kya what to say subjunctive is also commonly used in conditional constructions for example one of few english locutions in subjunctive which remains more or less current is were it 0 then 0 or more commonly if it were where were is in past tense of subjunctive syat can be translated into english as meaning perchance may be perhaps it is use of verb as in optative tense is found in more ancient vedic era literature in a similar sense for example sutra 1 4 96 of panini s explains it as signifying a chance maybe probable in jainism however syadvada and anekanta is not a theory of uncertainty doubt or relative probabilities rather it is conditional yes or conditional approval of any proposition state matilal and other scholars this usage has historic precedents in classical sanskrit literature and particularly in other ancient indian religions buddhism and hinduism with phrase syad etat meaning let it be so but or an answer that is neither yes nor no provisionally accepting an opponent s viewpoint for a certain premise this would be expressed in archaic english with subjunctive be it so a direct translation of syad etat traditionally this debate methodology was used by indian scholars to acknowledge opponent s viewpoint but disarm and bound its applicability to certain context and persuade opponent of aspects not considered according to charitrapragya in jain context syadvada does not mean a doctrine of doubt or skepticism rather it means multiplicity or multiple possibilities syat in jainism connotes something different from what term means in buddhism and hinduism in jainism it does not connote an answer that is neither yes nor no but it connotes a many sidedness to any proposition with a sevenfold predication syadvada is a theory of qualified predication states koller it states that all knowledge claims must be qualified in many ways because reality is many sided it is done so systematically in later jain texts through saptibhanginaya or theory of sevenfold scheme these saptibhangi seem to be have been first formulated in jainism by 5th or 6th century ce svetambara scholar and they are grimes john 1996 p 312 affirmation syad asti in some ways it is denial syan nasti in some ways it is not joint but successive affirmation and denial syad asti nasti in some ways it is and it is not joint and simultaneous affirmation and denial in some ways it is and it is indescribable joint and simultaneous affirmation and denial in some ways it is not and it is indescribable joint and simultaneous affirmation and denial in some ways it is it is not and it is indescribable joint and simultaneous affirmation and denial in some ways it is indescribable each of these seven predicates state jain viewpoint of a multifaceted reality from perspective of time space substance and mode phrase syat declares standpoint of expression affirmation with regard to own substance dravya place ksetra time kala and being bhava and negation with regard to other substance dravya place ksetra time kala and being bhava thus for a jar in regard to substance dravya earthen it simply is wooden it simply is not in regard to place ksetra room it simply is terrace it simply is not in regard to time kala summer it simply is winter it simply is not in regard to being bhava brown it simply is white it simply is not and word simply has been inserted for purpose of excluding a sense not approved by nuance for avoidance of a meaning not intended according to samantabhadra s text verse 105 syadvada doctrine of conditional predications and kevalajnana omniscience are both of substances of reality difference between two is that while kevalajnana illumines directly syadvada illumines indirectly syadvada is indispensable and helps establish truth according to samantabhadra nayavada nayavada is theory of standpoints or viewpoints nayavada is a compound of two sanskrit words naya standpoint viewpoint interpretation and vada doctrine thesis grimes john 1996 p 198 202 03 274 301 nayas are philosophical perspective about a particular topic and how to make proper conclusions about that topic according to jainism there are seven nayas or viewpoints through which one can make complete judgments about absolute reality using syadvada these seven naya according to umaswati are grimes john 1996 p 119 198 03 274 301 naya common sense or a universal view naya generic or class view that classifies it naya pragmatic or a particular view assesses its utility naya linear view considers it in present time naya verbal view that names it naya etymological view uses name and establishes it nature naya actuality view considers its concrete particulars naya theory emerged after about 5th century ce and underwent extensive development in jainism there are many variants of nayavada concept in later jain texts a particular viewpoint is called a naya or a partial viewpoint according to vijay jain nayavada does not deny attributes qualities modes and other aspects but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective a naya reveals only a part of totality and should not be mistaken for whole a synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by doctrine of conditional predications syadvada jiva changing soul thumb mahavira did not use word anekantavada but his teachings contain seeds of concept painting from rajasthan ca 1900 ancient india particularly centuries in which mahavira and buddha lived was a ground of intense intellectual debates especially on nature of reality and self or soul jain view of soul differs from those found in ancient buddhist and hindu texts and jain view about jiva and ajiva self matter utilizes anekantavada for a complete discussion of anekantavada on jain concept of jiva upanishadic thought hindu postulated impermanence of matter and body but existence of an unchanging eternal metaphysical reality of brahman and atman soul self buddhist thought also postulated impermanence but denied existence of any unchanging eternal soul or self and instead posited concept of anatta no self according to upanishadic conceptual scheme buddhists were wrong in denying permanence and absolutism and within buddhist conceptual scheme were wrong in denying reality of impermanence two positions were contradictory and mutually exclusive from each other s point of view koller john 2004 p 97 jains managed a synthesis of two uncompromising positions with anekantavada quote to counter proponents of these diametrically opposed positions buddhist and hindu jains developed a position knows as syadvada vah duh way or path of perhaps maybe or somehow syadvada states simply that judgments resting on different points of view may differ without any of them being wholly wrong a limited and incomplete judgment is called a naya nuh yuh and all human knowledge is a compilation of nayas judgments resulting from different attitudes jains were thus able to accept equally hindu views of being and buddhist views of becoming but took neither in sense that their partisan advocates desired or found comforting jain doctrine of syadvada is non absolutist and stands firmly against all even including any assertion that jainism is right religious path sharma arvind 2001 preface xii from perspective of a higher inclusive level made possible by ontology and epistemology of anekantavada and syadvada jains do not see such claims as contradictory or mutually exclusive instead they are seen as or only partially true tara 2004 p 97 jain breadth of vision embraces perspectives of both vedanta which according to jainism recognizes substances but not process and buddhism which recognizes process but not substance jainism on other hand pays equal attention to both substance dravya and process burch george 1964 pp 68 93 this philosophical syncretisation of paradox of change through anekanta has been acknowledged by modern scholars such as arvind sharma who wrote inclusivist or exclusivist some indian writers state that anekantavada is an inclusivist doctrine positing that jainism accepts non jain teachings as partial versions of truth a form of sectarian tolerance others scholars state this is incorrect and a reconstruction of jain history because jainism has consistently seen itself in exclusivist term as one true path classical jain scholars saw their premises and models of reality as superior than competing spiritual traditions of buddhism and hinduism both of which jainism considered inadequate for instance jain text sutra in section 23 63 calls competing indian thought to be heterodox and heretics and that they have chosen a wrong path right path is that taught by jinas similarly early jain scholar haribhadra who likely lived between 6th and 8th century states that those who do not follow teachings of jainism cannot be approved or accommodated john koller states anekantavada to be epistemological respect for view of others about nature of existence whether it is inherently enduring or constantly changing but not relativism it does not mean conceding that all arguments and all views are equal in contemporary times according to paul dundas anekantavada doctrine has been interpreted by some jains as intending to promote a universal religious tolerance and a teaching of plurality and benign attitude to other ethical religious positions this is problematic and a misreading of jain historical texts and mahavira s teachings states dundas many pointedness multiple perspective teachings of mahavira is a doctrine about nature of absolute reality and human existence and it is sometimes called non absolutism doctrine however it is not a doctrine about tolerating or condoning activities such as sacrificing or killing animals for food violence against disbelievers or any other living being as perhaps right five vows for jain monks and nuns for example are strict requirements and there is no perhaps just one perspective similarly since ancient times jainism co existed with buddhism and hinduism according to dundas but jainism was highly critical of knowledge systems and ideologies of its rivals and vice versa history and development principle of anekantavada is one of foundational jain philosophical concept development of anekantavada also encouraged development of dialectics of syadvada conditioned viewpoints and nayavada partial viewpoints according to karl potter jain anekantavada doctrine emerged in a milieu that included buddhists and hindus in ancient and medieval india diverse hindu schools such as nyaya vaisheshika samkhya yoga and mimamsa vedanta all accepted premise of atman that unchanging permanent soul self exists and is self evident while various schools of early buddhism denied it and substituted it with anatta no self no soul further for causation theories vedanta schools and madhyamika buddhists had similar ideas while nyaya vaisheshika and non madhyamika buddhists generally agreed on other side jainism using its anekantavada doctrine occupied center of this theological divide on soul self jiva and causation theories between various schools of buddhist and hindu thought origins origins of anekantavada are traceable in teachings of mahavira who used it effectively to show relativity of truth and reality taking a relativistic viewpoint mahavira is said to have explained nature of soul as both permanent from point of view of underlying substance and temporary from point of view of its modes and modification charitrapragya 2004 p 75 early history early jain texts were not composed in vedic or classical sanskrit but in prakrit language according to matilal earliest jain literature that present a developing form of a substantial anekantavada doctrine is found in sanskrit texts and after jaina scholars had adopted sanskrit to debate their ideas with buddhists and hindus of their era these texts show a synthetic development existence and borrowing of terminology ideas and concepts from rival schools of indian thought but with innovation and original thought that disagreed with their peers early svetambara canons and teachings do not use terms anekantavada and syadvada but contain teachings in rudimentary form without giving it proper structure or establishing it as a separate doctrine svetambara text sutrakritanga contains references to vibhagyavada which according to hermann jacobi is same as syadvada and saptibhangi jacobi hermann 1895 14 21 22 for example jacobi in his 1895 translation interpreted vibhagyavada as syadvada former mentioned in svetambara jain canonical text sutrakritanga however digambara jains dispute this text is canonical or even authentic jaina canon encyclopaedia britannica according to upadhyaye also called mentions three primary predications of saptibhanginaya upadhyaye a n 2001 pp 6136 37 this too is a svetambara text and considered by digambara jains as earliest comprehensive teachings of anekantavada doctrine is found in tattvarthasutra of considered to be authoritative by all jain sects including svetambara and digambara century in which umaswati lived is unclear but variously placed by contemporary scholars to sometime between 2nd and 5th century digambara scholar kundakunda in his mystical jain texts expounded on doctrine of syadvada and saptibhangi in and kundakunda also used nayas to discuss essence of self in kundakunda is believed in digambara tradition to have lived about 1st century ce but has been placed by early modern era scholars to 2nd or 3rd century ce in contrast earliest available secondary literature on kundakunda appears in about 10th century which has led recent scholarship to suggest that he may have lived in or after 8th century this radical reassessment in kundakunda chronology if accurate would place his comprehensive theories on anekantavada to late 1st millennium ce parable of blind men and elephant thumb seven blind men and an elephant parable jain texts explain anekantvada concept using parable of blind men and elephant in a manner similar to those found in both buddhist and hindu texts about limits of perception and importance of complete context parable has several indian variations but broadly goes as follows this parable is called andha gaja nyaya maxim in jain texts two of jain references to this parable are found in of vidyanandi 9th century and it appears twice in of acarya mallisena 13th century according to mallisena whenever anyone takes a partial unconditional view of ultimate reality and denies possibility of another aspect of that reality it is an instance of above parable and a defective view mallisena goes further in his second reference to above parable and states that all reality has infinite aspects and attributes all assertions can only be relatively true this does not mean scepticism or doubt is right path to knowledge according to mallisena and other jain scholars but that any philosophical assertion is only conditionally partially true any and all viewpoints states mallisena that do not admit an exception are false views while same parable is found in buddhist and hindu texts to emphasize need to be watchful for partial viewpoints of a complex reality jain text apply it to isolated topic and all subjects for example syadvada principle states that all following seven predicates must be accepted as true for a cooking pot according to matilal from a certain point of view or in a certain sense pot exists from a certain point of view pot does not exist from a certain point of view pot exists and does not exist from a certain point of view pot is inexpressible from a certain point of view pot both exists and is inexpressible from a certain point of view pot both does not exist and is inexpressible from a certain point of view pot exists does not exist and is also inexpressible medieval developments acarya haribhadra 8th century ce was one of leading proponents of anekantavada he wrote a a compendium of a variety of intellectual views this attempted to jain thoughts within broad framework rather than espouse narrow partisan views it interacted with many possible intellectual orientations available to indian thinkers around 8th century dundas paul 2002 p 228 acarya starts his famous 10th century ce work with strong praise for anekantavada i bow down to principle of anekanta source and foundation of highest scriptures of wrong one sided notions that which takes into account all aspects of truth reconciling diverse and even contradictory traits of all objects or entity jain j p 2006 verse no 2 acarya vidyanandi 11th century ce provides analogy of ocean to explain nature of truth in 116 t w rhys davids 1980 pp 576 a 17th century jain monk went beyond anekantavada by advocating meaning standing in middle or equidistance this position allowed him to praise qualities in others even though people were non jain and belonged to other faiths dundas paul 2004 p 134 there was a period of stagnation after as there were no new contributions to development of jain philosophy jain j c 2001 p 1487 influence jain philosophical concept of anekantavada made important contributions to ancient indian philosophy in areas of skepticism and relativity mcevilley thomas 2002 p 335 epistemology of anekantavada and syadvada also had a profound impact on development of ancient indian logic and philosophy while employing anekantavada 17th century jain scholar stated that it is not indiscriminate attachment to all views as being true which is effectively a kind of misconceived relativism dundas paul 2004 pp 131 132 in jain belief anekantavada transcends various traditions of buddhism and hinduism role in jain history anekantavada played a role in history of jainism in india during intellectual debates from buddhists muslims and christians at various times according to john koller professor of asian studies anekantavada allowed jain thinkers to maintain validity of their doctrine while at same time respectfully criticizing views of their opponents in other cases it was a tool used by jaina scholars to confront and dispute buddhist scholars in ancient india or in case of haribhadra justify retaliation of killing of his two nephews by buddhist monks with capital punishment for all buddhist monks in suspected monastery according to buddhist version of haribhadra s biography there is historical evidence that along with intolerance of non jains jains in their history have also been tolerant and generous just like buddhists and hindus their texts have never presented a theory for holy war jains and their temples have historically procured and preserved classic manuscripts of buddhism and hinduism a strong indicator of acceptance and plurality combination of historic facts states cort suggest that jain history is a combination or tolerance and intolerance of non jain views and that it is inappropriate to rewrite jainism past as a history of benevolence and tolerance towards others mohandas karamchand gandhi mahatma gandhi mentioned anekantavada and syadvada in journal young india 21 jan 1926 according to jeffery d long a scholar of hindu and jain studies jain syadvada doctrine helped gandhi explain how he reconciled his commitment to reality of both personal and impersonal aspects of brahman and his view of hindu religious pluralism thumb left upright 0 8 gandhi used jain concept of anekantavada to explain his views against religious intolerance and contemporary terrorism referring to september 11 attacks john koller states that threat to life from religious violence in modern society mainly exists due to faulty epistemology and metaphysics as well as faulty ethics a failure to respect life of other human beings and other life forms states koller is rooted in dogmatic but mistaken knowledge claims that fail to recognize other legitimate perspectives koller states that anekantavada is a jain doctrine that each side commit to accepting truths of multiple perspectives dialogue and negotiations koller john 2004 pp 85 98 according to sabine scholz application of anekantavada as a religious basis for intellectual ahimsa is a modern era reinterpretation one attributed to writings of a b dhruva in 1933 this view states that anekantavada is an expression of religious tolerance of other opinions and harmony in 21st century some writers have presented it as an intellectual weapon against intolerance fundamentalism and terrorism other scholars such as john e cort and paul dundas state that while jainism indeed teaches non violence as highest ethical value reinterpretation of anekantavada as religious tolerance of other opinions is a misreading of original doctrine in jain history it was a metaphysical doctrine and a philosophical method to formulate its distinct ascetic practice of liberation jain history shows to contrary that it persistently was harshly critical and intolerant of buddhist and hindu spiritual theories beliefs and ideologies john cort states that anekantavada doctrine in pre 20th century jain literature had no relation to religious tolerance or intellectual ahimsa jain intellectual and social history toward non jains according to cort has been contrary to modern revisionist attempts particularly by diaspora jains to present jains having exhibited a spirit of understanding and tolerance toward non jains or that jains were rare or unique in practicing religious tolerance in indian intellectual history according to states cort indiscriminate open mindedness and approach of accepting all religious paths as equally correct when in fact they are not is an erroneous view in jainism and not supported by anekantavada doctrine according to paul dundas in and after 12th century persecution and violence against jains by muslim state caused jain scholars to revisit their theory of ahimsa non violence for example suri in 12th century wrote during a time of widespread destruction of jain temples and blocking of jaina pilgrimage by muslim armies that anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody in self defense would not lose any merit n l jain quoting acarya states anekantavada doctrine is not a principle that can be applied to all situations or fields in his view doctrine has its limits and anekantavada doctrine does not mean intellectual tolerance or acceptance of religious violence terrorism taking of hostages proxy wars such as in kashmir and that to initiate a conflict is as sinful as to tolerate or not oppose it reinterpretation of anekantavada as a doctrine of religious tolerance is novel popular but not unusual for contemporary jains it is a pattern of reinterpretation and reinvention to rebrand and reposition that is found in many religions states scholz comparison with non jain doctrines according to bhagchandra jain one of difference between buddhist and jain views is that jainism accepts all statements to possess some relative truth while for buddhism this is not case bhagchandra jain rudiments of anekantavada in early pali literature in jainism states jayatilleke no proposition could in theory be asserted to be categorically true or false irrespective of standpoint from which it was made in buddhism such categorical assertions were considered possible in case of some propositions jayatilleke early buddhist theory of knowledge publisher george allen and unwin 1963 pp 279 280 unlike jainism there are propositions that are categorically true in buddhism and there are others that are uncertain indefinite examples of categorically true and certain doctrines are four noble truths while examples of latter in buddhism are theses further unlike jainism buddhism does not have a nayavada doctrine jayatilleke early buddhist theory of knowledge publisher george allen and unwin 1963 p 280 according to karl potter and other scholars hinduism developed various theory of relations such as satkaryavada asatkaryavada and others anekantavada overlaps with two major theories found in hindu and buddhist thought according to james lochtefeld anekantavada doctrine is satkaryavada in explaining causes and asatkaryavada in explaining qualities or attributes in effects different schools of hindu philosophy further elaborated and refined theory of and theory of relations to establish correct means to structure propositions in their view criticism indologists such as professor john e cort state that anekantavada is a doctrine that was historically used by jain scholars not to accept other viewpoints but to insist on jain viewpoint jain monks used anekantavada and syadvada as debating weapons to silence their critics and defend jain doctrine according to paul dundas in jain hands this method of analysis became a fearsome weapon of philosophical polemic with which doctrines of hinduism and buddhism could be pared down to their ideological bases of simple permanence and impermanence respectively and thus could be shown to be one pointed and inadequate as overall interpretations of reality they purported to be dundas paul 2002 p 231 jain scholars however considered their own theory of anekantavada self evident immune from criticism needing neither limitations nor conditions doctrines of anekantavada and are often criticised to denying any certainty or accepting incoherent contradictory doctrines another argument against it posited by medieval era buddhists and hindus applied principle on itself that is if nothing is definitely true or false is anekantavada true or false pandya v 2001 p 5210 according to karl potter anekantavada doctrine accepts norm in indian philosophies that all knowledge is contextual that object and subject are interdependent however as a theory of relations it does not solve deficiencies in other progress philosophies just compounds felony by merely duplicating already troublesome notion of a dependence relation hindu philosophies nyaya nyaya school criticized jain doctrine of anekantavada states karl potter as wanting to say one thing at one time other at another thereby ignoring principle of non contradiction states that it makes no sense to simultaneously say jiva and ajiva are not related and jiva and ajiva are related jains state that jiva attaches itself to karmic particles ajiva which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying bound ajiva to jiva yet jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent according to nyaya scholars jain theory of anekantavada makes its theory of karma asceticism and salvation incoherent according to nyaya texts vaisheshika vaisheshika and shaivism school scholar vyomashiva criticized anekantavada doctrine because according to him it makes all moral life and spiritual pursuits for moksha meaningless any spiritually liberated person must be considered under anekantavada doctrine to be a both liberated and not liberated from one point of view and b simply not liberated from another point of view since all assertions are to be qualified and conditional under it in other words states vyomashiva this doctrine leads to a paradox and circularity vedanta anekantavada was analyzed and critiqued by adi 800 ce in his bhasya on 2 2 33 36 nakamura hajime 1992 pp 169 70 he stated that anekantavada doctrine when applied to philosophy suffers from two problems contradictions and dubiety neither of which it is able to reconcile with objectivity shankara s criticism of anekantavada extended beyond arguments of it being incoherent epistemology in ontological matters according to shankara goal of philosophy is to identify one s doubts and remove them through reason and understanding not get more confused problem with anekantavada doctrine is that it compounds and glorifies confusion further states shankara jains use this doctrine to be certain that everything is uncertain according to karl potter shankara does not take jains seriously and admits that he doesn t understand jainism s theory of relations contemporary scholars states piotr balcerowicz concur that jain doctrine of anekantavada does reject some versions of law of non contradiction but it is incorrect to state that it rejects this law in all instances quote this is sense in which it is correct to say that jainas reject law of non contradiction buddhist philosophy buddhist scholar santaraksita and his student criticized anekantavada by presenting his arguments that it leads to buddhist premise jivas souls do not exist that is two of most important doctrines of jainism are mutually contradictory premises according to santaraksita jains state that jiva is one considered collectively and many considered but if so debates santaraksita jiva cannot change he then proceeds to show that changing jiva necessarily means jiva appear and disappear every moment which is equivalent to jiva don t exist according to karl potter argument posited by santaraksita is flawed because it commits what is called in western logic as fallacy of division buddhist logician critiqued anekantavada as follows self criticism in jain scholarship medieval era jain logicians akalanka and vidyananda who were likely contemporaries of adi shankara acknowledged many issues with anekantavada in their texts for example akalanka in his acknowledges seven problems when anekantavada is applied to develop a comprehensive and consistent philosophy dubiety contradiction lack of conformity of bases joint fault infinite regress and absence vidyananda acknowledged six of those in akalanka list adding problem of cross breeding in ideas and incomprehensibility who probably lived in 11th century and several other later jain scholars accepted many of these identified issues in anekantavada application see also references citations
