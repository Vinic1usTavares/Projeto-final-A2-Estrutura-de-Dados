perennial but with a very low base flow of about 2 million to 3 million cubic meters per month during summer months and as much as 5 million to 8 million cubic meters per month during rainy winter months this makes it second largest tributary of lower jordan river after yarmouk river and third largest river in region by annual discharge irregular floods after rain storms may increase flow to as much as 54 million cubic meters median annual flow is 63 3 million cubic meters total basin area is largest in jordan gis hydrological models for managing water resources in zarqa river basin n al abed f abdulla and a abu environmental geology volume 47 number 3 february 2005 a small dam al dam near village of dayr alla marks end of upstream portion of river where it is natural and fast flowing with very clear water there is very little agriculture along banks of river in this region which are very rocky downstream from this dam water level is very low and river banks are intensively used for agriculture as well as grazing by sheep and of an initial field survey for otters lutra lutra in jordon king talal dam was built across lower zarqa in 1970 and created a reservoir with a capacity of 55 million cubic meters and increased in 1987 to 86 million cubic meters when built it was expected that reservoir would supply water for municipal use in amman region however current levels of pollution in lake make water unfit for human consumption and it is used for irrigation only ramsar sites information service bridges new jerash bridge crosses zarqa upstream of king talal reservoir on road from amman to jerash bridge is site of a gauging station where flow measurements are continuously taken in city of zarqa several bridges vehicular and pedestrian cross river earliest of these was built by chechen founders of city current bridges include bridge a vehicular bridge connecting baha al din street with al zuhur street and another connecting baha al din street with king talal street two pedestrian bridges connect al zuhur street and baha al din street and wasfi al tal street and petra street natural history geological origins of zarqa river are about 30 million years old when jordan rift valley was formed a ripple effect of its formation was creation of side wadis zarqa river carved into western edge of one of these side wadis zarqa river eco development earliest exposed formations in area date from triassic and early jurassic periods and have been named zerqa and formations rock formations are marine sediments remnants of prehistoric tethys sea which used to cover area running roughly east west halfway across present dead sea along zarqa crystalline limestone alternating with shale was found next layer is a 20 30 meter high layer of gypsum argillaceous marly lime shales and iron rich stone and sandstone this layer is rich in fossils tribes and territories in transition flora archaeological finds of remains indicate that poplar and tamarix used to grow along banks of zarqa with forests of wild oak growing on hillsides today tamarix thickets are still widespread in floodplains and banks are cultivated with fruit orchards and vegetable fields along course of zarqa river water is pumped directly and used to irrigate crops of leafy vegetables such as parsley spinach cabbage cauliflower and lettuce as well as potatoes olive trees are also found along river s banks reclamation s history of jordan river basin in jordan a focus on agriculture past trends actual farming systems and future prospective tulips grow on many hillsides of river while in springs area and watercourse water vegetation is found royal society for conservation of nature jordan natural pine forests grow in king talal dam area along upstream banks where river runs wild one finds common reed oleander and typha species since waters of zarqa are highly contaminated with high levels of organic matter and various chemical compounds especially detergents and dyes use of zarqa water for irrigation has significantly altered biodiversity of natural flora and caused disappearance of majority of fresh water species water scarcity in relation to food security and sustainable use of biodiversity in jordan fauna in prehistoric times area was rich with fauna and 45 distinct animal species have been identified half of them wild animals domesticated goats were most common and gazelles were most frequently occurring wild animal species today area is still home to a diverse population of birds and mammals and some of breeding species found do not breed anywhere else in jordan observations on avifauna of eastern jordan valley during july and august of 2005 among bird species found are european roller desert lark dead sea sparrow desert finch and blue cheeked bee eater king talal dam has created a lake which is a habitat for migratory waterfowl and various fish species notable birds found in lake area include little bittern cattle egrets grey herons white storks common teal and eurasian coot lake s waters sustain fish some of which are indigenous species and some are introduced species most common are tilapia migratory birds also winter in man made pools which make up al samra sewage treatment plant located in a broad depression close to wadi main tributary of zarqa river as many as 6 000 white storks have been spotted roosting there mammals found in area include common otter lutra lutra and persian squirrel sciurus otter is considered a threatened species history zarqa valley was an important passageway connecting eastern desert with

earliest finds date to 7200 bce ain ghazal is one of earliest known human settlements with evidence of domesticated animals with a population of around 3 000 at its height it was also one of largest prehistoric population centers in near east with about five time population of neighboring jericho iron age during a 1982 survey of zarqa valley a number of early iron age sites were discovered

zarqa zarqa jordan s second largest city is built on banks of zarqa river and is largest settlement along its course town of zarqa was founded in 1902 by chechen immigrants chechens amjad m p 231 routledge 2005 its population grew rapidly with an influx of palestinian refugees who fled west bank during six day war environmental concerns zarqa river is highly polluted in many areas raw sewage flows untreated directly into river through dry riverbeds wadis contaminating it and creating a stench which has been a cause of numerous complaints particularly during summer months though sewage treatment stations have been built in a couple of locations including ain ghazal and khirbet as samra these stations often receive more water than they can handle such overflow occurs during winter floods as well as during summer months when population increases with return of migrant workers to amman during overflow untreated water runs directly to zarqa river as a result zarqa s water is brownish colored often with dense foam due to large amounts of organic matter other sources of pollutants are illegal dumping of industrial waste including those from textile factories and batteries and oils from garages river s watershed encompasses most densely populated areas east of jordan river and it flows through an industrialized area that is home to more than 52 of jordan s industrial plants including jordan petroleum refinery company during summer months treated domestic and industrial waste water compose nearly all of flow and substantially degrade water quality coupled with over extraction of water from underground aquifer and naturally low base flow of zarqa this has created a major problem described as one of jordan s environmental black spots and has made rehabilitation of zarqa a top priority for jordanian ministry of environment restoration project is estimated to cost 30 million see also arnon river yarmouk river notes references external links category rivers of
