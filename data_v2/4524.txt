had idea for south of nowhere when one of his close conservative friends told lynch that his son had just come out to him man asked his son how do you know you re gay and son responded how do you know you re straight when lynch heard this he says he knew there was a series in there about identity he wondered why such a noteworthy event an adolescent s coming out to their parents had never before been explored as an ongoing subject on a television series he sat with idea for a few days and then wrote an outline of show s pilot over a few weeks in an effort to maintain authenticity in depicting teenage experiences lynch spoke to high school counselors and asked drama students at a los angeles high school for feedback he pitched series which he was then calling out to n executives amy friedman and essie chambers who then commissioned him to write pilot script gabrielle christian first auditioned for role of spencer then called zooey in july 2004 though lynch also had her read for ashley s part mandy musgrave also auditioned for role of spencer but lynch liked her chemistry with christian so he paired two up with musgrave as ashley pilot was first shot in october 2004 and

i had to make sure that this combination was perfect her contract was finally picked up in may 2005 and pilot was re filmed with new cast in july filming took place in los angeles with a correctional facility used largely as high school set donna deitch who directed second version of pilot but no subsequent south of nowhere episodes said that pilot is something i m really really proud of because i think that show has a look a style to it that really helps she felt that style she set suited material and was fairly inventive for a low budget series promotion before airing of pilot n joined with marketing agency mr youth llc to promote show amongst teenagers in manhattan on thursday november 3 and friday november 4 2005 street teams with chest mounted televisions as well as branded were dispersed around lower manhattan they visited various high schools and offered south of nowhere branded metrocards to teenagers who were traveling south on n subway line reception most reviews of secret truths were positive particularly praising its treatment of social issues maureen ryan wrote for chicago tribune that lack of either or condescension shown by this program is promising she also commended that pilot doesn t shy away from issues pertaining to race religion and sexuality kate of new york times compared pilot positively to other series writing if you took plot of beverly hills 90210 a good looking midwestern family moves to los angeles combined it with identity issues of degrassi race sexuality and class clash in a high school setting and added a splash of one tree hills basketball backdrop you would get south of nowhere that s meant to be a compliment alessandra stanley another critic for new york times mentioned secret truths in a feature about racial issues on television she felt that pilot distinguished itself from other teen shows by including a subplot about race however she still found it to be constrained and politically correct varietys brian lowry gave episode a lukewarm review comparing it to other teen dramas he wrote that web of relationships doesn t feel particularly fresh mirroring recent spate of nighttime teen serials but he felt pilot was an edgier treatment noting that it isn t screwing around by addressing topics including abortion drugs homosexuality and racism karman of afterellen com a website focused on portrayal of lesbians in media thought that episode was well written and storyline for each of lead characters is compelling she praised show greatly for its authentic portrayal of teenagers questioning of their sexuality and big step taken towards promoting tolerance other critics responded to episode less positively joanna weiss of boston globe was more critical feeling that show takes pains to introduce as many hot button issues as possible to give illusion of authenticity she found characters to be predictable and to only serve as plot vehicles seattle times kay mcfadden also found a main problem of show in characters believing that pilot was more focused on plot development than it was on character development she felt that show was slightly hypocritical in trying to educate viewers on moral values but at same time emphasising its own sexual aspects setting a weird standard for young viewers references external links category 2005 american television episodes category american television pilots
