meteorological history monsoon spawned a low pressure area on july 25 over extreme northern bay of bengal and along southern coast of bangladesh with low wind shear and abundant convection south of a developing circulation system quickly organized at 03 00 utc on july 26 india meteorological department imd classified system as a depression while circulation was nearly stationary near southern coast of bangladesh land interaction and an unfavorable phase of madden julian oscillation prevented further strengthening despite warm water temperatures of early on july 27 american based joint typhoon warning center jtwc began monitoring depression after convection organized further amplified by good outflow still embedded within monsoon depression remained nearly stationary for two days over southern bangladesh jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert late on july 28 due to increasingly defined circulation on july 28 system began moving more to south and southeast although its movement was very slow possibly affected by another monsoon depression over western india imd described track as unique taking a semi circular path over northeast bay of bengal at 00 00 utc on next

tropospheric trough to northeast imparted dry air but otherwise conditions were generally favorable a ridge over myanmar turned system to north on july 29 during that day circulation was somewhat elongated and exposed from convection while thunderstorms in southern periphery organized into spiral rainbands at 18 00 utc on july 29 imd upgraded system to cyclonic storm komen one of only four storms of such intensity in july since 1965 typically low pressure areas that form in month are in extreme northern periphery of bay of bengal allowing little time to develop over waters and usually impeded by wind shear late on july 29 jtwc estimated that komen attained peak 1 minute sustained winds of 75 km h 45 mph based on estimates from satellite imagery as storm approached bangladesh circulation remained very broad with most of convection in southern periphery although radar imagery from coast indicated there was a formative eye feature in storm s center at 06 00 utc on july 30
