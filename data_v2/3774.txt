was ultimately unsuccessful gaining only 45 of vote he was eventually successful at next election in 1930 defeating mutch and would hold botany until its abolition in 1950 while his support for lang had enabled heffron to accelerate his political career he found himself increasingly unhappy with lang s autocratic and divisive political style which had been amplified by great depression expulsion of nsw branch of labor party from federal branch and ultimate dismissal of lang s government in 1932 by governor sir philip game after labor s defeats at hands of united australia party uap at 1932 and 1935 state elections heffron became associated with a small group in caucus and in nsw labor council who aimed to depose lang as leader williams robert james heffron p 318 however while heffron s movement was based on his personal stronghold in his botany maroubra alp branches and left wing trade unions lang maintained majority control of caucus party machine and party newspaper labor daily industrial labor party when labor council secretary robert king organised a conference of dissident left wing unions on 1 august 1936 which was attended by heffron and three other caucus members lang summoned a special party conference on 22 august which expelled heffron king and all other leaders who attended conference as a result heffron along with his colleague carlo lazzarini and others formed industrial labor party ilp which was also known as heffron labor party despite their expulsion heffron and new ilp did increasingly well against lang and labor party winning two subsequent by elections in seats of hurstville won by clive evatt and waverley won by clarrie martin in june 1939 three other mps frank burke newtown mat davidson cobar and ted sturt unhappy with lang s leadership

services charged with implementation of national emergency services act and administration of national emergency services new south wales in this role he was responsible for civil defence and air raid precautions of new south wales which became increasingly more important after entry of japan in second world war in december 1941 and subsequent attacks on australia on darwin and sydney in 1942 serving until 8 june 1944 heffron advocated public vigilance whilst in this portfolio declaring we are living in a fool s paradise in australia many people have idea that what is happening in other countries cannot happen here heffron also clashed with federal government s imposition of national emergency services procedures most notably over imposition of for city of sydney in legislative assembly in november 1942 heffron denounced advisers of federal government who continued to maintain brown out as an essential defence measure only conclusion i can come to is that brown out was born of a form of panic when japan entered war and it has continued because of a few brass hats will not look at facts and evidence of fighting men but persist in sticking to their first conclusion position therefore is ludicrous heffron later affirmed that brown out was completely unnecessary as a black out with short notice given was a more effective and safer defensive measure minister for education appointed by mckell as minister for education in june 1944 heffron authored in 1946 a comprehensive policy for new south wales education system entitled tomorrow is theirs present and future of education in new south wales as minister during important post war era of economic growth and infrastructure development heffron presided over expansion in number and facilities of public schools

appointed harold wyndham as director general of education and commissioned him to chair a committee tasked to completely review secondary education system in new south wales and make recommendations for improvements committee s report popularly referred to as wyndham report was presented to heffron in october 1957 and gave rise to public education act of 1961 being brought into effect in 1962 during heffron s term as premier key amongst changes was objective of presenting all students with opportunity to experience a wide range of subjects including visual arts industrial arts music and drama and a wide range of languages five year secondary school system was abandoned in favour of adding another year to course with major statewide external examinations at end of tenth school certificate and twelfth higher school certificate years of schooling heffron s reformist attitude in education also extended to tertiary level in which he intended to significantly expand nsw s capacity for higher level learning on 9 july 1946 he presented a proposal to cabinet outlining creation of a technological based university in nsw as a separate institution to existing sydney technical college and a year later cabinet authorised appointment of a developmental council chaired by heffron to bring new tertiary institution into existence first meeting in august 1947 council established all guidelines and regulations that would set up future institution and by march 1948 46 students had already enrolled to study this institution now named new south wales university of technology gained its statutory status through enactment of new south wales university of technology act 1949 which was carried by heffron s firm support of its cause government is fully alive to need in a democratic country to extend facilities to students who for financial reasons cannot attend present full time university courses this was first time that a second university was to be established in any australian state with establishment of this institution receiving opposition by some areas in media and conservatives heffron came to its defence in an article published in sydney morning herald on 4 may 1949 noting i feel that this new institution should be given time to prove its worth through quality and work of its graduates in september 1958 heffron moved bill to change name of new south wales university of technology to university of new south wales following recommendations of murray report that had proposed expansion of its focus from technology into such fields as medicine and arts when several opposition mps objected during debate on basis of it posing a threat to status of university of sydney with one joking that it could be called heffron university heffron came to defence of university and dismissed objections as absurd in 1950 heffron s seat of botany was abolished and largely replaced by maroubra which he was subsequently elected to and would hold until his retirement in 1968 thumb right 290px heffron centre beneath mantlepiece at new south wales university of technology council s first meeting in july 1949 meanwhile heffron who supported a general policy of tertiary education across state directed his department to begin establishment of various teachers colleges in new south wales to provide sufficient tertiary training to expanding numbers of teachers filling new schools and colleges across state among them was newcastle teachers college established in 1949 and opened in 1950 which facilitated growing calls from city of newcastle for a more permanent university in city in may 1951 heffron indicated his support for establishment of a satellite college of sydney university in newcastle as an initial step towards establishment of a full university by july heffron sought to approach sydney university officials to facilitate efforts to have a university established in newcastle as soon as possible and noted that his moves to purchase land in city as site of this college was an indication of government s intentions i didn t buy that site in newcastle just for fun i want to provide a university in newcastle and i want that to be only first step in providing universities all over state however by time heffron opened newcastle university college nuc on 3 december 1951 no affiliation had been finalised by may 1952 a university establishment group had gained much momentum but heffron had been notified by premier joseph cahill that there were insufficient funds available for establishment of another full university nevertheless in early 1954 this college had become a college of new south wales university of technology as premier in late 1961 heffron moved with his minister for education ernest wetherell that newcastle university college would become a full university come what may this was achieved when on 12 march 1962 university of technology vice chancellor philip baxter notified nuc warden professor james that it would be allowed to take on full autonomy to become university of newcastle from 1 january 1965 in 1951 heffron also played a role in establishment of university of new england une when he discussed with university of sydney on its thoughts about training and certifying schoolteachers by external studies and or correspondence courses university rejected idea stating that external degree or certification programs would be significantly inferior to residence education undeterred heffron asked new england about its willingness to conduct external studies warden of new england university college and later first vice chancellor of une robert madgwick enthusiastically supported idea and instructed his college s staff to begin preparing an external studies program heffron asked university of sydney if it had any objection to new england being granted independence to operate state s external education program university replied that it had no objection jordan a spirit of true learning pp 69 70 as a result heffron introduced university of new england act to parliament in early december 1953 it received assent on 16 december 1953 and college became independent university of new england on 1 february 1954 jordan a spirit of true learning pp 74 75 deputy premier and leadership throughout his period in cabinet heffron was seen as a prominent and well performing member of government and as such a potential contender for premiership first opportunity for heffron came in february 1946 when mckell announced to labor caucus of his intention to resign before 1947 election mckell with intention of ensuring heffron as his successor remained as an mp even after prime minister joseph chifley had announced his appointment as governor general in order to vote for heffron at ballot on 5 february 1947 heffron lost by two votes to minister for housing james mcgirr who was favoured by more catholic and conservative caucus members when mcgirr announced his resignation on grounds of ill health on 1 april 1952 heffron put himself forward as a candidate to succeed him against among others deputy premier joseph cahill however day before ballot on 3 april heffron had been made aware that he would not have numbers in caucus to win against cahill and consequently made arrangements with cahill to give votes of his bloc to cahill in exchange for his support to become deputy premier as a result on 3 april cahill defeated attorney general clarrie martin 32 votes to 14 to become premier and heffron defeated mines secretary joshua arthur 32 votes to 14 to become deputy premier when heffron s former opponent arthur resigned from ministry on 23 february 1953 when a royal commission was set up to investigate his involvement in corrupt business activity heffron was commissioned to replace him as secretary for mines serving from february to september 1953 as deputy premier heffron acted in cahill s absence and in times of infirmity which included receiving japanese prime minister kishi on his arrival at sydney airport on 31 october 1957 first visit of a prime minister of japan to australia heffron s role as deputy became of prime importance when cahill died suddenly in october 1959 and 68 year old heffron was elected to succeed him unopposed premier of new south wales heffron became premier being sworn in with his cabinet on 23 october 1959 at government house sydney by governor sir eric woodward however his time as premier was marked by significant tensions within labor party in nsw and nationally where although a split involving democratic labor party had been avoided during cahill s term sectarian and factional undercurrent in party was very much present in what was increasingly perceived as a tired and divided government indeed 68 year old heffron s government consisted mostly of mps and ministers who had come in with mckell after 1941 election in parliament heffron tended to reflect this by leaving most of speaking roles to his deputy jack renshaw and local government and highways minister pat hills it was clear to many that aged heffron s best days as a politician were behind him as future labor political advisor richard hall noted in bulletin in house he tends to ramble on recalling past glories as minister for education or minister for emergency services in answer to questions in an age where cliches cloak most politicians heffron throws them out as though they were devastating retorts although occasionally old radical has shown his teeth flashed into anger and for a few minutes reminded us that this was great mob orator who led many bitter strikes hall in clune et al decision and deliberation p 373 his old nemesis jack lang also took opportunity to take a last swipe at him ridiculing heffron in his newspaper century as mr magoo on 14 october 1960 heffron presided over official opening of dam completion of which meant that it became primary reservoir and first reliable water supply for whole sydney catchment at opening heffron declared we have come along way from tank stream sydney s first water supply thumb 180px right heffron s nomination of h v evatt as chief justice of new south wales in 1960 proved highly controversial evatt as chief justice in january 1960 heffron provided his old friend h v evatt a dignified exit from federal politics by nominating him to succeed sir kenneth street as chief justice of new south wales his attorney general reg downing however was horrified having favoured senior puisne justice sir william owen as most suitable candidate while also realising that evatt s worsening health would render him less than equal to task of chief justice williams robert james heffron p 325 therefore while downing as attorney general would normally be person to move nomination of chief justice in cabinet he refused to do so leaving heffron to do it himself heffron s motion to nominate evatt was passed narrowly by 8 votes to 6 downing s concerns would come to pass as evatt indeed proved highly ineffective often wracked by mental and physical ill health was reduced to having most of his judgements written or co written for him and resigning in 1962 after only two years as chief justice legislative council abolition thumb 180px left heffron in 1960 upon his elevation as premier heffron following an approved motion from 1958 state conference reanimated longstanding labor policy to abolish legislative council of new south wales by announcing a statewide referendum on this question heffron had long supported this policy from his days seeing council as an outdated bastion of conservative privilege a position that was echoed by trade union official and member of legislative council tom dougherty who had pushed through a rule at 1952 state conference that banned mlcs from becoming members of state party executive williams robert james heffron p 323 however heffron s efforts found themselves up against significant opposition not only from liberal and country parties but also within labor party itself indeed when constitution amendment legislative council abolition bill came before legislative council on 2 december 1959 council resolved 33 votes to 25 to send it back to legislative assembly on grounds that such a bill should have originated in council this was passed with support of seven labor councillors crossing floor including cyril cahill anne press and donald cochrane who were all subsequently expelled from party and formed independent labor group on 6 april 1960 heffron attempted to send bill back to council which returned it to assembly on same grounds as before as a result of deadlock heffron requested governor to order a joint session of parliament on 20 april a session which lasted two hours and was boycotted by opposition on 12 may assembly resolved that bill be submitted for a referendum however later that day leader of opposition in legislative council hector clayton started legal action against government on grounds that under section 5b of nsw constitution council had neither voted nor deliberated on bill and thus bill could not be submitted for a referendum in case of clayton v heffron 1960 a majority of full bench of supreme court of new south wales headed by chief justice evatt found in favour of government four to one on grounds that they had complied fully with intention of section 5b clayton v attorney general for new south wales 20 september 1960 supreme court full court nsw in a subsequent case for special leave to appeal to high court clayton argued that section 15 of commonwealth constitution which dealt with process by which state parliaments filled senate vacancies entrenched requirement for such parliaments to be bicameral on account of its exclusive mention of both houses this was rejected by court that affirmed that mention did not exclude right of state parliaments to do as they saw fit regarding abolition or reform in january 1961 heffron announced date of referendum for 29 april 1961 and affirmed that it would be a simple yes no question and would not include alternative proposals such as retaining upper house on an elective basis clune et al decision and deliberation p 410 however despite lack of time allocated for a campaign liberal country opposition led by robert askin and charles cutler despite rallying around a moderate slogan of retain and reform spearheaded a strong campaign centered on warnings of a labor dominated single house subject to communist and trades hall influence askin promised to fight abolition from one end of state to other while cutler also promised an all out campaign alongside liberals clune et al decision and deliberation p 411 by contrast heffron and labor s campaign was described as extremely tame and lacklustre having been weakened against fact that any criticism of legislative council also included its labor members with some labor backbench mlas terming council union officials club as a result referendum on 29 april was categorically rejected with 802 512 votes 42 4 for abolition and 1 089 193 votes 57 5 against this would be last attempt to abolish council and as first time nsw labor party had lost a state poll in many years was widely seen as beginning of end for labor government which had been in power since 1941 heffron s supporter dougherty resigned from council a month later in protest of result second term thumb 220px right sydney newcastle freeway at heffron made its construction as a toll road a priority for his government with work beginning on first stage in april 1963 at 1962 election heffron despite damage to prestige represented by failed referendum put forward new policies including establishment of a department of industrial development to reduce unemployment free school travel aid to home buyers and commencing construction of sydney newcastle freeway as a toll road at election labor party increased its margin by 5 seats leaving a comfortable majority in new parliament although its success was attributed to unpopularity at time of sir robert menzies federal liberal government following 1961 credit squeeze williams robert james heffron p 326 another one of heffron s election promises namely a royal commission into legalisation of off course betting caused considerable tension with his own cabinet his attorney general reg downing favoured its legalisation through a government supervised agency board tab while his chief secretary gus kelly favoured legalising activities of existing sp bookmakers downing however went over heffron s head and procured an alp state executive order requiring establishment of a tab when final report of commission was handed down on 29 march 1963 echoing position of downing heffron was obliged to carry out establishment of tab another issue arose when cardinal norman gilroy presented heffron in september 1962 with a plan for state aid to catholic church schools including assistance for teacher salaries and capital grants for buildings an issue that was highly explosive in sectarian politics of new south wales at time heffron alive to need for a limited form of state support to placate sectarian conflict that could destroy government permitted treasurer jack renshaw to include state support for school laboratories and a means tested allowance to school students in 1963 budget williams robert james heffron p 327 heffron later dropped school laboratory provision but his permitting of means tested allowance provoked condemnation from federal party executive in adelaide on 30 september 1962 who were less interested in placating traditional catholic hierarchy and more informed by bitterness of earlier alp dlp split in party in 1955 heffron and renshaw backed down on this last provision leaving no state aid for catholic schools and affirming dominance of federal party in such matters heffron humiliated and tired after several decades in ministerial office resigned as premier six months later on 30 april 1964 at age of 73 his announcement came as a surprise to many members of his own party although there had been existing hints in previous months that labor caucus had been discussing a departure plan for heffron to be replaced by deputy premier renshaw heffron insisted that he had made decision to himself a year prior declaring it was purely my own decision so i cannot complain about anyone throwing me out or advising me to get out sometimes we are advised to get out there are hints but we don t take any notice when they come from outside but it is not same of course as coming from your own party renshaw succeeded him as premier having been embarrassed when addressed as excellency on an overseas trip as minister for education in 1954 heffron was nevertheless granted by queen elizabeth ii retention of title honourable on 24 june 1964 for having served for more than three years as a member of executive council of new south wales later life thumb 200px right portrait of heffron by henry hanke 1956 oil on canvas unsw art collection after resigning as premier heffron remained in parliament as
