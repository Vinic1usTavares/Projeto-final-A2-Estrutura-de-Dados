illustrator randolph caldecott margaret lane author of magic years of beatrix potter notes mr potter was fond of taking his friends fishing and beatrix from an early age had been familiar with hazards and excitements of angling and dry fly fishing as a girl she had often enough had to endure her father and his friends relating their fishing adventures and picture of mr jeremy fisher retailing his mishap to sir isaac newton is so rich in observation both of amphibians and elderly gentlemen that one is ever afterwards prone to confuse them in memory lane 1978 pp 149 152 mr potter not only fished for sport but collected works of randolph caldecott lear 2007 p 47 in jeremy fisher potter tried to copy caldecott but felt she had failed i did try to copy caldecott she stated but i did not achieve much resemblance taylor 1987 p 129 biographer linda lear writes potter declared i have greatest admiration for his work a jealous appreciation for i think that others whose names are commonly bracketed with his are not on same plane at all as artist illustrators potter biographer linda lear and author of beatrix potter a life in nature writes potter wanted to do a frog story for some time because it was amusing and offered opportunity for naturalist illustrations she delighted in story of a fisherman down on his luck reminded beatrix of fish stories her father s friends had told in scotland as well as her brother s travails with rod and reel she also recreated gentlemen s club atmosphere absorbed from her father s reports of evenings spent at reform and athenaeum text and illustrations for this story are some of most balanced and compatible of all her writing nature is described and illustrated truthfully beautifully tranquil as well as unpredictably aggressive its carefully coloured botanical backgrounds of water plants a frog with anatomically correct turned out feet a trout that any self respecting fisherman would enjoy snagging and a rather frighteningly rendered water beetle who tweaks jeremy s dainty toes all made it a delight to look at as well as to read lear 2007 pp 212 3 production thumb upright alt a river winds through countryside river tay 2004 origin of tale of mr jeremy fisher lies in a story letter potter wrote to a child in september 1893 while on river tay lear 2007 pp 211 2 following year she created nine sketches called a frog he

taylor 1987 pp 126 1996 pp 80 1 tale was set aside while potter and warne developed other projects but in 1905 he approved frog tale as potter biographer daphne writes of potter s illustrations for jeremy when she finally did illustrations for book she changed original background from river tay in scotland to water in lakes illustrations are indeed lovely showing potter s skill both as a naturalist and a fantasist kutzer 2003 p 117 in august 1905 norman warne died and his brother harold became potter s editor she wrote to him indicating norman had approved frog project we had thought of doing mr jeremy fisher to carry on series of little books i know some people don t like frogs but i think i had convinced norman that i could make it a really pretty book with a good many flowers

152 themes and style thumb left mr jeremy fisher fishing m daphne kutzer professor of english at state university of new york at plattsburgh and author of beatrix potter writing in code observes that social positions of jeremy and his friends are established through clothing they wear although potter sharply critiqued upper class elsewhere kutzer observes that in jeremy fisher her tone is more moderate she suggests that potter s relocation to sawrey and hill top farm may have produced in her a willingness to accept silliness of aspiring middle class as well as eccentricities of upper classes kutzer 2003 p 121 ruth k macdonald professor of english at new mexico state university and author of beatrix potter points out that although potter regarded lives of her father and his friends as comical and even beneath notice yet she clearly respected and valued their outdoor pursuits from bemused treatment she accorded them in jeremy fisher she valued nature untouched by humans even more macdonald notes as evidenced by careful observation in illustrations jeremy fisher was written without many revisions typical of potter s other productions and pictures appear effortless in their execution macdonald writes her ability to show human society without also implying its damaging effects on flora and fauna further underscores book s felicitous composition and success macdonald 1986 p 98 literary scholar humphrey carpenter writes in secret gardens golden age of children s literature basis for potter s writing style can be found in authorized king james version of bible jeremy fisher reflects characteristic cadence and employs a psalm like caesura in middle of a sentence carpenter p 143 carpenter sees in potter s work thematic shifts from early work onward in first stage of her work he sees in stories such as tale of peter rabbit a type of jack giant killer theme in which a small creature confronts a large creature that he believes culminates in tale of jeremy fisher potter places jeremy fisher in a dangerous world according to carpenter fishing experience is frightening bank side creatures worry him stickleback threatens him directly and trout tries to swallow him but potter makes point that all creatures are prey ending story with jeremy fisher himself eating a grasshopper smothered in lady bird sauce carpenter 145 147 miniature letters about 1907 potter created miniature letters delivered to child fans in either a miniature mail bag or a miniature mail box some of letters were very funny potter wrote defect was that inquiries and answers were all

my maroon tail coat i had hopes but i am alone if there were a mrs jeremy fisher she might object to snails it is some satisfaction to be able to have as much water mud in house as a person likes mrs
