instantly and take an early lead pair experienced considerable trouble in early part of race car did not restart during gregory s first pit stop later engine failed partially and gregory brought car into pits on only six of twelve cylinders at this point rindt had already changed back into his civilian clothes expecting their race to be over after thirty minutes of repairs car restarted and rindt and gregory agreed to drive rest of event flat out at full speed and with accompanying risk rindt drove most of night advancing from 18th to third position by dawn gregory persuaded rindt to let him

handing pair what ickx called an unexpected victory later that year rindt drove again in a ferrari 250lm at 500 kilometre race at zeltweg he was able to win ahead of better powered ferrari of mike

s overalls for 1966 season for cooper introduced t81 chassis and used nine year old maserati v12 engines which were powerful but heavy a new engine formula was introduced for season with capacity

from ferrari at second race of year belgian grand prix rindt overcame an engine failure in practice to qualify second next to surtees on front row of grid in a race affected by heavy rain he overtook surtees for lead on lap four he spun several times on wet track and suffered from a limited slip differential but held onto lead until lap 21 when surtees repassed him and won it was rindt s first ever podium finish in formula one after what motor sport magazine called a very courageous drive overall he achieved three podium positions handing him third place in championship at end of year was less successful as rindt only finished two races belgian and italian grands prix both in fourth place six points meant that he ended season in 13th place in championship prior to rindt received offers from every team except lotus and honda and moved to brabham who had been world champions in two previous seasons technical problems restricted him that year brabham s repco v8 engine was not competitive against now widely used cosworth dfv and rindt finished just two races both in third place at season opener in south africa on new year s day rindt placed third being elevated by a late retirement from jackie stewart and closing on second placed graham hill towards end race was won by jim clark a close friend of rindt s it was clark s final formula one race he died three months later

heavy rain and fog at nurburgring at german grand prix a race dominated by stewart who finished four minutes ahead of hill in second place rindt had closed on hill in latter stages of race after englishman spun and finished just four seconds behind after a close battle during last lap his eight points placed him twelfth in championship at end of season during these years he also raced in indianapolis 500 in both 1967 and 1968 but finished only 24th and 32nd completing only five laps in 1968 after finishing slightly more than half of 1967 race in an interview in 2014 heinz pruller

conversing in pit lane in front of a brick wall for 1969 season rindt signed for 1968 world constructors champion lotus where he joined defending drivers champion graham hill rindt felt uncomfortable with move owing to notorious unreliability of lotus car in a twenty month period between 1967 and 1969 team was involved in 31 accidents hill alone had nine crashes between 1968 and 1970 which led him to joke every time i am being overtaken by my own wheel i know i am in a lotus when rindt joined lotus his friend and de facto manager bernie ecclestone who had negotiated deal remarked that they were aware that brabham may have been a better choice of team but speed of lotus gave rindt a chance to win championship rindt commented at lotus i can either be world champion or die because of his uncertainty about wisdom of joining team rindt did not sign lotus contract until shortly before 1969 spanish grand prix thumb left rindt at 1969 german grand prix alt side view color photograph of rindt racing a red and white lotus formula one car with a wing attached at rear rindt s hesitancy appeared justified when both he and hill suffered high speed crashes at spanish grand prix at montjuic in both instances suspension mounted wings on cars broke off causing accidents that could have killed either driver effect of failure lifted rindt s car off track and into barriers where it collided with stationary car of hill whose accident occurred at same spot although rindt only suffered a broken nose one marshal lost an eye and another had his foot broken rindt was furious with lotus s team owner colin chapman over failure he told a reporter after accident i place blame on him chapman and rightfully so because he should have calculated that wing would break in an interview on austrian television a day later he said these wings are insanity ein in my eyes and should not be allowed on racing cars but to get any wisdom into colin chapman s head is impossible asked whether he had lost trust in lotus after accident he replied i never had any trust in lotus going on to describe his relationship with team as purely business his accident left him sidelined for monaco grand prix a race that hill won jackie stewart later described rindt s 1969 season as year that he came of age at end of year motor sport magazine called him t he only driver to challenge stewart seriously throughout season albeit placing only fourth in championship poor reliability of lotus 49b affected him he retired from seven races at british grand prix rindt fought a close battle with stewart for lead both men were 90 seconds ahead of third placed jacky ickx race was decided in stewart s favour only when rindt had to enter pits after part of his car s bodywork started to rub on tyre he finished fourth at italian grand prix he was involved in a memorable finish having started from pole position he traded lead with stewart and piers courage several times during last lap rindt stewart mclaren and jean pierre were running close together as they approached finish line stewart took win only eight hundredths of a second ahead of rindt while fourth placed mclaren was also within two tenths of a second it was closest 1 2 3 4 finish in history of sport rindt recorded his maiden grand prix win at penultimate race of season at watkins glen winning 50 000 largest monetary prize in formula one history at time his victory was overshadowed by a serious accident involving his teammate hill who crashed after a high speed puncture and suffered major leg injuries 1970 season for rindt s partner at lotus was john miles graham hill had left team to drive for rob walker s customer franchise rindt became clear team leader at first grand prix of season in south africa he qualified fourth but eventually retired with an engine failure after a first lap incident with chris amon and jack brabham latter of whom went on to win for final time in his career at following race spanish grand prix lotus introduced their revolutionary new car design instead of one conventional front radiator lotus 72 featured two one on each side of cockpit further innovations included torsion bar suspension in place of widely used coil springs and all four brakes mounted inboard to reduce unsprung weight during its first practice session left semi axle of car broke sending rindt into a spin car also proved ineffective in race rindt retired after nine laps as lotus 72 was not as effective as team hoped it was returned to factory to be re built and rindt used old lotus 49 for next race in monaco necessity of using tyres intended for new design made older car unstable seemingly unaffected by this rindt produced what his race engineer herbie blash called race of his life from eighth on grid he worked his way through field on a track notorious for presenting few overtaking opportunities in closing stages he was second steadily closing gap on leader jack brabham on final lap on final corner brabham braked too late touched kerbstone and went straight ahead into straw bales allowing rindt through to take his first victory of season rindt used lotus 49 one last time at belgian grand prix a race at which he heavily criticised organisers for installing guardrails that had gaps of several metres between them he had originally started practice in remodelled 72 but car came to a halt early in session with a broken lower wishbone forcing rindt to switch cars once more despite engine troubles during rest of practice he managed to qualify on front row but later retired with another engine failure thumb rindt took lotus 72 s maiden victory at 1970 dutch grand prix alt black and white photograph of rindt racing a flat and winged formula one car through a corner at dutch grand prix rindt eventually used new lotus 72 better sorted after alterations had been made he set pole position in final practice session almost a quarter of a second ahead of his closest challenger stewart rindt went on to take his maiden victory in lotus 72 but it was not a joyful occasion for him on lap 23 his close friend piers courage with whom he had eaten dinner just night before died in a fiery crash rindt was heavily shaken by loss of yet another fellow driver and contemplated retirement after success of zandvoort rindt gained confidence in new lotus 72 describing it as best racing car that exists at moment but he continued to have problems during practice for french grand prix rindt opted to drop his new all enveloping bell star crash helmet finding it too hot he went back to using his open front helmet only to be hit in face by a stone from another car causing a deep cut on his right cheek he also suffered a steering failure on his car furious over yet another mechanical problem he stormed into lotus garage and yelled at colin chapman if this happens again and i survive i will kill all of you rindt was still able to win race taking lead in championship next race was british grand prix at brands hatch jacky ickx established an early lead ahead of brabham and rindt but when ickx s transmission failed rindt seized opportunity to pass brabham for lead brabham was then able to regain top spot on lap 69 as rindt missed a gear and looked certain winner only to repeat his misfortune of monaco on last lap he ran out of fuel allowing rindt to take his third win in a row his victory was cast into doubt shortly after race when chief cecil mitchell found rear aerofoil not at regulated height rindt was provisionally disqualified only to be reinstated as winner after three hours of deliberation german grand prix was originally set to take place at its traditional venue nurburgring grand prix drivers association gpda represented by rindt and graham hill demanded changes to circuit to increase safety including armco barriers along entire of nordschleife no agreement was reached and grand prix moved to hockenheim where rindt took his fourth victory in succession race was another two way fight this time between rindt and ickx who exchanged lead several times this meant that he could have secured drivers title at his home event at austrian grand prix he set lotus 72 on pole position to delight of crowd but retired from race with an engine failure title decision was therefore postponed to next race in monza death and legacy thumb upright rindt in 1969 alt black and white headshot photograph of rindt s paddock moved to italian grand prix at monza a track known for high speeds drivers often used slipstream of cars in front to increase their pace because of this many teams including lotus opted to drop rear wings mounted on cars to reduce drag and further increase speeds more powerful flat 12 ferraris of jacky ickx and clay regazzoni had been up to faster than lotus at previous race in austria rindt s teammate john miles was unhappy with wingless setup in friday practice reporting that car wouldn t run straight rindt reported no such problems and chapman recalled that rindt reported car to be almost 800 rpm faster on straight without wings on following day rindt ran with higher gear ratios fitted to his car to take advantage of reduced drag increasing car s potential top speed to on his fifth lap of his practice session he crashed heavily at approach to corner denny hulme who was following rindt at time described accident as follows upon impact a joint in crash barrier parted suspension of vehicle went under barrier and car hit a stanchion head on front end was destroyed rindt was in habit of using only four points on five point harness then available and did not wear crotch straps as he wanted to be able to exit car quickly in event of fire as a result upon impact he slid under belts and suffered fatal throat injuries later investigations found that accident was initiated by a failure of car s right front brake shaft but that rindt s death was caused by poorly installed crash barriers rindt was pronounced dead on way to hospital and lotus withdrew all cars from race including lotus 72 entered by rob walker grand prix went ahead and clay regazzoni took his maiden victory but celebrations were muted there was a lengthy investigation into rindt s death in italy leading to a trial against colin chapman he was cleared of all charges in 1976 destroyed lotus 72 remained in italy after trial going to a scrapyard near
