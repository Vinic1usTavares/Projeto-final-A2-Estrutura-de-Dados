eindekker was restricted to patrolling behind german lines berthold took command of big bomber and left eindekker to buddecke this decision sped buddecke on his way to being a member of first wave of german aces that included oswald boelcke max immelmann and kurt wintgens meanwhile berthold damaged his original g ii in a landing accident on 15 september and had to return to piloting an old two seater shortly thereafter he returned to germany to pick up a replacement g ii by 1 october he was using it as a gunship for air defense missions as well as for bombing on 6 november one of those

france its motley assortment of fighters included two fokker e iiis a halberstadt d ii and seven fokker d iis it had had no success when it was still ad hoc fokker falkenhausen berthold took advantage of being in a quiet sector and trained his troops hard he brought in new albatros d i and albatros d ii replacement fighter aircraft and renovated officers mess in mid december following unit s first victory they were inspected by kaiser wilhelm ii and crown prince wilhelm 1917 in january berthold and his squadron were subordinated to armee abteilung a army division a anticipating future need for air protection berthold made an unheeded plea for amassing air power into larger units and supported his proposal with detailed professional analysis in february jagdstaffel 14 scored only two victories however it was slated to move to more active duty in laon and began to rearm with albatros d iii fighters berthold flew to laon to find there were no quarters for his men he was adamant that he would not move his squadron until quarters were furnished in mid march a convoy of trucks hauled squadron to france they began operations on 17 march berthold had an albatros d iii prepared as his assigned aircraft its guns were test fired to check its synchronization gear it was painted with his personal insignia of a white winged sword of vengeance on either side of fuselage by september his entire squadron had adopted his basic scheme of royal blue fuselages and scarlet cowlings plus additional personal insignia on 24 march berthold resumed his successful air assaults and was credited with four more victories by mid april on 24 april he engaged a french caudron r 9 until driven back to base by a bullet through his right shin this wound added more chronic pain to his misery and caused him to convalesce at home from 23 may to 15 june by now his narcotics addiction was an open secret to his pilots from reports berthold determined that his squadron s performance declined and believed this was due to lack of in air leadership in early august he returned to his old training facility in grossenhain and wrangled a medical clearance from its doctor berthold returned to his unit to await paperwork to discover that he was being transferred to command jagdstaffel 18 fighter squadron 18 in harelbeke belgium on 12 august on 18 august berthold was finally certified to resume flying before berthold s arrival jagdstaffel 18 had had little success their new commander promptly emphasized training even as they flew combat missions shortly after assuming command berthold again pitched his idea of using fighters en masse 4th armee headquarters responded by grouping 18 24 31 and 36 into ad hoc jagdgruppe 7 with berthold in command he shot down a spad on 21 august raising his tally to 13 it was beginning of a string of 16 aerial victories during september he scored 14 more victories bringing his tally to 27 on 2 october he scored his 28th victory his final one of year left thumb berthold s fokker d vii would have been painted with scarlet cowling and a royal blue fuselage bearing a winged sword emblem during a dogfight on 10 october a british bullet ricocheted within cockpit of berthold s aircraft and entered his arm at an angle that pulverized his right humerus berthold overcame handicap of half severed ailerons and remained conscious long enough to make a smooth one handed landing at jagdstaffel 18 home airfield he passed out after his safe arrival his unconscious body was lifted from his fokker and rushed to field hospital in hospital lacked facilities to heal such a complex injury however it sufficed to keep him alive it was three weeks before wounded ace was stable enough to be transferred on 31 october he was shipped back to germany his pilots alerted his elder sister franziska who was a nursing supervisor in viktoria victoria hospital berlin she arranged for her brother s diversion to berlin clinic of one of germany s pre eminent surgeons doctor august bier pioneer of cocaine usage in spinal anesthesia berthold entered clinic on 2 november 1917 he was there for four months and doctor bier labored to save mangled arm from amputation meantime counter to berthold s wishes oberleutnant ernst wilhelm assumed berthold s dual commands of jagdstaffel 18 and jagdgruppe 7 berthold spent his convalescent leave learning to write with his left hand he believed if i can write i can fly meantime his right arm remained paralyzed as it slowly healed and he remained dependent on narcotics 1918 return to duty by february berthold could get out of bed in mid month he volunteered to return to command of jagdgruppe 7 on 1 march he reported to medical office of flieger ersatz abteilung 5 replacement detachment 5 in hannover he was returned to command of 18 but denied permission to fly on 6 march with his arm in a sling he rejoined his old squadron at its new duty station within two days on 8 march berthold had arranged for hans joachim buddecke s transfer into unit to lead it in air two days later buddecke was killed in action on 16 march rudolf berthold was transferred to command jagdgeschwader ii fighter wing 2 to replace hauptmann adolf ritter von killed in action previous day new wing had been copied from pioneering jagdgeschwader ii it was crucial to german spring offensive that was to be launched on 21 march berthold was in a tenuous and stressful situation he had suffered loss of his best friend left his familiar old squadron was taking command of an unfamiliar and newly formed larger unit and was not on flight status his solution to his dilemma was to take advantage of a loophole customarily a luftstreitkrafte commander being transferred swapped a small cadre of his unit into his new assignment berthold designated jagdstaffel 15 fighter squadron 15 wing s stab staffel command squadron then he effected a wholesale exchange of jagdstaffel 18 people and aircraft into jagdstaffel 15 in turn jagdstaffel 15 personnel and airplanes moved to jagdstaffel 18 completing trade berthold then departed for buddecke s funeral in berlin on 22 march he returned to his new assignment two days into new german offensive to find that infantry divisions his wing was supposed to support were complaining about their lack of air cover jagdgeschwader ii s performance improved under its grounded commander s guidance as germans advanced in eight days thumb avidly awaited but disappointing siemens schuckert d iii on 6 april nine siemens schuckert d iii fighters began to arrive despite high expectations for craft because of its superior performance it suffered engine failures after only seven to ten hours usage type was rapidly withdrawn from wing meanwhile berthold had his men begin repainting wing s aircraft with a common background marking wing s craft had standard dark blue paint applied to fuselage a la jagdstaffel 15 however instead of also copying a scarlet nose from them other squadrons each sported their own hue on cowlings jagdstaffel 12 had white cowlings jagdstaffel 13 had dark green ones jagdstaffel 19 settled on yellow to these markings pilots added their own personal insignia on night of 12 april french artillery directed by a reconnaissance aircraft began shelling jagdgeschwader 2 airfield by following morning airfield and its equipment had been hit over 200 times by though no one was killed damage was such that wing was essentially out of action for next three weeks as it changed airfields and re equipped in meantime berthold fretted he kept his sister apprised of his medical condition on 25 april he wrote franziska berthold wrote of her brother during this inactive stretch berthold outlined his intended use of wing in a memorandum to headquarters he outlined an air defense warning net posted forward to alert his wing and he pleaded for a transport column to maintain unit s mobility aside from this memo he planned personnel changes in his new wing he felt that squadron commanders were plotting to have him replaced by 18 may last of them had been replaced wing s score improved for that month totaling 19 victories return to aerial combat berthold had often flown a pfalz d iii in preference to albatros d v in may 1918 new fokker d vii entered service berthold borrowed one of new machines from jagdgeschwader 1 fighter wing 1 for a surreptitious test flight he liked its lightness on controls remarking hopefully that he could even fly it with his damaged right arm on morning of 28 may he mounted a brand new fokker d vii and for first time led his air wing into combat although it was a ground support mission he took opportunity to score his 29th victory following day he downed two more enemy aircraft despite a malfunctioning gun that nearly shot away his own propeller and caused a crash landing berthold s drug addiction did not handicap him in air georg von one of his pilots noted that despite his undiminished martial skills his morphine addiction made him temperamentally erratic nevertheless his subordinates remained loyal to him berthold s victory tally increased by half a dozen victories during june meantime on 18 june berthold again advised his sister of his ongoing medical problems he took a break until 28 june when he scored his 37th victory that night he wrote his sister his festering wound was not his only stressor as summer s heat came on engines of fokker triplanes of jagdstaffel 12 began overheating aggravated by lack of genuine castor oil for lubrication occasionally lack of replacement triplanes grounded squadron and hampered its sister squadron jagdstaffel 13 new fokker d viis arrived in wing but only sufficed to re equip jagdstaffel 15 by mid june triplanes of jagdstaffel 12 were deemed unserviceable jagdstaffel 19 had only partially rearmed with new fokker d viis understrength wing also suffered fuel shortages to remain operational fuel and lubricants were channeled to most useful craft d viis on 19 june jagdstaffel 12 and jagdstaffel 19 had no usable aircraft and wing was reduced to half strength or below bereft squadrons would slowly restock with d viis after triplanes were removed from wing relief finally came on 28 june when a shipment of 14 fokker d viis arrived and were divided between jagdstaffel 12 and jagdstaffel 19 berthold fought on scoring two more victories in july however now that he had re equipped his fighter wing influenza grounded all but three pilots from jagdstaffel 19 by 6 july berthold scored three more victories in early august raising his tally to 42 on 10 august he led 12 of his pilots into battle against a vastly superior force of british aircraft he shot down a royal aircraft factory se 5a fighter for his 43rd victory and an airco dh 9 bomber for his 44th when he tried to pull away from dh 9 at altitude his controls came loose in his hand his attempt to use a parachute failed because it required use of both hands his fokker crashed into a house in with such force that its engine fell into cellar german infantrymen plucked him from rubble and rushed him to hospital his right arm was at its previous fracture rudolf berthold would never fly again on 12 august berthold once again checked himself out of a hospital he arrived at jagdstaffel 15 officers mess coincidentally with newly appointed wing commander berthold stared down rittmeister heinz freiherr von brederlow who was senior to him and announced here i am boss once brederlow departed berthold took to bed stating he would run fighter wing from there on 14th kaiser wilhelm ii personally ordered ace to take sick leave and appointed berthold s deputy commander leutnant josef veltjens to take command of wing on 16 august berthold returned to doctor bier s clinic being treated there through early october once his pains were alleviated he went home to recuperate war ended while he was convalescing post war in early 1919 berthold was medically cleared to return to duty on 24 february he assumed command of airfield in berlin he soon had airfield functioning smoothly when it was shut down berthold then put out a call for volunteers to form a freikorps militia to stave off communist insurrectionists his renown attracted 1 200 men mostly from his native franconia he founded frankische detachment schar berthold franconian farmer s detachment iron troop berthold in april 1919 they were trained by late may his troopers were bound to him solely by personal loyalty in august berthold s freikorps moved to baltic states to fight bolsheviks in september freikorps became part of iron division in lithuania they engaged leftist forces in latvia at klaipeda and riga and fought on into a bitter winter last three weeks of 1919 were spent encamped on german lithuanian border before their return to germany on 1 january 1920 berthold and his troops entrained at memel for stade they arrived with 800 men with 300 rifles and a handful of machine guns they were scheduled to disarm on 15 march 1920 however on 13 march military attempted kapp putsch wolfgang kapp and general walther von called on all freikorps and reichswehr army units to maintain public order chancellor friedrich ebert countered by calling a general strike freikorps voted to join putsch so berthold s men commandeered a train and crew from striking rail workers and moved to join coup slowed by doused signals along rail line they got as far as harburg hamburg on evening of 14 march there they bivouacked in middle school thumb left commemorative plaque at school in hamburg translation on 15 march 1920 school in street was scene of only armed conflict which occurred in course of kapp putsch of 13 march 1920 in hamburg area fight in harburg was targeted against an armed freicorps which participated under leadership of rebel rudolf berthold in an attempt to overthrow weimar republic in berlin a spontaneously formed alliance of members of military population harburg harburg pioneers and a large number of armed workers successfully turned against rebels during course of battle a total of 25 people died and more than 50 people were wounded some seriously independent socialist government of harburg anticipated freikorps imminent arrival by arresting commander of local bataillon 9 pioneer battalion 9 leaving its 900 trained soldiers leaderless on morning of 15 march 1920 trade union leaders tried to talk pioneers into disarming freikorps to no avail union workers were then armed to face freikorps and converged on middle school meanwhile burgomaster mayor heinrich offered safe passage out of town to freikorps if they would disarm berthold refused it past noon when workers had gathered a machine gun fired over their heads to clear an exit passage out of school instead of fleeing in panic union men shot back in ensuing firefight 13 workers and three freikorps combatants were killed an additional eight freikorps fighters were summarily executed after being captured school grounds were encircled freikorps was besieged by late afternoon freikorps ammunition was running low calling truce berthold negotiated a safe passage for those of his men who would disarm at about 18 00 hours freikorps filed out of schoolhouse to disarm a crowd of onlookers that had not been part of negotiations were outraged by civilian casualties and they mobbed freikorps there is a widespread myth that rudolf berthold was strangled with ribbon of his pour le merite truth is more prosaic and more brutal berthold doubled back through school when mob attacked as he exited back door someone spotted his pour le merite and yelled alarm a mob overpowered berthold his handgun was taken from him and used to shoot him twice in head and four times in body as mob mauled him hans wittmann who retrieved berthold s body described it thus berthold s remains were taken to hospital in a hamburg suburb two of his old fliers who lived in hamburg rushed to hospital they stayed with berthold s body until franziska arrived from berlin berthold s pour le merite iron cross first class and pilot s badge were retrieved from a garbage dump in harburg before she arrived funeral and aftermath rudolf berthold was buried on 30 march 1920 although pallbearers were customarily of same rank as deceased his family requested that sergeants from his freikorps do
