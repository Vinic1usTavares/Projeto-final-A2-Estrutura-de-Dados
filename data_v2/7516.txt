albanian venetian war of 1447 48 was waged between venetian and ottoman forces against albanians under george kastrioti skanderbeg war was result of a dispute between republic and dukagjini family over possession of dagnum fortress skanderbeg then ally of dukagjini family moved against several venetian held towns along albanian coastline in order to pressure venetians into restoring dagnum in response republic sent a local force to relieve besieged fortress of dagnum and urged ottoman empire to send an expeditionary force into albania at that time ottomans were already besieging fortress of svetigrad stretching skanderbeg s efforts thin however league of lezhe defeated both venetian forces and ottoman expedition league won over venetian forces on 23 july 1448 at gates of scutari and over ottomans three weeks later on 14 august 1448 at battle of oronichea republic was thereafter left with few soldiers to defend venetian albania as a result league soon signed peace with republic of venice while continuing war against ottoman empire after albanian venetian war of 1447 1448 venice did not seriously challenge skanderbeg or league allowing skanderbeg to focus his campaigns against ottoman empire background in 1444 skanderbeg had managed to unite major albanian princes under his leadership at league of lezhe where a confederation of all albanian principalities was created stresses within alliance were felt when nicholas dukagjini a member of dukagjini family a powerful family in northern albania ambushed and killed leke zaharia prince of dagnum and also league member since zaharia had no children he organized killing to more easily gain dagnum year in which zaharia was killed is not recorded a venetian document dated to 4 january 1445 mentions zaharia as once lord of dagnum which was given to zaharia s mother venetian chronicler stefano magno says that zaharia was killed close to advent of year 1445 two princes had been in dispute over who should marry irene dushmani only daughter of leke dushmani prince of in 1445 albanian princes had been invited to wedding of skanderbeg s younger sister who was being married to muzaka thopia irene entered wedding and hostilities began dukagjini asked irene to marry him but zaharia who was drunk saw this and assaulted dukagjini some princes attempted to stop fight but only more people became involved several people died or got injured before peace was established neither of two antagonists had suffered any physical damage but after event dukagjini was morally humiliated death of zaharia left his princedom with no successor as a result his mother handed fortress over to venetian albania a stretch of possessions of republic of venice skanderbeg urged venetian legates that dagnum along with sati and dushmani which had been taken by venice should be restored to league since it guarded an important trade route but venice refused and consequently skanderbeg prepared for war against republic itself league soon sent envoys to its neighbors stefan i and durad brankovic brankovic a lord of serbian despotate who was also in dispute with venice over principality of zeta expressed his willingness to help skanderbeg against republic but not against ottoman empire venetians sent an ambassador to skanderbeg offering him 1 000 ducats to lay aside all claims to dagnum in return that albanians would protect country and keep roads free from violence skanderbeg however refused to accept offer and hostilities continued alongside spani family dushmani family was against war with venice and did not participate in it initial campaigns thumb left 200px durres in 1573 in december 1447 after leaving a protective force of three to four thousand men under vrana to guard frontier in event of an ottoman

venetians skanderbeg also turned towards durazzo then another possession of venetian albania and cut city off from their local resources and trade this move forced venice to redirect to durazzo two galleys which initially were bound for crete in order to watch over events there by then venice treated skanderbeg as a rebellious ottoman vassal so on 4 march 1448 a life pension of 100 gold ducats per month was offered to anyone who would assassinate skanderbeg in may ottoman forces besieged svetigrad putting great strain on skanderbeg s campaigns on 27 june 1448 venice sent andrea venier then provveditore at scutari s rozafa castle to attempt to persuade ottomans to invade albania after venice also sent venier to meet with skanderbeg in order to convince him to break off hostilities and also attempted to push dukagjini clan away from their alliance with skanderbeg despite measures taken by venetians skanderbeg marched towards scutari unabated he also dared venetians to send out a force to defeat him siege of dagnum continued however with a force of 4 000 that skanderbeg had left behind battle of river drin and ottoman expedition thumb left 200px rozafa castle today on 23 july
