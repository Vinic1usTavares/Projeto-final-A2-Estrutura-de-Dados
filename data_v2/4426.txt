received a series of telegrams between 17 and 19 july notifying him of italian attack which he initially believed to be a feint to draw austrian fleet away from its main base at pola and venice by morning of 19th however he was convinced that lissa was in fact italian objective and so he requested permission to attack wilson pp 229 230 as tegetthoff s fleet arrived off lissa on morning of 20 july persano s fleet was arrayed for another landing attempt latter s ships were divided into three groups with only first two able to concentrate in time to meet austrians wilson pp 223 225

thoroughly rotted hull so austro hungarian navy decided to replace ship parliamentary objection to granting funds for new ships forced navy to resort to subterfuge to replace ship reconstruction
