colorado river is one of principal rivers along with rio grande in southwestern united states and northern mexico river drains an expansive arid watershed that encompasses parts of seven u s and two mexican states starting in central rocky mountains of colorado river flows generally southwest across colorado plateau and through grand canyon before reaching lake mead on arizona nevada border where it turns south toward international border after entering mexico colorado approaches mostly dry colorado river delta at tip of gulf of california between baja california and sonora known for its dramatic canyons whitewater rapids and eleven u s national parks colorado river and its tributaries are a vital source of water for 40 million people river and its tributaries are controlled by an extensive system of dams reservoirs and aqueducts which in most years divert its entire flow for agricultural irrigation and domestic water supply its large flow and steep gradient are used for generating hydroelectric power and its major dams regulate peaking power demands in much of intermountain west intensive water consumption has dried up lower of river which has rarely reached sea since 1960s beginning with small bands of nomadic hunter gatherers native americans have inhabited colorado river basin for at least 8 000 years between 2 000 and 1 000 years ago watershed was home to large agricultural civilizations considered some of most sophisticated indigenous north american cultures which eventually declined due to a combination of severe drought and poor land use practices most native peoples that inhabit region today are descended from other groups that settled there beginning about 1 000 years ago europeans first entered colorado basin in 16th century when explorers from spain began mapping and claiming area which became part of mexico upon its independence in 1821 early contact between europeans and native americans was generally limited to fur trade in headwaters and sporadic trade interactions along lower river after most of colorado river basin became part of u s in 1846 much of river s course was still subject of myths and speculation several expeditions charted colorado in mid 19th century one of which led by john wesley powell was first to run rapids of grand canyon american explorers collected valuable information that was later used to develop river for navigation and water supply large scale settlement of lower basin began in mid to late 19th century with steamboats providing transportation from gulf of california to landings along river that linked to wagon roads to interior starting in 1860s gold and silver strikes drew prospectors to parts of upper colorado river basin large engineering works began around start of 20th century with major guidelines established in a series of international and u s interstate treaties known as law of river u s federal government was main driving force behind construction of dams and aqueducts although many state and local water agencies were also involved most of major dams were built between 1910 and 1970 system keystone hoover dam was completed in 1935 colorado is now considered among most controlled and litigated rivers in world with every drop of its water fully allocated environmental movement in american southwest has opposed damming and diversion of colorado river system because of detrimental effects on ecology and natural beauty of river and its tributaries during construction of glen canyon dam environmental organizations vowed to block any further development of river and a number of later dam and aqueduct proposals were defeated by citizen opposition as demands for colorado river water continue to rise level of human development and control of

snowpack which begins in april and peaks during may and june before exhausting in late july or early august flows at mouth of river have steadily declined since beginning of 20th century and in most years after 1960 colorado river has run dry before reaching pacific ocean irrigation industrial and municipal diversions evaporation from reservoirs natural runoff and likely climate change have all contributed to this substantial reduction in flow threatening water supply for future for example gila river formerly one of colorado s largest tributaries contributes little more than a trickle in most years due to use of its water by cities and farms in central arizona average flow rate of colorado at northernmost point of mexico united states border nib or northerly international boundary is

period about 100 million years ago much of western north america was still part of pacific ocean tectonic forces from collision of farallon plate with north american plate pushed up rocky mountains between 50 and 75 million years ago in a mountain building episode known as laramide orogeny colorado river first formed as a west flowing stream draining southwestern portion of range and uplift also diverted green river once a tributary of mississippi river west towards colorado about 30 to 20 million years ago volcanic activity related to orogeny led to mid tertiary ignimbrite flare up which created smaller formations such as chiricahua mountains in arizona and deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over watershed colorado plateau first began to rise during eocene between about 55 and 34 million years ago but did not attain its present height until about 5 million years ago about when colorado river established its present course into gulf of california time scale and sequence over which river s present course and grand canyon were formed is uncertain before gulf of california was formed around 12 to 5 million years ago by faulting processes along boundary of north american and pacific plates colorado flowed west to an outlet on pacific ocean possibly monterey bay on central california coast and may have played a role in formation of monterey submarine canyon crustal extension in basin and range province began about 20 million years ago and modern sierra nevada began forming about 10 million years ago eventually diverting colorado southwards towards gulf as colorado plateau continued to rise between 5 and 2 5 million years ago river maintained its ancestral course as an antecedent stream and began to cut grand canyon antecedence played a major part in

present day moab utah lack of associated sediment deposits along this stretch of colorado river which would have accumulated in impounded lakes over time suggests that most of these dams did not survive for more than a few decades before collapsing or being washed away failure of lava dams caused by erosion leaks and cavitation caused catastrophic floods which may have been some of largest

until rise of desert archaic culture which from 8 000 to 2 000 years ago constituted most of region s human population these prehistoric inhabitants led a generally nomadic lifestyle gathering plants and hunting small animals though some of earliest peoples hunted larger mammals that became extinct in north america after end of pleistocene epoch another notable early group was fremont culture whose peoples inhabited colorado plateau from 2 000 to 700 years ago fremont were likely first peoples of colorado river basin to domesticate crops and construct masonry dwellings they also left behind a large amount of rock art and petroglyphs many of which have survived to present day beginning in early centuries a d colorado river basin peoples began to form large agriculture based societies some of which lasted hundreds of years and grew into well organized civilizations encompassing tens of thousands of inhabitants ancient puebloan also known as anasazi or people of four

puebloans dominated basin of san juan river and center of their civilization was in chaco canyon in chaco canyon and surrounding lands they built more than 150 multi story pueblos or great houses largest of which pueblo bonito is composed of more than 600 rooms hohokam culture was present along middle gila river beginning around 1 a d between 600 and 700 a d they began to employ irrigation on a large scale and did so more prolifically than any other native group in colorado river basin an extensive system of irrigation canals was constructed on gila and salt rivers with various estimates of a total length ranging from and capable of irrigating both civilizations supported large populations at their height chaco canyon puebloans numbered between 6 000 and 15 000 and estimates for hohokam range between 30 000 and 200 000 these sedentary peoples heavily exploited their surroundings practicing logging and harvesting of other resources on a large scale construction of irrigation canals may have led to a significant change in morphology of many waterways in colorado river basin prior to human contact rivers such as gila salt and chaco were shallow perennial streams with low vegetated banks and large floodplains in time flash floods caused significant downcutting on irrigation canals which in turn led to entrenchment of original streams into arroyos making agriculture difficult a variety of methods were employed to combat these problems including construction of large dams but when a hit region in 14th century a d ancient civilizations of colorado river basin abruptly collapsed some puebloans migrated to rio grande valley of central new mexico and south central colorado becoming predecessors of hopi zuni laguna and people in western new mexico many of

sheep and goats to navajo who came to rely heavily on them for meat milk and wool by mid 16th century utes having acquired horses from spanish introduced them to colorado river basin use of horses spread through basin via trade between various tribes and greatly facilitated hunting communications and travel for indigenous peoples more warlike groups such as utes and navajos often used horses to

century settling in towns such as st johns arizona they also established settlements along gila river in central arizona beginning in 1871 these early settlers were impressed by extensive ruins of hohokam civilization that previously occupied gila river valley and are said to have envisioned their new agricultural civilization rising as mythical phoenix bird from ashes of hohokam society mormons were first whites to develop water resources of basin on a large scale and built complex networks of dams and canals to irrigate wheat oats and barley in addition to establishing extensive sheep and cattle ranches one of main reasons mormons were able to colonize arizona was existence of jacob hamblin s ferry across colorado at lee s ferry then known as crossing which began running in march 1864 this location was only section of river for hundreds of miles in both directions where canyon walls dropped away allowing for development of a transport route john doyle lee established a more permanent ferry system at site in 1870 one reason lee chose to run ferry was to flee from mormon leaders who held him responsible for mountain meadows massacre in which 120 emigrants in a wagon train were killed by a local militia disguised as native americans even though it was located along a major travel route lee s ferry was very isolated and there lee and his family established aptly named lonely dell ranch in 1928 ferry sank resulting in deaths of three men later that year navajo bridge was completed at a point downstream rendering ferry obsolete gold strikes from mid 19th to early 20th centuries played a major role in attracting settlers to upper colorado river basin in 1859 a group of adventurers from georgia discovered gold along blue river in colorado and established mining boomtown of breckenridge during 1875 even bigger strikes were made along uncompahgre and san miguel rivers also in colorado and these led to creation of and telluride respectively because most gold deposits along upper colorado river and its tributaries occur in lode deposits extensive mining systems and heavy machinery were required to extract them mining remains a substantial contributor to economy of upper basin and has led to acid mine drainage problems in some regional streams and rivers naming of upper colorado river and controversy prior to 1921 upper colorado river above confluence with green river in utah had assumed various names fathers dominguez and escalante named it rio san rafael in 1776 through mid 1800s river between green river and gunnison river was most commonly known as grand river river above junction with gunnison river however was known variously as river north fork of grand river blue river and grand river latter name did not become consistently applied until 1870s in 1921 u s representative edward t taylor of colorado petitioned congressional committee on interstate and foreign commerce to rename grand river as colorado river taylor saw fact that colorado river started outside border of his state as an abomination on july 25 name change was made official in house joint resolution 460 of 66th congress over objections of representatives

hydroelectricity each year often called america s nile colorado is so carefully managed with basin reservoirs capable of holding four times river s annual flow that each drop of its water is used an average of 17 times in a single year one of earliest water projects in colorado river basin was grand ditch a diversion canal that sends water from never summer mountains which would naturally have drained into headwaters of colorado river to bolster supplies in colorado s front range urban corridor constructed primarily by japanese and mexican laborers ditch was considered an engineering marvel when completed in 1890 delivering across continental divide each year because roughly 75 percent of colorado s precipitation falls west of rocky mountains while 80 percent of population lives east of range more of these water transfers locally known as diversions followed while first envisioned in late 19th century construction on colorado big thompson project c bt did not begin until 1930s c bt now delivers more than 11 times grand ditch s flow from colorado river watershed to cities along front range meanwhile large scale development was also beginning on opposite end of colorado river in 1900 entrepreneurs of california development company cdc looked to imperial valley of southern california as an excellent location to develop agriculture irrigated by waters of river engineer george chaffey was hired to design alamo canal which split off from colorado river near pilot knob curved south into mexico and dumped into alamo river a dry arroyo which had historically carried flood flows of colorado into salton sink with a stable year round flow in alamo river irrigators in imperial valley were able to begin large scale farming and small towns in region started to expand with influx of job seeking migrants by 1903 more than in valley were under cultivation supporting a growing population of 4 000 it was not long before colorado river began to wreak havoc with its erratic flows in autumn river would drop below level of canal inlet and temporary brush diversion dams had to be constructed in early 1905 heavy floods destroyed headworks of canal and water began to flow uncontrolled down canal towards salton sink on august 9 entire flow of colorado swerved into canal and began to flood bottom of imperial valley in a desperate gamble to close breach crews of southern pacific railroad whose tracks ran through valley attempted to dam colorado above canal only to see their work demolished by a flash flood it took seven attempts more than 3 million and two years for railroad cdc and federal government to permanently block breach and send colorado on its natural course to gulf but not before part of imperial valley was flooded under a lake today s salton sea after immediate flooding threat passed it was realized that a more permanent solution would be needed to rein in colorado patten and pp 4 5 lower basin development 1930s 50s in 1922 six u s states in colorado river basin signed colorado river compact which divided half of river s flow to both upper basin drainage area above lee s ferry comprising parts of colorado new mexico utah and wyoming and a small portion of arizona and lower basin arizona california nevada and parts of new mexico and utah each was given rights to of water per year a figure believed to represent half of river s minimum flow at lee s ferry this was followed by a u s mexico treaty in 1944 allocating of colorado river water to latter country per annum arizona refused to ratify colorado river compact in 1922 because it feared that california would take too much of lower basin allotment in 1944 a compromise was reached in which arizona would get a firm allocation of but only if california s allocation was prioritized during drought years these and nine other decisions compacts federal acts and agreements made between 1922 and 1973 form what is now known as law of river thumb left upright alt front view of a dam in

gila river and its tributaries through projects such as theodore roosevelt and coolidge dams completed in 1911 and 1928 respectively roosevelt was first large dam constructed by usbr and provided water needed to start large scale agricultural and urban development in region colorado river aqueduct which delivers water nearly from near parker dam to 10 million people in los angeles metropolitan area was completed in 1941 san diego aqueduct branch whose initial phase was complete by 1947 furnishes water to nearly 3 million people in san diego and its suburbs las vegas valley of nevada experienced rapid growth in part due to hoover dam construction and las vegas had tapped a pipeline into lake mead by 1937 nevada officials believing that groundwater resources in southern part of state were sufficient for future growth were more concerned with securing a large amount of dam s power supply than water from colorado thus they settled for smallest allocation of all states in colorado river compact upper basin development 1950s 1970s through early decades of 20th century upper basin states with exception of colorado remained relatively undeveloped and used little of water allowed to them under colorado river compact water use had increased significantly by 1950s and more water was being diverted out of colorado river basin to front range corridor salt lake city area in utah and rio grande basin in new mexico such projects included roberts tunnel completed in 1956 which diverts per year from blue river to city of denver and fryingpan arkansas project which delivers from fryingpan river to arkansas river basin each year without addition of surface water storage in upper basin there was no guarantee that upper basin states would be able to use full amount of water given to them by compact there was also concern that drought could impair upper basin s ability to deliver required past lee s ferry per year as stipulated by compact a 1956 act of congress cleared way for usbr s colorado river storage project crsp which entailed construction of large dams on colorado green gunnison and san juan rivers initial blueprints for crsp included two dams on green river within dinosaur national monument s echo park canyon a move criticized by both u s national park service and environmentalist groups such as sierra club controversy reached a nationwide scale and usbr dropped its plans for dinosaur dams in exchange for a dam at flaming gorge and a raise to an already proposed dam at glen canyon famed opposition to glen canyon dam primary feature of crsp did not build momentum until construction was well underway this was primarily because of glen canyon s remote location and result that most of american public did not even know of existence of impressive gorge few who did contended that it had much greater scenic value than echo park sierra club leader david brower fought dam both during construction and for many years afterwards until his death in 2000 brower strongly believed that he was personally responsible for failure to prevent glen canyon s flooding calling it his greatest mistake greatest sin pacific southwest water plan agricultural and urban growth in arizona eventually outstripped capacity of local rivers these concerns were reflected in creation of a pacific southwest water plan in 1950s which aimed to build a project that would permit arizona to fully utilize its allotment of river pacific southwest water plan was first major proposal to divert water to colorado basin from other river basins namely from wetter northwestern united states it was intended to boost supplies for lower basin states of arizona california and nevada as well as mexico thus allowing upper basin states to retain native colorado river flows for their own use although there was still a surplus of water in colorado basin during mid 20th century bureau of reclamation predicted correctly that eventually population growth would outstrip available supply and require transfer of water from other sources original version of plan proposed to divert water from trinity river in northern california to reduce southern california s dependence on colorado allowing more water to be pumped by exchange to central arizona because of large amount of power that would be required to pump colorado river water to arizona cap originally included provisions for hydroelectric dams at bridge canyon and marble canyon which would have flooded large portions of colorado within grand canyon and dewatered much of remainder when these plans were publicized environmental movement still reeling from glen canyon controversy successfully lobbied against project as a result grand canyon dams were removed from cap agenda boundaries of grand canyon national park were extended to preclude any further development in area and pumping power was replaced by building of coal fired navajo generating station near page arizona in 1976 resulting central arizona project cap irrigates more than and provides municipal supplies to over 5 million people from phoenix to tucson using water from colorado river environmental impacts thumb right alt view of a narrow green river flowing between high reddish brown cliffs colorado was named for reddish color caused by its natural sediment loads but damming river has caused it to acquire a clear green hue as seen here in lower glen canyon historically colorado transported from of sediment or silt to gulf of california each year second only to mississippi among north american rivers this sediment nourished wetlands and riparian areas along river s lower course particularly in its delta once largest desert estuary on continent currently majority of sediments carried by colorado river are deposited at upper end of lake powell and most of remainder ends up in lake mead various estimates place time it would take for powell to completely fill with silt at 300 to 700 years dams trapping sediment not only pose damage to river habitat but also threaten future operations of colorado river reservoir system reduction in flow caused by dams diversions water for thermoelectric power stations and evaporation losses from reservoirs latter of which consumes more than 15 percent of river s natural runoff has had severe ecological consequences in colorado river delta and gulf of california historically delta with its large freshwater outflow and extensive salt marshes provided an important breeding ground for aquatic species in gulf today s desiccated delta at only a fraction of its former size no longer provides suitable habitat and populations of fish shrimp and sea mammals in gulf have seen a dramatic decline since 1963 only times when colorado river has reached ocean have been during el nino events in 1980s and 1990s reduced flows have led to increases in concentration of certain substances in lower river that have impacted water quality salinity is one of major issues and also leads to corrosion of pipelines in agricultural and urban areas lower colorado s salt content was about 50 parts per million ppm in its natural state but by 1960s it had increased to well over 2000 ppm by early 1970s there was also serious concern about salinity caused by salts leached from local soils by irrigation drainage water which were estimated to add of excess salt to river per year colorado river basin salinity control act was passed in 1974 mandating conservation practices including reduction of saline drainage program reduced annual load by about but salinity remains an ongoing issue in 1997 usbr estimated that saline irrigation water caused crop damages exceeding 500 million in u s and 100 million in mexico further efforts have been made to combat salt issue in lower colorado including construction of a desalination plant at yuma in 2011 seven u s states agreed upon a plan of implementation which aims to reduce salinity by per year by 2030 in 2013 bureau of reclamation estimated that around 32 million was spent each year to prevent around 1 2 million tons of salt from entering and damaging colorado river agricultural runoff containing pesticide residues has also been concentrated in lower river in greater amounts this has led to fish kills six of these events were recorded between 1964 and 1968 alone pesticide issue is even greater in streams and water bodies near agricultural lands irrigated by imperial irrigation district with colorado river water in imperial valley colorado river water used for irrigation overflows into new and alamo rivers and into salton sea both rivers and sea are among most polluted bodies of water in united states posing dangers not only to aquatic life but to contact by humans and migrating birds pollution from agricultural runoff is not limited to lower river issue is also significant in upstream reaches such as colorado s grand valley also a major center of irrigated agriculture large dams such as hoover and glen canyon typically release water from lower levels of their reservoirs resulting in stable and relatively cold year round temperatures in long reaches of river colorado s average temperature once ranged from at height of summer to near freezing in winter but modern flows through grand canyon for example rarely deviate significantly from changes in temperature regime have caused declines of native fish populations and stable flows have enabled increased vegetation growth obstructing riverside habitat these flow patterns have also made colorado more dangerous to recreational boaters people are more likely to die of hypothermia in colder water and general lack of flooding allows rockslides to build up making river more difficult to navigate minute 319 in 21st century there has been renewed interest in restoring a limited water flow to delta in november 2012 u s and mexico reached an agreement known as minute 319 permitting mexico storage of its water allotment in u s reservoirs during wet years thus increasing efficiency with which water can be used in addition to renovating irrigation canals in mexicali valley to reduce leakage this will make about per year available for release to delta on average water will be used to provide both an annual base flow and a spring pulse flow to mimic river s original snowmelt driven regime first pulse flow an eight week release of was initiated on march 21 2014 with aim of revitalising of wetland this pulse reached sea on may 16 2014 marking first time in 16 years that any water from colorado flowed into ocean and was hailed as an experiment of historic political and ecological significance and a landmark in u s mexican cooperation in conservation pulse will be followed by steady release of over following three years just a small fraction of its average flow before damming uncertain future when colorado river compact was drafted in 1920s it was based on barely 30 years of streamflow records that suggested an average annual flow of past lee s ferry modern studies of tree rings revealed that those three decades were probably wettest in past 500 to 1 200 years and that natural long term annual flow past lee s ferry is probably closer to as compared to natural flow at mouth of this has resulted in more water being allocated to river users than actually flows through colorado droughts have exacerbated issue of water over allocation including texas drought of 1950s which saw several consecutive years of notably low water and has often been used in planning for a worst case scenario thumb left alt view of a reservoir where water level has dropped showing white deposits on surrounding mountains lake mead in 2010 showing bathtub ring left behind by low water levels most severe drought on record

falling to just one third of capacity in early 2005 lowest level on record since 1969 when reservoir was still in process of filling watershed is experiencing a warming trend which is accompanied by earlier snowmelt and a general reduction in precipitation a 2004 study showed that a 1 6 percent decrease of precipitation would lead to runoff declining by as much as 18 percent by 2050 average reservoir storage declined by at least 32 percent further crippling region s water supply and hydropower generation a study by scripps institution of oceanography in 2008 predicted that both lake mead and lake powell stand an even chance of dropping to useless levels or dead pool by 2021 if current drying trends and water usage rates continue in late 2010 lake mead dropped to just above first drought trigger elevation a level at which arizona and nevada would have to begin rationing water as delineated by colorado river compact despite above average runoff in 2011 that raised immense reservoir more than record drought conditions returned in 2012 and 2013 reservoir levels were low enough at beginning of water year 2014 that bureau of reclamation cut releases from lake powell by first such reduction since 1960s when lake powell was being filled for first time this resulted in lake mead dropping to its lowest recorded level since 1937 when it was first being filled rapid development and economic growth further complicate issue of a secure water supply particularly in case of california s senior water rights over those of nevada and arizona in case of a reduction in water supply nevada and arizona would have to endure severe cuts before any reduction in california allocation which is also larger than other two combined although stringent water conservation measures have been implemented threat of severe shortfalls in colorado river basin continues to increase each year after a much lower than average snowpack in 2018 water year bureau of reclamation officials projected odds of an official shortage declaration in 2020 at 52 percent in 2021 at 64 percent and in 2022 at 68 percent wildlife and plants colorado river and its tributaries often nourish extensive corridors of riparian growth as they traverse arid desert regions of watershed although riparian zones represent a relatively small proportion of basin and have been affected by engineering projects and river diversion in many places they have greatest biodiversity of any habitat in basin most prominent riparian zones along river occur along lower colorado below davis dam especially in colorado river delta where riparian areas support 358 species of birds despite reduction in freshwater flow and invasive plants such as tamarisk salt cedar reduction of delta s size has also threatened animals such as jaguars and porpoise which is endemic to gulf human development of colorado river has also helped to create new riparian zones by smoothing river s seasonal flow notably
