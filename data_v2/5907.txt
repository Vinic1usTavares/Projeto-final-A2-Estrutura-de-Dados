kmfdm originally kein mehrheit fur die mitleid loosely translated by band as no pity for majority is a german industrial band from hamburg led by multi instrumentalist sascha konietzko who founded group in 1984 as a performance art project group s earliest incarnation included german drummer en esch and british vocalist raymond watts latter of whom left and rejoined group several times over its history trio recorded band s earliest albums in germany before konietzko and esch moved to united states where they found much greater success with seminal industrial record label wax trax german guitarist gunter schulz joined in 1990 both he and esch continued with band until kmfdm broke up in 1999 konietzko resurrected kmfdm in 2002 esch and schulz declined to rejoin on metropolis records and by 2005 he had assembled a consistent line up that included american singer lucia cifarelli british guitarists jules hodgson and steve white and british drummer andy selway konietzko and cifarelli moved back to germany in 2007 while rest of band stayed in u s hodgson and white moved on to other pursuits between 2015 and 2017 leaving band a working trio unofficially in addition to these core members dozens of other musicians have worked with group across its twenty studio albums and two dozen singles with sales totaling in excess of two million records worldwide critics consider kmfdm to be one of first bands to bring industrial music to mainstream audiences though konietzko refers to band s music as ultra heavy beat band incorporates heavy metal guitar riffs electronic music samples and both male and female vocals in its music which encompasses a variety of styles including industrial rock and electronic body music band is fiercely political with many of its lyrics taking stands against violence war and oppression kmfdm normally tours at least once after every major release and band members are known for their accessibility to and interaction with fans both online and at concerts members singly or working together and with other musicians have recorded under many other names primarily watts pig konietzko s excessive force and esch and schulz s slick idiot history origin 1984 kmfdm was officially founded in paris france on february 29 1984 as a performance art project between sascha konietzko and german painter and multimedia artist udo sturm at opening of an exhibition of young european artists at grand palais first show consisted of sturm playing an arp 2600 synthesizer konietzko playing vacuum cleaners and bass guitars with their amplifiers spread throughout building and four polish coal miners whom konietzko had met at a bordello pounding on foundations of grand palais name thumb left upright sascha konietzko performing in bolkow poland in july 2009 kmfdm is an initialism for nonsensical and grammatically incorrect german phrase kein mehrheit fur die mitleid which keeping same word order literally translates as no majority for pity but is typically given loose translation of no pity for majority in original phrase articles preceding nouns mehrheit and mitleid are inflected for wrong gender as proper declension would be keine mehrheit fur das mitleid swapping two nouns yields grammatically correct kein mitleid fur die mehrheit which translates directly as no pity for majority in a 2003 interview konietzko explained origins of phrase initialism has also jokingly been said to stand for kill motherfucking depeche mode coined by band on their first u s tour and used as recently as kunst early years in germany 1984 89 thumb right upright en esch performing with slick idiot in washington d c in may 2006 sturm left early on but konietzko continued performing at one point having twenty people in his troupe which by then was

was a member of band and indeed before band officially existed records gave album a second uk release in 1987 and introduced band to visual artist aidan hughes usually credited as brute hughes redesigned album s cover and went on to design almost every kmfdm album cover watts left group after working on just three songs on 1988 s don t blow your top to start his own project pig after working hamburg underground music scene and releasing albums on european labels band began its long standing relationship with wax trax records when don t blow your top was licensed to label for us

fourth album uaioe in early 1989 for distribution in both u s and europe arrived in america for first time on december 16 and commenced touring u s with ministry during kmfdm s first us tour band

club play songs chart in march 1991 konietzko moved to chicago in 1991 and esch followed a year later kmfdm quickly became a part of chicago industrial music scene that included ministry my life with thrill kill kult and revolting cocks konietzko later remarked we came from germany and we all had to have day jobs and work our asses off to afford to be kmfdm and all of a sudden we re in states and we re selling thousands of thousands of fucking records band s next club hit was split which was released in june 1991 and reached no 46 on billboards dance club play songs chart in july during 1991 konietzko collaborated with buzz mccoy of my life with thrill kill kult to record an album under name excessive force titled conquer your world konietzko and esch then began work on their halves of intended sixth album apart which was eventually released as two separate albums esch s half became his solo album cheesy while official kmfdm album used konietzko s material and was renamed money this album spawned two more club hits in 1992 vogue which reached no 19 on billboard dance club play songs chart in april and title track which reached no 36 on that same chart in july after touring in 1992 with drummer chris vrenna then core of kmfdm konietzko esch schulz and second guitarist mark durante returned to chicago and found that wax trax had filed chapter 11 bankruptcy to begin corporate reorganization in november 1992 band went into studio in 1993 as a group to record its seventh album angst which sold more than 100 000 copies over next two years esch said after album s release i like this album way more money was done in a hurry and i was doing a major pigface tour so i didn t have much influence on album i really like angst i m totally down with it we ve tried to involve guitar players we tried to be like a real band especially in creative kind of aspect after release of angst wax trax tvt records launched a promotion in which fans were encouraged to devise as many alternate meanings for kmfdm as possible with more than a thousand submissions resulting konietzko released a second album under excessive force moniker in 1993 titled gentle death kmfdm received its first exposure to mainstream with its single a drug against war despite band s anti mtv stance video of a drug against war received airplay on mtv and was shown on mtv cartoon beavis and butt head

connelly right and nivek ogre in 1991 both contributed guest vocals for kmfdm in 1990s mid to late 1990s were kmfdm s most successful years in terms of album sales and mainstream awareness konietzko moved to seattle in 1994 while esch moved to new orleans watts rejoined band to work on its eighth album nihil which peaked at no 16 on billboard heatseekers chart and sold 209 000 copies making it band s best selling album it marked first contributions by drummer bill rieflin who worked with band on its next five albums nihil featured kmfdm s most widely known song juke joint jezebel versions of which appeared on both bad boys and mortal kombat soundtracks latter of which peaked at no 10 on billboard 200 and sold over 1 8 million copies their song ultra was used in english version of street fighter ii animated movie commenting on rotating cast of musicians shortly after nihil s release konietzko said it s as if en and i are suns and other musicians at time come and revolve around us regarding duo s dynamic konietzko said en esch and myself have always been cornerstone of kmfdm s existence and we are diametrically opposed as writers angsty stuff generally comes from him poppy hard stuff comes from me esch commented in 1994 sascha and myself are different of course but that s why we can still make things happen our best and worst qualities are contrary to put it simply he s more organized and stable i m more complicated and abstract in late 1995 close friend and president of chicago s wax trax jim nash died of an illness complicated by aids and seattle became official headquarters of kmfdm watts toured with kmfdm throughout 1995 in support of nihil but then left group to return to recording under pig moniker esch also separated from group and xtort was created in 1996 almost entirely without his input konietzko instead brought in a number of other industrial artists such as chris connelly to assist with album xtort was first kmfdm album to chart on billboard 200 and highest charting album in band s history reaching no 92 and selling more than 200 000 copies power album s first single was most heavily promoted song in band s history with almost 100 000

travis and skinny puppy s nivek ogre symbols reached no 137 on billboard 200 its first track megalomaniac was featured in film mortal kombat annihilation and was first song from its soundtrack to receive radio airplay tim skold formerly of band shotgun messiah made his first appearance as a band member writing lyrics and performing vocals on anarchy looking back on symbols in 2002 konietzko said i listened to symbols album and heard exactly why kmfdm broke up in first place it told me story of what went wrong there were maybe two good songs on that album and others were just a bunch of compromising tug of wars that was something i was not going to do again band released a pair of compilation albums in 1998 first retro was a greatest hits compilation which included most of singles released up until xtort second agogo was a collection of rarities and previously unreleased tracks including a cover of u2 s mysterious ways adios 1999 album adios was written and performed almost exclusively by konietzko and skold ogre again provided vocals as did german musician nina hagen originally fulfillment of band s ten record contract with wax trax tvt adios later signaled breakup of band itself which esch s and schulz s limited participation foreshadowed kmfdm disbanded albeit temporarily on january 22 1999 with only konietzko and skold remaining together konietzko said split was due to lots of stress and pressure as well as differences in vision and drive esch said there was a lot of negative energy between sascha and gunter schulz and myself and we all decided on phone to call band quits adios was released three months later and reached no 189 on billboard 200 its title track was called a bitter goodbye in wake of columbine high school massacre it was revealed that lyrics to kmfdm songs son of a gun stray bullet waste were posted on website of shooter eric harris and that date of massacre april 20 coincided with both release date of album adios and birthday of adolf hitler some journalists were quick to jump on apparent connection of massacre to violent entertainment and nazism though one wrote lyrically band has written some songs that could easily be misconstrued by anyone lacking an ear for irony and looking for an excuse to commit violence in response konietzko issued a statement first and foremost kmfdm would like to express their deep and heartfelt sympathy for parents families and friends of murdered and injured children in littleton we are sick and appalled as is rest of nation by what took place in colorado yesterday kmfdm are an art form not a political party from beginning our music has been a statement against war oppression fascism and violence against others while some of former band members are german as reported in media none of us condone any nazi beliefs whatsoever mdfmk slick idiot and reformation 2000 02 thumb right upright lucia cifarelli performing in bolkow poland in july 2009 after group disbanded schulz

toured north america after being released from his contract with universal due to a disagreement over who would produce next album konietzko said he called metropolis records and asked if they d be interested in signing kmfdm label agreed although at time only konietzko himself was certain to participate konietzko announced return of kmfdm in early 2001 due to public demand with skold cifarelli and former collaborators watts and rieflin joining him in studio he said at time i talked with usual kmfdm suspects to see if they were interested and what we came up with was something better than what we had before recalled esch in 2009 i was happy about my new creative freedom at that time and so i refused concept of a fast reunion of original kmfdm konietzko said of reformed band not only is it fun again but it s devoid of all personal confrontations due to egos and fractions that were once a part of band but said i really miss en esch in 2003 kmfdm released its first album in three years attak in march 2002 album was on billboard independent albums chart for four weeks peaking at no 11 new line up 2003 07 skold left after attak to join marilyn manson over next few years watts bandmates from pig joined kmfdm one by one jules hodgson had already done guitar work for 2002 s attak andy selway first played drums for kmfdm on wwiii in 2003 and steve white contributed to 2005 s hau ruck after touring with band all three along with watts and cifarelli were mentioned as band members on intro final track on wwiii although that was to be last album on which watts performed wwiii was on billboards dance electronic albums chart for seven weeks and peaked at no 3 opium was re released in 2002 as on band s new label kmfdm records and a collection of songs recorded between 1984

released in 2006 konietzko took a new approach for tohuvabohu released in 2007 principally in past there used to be 2 people that would start songs me and jules on this record i said to other 2 guys andy selway and steve white why don t you guys come up with something tohuvabohu was on billboards dance electronic albums chart for just three weeks and peaked at no 4 it appeared on independent albums chart for one week at no 29 tohuvabohu also had a companion a full length remix album released in 2008 that barely made it onto billboards dance electronic albums chart hitting no 20 for a single week metropolis records announced in mid 2006 it would reissue kmfdm s entire wax trax era studio album back catalog which had been out of print since early 2000s albums were released in chronological order in groups of two or three from september 2006 to may 2007 konietzko said remastering was done over concerns about losing rights to back catalog after tvt defaulted on a loan explaining original agreement was that catalog would have reverted back to me in 2008 anyway but tvt and rykodisc were thinking of just making a kmfdm compilation which would have eliminated my catalog and i didn t want that konietzko commented in 2006 that current line up was best he had worked with and said in a separate interview that his former bandmates were looking at me for handouts konietzko announced in october 2007 that he was packing up and moving back to germany in next three months return to germany 2007 2016 thumb left upright tim skold performing with marilyn manson in 2007 following finnish school shootings of 2007 and 2008 media reports again attempted to draw a connection between shooters and kmfdm and noted that both listed band among their favorites in an interview with norwegian broadcaster nrk shortly after 2008 incident konietzko responded to these claims by saying recent shootings were a by product of copycat mentality and finnish shooters desire to emulate lifestyles and actions of columbine shooters one of my biggest concerns immediately following this incident columbine shooting was that there would be copycats repeating such things in future as there often are when people commit heinous crimes and acts of violence i was unfortunately right kmfdm re released all of its old singles and hard to find tracks from before 1999 breakup in a series of three double albums called extra vol 1 vol 2 and vol 3 in mid 2008 kmfdm records released skold vs kmfdm in early 2009 which was a collaboration that skold and konietzko conducted over internet while on separate continents from june to october 2008 a follow up is planned but is not a high priority kmfdm s sixteenth studio album blitz released in march 2009 showcased further collaboration with skold but less input from band members not living in germany it reached no 4 on billboards dance electronic albums chart and was on chart for four weeks its companion remix album krieg was released in early 2010 two compilation albums wurst and greatest shit were released in september that same year on december 14 2010 official kmfdm website was changed to include a single

instead new quartet of konietzko cifarelli selway and blacksugar announced their latest album paradise for release on september 27 2019 band features a variety of guest appearances including kmfdm co founder raymond watts for first time since 2003 musical style influences and lyrical content thumb right upright jules hodgson performing in edmonton canada in october 2004 kmfdm s earliest output was performance art as konietzko incorporated not only visuals such as burning beds and exploding televisions but also non musical devices used as instruments e g vacuum cleaners 1980s albums featured heavy use of sampling and studio manipulations and primary instruments used were synthesizers and drum machines konietzko has cited t rex david bowie and frank zappa as inspiration in early stages of kmfdm before forming band he listened to punk music and true industrial bands such as throbbing gristle band s music has been described as industrial industrial rock electro industrial industrial metal and techno industrial while recognized along with ministry nine inch nails and skinny puppy as pioneers in introducing industrial music to mainstream audiences kmfdm describes its sound as ultra heavy beat konietzko once stated if i was to give myself a label it would be industrial alternative electronic crossover rock and band has made heavy use of guitars since its inception and pioneered their use during band s early days in germany although not a metal fan konietzko said his infatuation with ripping off metal licks stemmed from his experiments with e mu s sampler in late 1986 adding what i always hated most about heavy metal was that best riffs came only once and were never repeated so fascination actually was to sample a great riff loop it and play it over and over again while album don t blow your top was more sparse in content due to influence of producer sherwood it was exception rather than rule ministry founder and frontman al jourgensen on tour with band in 1989 described kmfdm as a battalion of guitars marching through europe kmfdm s music has since been a fusion of electronic and heavy metal with occasional elements of dub as well as orchestral samples and live horns many songs feature prominent backing vocals by female singers such as alberti travis and cifarelli many of musicians who have played in band are multi instrumentalists so there is a degree of versatility and freedom in music many albums feature one or more songs in which band lampoons itself notably in lyrics to sucks and inane band s cynical detachment has been compared to steely dan lyrics often express political concerns and call for rejection of and resistance to terrorism violence oppression censorship and war in 1995 song terror konietzko specifically warns fundamentalist forces are undermining integrity of liberal and democratic political structures samples of news broadcasts and speeches by political leaders are sometimes featured in songs konietzko has said that while 2003 album wwiii is critical of then president george w bush who was sampled extensively for album it s not an anti bush record per se it s an anti stupidity record and if we had a message it would be think for yourself and don t believe bullshit reception as of july 2007 kmfdm had sold approximately two million records worldwide critics have been widely positive of kmfdm though less enthusiastic about band s earliest work what do you know deutschland was called less energetic and don t blow your top was called a little flimsy in comparison to later albums by allmusic critics andy hinds and vincent jeffries respectively uaioe when band s sound began to develop was called more assured by hinds and more representative of kmfdm s true motives by thompson who added that kmfdm s guitar heavy sound inspired ministry s own embrace of instrument after bands toured together in 1990 thumb left steve white performing in bolkow poland in july 2009 first major breakthrough in band s critical reception was 1990 s naive called one of their strongest releases by stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic brilliant by fellow allmusic critic ned raggett superb by hinds and most fun industrial dance album ever by spin critic chuck eddy subsequent albums released in 1990s were described as some of band s strongest by allmusic critic greg prato with their metal guitars industrial beats and dance floor sensibilities praised by ira robbins and cmj new music monthly critic heidi macdonald michael saunders of boston globe said of band it s a small field but kmfdm is tops in it makers of dense danceable post industrial torrents of noise german band specializes in fabricating aural assaults that can be intimidating to uninitiated macdonald said in 1996 with ministry gone grindcore skinny puppy just gone and nine inch nails a brand name kmfdm is now standard bearer of industrial though erlewine and hinds felt band was losing some steam towards end of decade greg rule declared in 1999 after its temporary disbandment that kmfdm had produced nine high impact records that have earned them a large loyal fanbase strewn across planet erlewine called band one of wax trax s first industrial superstars an underground sensation and one of major industrial bands of 90s most of band s albums released in 21st century have been well received although prato has commented on sameness from one album to next recent albums blitz and wtf have been described as moving in an electronic less guitar focused direction by trey spencer of sputnikmusic and allmusic s david jeffries

collections hughes artwork is featured in kmfdm s music videos for a drug against war and son of a gun and on band s promotional t shirts art critic brian sherwin said hughes is probably best known

futurists and woodcut artists in an interview with sherwin hughes stated kmfdm have cornered market in industrial post modern angst and so my work reflects that hughes said that initially he based his work on music which caused artistic block konietzko gave him more freedom to use whatever themes he wished resulting in cover to money which hughes said was based upon my disillusionment with street lifestyle i was experiencing at time and art carries with it implication that no matter what temptation lies in your path you still gotta pay only studio album covers not designed by hughes are opium
