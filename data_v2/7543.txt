yamhad was an ancient semitic kingdom centered on halab aleppo syria kingdom emerged at end of 19th century bc and was ruled by yamhadite dynasty kings who counted on both military and diplomacy to expand their realm from beginning of its establishment kingdom withstood aggressions of its neighbors mari qatna and assyria and was turned into most powerful syrian kingdom of its era through actions of its king yarim lim i by middle of 18th century bc most of syria minus south came under authority of yamhad either as a direct possession or through vassalage and for nearly a century and a half yamhad dominated northern northwestern and eastern syria and had influence over small kingdoms in mesopotamia at borders of elam kingdom was eventually destroyed by hittites then annexed by mitanni in 16th century bc yamhad s population was predominately amorite and had a typical bronze age syrian culture yamhad was also inhabited by a substantial hurrian population that settled in kingdom adding influence of their culture yamhad controlled a wide trading network being a gateway between eastern iranian plateau and aegean region in west yamhad worshiped traditional northwest semitic deities and capital halab was considered a holy city among other syrian cities as a center of worship for hadad who was regarded as main deity of northern syria history little of halab has been excavated by archaeologists as halab was never abandoned during its long history and modern city is situated above ancient site therefore most of knowledge about yamhad comes from tablets discovered at alalakh and mari establishment name yamhad was likely an amorite tribal name and is used synonymously with halab when referring to kingdom city of halab was a religious center in northern syria and was mentioned by name ha lam as a vassal of eblaite empire which controlled most of syria in middle of third millennium bc halab s fame as a holy city contributed to its later prominence main temple of north syrian storm god hadad was located in city which was known as city of hadad name halab as well as that of yamhad appeared for first time during old babylonian period when sumu epuh first yamhadite king was attested in a seal from mari as ruler of land of yamhad which included in addition to halab cities of alalakh and tuba sumu epuh consolidated kingdom and faced yahdun lim of mari who had a dynastic alliance with yamhad to oppose assyria but eventually campaigned in north threatening kingdom yamhadite king supported tribes and formed an alliance with other syrian states including urshu hassum and carchemish against mariote king who defeated his enemies but was eventually killed by his son sumu yamam rivalry with assyria and expansion thumb 160px legal case from niqmi epuh of yamhad to king of alalakh rise of shamshi adad i of assyria proved more dangerous to yamhad than mari assyrian king was an ambitious conqueror with aim to rule mesopotamia and levant and styled himself as king of world shamshi adad surrounded yamhad by way of alliances with charchemish hassum and urshu to north and by conquering mari to east forcing zimri lim heir of mari to flee sumu epuh welcomed zimri lim and aimed to use him against assyria since he was legitimate heir of mari shamshi adad s most dangerous alliance was with qatna whose king ishi addu became assyria s agent at yamhad s borders and married his daughter to yasmah adad son of assyrian king who was installed by his father as king of mari sumu epuh was apparently killed during his fight with shamshi adad and was succeeded by his son yarim lim i who consolidated his father s kingdom and turned it into most powerful kingdom in syria and northern mesopotamia yarim lim surrounded shamshi adad by alliances with hammurabi of babylon and pi el ii of eshnunna then in 1777 bc he advanced to east conquering tuttul and installing zimri lim as governor of city death of assyrian king came a year later yarim lim then sent his army with zimri lim to restore his ancestors throne as an ally vassal to yamhad cementing relationship through a dynastic marriage between new mariote king and shibtu daughter of yarim lim yarim lim spent next years of his reign expanding kingdom which reached mamma in north syrian city states were subdued through alliances or force mamma ebla and ugarit became vassals of yamhad while qatna remained independent but came to peace with yamhad following death of its ally late shamshi adad i a sample of yarim lim policy of diplomacy and war can be read in a tablet discovered at mari that was sent to king of der in southern mesopotamia which included a declaration of war against der and its neighbor diniktum tablet mentions stationing of 500 yamhadite warships for twelve years in diniktum and yamhadite military support of der for 15 years yarim lim s accomplishments elevated yamhad into status of a great kingdom and yamhadite king title became great king yarim lim i was succeeded by his son hammurabi i who had a peaceful reign he was able to force charchemish into submission and sent troops to aid hammurabi of babylon against larsa and elam alliance ended after babylonian king sacked mari and destroyed it babylon did not attack yamhad however and relations between two kingdoms remained peaceful in later years power vacuum caused by mari s fall opened way for hammurabi to extend yamhad s hegemony over upper khabur valley in east where ruler of shubat enlil became his vassal hammurabi i was succeeded by his son abba el i whose reign witnessed rebellion of city irridu which was under authority of prince yarim lim abba el s brother king responded to rebellion by destroying irridu and compensating his brother by giving him throne of alalakh thus creating a cadet branch of dynasty decline and end thumb 160px god head discovered near c 1600 bc era of abba el i s successors is poorly documented and by time of yarim lim iii in mid 17th century bc power of yamhad declined due to internal dissent yarim lim iii ruled a weakened kingdom and although he imposed yamhadite hegemony over qatna weakening was obvious as alalakh had become all but independent under self declared king in spite of this regression king of yamhad remained strongest king of syrian states as he was referred to as a great king by hittites diplomatic equal of hittite king rise of hittite kingdom in north posed biggest threat to yamhad although yarim lim iii and his successor hammurabi iii were able to withstand aggressions of hittite king hattusili i through alliances with hurrian principalities hattusili chose not to attack halab directly and began with conquering yamhad s vassals and allies starting with alalakh in second year of his syrian campaigns c 1650 bc middle chronology or slightly later hattusili then turned to attack hurrians in urshu northeast of halab and won in spite of military support from halab and carchemish for hurrians hittite king then defeated yamhad in battle of mount and sacked hassum along with several other hurrian cities in sixth year of his syrian wars after many campaigns hattusili i finally attacked halab during reign of hammurabi iii attack ended in a defeat wounding of hittite king and his later death c 1620 bc hattusili s campaigns considerably weakened yamhad causing it to decline in status monarch ceased to be styled a great king hattusili was succeeded by his grandson mursili i who conquered halab c 1600 bc and destroyed yamhad as a major power in levant mursili then left for babylon and sacked it but was assassinated upon his return to his capital and his empire disintegrated halab was rebuilt and kingdom expanded to include alalakh again reestablished kingdom was ruled by kings of whom nothing but their names is known first is sarra el who might have been son of yarim lim iii last king of dynasty to rule as king of halab was ilim ilimma i whose reign ended c 1524 when he was killed during a rebellion orchestrated by king of mitanni who annexed halab ilim ilimma s son idrimi fled to emar then conquered alalakh c 1517 bc seven years following his conquest of alalakh idrimi made peace with mitanni and was acknowledged as a vassal and allowed to control halab though he had to relocate dynasty s residence to alalakh and relinquish title of king of halab use of name yamhad also ended kings of yamhad dates are estimated and

thumb seal of abba el ii egyptian ankh was a replacement for cup usually held by deity people of yamhad were amorites and spoke amorite language and apart from a few mesopotamian egyptian and aegean influences yamhad belonged mainly to middle bronze age syrian culture this culture influenced architecture and functions of temples which were mainly cultic while political authority was invested in royal palace in contrast to important political role of temples in mesopotamia since capital halab has not been excavated architecture of kingdom is archaeologically best represented by city of alalakh which was subordinate to halab and ruled by a king belonging to yamhadite royal house amorites in general built large palaces that bear architectural similarities to old babylonian era palaces they were adorned with grand central courtyards throne rooms tiled floors drainage systems and plastered walls which suggest employment of specialized labor evidence exists for presence of minoan aegean fresco artists who painted elaborate scenes on walls of palaces in alalakh yamhad had a distinctive syrian iconography which is clear in seals of kings that gave prominence to syrian gods egyptian influence was minimal and limited to ankh which cannot be interpreted as an emulation of egyptian rituals but rather as merely a substitute for cup held by deity elsewhere yamhad had a special pattern of trim called yamhad style which was favored in mari during reign of king zimri lim whose queen shibtu was daughter of yarim lim i after fall of akkadian empire hurrians began to settle in city and its surroundings and by c 1725 bc they constituted a sizable portion of population presence of a large hurrian population brought hurrian culture and religion to halab as evidenced by existence of certain religious festivals that bear hurrian names economy halab s location has always been a factor in its prominence as an economic center yamhad s economy was based on trade with iranian plateau mesopotamia cyprus and anatolia with city of emar as its port on euphrates and alalakh with its proximity to sea as its port on mediterranean actions of yarim lim i and his alliance with babylon proved vital for kingdom s economy for they secured trade between mesopotamia and northern syria with king of mari protecting caravans crossing from persian gulf to anatolia emar attracted many babylonian merchants who lived in city and had a lasting impact on local scribal conventions as late as 14th century bc texts of so called syrian type from emar preserve distinct babylonian traits markets of yamhad became a source of copper which was imported from mountains probably anatolian and cyprus however babylonian invasion of mari had a negative impact on trade between two kingdoms as road became dangerous because of loss of mari s protection to caravans this led babylonian king to build many strongholds up river valley and to establish colonies of mercenaries known as kassite houses to protect middle euphrates area those colonies later evolved into semi independent polities that waged a war against babylonian king ammi and caused trade temporarily to stop religion thumb hadad temple aleppo citadel people of yamhad practiced amorite religion and mainly worshiped northwest semitic deities most important of these were dagon who was considered father of gods and hadad who was most important deity and head of pantheon kingdom was known as land of hadad who was famous as storm god of halab beginning in middle of 3rd millennium bc his main temple was located on citadel hill in center of city and remained in use from 24th century bc until at least 9th century bc title beloved of hadad was one of king s titles hadad was kingdom s patron god and all treaties were concluded in his name which was also used to threaten other kingdoms and to declare wars as hurrian presence grew so did hurrian religious influences and some of hurrian deities found a place in yamhadite pantheon king abba el i mentioned receiving support of hurrian goddess hebat in one of alalakh tablets hebat was spouse of hurrian main deity teshub but in abba el i s tablet she is associated with hadad later hurrians started to identify teshub with hadad who became teshub storm god of halab beside general gods kings had a head god that is a deity who had an intimate connection for worshiper king yarim lim i described hadad as god of state but mesopotamian deity sin as god of his head his son hammurabi i did likewise see also armi yamhad dynasty list of rulers of aleppo
