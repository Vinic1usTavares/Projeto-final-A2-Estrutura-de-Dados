acting hannah lawrence from hollywood was happy with romance of episode writing it seems clear that writers are spending more time on characters finding love and i actually enjoy it very much i suspect writers are aware that ultimately what all of us want for dunder mifflin employees is love cliqueclack wrote positively of episode praising ensemble acting and wrote overall another solid ensemble episode way to go office many other reviews compared episode either positively or negatively to previous episodes jeffrey hyatt from screencrave gave episode an 8 10 rating and wrote i d say it was strongest of six episodes so far this season doomsday delivered that classic office formula where everything just works and it feels so right joseph kratzer from whatculture awarded episode 3 and a half stars out of five and compared it to season s previous episodes writing for a minute there i thought season eight of office was going to be some kind of subpar shut out but thankfully doomsday has lifted series out of rut it s been in i feel doomsday was successful because it captured a sense of ease and fluidity show s been lacking severely since michael s departure other reviews were more mixed or simply referred to episode as decent jill mader from called episode decent noting that that is how season has been shaping up dan forcella from tvfanatic noted that episode was not a fantastic episode of office but it had its funny moments and that s what i tune in for a v club reviewer myles mcnutt wrote doomsday was not a terrible episode by any means but various pieces never fell into place and resolution didn t feel as though it was earned by episode that came before it it just felt like it was trying to do too much too quickly never quite narrowing in on character in midst of manufacturing chaos mcnutt ultimately gave episode a b despite some of more mixed reviews a large majority of critics found cold opening humorous with many noting that it was best of season
