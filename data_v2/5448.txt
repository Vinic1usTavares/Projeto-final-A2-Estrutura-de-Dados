europa barbarorum or eb is a modification of pc game rome total war rtw based on desire to provide rome total war players with a more historically accurate game experience basic gameplay mechanics of original game remain same player controls an empire with goal of conquering as much territory as possible and eliminating rival factions which are controlled by computer or ai main campaign is split between two gameplay modes a turn based strategy map for moving whole armies and managing empire and a real time battle map for fighting battles on ground between two or more armies two game modes are linked with success or failure in one game mode influencing chances of success or failure in other although set in a similar historical period and geographical area to unmodified game covering a timespan of 272 bc to 14 ad compared to original game s 270 bc to 14 ad europa barbarorum is a total conversion modification as it replaces all aspects of original rome total war game that can be replaced such as unit models statistics and musical score modification has received favourable reviews in a number of computer gaming magazines pc gamer magazine ranks europa barbarorum as best mod for any of seven total war games released for pc at that time gameplay in original rome total war player took control of an empire or faction of classical europe north africa or middle east with aim of expanding their faction s territory and eliminating rival empires through military conquest and city building europa barbarorum retains this basic gameplay mechanic and sets itself in a similar time period and geographical area to original game however as a total conversion mod replaces particular factions military units buildings and other elements present in original game and adds a new soundtrack and several brand new gameplay mechanics not present in original such as installation of puppet rulers modification s development team s stated aim in making changes that they have to rome total war is to make player s experience of ancient world more historically accurate for this reason numerous parameters of game at start of campaign in 272 bc such as generals names diplomatic relations between factions and particular understanding of outside world that each faction has have been set to correspond to actual political situation in that year also for reasons of historical verisimilitude factions provinces on campaign map and factions family members have been given vernacular names in europa barbarorum rather than having latinised or anglicised ones as in rome total war so for instance original game s armenia faction is known as hayasdan in europa barbarorum and germania as instead of having to play one s first campaign as a roman faction and only subsequently unlock playable campaigns as non romans by defeating them in roman campaign all twenty of europa barbarorums playable factions can be accessed by player from start furthermore one unplayable and three playable roman factions of original have been combined into a single playable faction in europa barbarorum romani dissatisfied with homogeneity of factions of original rome total war europa barbarorum development team have sought to differentiate playing experiences of game s different factions so for example rome total wars trait acquisition system where player s faction s family members acquire certain characteristics and talents which make them more or less adept at certain tasks such as city management or military leadership has been made more faction specific in europa barbarorum with hellenic characters traits for instance being based on characters and aristotle s teachings on golden mean and romans traits being partially based on moral tales of valerius maximus there are sometimes additional requirements for a family member to be able to gain a new trait in order for them to compete in one of panhellenic games for instance player must ensure that they are stationed in appropriate city on campaign map in year that competition is scheduled to take place one reviewer has commented that europa barbarorums expansions upon original rome total wars trait system have served to add a role playing element to game campaign right thumb alt map europa barbarorum world map correct for version 1 1 as in original rome total war europa barbarorums strategic campaign sees player take control of a particular faction and then compete for territory and resources against all other factions which are controlled by game s artificial intelligence player is presented with a map of europe north africa and near east in which territory is divided into 200 provinces each of which contains a province capital which will at any given point be controlled either by player s faction a rival playable faction or non playable faction which represents world s minor kingdoms regional powers and rebel states if a faction should at any point find itself not in control of any provinces it is eliminated from game gameplay is turn based each turn representing passage of three months on campaign map unlike six months of original rome total war and alternating between player managing their empire and artificial intelligence making all other factions moves a key game mechanic of campaign map is annexation of territory which is done province by province either by successfully besieging province capital or by acquiring it from another faction through diplomacy once a faction has acquired a province they may construct buildings in province capital that either enable recruitment of certain military units or grant various bonuses to city such as greater resilience during a siege or a decreased likelihood of province rebelling provided city contains appropriate buildings player may recruit military units in city at same time as undertaking construction projects aim of game is to acquire a specified number of provinces and or eliminate specified rival factions in europa barbarorum particular victory conditions differ for each faction whilst avoiding being eliminated by other factions campaign map itself of europa barbarorum covers a wider geographical area than that of rome total war expanding into areas such as arabian peninsula india central asia and scandinavia relief province boundaries snow boundaries vegetation types coastlines and areas prone to natural disaster in 272 bc have all been researched and implemented into campaign map nile red sea canal linking indian ocean and mediterranean sea has been added to map as have great trade routes of ancient world such as amber and silk roads which can be captured and exploited by player or by artificial intelligence selection of factions present in original rome total war has been overhauled in europa barbarorum original game s gaul faction has been replaced with two new factions and arverni scythia faction has been replaced by and greek cities faction which included various city states has been replaced by a faction which represents chremonidean league of athens sparta and rhodes entirely new factions include a central asian hellenic empire and epeiros a western greek faction famous for producing pyrrhos of on other hand numidia faction of rome total war was removed entirely right thumb alt cities controlled by nomadic factions can choose between building trees conducive to pastoral or nomadic life a diagram of possible development of governments of nomadic factions in europa barbarorum way in which factions enhance provinces they own through construction of new buildings in their province capitals has changed in europa barbarorum process of assimilating a newly conquered province into one s empire has become more differentiated in modification than it was in original game through introduction of so called government buildings and military industrial complexes government buildings represent different degrees of central state intervention in a province and range from a homeland government which can only be built in a faction s traditional ethnic homeland and represents highest possible degree of central state control to an allied state government which makes province in question semi autonomous and installs a puppet ruler to govern it on controlling faction s behalf choice of government building in a province affects what other buildings can be constructed there greater degree of autonomy granted to a province greater shift in make up of pool of buildings available for construction from controlling faction s own buildings to native buildings that is buildings which are more closely associated with faction that would make its traditional home in province in question rather than one currently occupying it nomadic desert and steppe dwelling factions have their own government buildings which some say has helped differentiate between europa barbarorums factions and make differences between europa barbarorum and original rome total war more than just cosmetic these government buildings also affect unit recruitment options in a province through mod s introduction of military industrial complex mic buildings original rome total wars system of constructing and subsequently upgrading different types of building in order to recruit different types of soldier stables for horses ranges for archers and so on has been replaced in europa barbarorum by factional mic which enables recruitment of all province controlling faction s units and regional mic which enables recruitment of native types of soldier how far two types of complexes can be upgraded depends on government of province greater autonomy of province more native mic may be upgraded and less factional mic may be upgraded and vice versa in addition to buildings that can be constructed by player europa barbarorum also introduces a number of unique buildings or wonders which can either be man made structures or features of landscape and which provide unique bonuses to province warfare if during their turn on campaign map player should engage one of their armies in combat with another faction s army or if their troops should be engaged by another faction during ai s turn player then has option of fighting a real time battle or siege in this gameplay mode player directs troops they had brought with them on campaign map to engagement ordering them to manoeuvre and attack enemy s troops on a three dimensional battlefield troops can either be killed outright on battlefield or made to rout and flee field if their morale falls below a certain threshold reviewers have noted of rome total war that during a battle troop numbers do not outweigh all other considerations other factors such as individual unit types strengths and soldiers morale and fatigue at point of fighting are also taken into account a battle is won when one side kills or routs entire enemy army a siege may be won by attacking side through either dispatching opposing forces or gaining control of besieged city s central plaza for a certain number of minutes and by defending side either by killing attackers or by destroying their siege equipment before they have managed to breach city s defences make up of game s units is one of areas in which most change can be seen going from original game to mod reviewers have commented that differences between europa barbarorum and its parent game are immediate and striking and that modification is different from its parent game in look and in play another reviewer described mod as having a more gritty realistic look than original rome total war all units that were present in original game have been removed and replaced in europa barbarorum specific examples include removal of several units that europa barbarorum team considered to be historically doubtful or only marginally used in warfare such as incendiary pigs and celtic head from original rome total war nor was modding team happy with way more conventional forces were portrayed in original game for instance calling rome total wars egyptian soldiers mummy returns egyptians and hence creating a new unit roster for egyptian faction in game named egypt in original rome total war and in europa barbarorum in order to better correspond with ptolemaic period of history mod also features new custom battle formations in order to encourage more realistic behaviour from ai audio europa barbarorum features its own soundtrack distinct from that of rome total war some of its tracks were composed especially by morgan casey and nick wylie others are examples of authentic music celtic factions tracks for example having been recorded by early music ensemble prehistoric music ireland europa barbarorum also includes its own voicemod an attempt by developers to replace english cries of rome total wars soldiers with ones in their native languages which include classical latin celtic and ancient greek development europa barbarorum project began in january 2004 eight months before rome total wars release when europa barbarorum development team who were following game s development became concerned that its barbarian factions such as gauls were being portrayed inaccurately europa barbarorum team felt that such factions representations in rome total war conformed more to a hollywood stereotype than to historical fact and wished to see a more realistic portrayal of such factions in game modding team tried to convince creative assembly ca developers of rome total war to alter their depiction of period in line with team s research but developers failed to take them up on their offer having exhausted this avenue for change europa barbarorum members then resolved to modify game themselves upon its release release europa barbarorum was first released to public as an open beta in december 2005 after several more minor releases throughout 2006 which mostly fixed bugs and made small adjustments to modification next major release of europa barbarorum was version 0 80 in december 2006 its changes included addition of faction new music and inclusion of a new military industrial complex system there were three more 0 8 series releases during first half of 2007 which primarily made minor adjustments to modification and fixed bugs in total over 135 000 downloads of 0 80 0 81 versions were tracked next major release was version 1 0 which was released in october 2007 and included new units new government options for and hayasdan factions addition of a new type of wall to battle map and new music from prehistoric music group prehistoric music ireland 1 0 version was downloaded over 90 000 times in six months following its release this was followed by version 1 1 which was released in april 2008 and included new battle map landscapes new units addition of pahlavi voicemod and inclusion of an introduction video for saka faction current release is version 1 2 which contains addition of punic voicemod and bug fixes development team had previously stated that future releases of europa barbarorum for rome total war engine will not include any major gameplay changes europa barbarorum has seen some significant changes to its campaign over course of its development yuezhi faction included in early releases of modification was subsequently dropped earlier releases of europa barbarorum also featured player alerts representing major stages of breakup of seleukid faction if that collapse occurred in game however such features became impossible to implement after faction of original game used in europa barbarorum for scripting purposes was removed from mod in exchange for kingdom of saba following main modification s release a number of of europa barbarorum have been created such as porting it to run using rome total war barbarian invasion executable or feral interactive s mac os x version of rome total war there had been plans to release a version of mod for pc game europa universalis rome but no europa barbarorum mod has yet been released for strategy title europa barbarorum ii europa barbarorum development team also developed a new version of modification for medieval ii total war kingdoms engine which was named europa barbarorum ii modification was designed to take advantage of improved graphics of medieval ii total war and of its engine s additional features such as possibility of different soldiers within same unit to have different appearances as opposed to clones criticised by some reviewers of rome total war europa barbarorum ii includes new government unit recruitment and trait systems and new playable factions such as kingdom of gandhara which has its own sanskrit voicemod an initial version of europa barbarorum ii v2 0 was released on 25 august 2014 with a second version v2 01 released on 12 september 2014 on 21 december 2015 a third version 2 1b was released and provided a number of improvements such as an improved campaign ai battle ai remodelled battle map settlements battle map vegetation and new units with military reforms for various factions version 2 2b which was released on 4 june 2016 contained same new improvements reception europa barbarorum was featured and reviewed in a number of video game magazines it has been reviewed in pc gamer uk twice in march 2005 and february 2008 2008 review was overwhelmingly positive saying that eb feels like a whole new total war game and going on to praise modification s stunning scope and striking extent of differences between it and rome total war review was somewhat critical of modification s graphical user interfaces which occasionally had a home made feel to them as well as its lack of accessibility and steep learning curve although it adds that second point is not a large problem as modification is largely a master s challenge for accomplished rome players review finished on a positive note summing europa barbarorum up as a superior game in 2010 same magazine s website named europa barbarorum best mod of any total war game a number of non english language magazines have also reviewed europa barbarorum italian pc gaming magazine giochi per il mio computer reviewed modification in april 2005 and march 2008 2005 review reported that modification whose development team included two historians was to replace economic system soldiers equipment and provinces of rome total war latter review praised mod for having altered and deepened gameplay of original title and wrote that europa barbarorum was best substitute for a rome 2 total war game prior to actual release of such a title dutch magazine reviewing mod in march 2008 also wrote that mod was perhaps best candidate for title rome total war ii until official announcement and went on to note that list of changes that modification had made to original game almost constituted a history book of its own german magazine gamestar wrote in april 2007 that europa barbarorum team had banned all historical mistakes from game in january 2011 another german publication pc games also noted mod s historical accuracy singling out its more realistic more challenging battles for praise although it did note that mod was squarely aimed at experienced rome total war players reviewing version 0 74 of mod in november 2006 romanian publication level concurred that mod was aimed at experienced players adding that modified version of game put greater demands on player s computer than original rome total war requiring 512 mb of ram up from original s 256 despite this reviewer praised mod s complexity painstaking detail that went into making units and mod s soundtrack europa barbarorum has also received several online reviews modification received a review early into its development process on gaming website which said that it was an ambitious project and praised its commitment to historical accuracy even stating that europa barbarorum development team was going to use satellite imagery and climate change statistics to accurately portray world as it was in 272 bc later in 2008 modification has been reviewed on boomtown which praised modification s incredibly well researched and devised unit stats system as well as its legion of historians modification has sometimes been mentioned as a recommended complement to rome total war in reviews of original title for instance by norwegian gaming website gamereactor in 2007 in addition europa barbarorum was singled out for praise by creative assembly themselves in 2011 when they called mod
