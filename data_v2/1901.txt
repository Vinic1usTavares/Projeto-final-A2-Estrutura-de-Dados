kennedy speaking at rice university on september 12 1962 we choose to go to moon officially titled as address at rice university on nation s space effort is a speech delivered by united states president john f kennedy about effort to reach moon to a large crowd gathered at rice stadium in houston texas on september 12 1962 speech was intended to persuade american people to support apollo program national effort to land a man on moon in his speech kennedy characterized space as a new frontier invoking pioneer spirit that dominated american folklore he infused speech with a sense of urgency and destiny and emphasized freedom enjoyed by americans to choose their destiny rather than have it chosen for them although he called for competition with soviet union kennedy also proposed making moon landing a joint project speech resonated widely and is still remembered although at time there was disquiet about cost and value of moon landing effort kennedy s goal was realized in july 1969 with successful apollo 11 mission background when john f kennedy became president of united states in january 1961 many americans perceived that united states was losing space race with soviet union which had successfully launched first artificial satellite sputnik 1 almost four years earlier perception increased when on april 12 1961 russian cosmonaut yuri gagarin became first man in space before u s could launch its first project mercury astronaut american prestige was further damaged by bay of pigs fiasco five days later convinced of political need for an achievement which would decisively demonstrate america s space superiority kennedy asked his vice president lyndon b johnson in his role as chairman of national aeronautics and space council to identify such an achievement he specifically asked him to investigate whether united states could beat soviet union in putting a laboratory in space or orbiting a man around moon or landing a man on moon and to find out what such a project would cost johnson consulted with officials of national aeronautics and space administration nasa its new administrator james e webb told him that there was no chance of beating russians to launching a space station and it was uncertain as to whether nasa could orbit a man around moon first so best option would be to attempt to land a man on moon this would also be most expensive option webb believed it would require 22 billion to achieve it by 1970 johnson also consulted with wernher von braun military leaders including lieutenant general bernard schriever and three captains of industry frank stanton from cbs donald c cook from american electric power and george r brown from brown root kennedy stood before congress on may 25 1961 and proposed that us should commit itself to achieving goal before this decade is out of landing a man on moon and returning him safely to earth not everyone was impressed a gallup poll indicated that 58 percent of americans were opposed kennedy s goal gave a specific mission to nasa s apollo program this required expansion of nasa s space task group into a manned spacecraft center houston texas was chosen as site and humble oil and refining company donated land during 1961 with rice university as an intermediary kennedy took a two day visit to houston in september 1962 to view new facility he was escorted by astronauts scott carpenter and john glenn and shown models of gemini and apollo spacecraft he also viewed mercury spacecraft in which glenn had made america s first orbital flight he took advantage of opportunity to deliver a speech to drum up support for nation s space effort initial drafts of speech were written by ted sorensen with changes by kennedy speech delivery thumb thumbtime 10 39 kennedy s speech on nation s space effort delivered at rice stadium on september 12 1962 on september 12 1962 a warm and sunny day president kennedy delivered his speech before a crowd of about 40 000 people at rice university s rice stadium many individuals in crowd were rice university students middle portion of speech has been widely quoted and reads as follows joke referring to rice texas football rivalry was handwritten by kennedy into speech text and is part of speech remembered by sports fans although rice texas rivalry was highly competitive at time of kennedy s speech with rice holding an 18 17 1 edge over texas from 1930 to 1966 rice has only beaten texas in 1965 and 1994 since kennedy s speech later in speech kennedy also made a joke about heat jokes elicited cheers and laughter from audience while these side comments may have diminished rhetorical power of speech and do not resonate outside texas they stand as a reminder of part texas played in space race rhetoric thumb left crowd at rice university watching kennedy s speech kennedy s speech used three strategies a characterization of space as a beckoning frontier an articulation of time that locates endeavor within a historical moment of urgency and plausibility and a final cumulative strategy that invites audience members to live up to their pioneering heritage by going to moon when addressing crowd at rice university he equated desire to explore space with pioneering spirit that had dominated american folklore since nation s foundation this allowed kennedy to reference back to his inaugural address when he declared to world together let us explore stars when he met with nikita khrushchev premier of soviet union in june 1961 kennedy proposed making moon landing a joint project but khrushchev did not take up offer there was rhetorical opposition in speech to extending militarization of space kennedy verbally condensed human history to fifty years in which only last week did we develop penicillin and television and nuclear power and now if america s new spacecraft succeeds in reaching venus mariner 2 we will have literally reached stars before midnight tonight with this extended metaphor kennedy sought to imbue a sense of urgency and change in his audience most prominently phrase we choose to go to moon in rice speech was repeated three times consecutively followed by an explanation that climaxes in his declaration that challenge of space is one that we are willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to win considering line before rhetorically asked audience why they choose to compete in tasks that challenge them kennedy highlighted here nature of decision to go to space as being a choice an option that american people have elected to pursue rather than claim it as essential he emphasized benefits such an endeavor could provide uniting nation and competitive aspect of it as kennedy told congress earlier whatever mankind must undertake free men must fully share these words emphasized freedom enjoyed by americans to choose their destiny rather than have it chosen for them combined with kennedy s overall usage of rhetorical devices in rice university speech they were particularly apt as a declaration that began american space race kennedy was able to describe a romantic notion of space in rice university speech with which all citizens of united states and even world could participate vastly increasing number of citizens interested in space exploration he began by talking about space as new frontier for all of mankind instilling dream within audience he then condensed human history to show that within a very brief period of time space travel will be possible informing audience that their dream is achievable lastly he uses first personal plural we to represent all people of world that would allegedly explore space together but also involves crowd reception thumb kennedy attending a briefing at cape canaveral on september 11 1962 with

days it is a great speech one that encapsulates all of recorded history and seeks to set it in history of our own time unlike today s politicians kennedy spoke to our best impulses as a nation not our worst ron sass and robert curl were among many members of rice university faculty present curl was amazed by cost of space exploration program they recalled that ambitious goal did not seem so remarkable at time and that kennedy s speech was not regarded as so different from one delivered by president dwight d eisenhower at rice s autry court in 1960 but that speech has long since been forgotten while kennedy s is still remembered speech did not stem a rising tide of disquiet about moon landing effort there were many other things that money could be spent on eisenhower declared to spend 40 billion to reach moon is just nuts senator barry goldwater argued that civilian space program was pushing more important military one aside senator william proxmire feared that scientists would be diverted away from military research into space exploration a budget cut was only narrowly averted kennedy gave a speech to united nations general assembly on september 20 1963 in which he again proposed a joint expedition to moon khrushchev remained cautious about participating and responded with a statement in october 1963 in which he declared that soviet union had no plans to send cosmonauts to moon however his military advisors persuaded him that offer was a good one as it would enable soviet union to acquire american technology kennedy ordered reviews of apollo project in april august and october 1963 final report was received on november 29 1963 a week after kennedy s assassination legacy thumb buzz aldrin on moon 1969 photograph by neil armstrong idea of a joint moon mission was abandoned after kennedy s death but apollo project became a memorial to him his goal was fulfilled in july 1969 with successful apollo 11 moon landing this accomplishment remains an enduring legacy of kennedy s speech but his deadline demanded a necessarily narrow focus and there was no indication of what should be done next once it was achieved apollo did not usher in an era of lunar exploration and no further missions were sent to moon after apollo 17 in 1972 subsequent planned apollo missions were canceled space shuttle and international space station projects never captured public imagination way apollo project did and nasa struggled to realize its visions with inadequate resources ambitious visions of space exploration were proclaimed by presidents george h w bush in 1989 george w bush in 2004 and donald j trump in 2017 but future of american space program remains uncertain notes references further reading external links transcript and video of speech
