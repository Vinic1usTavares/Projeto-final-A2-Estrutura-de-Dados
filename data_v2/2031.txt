readville is a passenger rail station located slightly northwest of wolcott square in readville section of hyde park neighborhood of boston massachusetts it serves multiple lines on mbta massachusetts bay transportation authority commuter rail system with access to fairmount line and franklin line on separate platforms readville is terminus of fairmount line although a small number of rush hour trains continue through station to and from franklin line station has platforms in place on northeast corridor but they are not used by providence stoughton line trains except during service disruptions passenger service has run to readville continuously since boston and providence railroad opened in 1834 separate stations on two levels were consolidated by new haven railroad around 1898 until 1958 railroad had its heavy maintenance facilities located in readville 5 yard to west of station station building burned down in 1983 but mbta built replacement platforms and ramps in 1992 history early stations thumb left 1907 postcard of readville showing midland branch platform on viaduct above hyde park avenue boston and providence railroad was built through readville starting in 1832 and passenger service on main line and a branch to dedham began in 1834 norfolk county railroad built midland division starting in 1853 from islington to boston through readville and full service began in july 1855 midland branch also called dorchester branch connected norfolk county railroad which then ran to blackstone massachusetts to boston midland division crossed boston providence on a high grade and bridge there was initially no track connection between two railroads norfolk county was acquired by boston hartford and erie railroad in 1868 and then to new york and new england railroad in 1875 becoming latter s primary route into boston readville served as a short turn turnback point for b p trains from 1867 to 1880 and after 1899 midland branch station located on upper level closer to wolcott square was originally known as blue hills after nearby range of hills however by 1888 it too was known as readville near beginning of 20th century two stations were consolidated as one under new haven after new york new haven and hartford railroad acquired boston providence in 1893 and ny ne in 1898 two stations were consolidated a connecting track was built in 1899 allowing trains from franklin and beyond to run on northeast corridor to boston and two story readville depot was built to serve both levels on station an under track passage provided access to southbound b p platform ny ne platforms and dedham branch platforms dedham and midland branches thumb left pedestrian grade crossing of former dedham branch near track and 5 yard lead track dedham branch briefly became an important piece of new haven s commuter system between 1926 and 1938 trains operated on a loop using dedham branch and b p s west roxbury branch part of which is now part of needham line in 1940 service to dedham via west roxbury was discontinued leaving dedham branch as only rail access to dedham however traffic to dedham continued to decline and last service a single daily round trip to dedham via dedham branch ended on april 21 1967 mbta purchased abandoned right of way from penn central on january 27 1973 midland branch also declined in importance after franklin division was connected to new haven mainline in 1899 through trains from connecticut were redirected to mainline at readville leaving only franklin and readville locals to use midland service on line from boston to readville was discontinued in 1938 it returned in 1940 but ended more permanently in march 1944 through trains to connecticut discontinued in 1955 and commuter trains to blackstone discontinued april 24 1966 and franklin continued to use section from readville to islington mbta era thumb left 1977 aerial view of former two story depot which burned in 1983 from west thumb right fairmount line platform and train in 2017 from 1944 to 1979 configuration of readville was static two story depot served lower level northeast corridor tracks while elevated track to franklin and beyond was served by a small shack with stairs to lower level starting in 1979 construction of southwest corridor necessitated closure of main line between back bay and forest hills from november 3 1979 until october 5 1987 all franklin line and providence stoughton line service ran to boston on midland division via readville two story station building was destroyed by a fire on june 11 1983 building had been vacant since early 1970s and was a frequent target of vandalism fire was judged to be of suspicious origin mbta did not replace building but handicapped accessible platforms were installed in 1992 and were connected with footbridges when franklin and providence stoughton service returned to main line service on midland had become popular enough to justify a continued shuttle service along line from boston to fairmount fairmount shuttle was extended to readville on november 30 1987 as fairmount line since 1987 providence stoughton line service has run through readville without making a station stop even though there are platforms in place to allow such use 1898 built truss bridge over northeast corridor still used by fairmount line trains laying over plus franklin line trains running via fairmount needed replacement in 2010s span was replaced with a bridge in two weekends with minimal impact to amtrak and mbta service on corridor with old abutments left in place as retaining walls design contract was awarded in 2012 and a construction contract was awarded in september 2015 bridge was replaced in november 2016 in november 2019 mbta announced plans to double track remaining single track sections of franklin line which will likely include modifications to readville proposed orange line extension readville is located in a densely populated neighborhood just nine miles from downtown boston making it a strong candidate for rapid transit service rather than conventional low frequency commuter rail service 1945 coolidge commission report recommended that an extension of main line elevated now orange line south from forest hills be built to dedham via west roxbury rather than hyde park and readville 1966 program for mass transportation recommended a bifurcated orange line with one branch to west roxbury or hersey and another to readville or route 128 via hyde park various reports over next two decades continued to recommend various combinations of extensions however due to cost 1987 relocation of orange line to southwest corridor was terminated at forest hills hyde park readville and needham line instead received limited upgrades such as handicapped accessible platforms 2004 program for mass transportation included an orange line extension to route 128 with intermediate stops at mount hope hyde park and readville at a cost of 342 8 million extension was listed as low priority due to environmental issues with crossing wetlands south of readville and because corridor already had commuter rail service station layout thumb left geographic schematic of readville station readville has an unusual layout because it is built on crossing of two rail lines fairmount line and franklin line each have a single track atop an embankment fairmount line has a single side platform while franklin line has two fairmount line track continues atop a bridge over northeast corridor to join with franklin line this connection is used by several trains each rush hour allowing trains from franklin line to avoid congestion in crowded southwest corridor at ground level three track northeast corridor runs through station there are two side platforms however providence stoughton line trains do not stop at readville in regular service platforms are occasionally used during service disruptions when fairmount line service is not running or when trains cannot stop at hyde park next to franklin line embankment two abandoned tracks run to former dedham branch and readville 5 yard readville station is accessible although accessible routes are only available from hyde park avenue entrance every platform includes a 1 car length mini high high level platform which allows passengers to board level with train car floors platforms are all connected by a system of pedestrian bridges which include accessible ramps in 2016 mbta considered addition of elevators to supplement ramps and add an accessible route to milton street parking lot however this was not pursued railroad yards thumb right former new haven railroad maintenance shops in readville 5 yard in 1977 readville station is bounded by several railroad yards which were mostly built in first half of 20th century east of station on fairmount line is readville interim repair facility an mbta commuter rail maintenance facility and layover yard readville 1 yard is an active csx freight yard located south of station on tracks connecting fairmount line to northeast corridor additionally there were formerly several yard tracks along northeast corridor north of station west of station readville 5 yard lies south of former dedham branch 5 yard is split between boston and dedham massachusetts and was formerly owned and used by new york new haven and hartford railroad which had shops on site until 1958 penn central railroad acquired yard along with rest of new haven in 1968 property was transferred to conrail on march 30 1976 and to amtrak a day later mbta acquired yard from amtrak on november 11 1987 and used it to store railroad related materials site remediation for environmental contamination including lead arsenic and was completed in 2011 in march 2012 mbta announced that contamination had been fully removed and revealed plans to place solar panels in west part of 5 yard panels would be installed and maintained for at least 20 years by an outside contractor bidding began in may 2012 with stipulation that solar array would be operational by spring of 2013 contract was chosen in september 2012 with a revised completion date of october 2013 in july 2013 massdot mbta s parent agency announced that construction would not begin until at least 2014 due to a state solar program reaching capacity earlier than expected installation was to occur in june 2015 bus connections thumb right a route 32 bus at wolcott square next to readville station readville has connections to two mbta bus routes wolcott square river
